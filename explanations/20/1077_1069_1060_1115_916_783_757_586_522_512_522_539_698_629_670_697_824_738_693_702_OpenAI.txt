- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 906 because the ILI time series data shows a consistent pattern of seasonal decline, with a typical low point reached around weeks 10–15 (522–539 occurrences), followed by a gradual rise in occurrences (e.g., 698, 629, and 670). News reports confirm low influenza activity as indicated by only 0.1–0.4% of respiratory specimens testing positive and ILI activity consistently below the 2.6% national baseline. However, the CDC expects flu activity to increase in the coming months, aligning with the observed slight rise in the time-series trend to 906 after 5 weeks. This increase reflects a normal seasonal response despite unusually low overall flu occurrences.
