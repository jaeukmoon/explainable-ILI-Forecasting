The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 3324 because recent trends in the time-series data show a consistent decline in weekly ILI counts over the past 6 weeks (from 6240 to 3343). This decline aligns with news that influenza activity is decreasing nationally, outpatient visits for respiratory illness remain below baseline, and ILI activity continues to trend downward in most regions, supported by reduced positive influenza test percentages and stable-to-declining hospitalization rates. These trends, combined with decreasing influenza-related mortality and limited outbreak activity in long-term care facilities, strongly suggest a continued decline in ILI cases, leading to the forecasted figure.
