The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are predicted to be 4,487 due to the ongoing slight upward trend in ILI activity observed in recent weeks combined with regional variations in activity levels. Although current ILI percentages remain at or below baseline in most areas, factors such as increasing outpatient visits for ILI, geographic areas experiencing moderate to high activity, the predominance of Influenza A (H3N2) known to cause severe seasons, and the CDC’s anticipation of increasing flu activity in the coming weeks support this prediction. These patterns are corroborated by prior observed increases in ILI occurrences during similar conditions in the time-series data.
