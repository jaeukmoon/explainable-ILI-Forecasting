- Explanation: The predicted future ILI occurrences of 23,985 after 5 weeks are attributed to key trends in the time-series data and news reports. The time-series shows a pattern of increasing ILI occurrences during peak seasonal activity, with a recent rise from 8,593 to 14,343 over the past 10 recorded weeks. Meanwhile, the news reports highlight rising influenza activity driven primarily by Influenza A(H3N2), an increasing percentage of respiratory outpatient visits (above the national baseline), and growing hospitalization rates. Additionally, reduced influenza vaccination uptake and genetic differences in circulating viruses compared to vaccine strains could exacerbate the spread. These factors combined point to a continued increase in ILI occurrences over the next several weeks.
