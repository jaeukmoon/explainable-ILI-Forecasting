The predicted ILI occurrences of 7973 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the seasonality observed in the historical time-series data, where ILI numbers show fluctuations corresponding to seasonal patterns. Specifically, after a consistent decline from 9873 in Week 10 to 5823 in Week 20, prior peaks (e.g., 9873, 8547) indicate a cyclical trend consistent with an anticipated rebound. The news supports this by indicating unusually low flu activity due to concurrent COVID-19 impacts but cautions about potential increases in the upcoming weeks, aligning with seasonal trends and emphasizing flu vaccination and preventive measures.
