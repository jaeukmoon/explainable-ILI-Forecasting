The projected future ILI occurrences of 448 after 5 weeks are largely influenced by the observed consistent decline in ILI cases over the past weeks, as evidenced by the time-series data showing a steady drop (e.g., from 897 in Week 4 to 511 in Week 20). This downward trend coincides with the surveillance reports indicating low influenza activity (e.g., a 0.3% positivity rate in clinical labs, ILI visits remaining well below the national baseline of 2.6%, and minimal activity across jurisdictions). Furthermore, public health interventions, including the CDC's emphasized push for flu vaccinations and low geographic spread, suggest controlled flu transmission, aligning with the expectation of continued low ILI activity.
