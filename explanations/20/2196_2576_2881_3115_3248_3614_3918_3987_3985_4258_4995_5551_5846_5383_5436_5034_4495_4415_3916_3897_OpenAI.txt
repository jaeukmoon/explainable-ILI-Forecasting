The future ILI occurrence of 3,569 after 5 weeks is explained by a decreasing trend in the time-series data ('5846', '5383', '5436', '5034', '4495', '4415', '3916', '3897'), suggesting a consistent decline in activity. Supporting this, past surveillance reports mention influenza activity stabilizing or remaining below the baseline nationally and co-circulation with other respiratory viruses, indicating reduced ILI contributions solely from influenza. Additionally, while hospitalization rates previously increased, they were lower than pre-pandemic levels, and the overall mortality impact was within manageable thresholds, reflecting reduced severe outcomes.
