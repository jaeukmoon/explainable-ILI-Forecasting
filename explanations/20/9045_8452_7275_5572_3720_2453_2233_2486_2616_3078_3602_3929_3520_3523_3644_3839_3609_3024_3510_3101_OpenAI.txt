- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2812 due to the consistent decline in outpatient respiratory illness visits and influenza activity reported in recent weeks, with the percentage of outpatient visits for respiratory illness dropping to below baseline (1.7%). Hospitalization rates for influenza have remained stable or have decreased (4.5 per 100,000), while long-term care facilities report a low percentage (0.4%) of influenza-positive tests among residents. These trends, combined with the ongoing sporadic rather than widespread influenza activity, suggest that ILI occurrences will continue to decline to the projected value of 2812.
