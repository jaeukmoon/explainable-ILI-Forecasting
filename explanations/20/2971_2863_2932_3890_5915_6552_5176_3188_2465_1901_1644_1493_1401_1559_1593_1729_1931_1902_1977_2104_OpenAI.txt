The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is projected to be 3625 because recent news reports indicate an upward trend in influenza-like illness activity across regions, particularly with increasing outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses reaching or exceeding baseline levels. This aligns with the past time-series data that show a seasonal increase in ILI cases during similar previous periods, especially with Influenza A(H3N2) as the predominant strain. Additionally, moderate to high activity in multiple jurisdictions, coupled with increasing hospitalizations and mortality rates related to respiratory illnesses, supports a moderate rise in future cases within the given timeline.
