Explanation:  
The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 5436 due to a steady overall decline in ILI cases shown in the time-series trend after week 13, where cases started decreasing from a peak of 16964 to 4258 over the last few weeks. Relevant news highlights that although influenza activity was increasing in certain regions like the northeast, hospitalization and outpatient visit rates for respiratory illnesses, including ILI, remain below pre-pandemic levels and continue to decline nationally. However, some activity persists with predominant Influenza A(H3N2) circulation, which aligns with a moderate case count projection over the next few weeks.
