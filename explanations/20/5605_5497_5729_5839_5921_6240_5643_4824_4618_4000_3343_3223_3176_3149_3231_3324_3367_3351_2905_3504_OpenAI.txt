The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks estimate of 4997 is influenced by previous time-series data showing a seasonal trend where ILI rates initially decreased but began increasing as influenza activity expanded regionally, especially with the predominance of Influenza A(H3N2). News reports highlighted that hospitalizations for influenza have been rising steadily for 11 weeks, outpatient visits for respiratory illness have trended upward since mid-February, and mortality from pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 has surpassed epidemic thresholds. This trend aligns with historical seasonal increases in ILI occurrences, supporting the projection of 4997 cases in week 25.
