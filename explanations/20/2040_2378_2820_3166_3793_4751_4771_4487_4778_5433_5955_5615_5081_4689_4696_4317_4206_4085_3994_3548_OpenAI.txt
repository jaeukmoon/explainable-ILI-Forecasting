- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 2922 after five weeks can be attributed to a slight stabilization in respiratory illness trends observed in the past data, coupled with the continued presence of Influenza A(H3N2), which remains antigenically different from vaccine reference viruses. Although outpatient visits for ILI remain below baseline, incremental trends in hospitalization rates for influenza over time and the co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses suggest a gradual rise in ILI activity. Regional variations and ongoing surveillance highlight increasing influenza impact in certain areas, contributing to the predicted value.
