- Explanation: The predicted future ILI occurrences of 3,844 in week 25 are influenced by the consistent downward trend in the ILI time-series data, decreasing from a peak of 6,240 in week 10 to 3,324 in week 20. Supporting this trend, the news reports indicate that influenza activity remains below baseline in most regions, with decreasing percentages of outpatient visits for respiratory illness and flu testing positivity rates. Additionally, no reports of severe escalations in ILI or influenza-related hospitalizations are evident. These factors indicate a continued decline in ILI occurrences in the subsequent weeks.
