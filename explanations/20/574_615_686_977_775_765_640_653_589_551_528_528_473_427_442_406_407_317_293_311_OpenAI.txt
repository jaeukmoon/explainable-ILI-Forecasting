The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 437 due to the observed declining trend in past time-series ILI occurrences, combined with the surveillance data indicating unusually low influenza activity. The virologic surveillance consistently reports minimal positive influenza cases (e.g., 0.2%-0.3% positivity in clinical labs), with all jurisdictions experiencing minimal or low ILI activity. Additionally, outpatient ILI visits persistently remain well below the national baseline of 2.6% (e.g., 1.2%-1.6% reported). These factors align with a stabilizing or declining trend in ILI occurrences, projecting the slower-than-usual activity in the coming weeks.
