- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 3532 because historical time-series data shows a consistent increase in ILI cases as the influenza season progresses, especially during weeks where a gradual rise in community spread becomes noticeable (e.g., in the time series, cases increased from week 3 to week 9). Additionally, the news highlights that influenza activity is increasing nationwide, with moderate to high ILI activity reported in several jurisdictions, outpatient visits for ILI trending upward, and anticipated continued rise in flu activity, driven by the predominance of Influenza A(H3N2) and increasing hospitalization rates. These patterns indicate a predicted rise in ILI occurrences.
