The future ILI occurrences of 1601 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the observed steady increase in ILI activity over the past weeks, as shown in the time-series data (rising from 550 to 996). Despite the news reporting unusually low influenza-like activity nationwide—such as lower-than-usual virologic positivity rates (0.1%) and outpatient visits below the national baseline (0.9%)—the consistent weekly growth trend within the numerical data, unaffected by regional variations or minimal severe disease reports, strongly supports the projection of 1601 ILI occurrences in five weeks.
