- Explanation: Based on the downward trend in past time-series ILI occurrences from Week 1 to Week 20 (from 6,147 to 4,327 cases), decreasing outpatient visits for respiratory illness below baseline (1.7% in Week 5), and reports of sporadic influenza activity with declining intensity in most recent weeks, the future ILI occurrences are projected at 1,731 cases for Week 25. This projection is derived from the ongoing decline in influenza activity, stabilizing hospitalization rates, and reduced contribution of influenza to respiratory illnesses nationwide.
