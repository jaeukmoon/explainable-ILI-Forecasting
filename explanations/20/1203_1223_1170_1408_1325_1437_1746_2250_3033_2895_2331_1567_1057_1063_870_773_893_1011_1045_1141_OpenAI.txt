- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to reach 1676 due to the observed increase in influenza activity in recent weeks, particularly among Influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Outpatient visits related to respiratory illness are trending upwards, with some jurisdictions experiencing moderate or high ILI activity, though still below the national baseline. Additionally, sporadic regions are encountering elevated hospitalization rates, while 8.3% of recent deaths are linked to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19, illustrating ongoing respiratory illness contributions. Vaccine uptake remains crucial, and co-circulation of multiple viruses further emphasizes the predicted increase in ILI cases.
