- Explanation: The substantial decline in ILI occurrences to 705 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the seasonal trend of influenza declining during the winter, as seen in the time-series data, where cases dropped from 1475 (week 12) to 641 by week 20. This matches the CDC's observation that influenza activity remains unusually low (e.g., only 0.2-0.4% of respiratory specimens tested positive) during the reported period. Coupled with below-baseline outpatient ILI visits (1.0-1.6%, far from the 2.6% baseline) and minimal geographic activity, these factors align to predict a continued low trend in ILI occurrences.
