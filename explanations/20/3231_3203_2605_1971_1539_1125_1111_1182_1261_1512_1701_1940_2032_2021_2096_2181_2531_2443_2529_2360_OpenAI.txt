The projected ILI occurrence of 1180 after 5 weeks is consistent with the declining trend in the time-series data for weekly influenza-like illness cases, which decreased from a peak of 3231 to 2360 over 20 weeks. Supporting evidence from the CDC surveillance reports indicates that influenza activity was decreasing nationally, with outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses remaining below the national baseline and only sporadic or stable increases in specific regions. Additionally, hospitalization rates and mortality indicators suggest reduced influenza impact, and vaccination efforts likely contained further spread. This confluence of factors justifies the stabilization of ILI occurrences at a lower level.
