The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1495 based on a gradual rise evident in recent ILI time-series trends (i.e., recent increases from week 16 [1486] to week 20 [1645]), indicating consistent growth in influenza-like activity. While news reports mention unusually low influenza activity and minimal geographic spread, they also note that ILI percentages (e.g., 1.3%) remain below the national baseline of 2.6% and are rising incrementally. This aligns with previous seasonal trends and signals potential increases, despite ongoing low hospitalizations and minimal cases reported in clinical/public labs.
