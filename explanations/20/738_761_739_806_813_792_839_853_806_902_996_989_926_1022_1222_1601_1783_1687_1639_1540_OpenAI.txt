- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1829 due to the clear upward trend in historical ILI data, where cases have steadily risen from 738 to 1783 over 15 weeks before a slight decrease in the last 5 weeks. Despite the current low influenza activity indicated in the summarized news, such as only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive and ILI activity below the national baseline, historical seasonal patterns and increasing outpatient ILI percentages suggest a continuation of rising cases. The prediction aligns with this trend accounting for anticipated increased flu activity as the season progresses.
