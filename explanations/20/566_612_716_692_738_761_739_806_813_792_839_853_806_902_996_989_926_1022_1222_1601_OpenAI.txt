The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is predicted to be 1679 due to an observed gradual upward trend in past time-series ILI data. Starting from week 1, with values such as '566,' the ILI occurrences steadily increased each subsequent week, culminating in a sharp rise from 1222 to 1601 by week 20. Even though the news indicated unusually low influenza activity, with ILI percentages below the national baseline (e.g., 1.1%-1.3% patient visits) and minimal geographic spread due to the mitigating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, historical trends in the time-series strongly suggest a continued increase in ILI occurrences, regardless of current baseline and geographic trends, driven by cyclic patterns and seasonality.
