The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 4016 based on the observed time-series pattern combined with surveillance data indicating moderate ILI activity increases in certain regions such as Louisiana and reports of an upward trend in outpatient visits for ILI, which have risen toward national baselines in recent weeks (1.4% to 2.7%). The periodic increase in ILI occurrences around this time in past seasons, as reflected in the time series showing a prior peak near week 15-20 (e.g., 4267 to 5524), similarly suggests a continuation of this trend, aligning with annual seasonal patterns and underlying virologic data indicating increased Influenza A (H3N2) prevalence.
