Future ILI occurrences of 1315 can be attributed to the observed upward trajectory of ILI cases from the past time-series data and the cautious interpretation of ILI activity due to the continuing impacts of COVID-19. Over the past 20 weeks, ILI cases increased significantly from '382' to '1201,' particularly in the final weeks (e.g., '869,' '1025,' '1201'), suggesting a trend of rising cases. While news reports indicate that influenza activity remains lower than usual (e.g., respiratory specimens testing positive at only 0.1%, minimal activity across jurisdictions), the combined factors of growing outpatient ILI percentages (below baseline) and pandemic disruptions in healthcare behavior likely mask a growing spread of flu-like illnesses, ultimately leading to a future ILI case projection of 1315.
