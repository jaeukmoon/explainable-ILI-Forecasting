Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 12,979 due to the increasing trend in the time-series data of ILI counts (culminating in recent high values, such as 19,975 in the last week) and the gradual rise in outpatient ILI surveillance percentages from 1.0% earlier to 1.3% in week 20, even though these values remain below the national baseline of 2.6%. While influenza activity remains unusually low according to virologic data (e.g., a 0.1% positivity rate for respiratory specimens), the upward trajectory in recent ILI activity levels suggests a continuation of this trend, including the possible effects of additional respiratory illness reporting due to changes in healthcare-seeking behavior influenced by the pandemic.
