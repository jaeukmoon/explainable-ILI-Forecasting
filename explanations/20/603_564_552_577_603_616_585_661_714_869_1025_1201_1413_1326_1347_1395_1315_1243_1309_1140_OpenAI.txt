- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences reaching 1228 after 5 weeks is likely driven by the observed increasing trend in past weekly occurrences, with numbers rising from 603 to 1413 before slightly fluctuating in recent weeks, suggesting a seasonal increase in line with historical patterns. This trend is supported by virologic surveillance data indicating a gradual rise in ILI-related healthcare visits (like the 1.4% observed in recent weeks compared to the national baseline of 2.6%), coupled with the typical late-season influenza activity. Although current influenza activity levels remain below baseline, the historical patterns and continued monitoring of ILI visits suggest a persistent rise in activity leading to the projected number.
