The future Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrence of 1218 after 5 weeks can be attributed to a consistent increase in ILI cases based on past time-series data, where ILI counts steadily rose from 661 to 1413 over several weeks before showing slight fluctuations. This upward trend aligns with news surveillance, which reports a slight increase in ILI activity (e.g., patient visits increasing from 1.2% in week 18 to 1.3% in week 20). Despite activity remaining below the national baseline, the percentage of positive specimens and patient visits indicates a gradual resurgence of ILI activity. These observations, combined with regional variations and ongoing respiratory virus dynamics, forecast the continued rise, resulting in 1218 cases after five weeks.
