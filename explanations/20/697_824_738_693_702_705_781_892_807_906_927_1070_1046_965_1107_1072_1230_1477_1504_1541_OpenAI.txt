The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to reach 1887 due to a historical upward trend observed in the time-series data and support from the surveillance report. The time-series indicates a steady seasonal rise in ILI cases over the weeks, increasing from 1230 to 1541 in the last five weeks. Moreover, while the virologic surveillance reports minimal influenza activity (0.1% of specimens testing positive and 1.2% outpatient visits for ILI below the 2.6% baseline), COVID-19-related behaviors and other respiratory factors may continue influencing ILI numbers. In light of ongoing trends and this low but present baseline influenza activity, the gradual rise aligns with the prediction of 1887 cases.
