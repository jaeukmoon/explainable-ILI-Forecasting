The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to reach 1222 due to a clear upward trend in recent weekly time-series ILI data, where cases increased steadily from week 9 (612) to week 20 (902). Specifically, the last three weeks (839, 853, 902) demonstrate persistent growth. This aligns with the CDC's statement that flu activity has remained low but may increase in the coming months, suggesting conditions are gradually becoming more conducive for influenza spread. Minimal ILI activity reported across regions, alongside below-baseline ILI percentages, may mask brewing flu dynamics that could accelerate in subsequent weeks.
