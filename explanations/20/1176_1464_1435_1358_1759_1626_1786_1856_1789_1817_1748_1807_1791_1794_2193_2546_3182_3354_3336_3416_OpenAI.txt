The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks being 2535 can be explained by the steady increase in ILI cases evident in the past 20 weeks of time-series data, where occurrences rose significantly from 1176 to 3416. This trend indicates a continued upward trajectory in ILI activity. Concurrently, the summarized news highlights low influenza-positive specimen rates (0.1%) and low hospitalization rates, yet also reports ILI visits gradually increasing week by week (e.g., 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.2%). These incremental week-on-week increases in outpatient illness surveillance, combined with the recorded upward trend in historical data, likely project a moderate rise, culminating in the ILI occurrences reaching 2535 after five weeks.
