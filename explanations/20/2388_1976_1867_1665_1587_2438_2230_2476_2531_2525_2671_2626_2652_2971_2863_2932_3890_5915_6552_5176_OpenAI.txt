- Explanation: The future influenza-like illness (ILI) occurrences are projected to be 1493 due to the declining trend in the time-series data of ILI reports, which dropped from 5915 to 5176 over the last two weeks, after peaking earlier. Additionally, the news surveillance consistently reports low influenza activity nationally, with outpatient visit percentages and positive respiratory specimen rates remaining below baseline levels, minimal geographic spread, and no significant surge in severe disease indicators. These factors collectively suggest a continued decrease in ILI cases.
