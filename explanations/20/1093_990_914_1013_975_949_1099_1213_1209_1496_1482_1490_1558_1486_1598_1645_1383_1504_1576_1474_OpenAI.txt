- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1859 because the historical time-series data shows a clear upward trend in ILI occurrences starting in week 13, climbing steadily from 1383 to 1645, and continuing this trajectory. Although the surveillance reports note minimal influenza activity, with only 0.1% of specimens testing positive and ILI visits remaining below the 2.6% baseline, the increasing trend in historical data likely reflects seasonal patterns or external factors such as reduced COVID-19 impact on healthcare-seeking behavior. Thus, the projection follows this steady increase, predicting a value of 1859.
