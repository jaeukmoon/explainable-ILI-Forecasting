- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected at 3718 due to the recent decrease in influenza activity nationwide, as supported by virologic data showing a decline in the percentage of positive influenza specimens. However, sporadic activity persists in some regions and the predominance of Influenza A(H3N2) viruses continues, which partly offsets the overall decline. Hospitalization rates remain moderate (e.g., 17.1 per 100,000 population), and outpatient visit percentages for respiratory illness have been trending below the national baseline. This combination of a slight downward trend with persistent regional activity aligns with the moderate increase in ILI projections, stabilizing near 3718 in 5 weeks.
