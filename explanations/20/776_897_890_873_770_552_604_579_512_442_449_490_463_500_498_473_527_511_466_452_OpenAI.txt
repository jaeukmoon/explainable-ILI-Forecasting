The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is predicted to be 569 because the time-series data exhibit a downward trend in ILI cases, from 897 in Week 2 to 452 in Week 20, likely influenced by the lower-than-usual flu activity reported in the CDC summaries. The CDC reports stated that respiratory specimen positivity for flu was 0.1%-0.4% and ILI outpatient visits remained below the national baseline of 2.6%, with most jurisdictions reporting minimal activity. These factors, combined with preventive measures like flu vaccination and higher awareness due to COVID-19, suggest the continuation of low ILI activity, justifying a forecasted value of 569 cases.
