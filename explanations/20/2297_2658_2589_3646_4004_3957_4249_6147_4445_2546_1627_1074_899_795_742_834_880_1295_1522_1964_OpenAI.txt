The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to reach 3537 because recent time-series data indicates a pattern of increasing ILI cases during the flu season, with current values nearing the national baseline. The ILI numbers were 742, 834, 880, 1295, 1522, and 1964 in recent weeks—clearly depicting an upward trend. Additionally, CDC surveillance reports state that influenza activity is increasing nationwide, primarily driven by Influenza A(H3N2) viruses, with outpatient visits for ILI trending upward and regional variations showing moderate to high activity in some areas. These observations align with the expected seasonal peak of flu activity, supporting the projection of 3537 cases.
