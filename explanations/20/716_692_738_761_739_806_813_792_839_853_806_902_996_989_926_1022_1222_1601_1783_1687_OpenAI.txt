- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 1815, likely due to trends from the time-series data showing consistent increases in ILI cases in recent weeks (e.g., from 1222 to 1601 to 1783) and the news noting that while ILI activity is below the baseline, minimal ILI activity and increases in percentages of ILI visits (e.g., up from 1.1% to 1.3%) signal a gradual rise. Additionally, the low vaccination rate against influenza, minimal current infections, and potential influence of seasonal effects contribute to the model predicting this steady growth over time.
