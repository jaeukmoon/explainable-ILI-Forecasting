- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are expected to be 2096 due to the increasing trend in influenza activity observed in recent weeks, as supported by both time-series data and the CDC reports. Specifically, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI is trending upward nationally, with geographical variations in moderate or high activity. Additionally, influenza A(H3N2) predominates, and hospitalization rates are showing a gradual increase. Historical time-series data also demonstrate periodic spikes in ILI cases during seasonal peaks, and the most recent value of 1512 supports an upward trajectory consistent with these patterns.
