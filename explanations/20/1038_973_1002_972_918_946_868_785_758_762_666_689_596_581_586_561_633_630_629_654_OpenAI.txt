The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 840 due to the decreasing trend observed in the time-series data over 20 weeks, where ILI occurrences steadily declined from 1038 in Week 1 to 561 by Week 16, with a slight subsequent increase to 654 at Week 20. Additionally, the recent news reports state that outpatient visits for ILI remain below baseline and have shown stable or slight upward trends, indicating low to moderate activity. Among the co-circulating respiratory illnesses, influenza's contribution has been declining, with only minimal to moderate activity reported regionally. These factors collectively point to a predicted stabilization of ILI occurrences at a moderate level of 840 by Week 25.
