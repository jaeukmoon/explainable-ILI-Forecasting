The predicted ILI occurrences after five weeks (2118) result from a combination of historical time-series data and trends of low influenza activity noted in the summarized CDC reports. The time series shows a decreasing trend over the last 20 weeks, with ILI numbers gradually dropping from 2830 to 1893. CDC reports confirm unusually low seasonal influenza activity, with outpatient ILI visits below the 2.6% national baseline (1.5%-1.6%), minimal geographic spread, and virologic surveillance consistently showing only 0.1%-0.4% of specimens positive for flu. These combined factors, along with CDC warnings of potential increases in activity, suggest a stabilization at a mid-range level like 2118 rather than extreme fluctuations.
