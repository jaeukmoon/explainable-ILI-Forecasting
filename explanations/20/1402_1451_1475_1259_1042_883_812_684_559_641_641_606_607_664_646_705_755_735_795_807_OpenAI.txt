Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences have shown a fluctuating downward trend through recent weeks, with cases stabilizing near the 800–900 range in the last few weeks ('795', '807'). The news consistently highlights an unusually low level of influenza activity, with only minimal ILI activity across jurisdictions and outpatient visits for ILI below the baseline at 1.6%–1.3%. However, the CDC notes that flu activity is expected to increase in the coming months, supporting a projected slight rise in ILI to 880 after five weeks.
