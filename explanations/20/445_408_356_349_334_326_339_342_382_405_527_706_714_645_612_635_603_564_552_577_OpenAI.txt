Based on the past time-series ILI occurrences, there is an observable trend where ILI cases increased significantly from week 10 ('382') to week 12 ('714'), followed by a slight decrease in subsequent weeks. Additionally, while the news consistently reported unusually low seasonal influenza activity with minimal ILI levels due to factors like the pandemic and low flu test positivity rates (0.1%), there is an expectation that ILI occurrences may rise in the coming months as indicated in the report's caution regarding surveillance. The continuation of this upward trend and stabilization in ILI cases would explain why the future ILI occurrence after five weeks is projected to return to '714'.
