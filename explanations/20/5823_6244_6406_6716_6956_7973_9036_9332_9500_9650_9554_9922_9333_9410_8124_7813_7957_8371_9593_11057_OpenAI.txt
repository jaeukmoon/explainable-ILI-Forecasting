The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 21,495 due to the observed increasing trend in the ILI time-series data and the CDC’s expectation mentioned in the summarized news that "flu activity may increase in the coming months." Past time-series data show a consistent rise in ILI numbers over the weeks, culminating at 11,057 in the most recent week. Though current surveillance reports indicate low influenza activity ("seasonal influenza activity remains lower than usual"), factors such as anticipated seasonal trends and a starting increase in activity suggest a significant rise in cases, aligning with the projected figure of 21,495.
