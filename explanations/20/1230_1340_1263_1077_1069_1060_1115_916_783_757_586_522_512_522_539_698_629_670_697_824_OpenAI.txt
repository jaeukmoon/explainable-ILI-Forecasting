The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 781 due to the consistent decline in ILI activity from 1230 in Week 1 to 824 in Week 20, with a general downward trend through seasonal patterns. Additionally, news reports confirm unusually low influenza activity, with only 1.6% of healthcare visits attributed to ILI—below the national baseline of 2.6%, and respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza at only 0.1%. This low ILI activity aligns with CDC expectations of continued low flu activity, resulting in the projection of 781 occurrences in 5 weeks.
