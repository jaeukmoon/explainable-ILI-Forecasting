- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences are predicted to be 4,973 based on a declining trend in recent time-series data (from a peak of 11,653 dropping steadily to 2,812) and corroborated by news reports that confirm low and sporadic influenza activity, a decreasing number of outpatient ILI visits below the national baseline of 2.5%, and low rates of hospitalization and influenza positivity in both clinical and long-term care facilities. These trends, combined with increasing vaccinations and low virus circulation, support a conservative estimate of ILI occurrences for Week 25.
