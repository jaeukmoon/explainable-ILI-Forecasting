The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 4327 due to the increasing trend observed in recent data combined with patterns from prior weeks. Recent reports show that influenza activity has been steadily rising (e.g., percentages of outpatient visits for ILI have been trending upward and reaching near or above baseline over multiple weeks), and Influenza A(H3N2), a predominant and often virulent strain, is spreading. Despite slight variations among regions, moderate to high ILI activity in several jurisdictions supports this upward trajectory. Additionally, hospitalization rates and mortality above epidemic thresholds indicate a growing burden of respiratory illness, further validating the projection.
