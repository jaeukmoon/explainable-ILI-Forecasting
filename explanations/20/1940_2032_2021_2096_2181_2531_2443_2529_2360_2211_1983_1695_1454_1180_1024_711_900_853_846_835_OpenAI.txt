- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1522 due to the declining trend in past time-series ILI occurrences (from 1940 to 835 over 20 weeks), coupled with surveillance reports indicating stable or decreasing outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses (e.g., "ILI remained below the national baseline" and "ILI activity has been trending downward over the past four weeks"). Additionally, influenza activity has been localized or sporadic in most regions, and the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza has remained low (e.g., around 0.5% to 1.8%). These factors collectively explain the projected decline in ILI occurrences to 1522.
