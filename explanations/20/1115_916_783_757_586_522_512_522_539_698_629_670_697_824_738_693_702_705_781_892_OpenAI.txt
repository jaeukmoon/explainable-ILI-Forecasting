The future Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1046 because past time-series data indicated a steady increase in ILI occurrences leading up to week 20 (e.g., 781 → 892). This aligns with the news report, which states that while ILI activity remains lower than usual and below the national baseline, concerns about increasing influenza activity in coming months were raised. Factors such as minimal but rising outpatient visits for ILI and potential behavioral changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to the gradual growth trajectory observed.
