- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 868 after 5 weeks can be attributed to a declining trend in recent ILI occurrences (from 1038 to 973) and the stable or decreasing influenza activity reported in CDC surveillance. The percentage of outpatient visits for ILI has remained below the national baseline, with influenza activity sporadic across regions and numerous respiratory viruses contributing to illnesses. Furthermore, hospitalization rates remain lower compared to pre-pandemic seasons, indicating reduced severity, despite Influenza A(H3N2) being predominant. These factors collectively suggest a continuation of the downward trajectory in ILI occurrences.
