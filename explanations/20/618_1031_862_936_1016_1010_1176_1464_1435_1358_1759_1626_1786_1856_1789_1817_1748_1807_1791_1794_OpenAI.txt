The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks reaching 3336 can reasonably be explained by the steady upward trend in the time-series data over the last 6 weeks (from 1358 to 1794), reflecting a substantial increase in activity despite the initially low baseline reported in surveillance. Although news reports indicate unusually low influenza positivity rates (0.1%), below-baseline ILI outpatient visits (around 1.0%-1.2%), and minimal geographic spread, the increasing trend in time-series data suggests local factors, such as delayed seasonal peaks or healthcare-seeking behavior shifts influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in an acceleration of reported ILI cases.
