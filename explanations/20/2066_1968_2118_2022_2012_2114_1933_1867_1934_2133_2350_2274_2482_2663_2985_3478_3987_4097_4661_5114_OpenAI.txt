The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2330 based on the consistent trends observed in both historical time-series data and recent surveillance reports. The time-series shows a decline in ILI occurrences after the week 18 peak (3987) with a steady decrease to 2022 in week 10, suggesting a seasonal tapering. Moreover, the surveillance reports highlight "minimal ILI activity" below the national baseline (1.3% of outpatient visits in week 20), with almost no influenza-positive specimens (0.1%) and low hospitalization rates (0.8/100,000). These patterns, combined with the impact of COVID-19 on reducing influenza transmission, support the moderate level of ILI occurrences expected in 5 weeks, aligning with the predicted value of 2330.
