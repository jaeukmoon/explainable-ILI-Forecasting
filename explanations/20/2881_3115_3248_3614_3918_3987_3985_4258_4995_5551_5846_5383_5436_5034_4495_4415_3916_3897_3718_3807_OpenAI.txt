The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 3644 due to the general trend observed in the time-series data combined with patterns described in the news reports. Week 20 data shows ILI occurrences increasing gradually after a dip (from 3718 to 3807). Historical time-series indicates periodic resurgence in ILI activity, and news reports mention influenza A(H3N2) as dominant, with steady hospitalization rates and co-circulating respiratory viruses contributing to overall ILI. Additionally, the ILI percentage remains below the baseline but is trending upward regionally and nationally, reflecting potential cases increasing moderately over time. These factors help estimate a value of 3644, aligning with this slower upward trend in ILI occurrences.
