Based on historical ILI occurrences and surveillance data, the future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 11,880 due to seasonal trends indicating a reduction in ILI occurrences after the peak in week 15 (21,495 cases). Surveillance data suggest that current influenza activity remains low, as only 0.1% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza, and ILI activity has been reported below the baseline at 1.2% of patient visits. Additionally, minimal ILI activity across jurisdictions and the absence of influenza-associated pediatric deaths imply a decline in flu-related illness, aligning with seasonal patterns following the decline from peak values. This trend results in the predicted value of 11,880 as flu activity normalizes further.
