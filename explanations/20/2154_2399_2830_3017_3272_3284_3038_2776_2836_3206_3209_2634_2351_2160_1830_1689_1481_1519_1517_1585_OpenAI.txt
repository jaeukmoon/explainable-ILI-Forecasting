The prediction of 2066 influenza-like illness (ILI) occurrences after 5 weeks can be explained by a continuation of the decreasing trend observed in the time-series data, where ILI occurrences have consistently decreased from 3,284 to 1,585 over the past 10 weeks, along with evidence from the surveillance reports indicating extremely low influenza activity. Clinical laboratories reported only 0.1%-0.4% positivity rates for influenza, and ILI outpatient visits remained below the 2.6% national baseline, with most jurisdictions reporting minimal activity. Additionally, there were no significant reports of increased influenza spread or severity, suggesting continued low ILI levels and a gradual decline to approximately 2066 occurrences in 5 weeks.
