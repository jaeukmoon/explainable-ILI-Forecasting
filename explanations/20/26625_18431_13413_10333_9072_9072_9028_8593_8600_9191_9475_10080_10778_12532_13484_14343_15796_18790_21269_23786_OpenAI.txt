- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 14,144 after five weeks can be explained by the observed trend of ILI steadily increasing in recent weeks as shown in the time-series data (e.g., increasing from 9,191 in week 10 to 23,786 in week 20). This aligns with the CDC’s reports indicating continued circulation of Influenza A(H3N2), sporadic yet regionally increasing influenza activity, and rising hospitalization rates. Although outpatient respiratory illness percentages are near or below baseline, co-circulating respiratory viruses and anticipated persistence of activity support a projected moderate level of ILI occurrence like 14,144 within the forecast period.
