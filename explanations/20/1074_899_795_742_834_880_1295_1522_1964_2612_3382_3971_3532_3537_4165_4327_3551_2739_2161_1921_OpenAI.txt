- Explanation: Based on the given time-series data, the ILI occurrences decreased steadily over the initial weeks but spiked around week 7, followed by fluctuations. The latest surveillance data indicates that influenza A(H3N2) dominated, with higher hospitalization rates compared to recent seasons, yet outpatient respiratory illness visits are below the national baseline, suggesting localized severity and sporadic activity. Despite predicted regional variations in ILI, the generally decreasing trends in activity over recent weeks suggest a projected stabilization around 1170 in week 25 as activity decreases nationwide but pockets of moderate activity persist in specific regions.
