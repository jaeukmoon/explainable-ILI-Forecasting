The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 758 because the time-series data indicates a clear downward trend in ILI cases over the past 20 weeks, with recent values stabilizing around 972. This decreasing trend aligns with the news reports stating that influenza activity in the U.S. is sporadic or declining in certain regions, outpatient visits for ILI are below the national baseline, and hospitalization rates remain lower compared to pre-COVID seasons. Additionally, lower influenza-associated activity in long-term care facilities and no significant increases in severe disease indicators (e.g., pediatric deaths) support the prediction of a continued gradual decrease in ILI occurrences.
