- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 946 due to the consistent decline in ILI cases observed in the past time-series data (e.g., from 2919 to 803 across several weeks), correlating with surveillance reports indicating that flu activity in most regions remains below baseline despite a slight upward trend in ILI outpatient visits (e.g., 1.7-2.4%). Additionally, vaccination and antiviral recommendations likely contributed to mitigating a significant resurgence.
