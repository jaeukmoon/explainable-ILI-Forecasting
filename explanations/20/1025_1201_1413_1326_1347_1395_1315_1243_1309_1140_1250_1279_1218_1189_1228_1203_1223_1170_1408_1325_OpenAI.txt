- Explanation: The increase in ILI occurrences to 2895 after five weeks is due to the current upward trends in influenza activity, particularly the predominance of Influenza A (H3N2) as identified by virologic surveillance and the slowly rising percentage of healthcare visits for ILI. While ILI activity remains below the national baseline of 2.4%, regional variances, such as moderate activity in Louisiana, suggest localized intensification. Public health recommendations emphasize vaccination and flu treatments; however, the lack of pediatric deaths, low hospitalization rates, and minimal mortality from pneumonia and influenza indicate that flu severity remains manageable. Nonetheless, these combined factors, including the gradual uptick in flu-related trends and regional variations, contribute to projecting an increase in ILI occurrences.
