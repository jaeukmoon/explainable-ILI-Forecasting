The future ILI occurrences of 664 after 5 weeks are predicted based on the following evidence: The time-series data shows a steady decline in ILI occurrences over recent weeks, dropping from 1954 in week 13 to 1122 in week 20. Additionally, the summarized news indicates that outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses, including ILI, remain below baseline nationally, with decreasing influenza activity in some regions. Furthermore, virologic surveillance shows low positivity rates for laboratory-confirmed influenza cases. These factors collectively suggest a continued downward trend in ILI occurrences, resulting in the projection of 664 in 5 weeks.
