- The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is projected to be 1933 based on the historical downward trend in the time-series and the contextual evidence of currently low influenza activity reported in the summarized news. Specifically, recent weeks have shown a decline in ILI occurrences from a peak of 12,215 to 4,016, coupled with news indicating minimal ILI activity below national baselines, low percentages of positive flu specimens (e.g., 2.3%), and reports of sporadic transmission across most regions. These factors suggest that the influenza burden is diminishing, correlating with the predicted value.
