The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2616 due to the observed decline in recent ILI time-series data, where occurrences have dropped significantly from a peak of 9045 to 5572 over the last six weeks. Additionally, the reported influenza activity in the news indicates that the percentage of positive influenza specimens (2.3%) and ILI outpatient visits (2.3%, below the baseline of 2.6%) are low, with most jurisdictions reporting minimal activity. These trends reflect a consistent reduction in influenza-like illnesses and support a continued decline, aligning with the projected lower ILI occurrence of 2616 in five weeks.
