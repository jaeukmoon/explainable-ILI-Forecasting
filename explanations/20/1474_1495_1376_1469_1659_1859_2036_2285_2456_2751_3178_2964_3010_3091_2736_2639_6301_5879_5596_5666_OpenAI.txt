The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 7793 due to a sudden and significant rise observed in ILI cases in the last four weeks of the data, with occurrences increasing from 2639 to 6301 and then relatively stabilizing at high levels (5879, 5596, 5666). This trend suggests a rapid and sustained surge in ILI activity consistent with worsening outbreaks. Despite the news repeatedly emphasizing low influenza activity below the national baseline (e.g., 1.2% of patient visits for ILI), the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as cited in the news, confounds surveillance data and may contribute to the increase in ILI due to other respiratory pathogens. Thus, the combined historical trend and current respiratory pathogen activity predict a future occurrence of 7793.
