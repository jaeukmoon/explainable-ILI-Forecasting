- Explanation: The predicted future ILI occurrence of 3,182 after 5 weeks is driven by trends in the time series data that show a consistent increase in ILI activity starting from week 9 (1,176 cases) to week 20 (1,807 cases), indicating an upward trajectory. This aligns with the absence of substantial mitigating factors in the news, as influenza activity remained minimal nationwide, though behavioral factors and potential secondary stressors (e.g., COVID-19 interplay or relaxed precautions) might allow a resurgence. The forecast is likely based on this growth trend plus external, indirect contributors (e.g., mortality rates exceeding thresholds or enhanced pandemic interplay).
