Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 1243, primarily because of the observed downward trend in ILI cases in the past few weeks, as evidenced by the decreasing ILI rates in outpatient visits and hospitalization data. The percentage of outpatient visits for respiratory illness remains below baseline despite moderate regional variations, reflecting a steady decline in activity, particularly from week 16 onward (e.g., ILI occurrences reduced from peaks of 4327 to 1386 before the forecast). Additionally, virologic surveillance reports indicate a reduction in positive influenza specimens, and no significant surge in pediatric or mortality-related influenza activity is mentioned, suggesting limited viral spread. Hence, this steady decline supports a projection of lower future ILI occurrences.
