The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 5615 based on an uptick in outpatient respiratory illness, influenza hospitalizations, and geographic ILI activity trends. The time-series data highlights a fluctuating but increasing pattern (e.g., sharp jumps from 5524 to 6865 to 9840), which corresponds with news of rising influenza activity, specifically Influenza A(H3N2) dominance and increased outpatient ILI percentages crossing national baselines (e.g., 4.8-2.7%). High ILI activity in multiple jurisdictions, alongside climbing hospitalization rates and persistent epidemic-level mortality rates (17.4%-28.4%), supports the prediction of significant case counts despite seasonal variations and mitigation efforts.
