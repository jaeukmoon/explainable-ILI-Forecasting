- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 853 due to the continued decrease in influenza activity and the stabilization of outpatient visits for respiratory illness, as confirmed by the virologic surveillance data showing fewer positive specimens and ILI activity trending downward for four weeks. The national outpatient ILI percentage remains below baseline (2.1%), and hospitalization rates are comparatively lower than pre-pandemic seasons (17.1 per 100,000). These patterns indicate a clear and consistent reduction in influenza prevalence, aligning with a projection of reduced ILI cases in the coming weeks.
