- Explanation: The increase in future ILI occurrences to 2809 after 5 weeks is due to the periodic upward trend observed in the time-series data, where previous peaks occurred at week intervals (e.g., 2087 → 2198). Furthermore, while current CDC surveillance reports indicate influenza activity remains below baseline (0.1% positives, 1.1% ILI visits), the data shows a gradual rise in outpatient ILI percentages over time (e.g., stability at 1.1%). These factors collectively suggest an anticipated gradual rise in ILI activity, aligning with seasonal trends and historical patterns in the time-series data.
