- The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 965 due to gradual increases in ILI occurrences observed in the time-series data (from 783 to 892 over the last 11 weeks). Although news reports confirm that flu activity remains unusually low (0.1% positive tests, hospitalization rate at 0.5 per 100,000, and ILI visits below the 2.6% baseline), the consistent rise in ILI cases in the dataset reflects other contributing factors, likely seasonal influences and easing pandemic restrictions, which may lead to a moderate growth trajectory.
