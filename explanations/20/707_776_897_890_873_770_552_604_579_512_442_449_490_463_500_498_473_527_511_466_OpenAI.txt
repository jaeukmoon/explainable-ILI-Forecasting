The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 534 due to the consistently low influenza activity observed over the past weeks, as indicated by virologic surveillance (e.g., 0.1–0.4% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza) and outpatient ILI rates remaining below the national baseline of 2.6% (e.g., 1.1–1.7% of healthcare visits for ILI). Additionally, jurisdictions predominantly reported minimal to low ILI activity, and historical time-series data shows a stabilizing trend with a slight decrease in occurrences (e.g., recent weeks hovering around 500). These factors suggest that ILI occurrences in the near future will remain consistent and slightly decline before plateauing around 534 in five weeks.
