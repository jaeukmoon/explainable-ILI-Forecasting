- Explanation: Based on the decreasing ILI occurrences in the past five weeks (from 5915 to 3188), influenza activity has been steadily declining after a notable peak. Virologic and outpatient surveillance data indicate low levels of disease spread, with only 2.3% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza and ILI activity below the national baseline of 2.6% in most regions. Moreover, 41 states reported minimal activity during this period. These trends suggest a significantly reduced ILI burden five weeks into the future, leading to an estimate of 1401 ILI occurrences.
