The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are estimated to be 1008 based on the increasing trend in the time-series data of ILI occurrences and recent updates in the CDC reports. Over the past weeks, ILI occurrences progressively rose from 524 to 1255, peaking at 1305, followed by a slight decline in the last two weeks. Despite low ILI activity nationally (below a baseline of 2.6%) and only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, the reported percentage of ILI outpatient visits increased incrementally in certain regions, as reflected in the historical patterns. This projected increase aligns with seasonal trends and slightly rising ILI activity reported in outpatient illness surveillance.
