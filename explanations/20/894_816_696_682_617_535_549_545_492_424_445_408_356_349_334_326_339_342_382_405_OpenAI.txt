The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 612 due to an observed increasing trend in the time-series data, where ILI cases have begun to rebound slightly after reaching a low point (326 in Week 16 to 405 in Week 20). This aligns with the news report stating that while influenza activity is currently low, it may increase in the coming months. Additionally, a typical seasonal rise is expected as preventive measures like vaccinations have ongoing adoption, and the impact of COVID-19 on suppressing flu activity starts normalizing, potentially contributing to a gradual resurgence.
