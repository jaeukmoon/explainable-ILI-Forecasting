The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are predicted to be 5394 due to a consistent upward trend in the past ILI time-series data, where values have been steadily increasing from 2193 to 3835 over 20 weeks. Additionally, the surveillance reports indicate a rise in positive influenza detections and outpatient ILI percentages, along with increasing flu activity due to Influenza A (H3N2). Although current ILI visits (e.g., 1.4%-2.3%) are below the seasonal baseline, the gradual spread across jurisdictions (moderate activity in regions like Louisiana) and the CDC's expectations of increasing flu activity in upcoming weeks align with this forecast.
