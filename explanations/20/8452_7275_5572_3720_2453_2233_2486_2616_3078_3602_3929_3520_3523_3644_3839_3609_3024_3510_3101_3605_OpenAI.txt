- Explanation: The predicted future occurrence of 2891 ILI cases after 5 weeks is based on a consistent decline in reported ILI cases from the provided time-series data (starting from a high of 8452 down to 3605 in Week 20) and the CDC surveillance trends indicating sporadic influenza activity across the country. Recent CDC reports highlight that influenza A(H3N2) viruses remain the dominant strain, outpatient visits for respiratory illness remain stable or below baseline, and hospitalization rates are lower than previous pre-pandemic seasons. These factors contribute to the projected stabilization at a reduced ILI occurrence level, reflecting a steady downward trend.
