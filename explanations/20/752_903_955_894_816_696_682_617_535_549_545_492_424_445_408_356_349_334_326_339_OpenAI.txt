The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 706 due to the observed stabilization and slightly increasing trend in ILI activity in recent weeks, consistent with historical seasonal patterns. Reviewing the time-series data, ILI occurrences began rising gradually after reaching the lowest point at 326 (week 16) and increased to 339 (week 20). CDC news highlights predict that influenza activity may increase in upcoming months, as flu season typically starts to gain momentum. Despite current low positivity rates (0.1-0.3%), historical trends suggest an expected rebound, supported by preventive measures like vaccination starting to have an effect later in the flu season.
