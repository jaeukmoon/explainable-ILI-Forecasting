- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2109 due to the increasing trend in the past time-series data, where ILI occurrences consistently grew from week 12 (1222) to week 20 (1721), combined with news indicating increased geographic spread and variations in activity levels across jurisdictions. Additionally, despite the current ILI percentage (1.2%-1.4%) being below the baseline, the CDC highlights severe disease indicators, such as hospitalization rates and mortality trends (e.g., 7.6% P&I deaths above epidemic thresholds), which suggest an overall rising impact of respiratory illnesses, likely contributing to the increasing ILI trend.
