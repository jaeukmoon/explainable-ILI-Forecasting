The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 2356 due to the significant decrease in ILI cases observed in the past time series data and the consistent reports of low influenza activity in the summarized news. The time series data shows a sharp decline in cases over the past five weeks (from 16,964 to 12,746), coupled with reports of minimal to moderate influenza activity in most regions and lower outpatient ILI rates below the national baseline (2.2%, 0.9%, or 1.4%). The news also highlights that COVID-19 remains the primary cause of respiratory illness-related deaths, rather than influenza. This reduced flu activity and overall low influenza-associated metrics suggest that ILI cases will continue to decrease, leading to a projection of 2,356 cases in five weeks.
