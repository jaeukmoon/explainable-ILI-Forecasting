The future ILI occurrence of 1807 after 5 weeks is likely explained by the observed historical pattern in the time-series data, which shows fluctuations in ILI cases, ranging from 618 to 1941 over 20 weeks and most recently showing a rebound trend (1759, 1626, and 1786 in the last three weeks). Additionally, the summarized news highlights that influenza activity remains lower than usual but suggests a potential increase in the coming months due to the seasonality of flu and the gradual rise in indicators like outpatient visits for ILI (from 0.8% to 1.7%) as reported weekly. This combination of historical pattern and slight increases in activity indicators aligns with the projection of 1807 cases.
