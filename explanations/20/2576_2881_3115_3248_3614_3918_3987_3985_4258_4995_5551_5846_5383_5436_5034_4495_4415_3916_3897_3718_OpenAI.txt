The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 3641 based on the observed trends in the past time-series data and news indicators, showing a slight decline in influenza activity and outpatient visits below baseline levels in recent weeks. While influenza A(H3N2) continues to be the dominant strain, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI has been trending downward, as reflected in the decreasing cases in the time series (e.g., from 5846 at its peak to 3718). Hospitalization rates and mortality surveillance remain above pre-pandemic levels, but since the current vaccination campaign and antiviral treatments are mitigating severe outcomes, they contribute to a slower accumulation of new ILI cases, stabilizing the projection at 3641 in five weeks.
