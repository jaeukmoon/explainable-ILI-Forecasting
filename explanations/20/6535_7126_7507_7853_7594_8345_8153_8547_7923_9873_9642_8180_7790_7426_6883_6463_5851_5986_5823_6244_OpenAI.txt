The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is predicted to be 9036 due to the observed upward trends in recent time-series data and CDC's anticipations of increased flu activity as the season progresses. Specifically, past ILI occurrences show a gradual increase—e.g., 6535 in Week 1 to 9873 in Week 10, followed by some fluctuations but higher baseline numbers overall. Additionally, while recent national virologic surveillance reports low positivity rates for influenza, they have warned of potential increases in influenza activity in the coming months. This aligns with the CDC’s guidance emphasizing flu prevention measures, particularly as lower initial influenza activity does not preclude later-season surges.
