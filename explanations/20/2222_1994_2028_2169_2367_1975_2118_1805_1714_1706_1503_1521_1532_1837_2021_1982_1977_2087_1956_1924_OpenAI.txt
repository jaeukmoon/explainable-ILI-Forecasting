The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1777 due to a combination of historical trends and current surveillance data indicating consistently low influenza activity. The time-series data shows a downward trend in ILI occurrences over the last 10 weeks, with fluctuations stabilizing around lower values. Additionally, recent surveillance reports highlight minimal ILI activity, with outpatient visits for ILI below the national baseline (1.1%-1.7%) and virologic surveillance showing less than 0.4% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza. These factors, combined with CDC's expectation of low activity and the continued impact of COVID-19 on health behaviors, support a conservative forecast of ILI occurrences continuing at low levels.
