- Explanation: Based on the past time-series ILI occurrences, there has been a cyclical increase in ILI cases starting from Week 6, peaking at Week 12 (9045 cases), and subsequently declining. The recent news highlights that influenza activity, while low earlier, has steadily increased in recent weeks, with more laboratory detections of Influenza A(H3N2). Outpatient visits for ILI have exceeded the national baseline, hospitalization rates have risen, and early virus characterization indicates continued circulation of this strain. These factors, combined with the periodic nature of the historical ILI data, suggest an expected increase post-Week 20, leading to 3523 ILI cases in 5 weeks due to rising flu activity.
