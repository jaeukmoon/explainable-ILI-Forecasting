The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 1201 due to the rising trend observed in the past time-series data, where ILI occurrences increased substantially from week 6 onwards—starting at 405 and peaking at 706 in week 9—before fluctuating slightly while maintaining higher levels. Despite the news reports showing unusually low influenza activity and minimal positivity rates, the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other respiratory infections could influence higher ILI activity. Additionally, CDC's emphasis on the potential increase in influenza activity in the coming weeks, combined with a consistent but slight rise in ILI percentages despite remaining below baseline, suggests a scenario where higher future ILI occurrences are likely.
