The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 18,790 because the time-series data shows a trend of increasing ILI cases after a period of decline, evident from recurring peaks in multiple past weeks (e.g., week 5: 43,523, week 11: 10,333). Additionally, the CDC reports indicate influenza activity, particularly Influenza A(H3N2), has been increasing nationally, with moderate or high ILI activity in several jurisdictions, outpatient visits surpassing baselines, and hospitalization rates climbing. These patterns together predict a rise in ILI occurrences leading to the projected case count.
