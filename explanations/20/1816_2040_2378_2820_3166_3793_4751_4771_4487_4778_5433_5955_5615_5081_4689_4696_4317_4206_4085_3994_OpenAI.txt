- Explanation: The forecasted Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrence of 3233 after 5 weeks is influenced by the observed trend of increasing influenza A(H3N2) activity in previous weeks, hospitalization rates rising steadily each week, and ongoing co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses. Despite outpatient visits for respiratory illness remaining below baseline, there has been a slight upward trend since February. Additionally, reports highlight that most H3N2 viruses are antigenically different from vaccine reference strains, reducing vaccine effectiveness and increasing infection rates in regions with moderate to high activity. These factors, combined with stable but above-threshold mortality rates for pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19, contribute to the projected increase in ILI cases.
