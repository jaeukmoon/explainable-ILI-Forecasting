- Explanation: The predicted future Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrence after 5 weeks reaching 11,626 is based on the observation that influenza activity was reported to be increasing across several regions in prior weeks, specifically in central, south-central, and northeastern areas according to the latest weekly reports. The majority of detected viruses being Influenza A(H3N2), which are antigenically different from vaccine reference viruses, contribute to higher hospitalization rates (14.4 per 100,000 in recent data) and the continued presence of co-circulating respiratory viruses. Coupled with outpatient visit trends showing a stable or slight increase in respiratory illness rates nationally and regional variability in ILI activity levels, these factors support a gradual rise in ILI cases over 5 weeks, reaching 11,626.
