- Explanation: The ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is predicted to be 10,080 based on the decreasing trend observed in the past ILI time-series data, where ILI values consistently dropped from 43,523 in Week 11 to 9,072 in Week 19. Furthermore, summarized surveillance reports indicate declining outpatient visits for ILI, currently below the national baseline, with sporadic influenza activity and low overall virus positivity rates. These factors suggest a continued reduction, leading to the projected future value.
