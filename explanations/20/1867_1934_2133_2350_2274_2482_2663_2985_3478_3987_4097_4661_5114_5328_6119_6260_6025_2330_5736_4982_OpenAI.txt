- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are expected to be 5230 based on historical time-series trends indicating a rise in ILI occurrences over several weeks, reaching a peak of around 6260 (Week 16) followed by a decline (Weeks 17-20). Concurrently, CDC reports indicate a percentage of healthcare visits for ILI rising regionally, with 1.2% below the national baseline of 2.6%, and variations in activity across jurisdictions. Current virologic surveillance suggests low influenza activity, but other severe disease indicators, such as a 7.6% mortality rate attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 above epidemic thresholds, imply increasing respiratory illness incidence. These factors combined suggest a gradual increase in ILI occurrences in the upcoming weeks.
