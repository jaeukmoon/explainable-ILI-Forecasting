- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2104 due to the observed declining trend in the time-series data, where ILI occurrences consistently decreased over the last several weeks, from 5915 to 1593. Additionally, summarized CDC surveillance data indicates that influenza activity remains low, outpatient visits for ILI are still below the national baseline, and most regions report minimal or sporadic activity. Although the reports mention a slight increase in influenza virus detections and rising trends in some areas, the overall activity level and its slow progression contribute to the forecasted ILI value being significantly lower than previous highs.
