The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1843 because the time-series data shows a gradual decline in ILI visits over recent weeks, falling from 2367 in week 8 to 1977 in week 20. Additionally, the summarized news reports indicate consistently low influenza activity with only 0.1%-0.2% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza and ILI visits at 1.6%, far below the national baseline of 2.6%. Furthermore, minimal geographic spread, low hospitalization rates, and CDC warnings of potential increases in the coming months suggest a stable, but slightly decreasing, trend.
