- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 16,729 based on the increasing trend in the recent time-series data (from 9,410 to 21,495 across 20 weeks, peaking before a slight decline) aligned with sustained ILI activity reported in the surveillance data. Although recent ILI outpatient visits (1.2%) are slightly below the national baseline of 2.6%, the geographical spread of minimal to high activity in some regions, combined with virologic surveillance indicating a predominance of Influenza A viruses in circulating strains, suggests a continued moderate rise in ILI cases over time. Mortality data further supports ongoing respiratory pathogen activity during this period.
