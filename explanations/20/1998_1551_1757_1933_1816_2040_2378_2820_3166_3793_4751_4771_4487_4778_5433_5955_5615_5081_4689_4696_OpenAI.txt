- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences have been decreasing gradually from a peak (5955 in week 15 to 4696 in week 20). Influenza activity is described as sporadic across regions, with outpatient visits for respiratory illness below the national baseline (2.1%) and ILI activity trending downward over the last four weeks. Furthermore, hospitalization rates remain relatively low, at 17.1 per 100,000 population, and virologic surveillance shows a decrease in positive specimens. These factors collectively imply a continued decline in ILI occurrences, leading to the projected 3548 occurrences after 5 weeks.
