The anticipated ILI occurrence of 5746 after 5 weeks can be explained by observing the steady upward trend in past ILI time-series data, where numbers rose from 3987 to 5846 over the earlier weeks, and stabilizing slightly around ~5400 in recent weeks. Additionally, the news indicates that influenza activity, particularly the A(H3N2) subtype, is increasing in some regions despite currently being below baseline nationally. Several reports emphasize rising hospitalization rates and increasing respiratory illness contributing to ILI. Taken together, these factors suggest an expected spike in ILI as influenza activity intensifies over the coming weeks.
