The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to reach 2658 due to the observed trend in the time-series data, where weekly ILI occurrences have steadily increased from 906 to 2067 over 20 weeks, showing consistent growth. This rise correlates with the virologic surveillance report indicating a predominance of Influenza A viruses and increasing influenza activity in certain jurisdictions, coupled with 7.6% of recent deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 being above the epidemic threshold. Additionally, regional variations in ILI activity and respiratory infections being above baseline thresholds for specific age groups suggest a continued upward trajectory in ILI cases.
