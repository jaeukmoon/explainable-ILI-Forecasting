- The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to reach 585 due to the upward trend in the ILI time-series data, where numbers have consistently risen from week 11 (382) to week 20 (564), reflecting a resurgence after a period of lower activity. While the reported ILI percentage (e.g., 1.1%) remains below the national baseline of 2.6%, and virologic surveillance shows minimal influenza activity (0.1% positive tests), the consistent rise in ILI numbers suggests that other respiratory illnesses or healthcare-seeking behaviors impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to the increase. This aligns with the CDC's note on influenza activity potentially increasing in the coming months despite current low levels.
