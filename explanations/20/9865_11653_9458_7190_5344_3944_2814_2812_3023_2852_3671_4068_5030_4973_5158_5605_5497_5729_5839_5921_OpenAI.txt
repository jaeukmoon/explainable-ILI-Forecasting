Based on the time series ILI occurrences, there was a steady decrease in cases from the initial weeks before stabilizing around week 8. However, from week 11 onward, there is a consistent increase in ILI cases (e.g., 4068 to 5921). This aligns with the CDC surveillance reports indicating that influenza activity is rising in certain regions, with influenza A(H3N2) being the predominant strain, contributing to increased outpatient visits and hospitalizations. Despite vaccination efforts, antigenic differences in H3N2 viruses from the vaccine likely contributed to the elevated transmission, explaining the projected future occurrence of 4,000 ILI cases after 5 weeks.
