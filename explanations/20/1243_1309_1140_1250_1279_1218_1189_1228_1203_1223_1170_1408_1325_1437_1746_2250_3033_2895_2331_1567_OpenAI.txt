- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 893 is predicted based on a decline in ILI trends over the past five weeks, including a consistent drop in weekly counts (e.g., from 3033 to 1567), suggesting reduced flu activity. Additionally, the CDC report highlights that outpatient ILI visits remain below national baselines at approximately 1.4%, with most regions experiencing minimal activity, alongside low hospitalization and mortality rates related to influenza. The seasonal decline, paired with widespread vaccination efforts and limited transmission in most areas, contributes to the reduced ILI forecast after five weeks.
