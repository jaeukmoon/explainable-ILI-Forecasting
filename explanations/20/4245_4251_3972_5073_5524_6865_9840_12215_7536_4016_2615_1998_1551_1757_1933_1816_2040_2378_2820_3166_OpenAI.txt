The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 4778 based on the recent trends showing an increasing, yet relatively controlled, trajectory of influenza activity in the U.S., per the past reports and time-series data. The time-series data reflects a seasonal rise and fall, with ILI counts peaking around Week 6-8 in previous cycles, aligning with news indicating growing outpatient ILI visits exceeding baselines and influenza A(H3N2) predominance. Meanwhile, the availability of over 162.5 million flu vaccine doses and low long-term care facility case reports suggest effective mitigation strategies are limiting excessive escalation. These influences combine to project a modest increase in ILI occurrences at 4778.
