The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2133 based on the observed gradual stabilization and slight increase in ILI activity in the time-series data, coupled with low influenza activity as reported in the news. Specifically, while ILI occurrences have been fluctuating slightly but remain near minimal, outpatient visits for ILI (e.g., 1.0%-1.7%) remain consistently below the national baseline, and influenza positivity rates in clinical laboratories remain very low (around 0.1%-0.4%). The forecasted value of 2133 reflects the slight upward trend in recent weeks, as seen in the time-series (2022, 2118, 2066), combined with the expectation of modest fluctuations in ILI activity due to low influenza circulation and continued impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare-seeking behavior, as stated in the surveillance reports.
