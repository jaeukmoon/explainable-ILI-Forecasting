- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 8,371 after 5 weeks is due to the observed cyclical trends in the time-series data where the ILI occurrences dropped steadily from a peak at 9,922 to lower levels around 5,851, then resurged upwards in subsequent weeks. Based on historical patterns, ILI activities are showing signs of recovery, as supported by the recent rise from 8,180 to 9,054 over the previous weeks. However, news reports indicate unusually low influenza activity, with virologic surveillance at 0.1% positivity and outpatient ILI visits at 1.1%, well below the 2.6% threshold. These factors suggest a moderate resurgence in ILI rates but not a dramatic spike, aligning with the projected 8,371.
