The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are predicted to be 3944 because recent trends in time-series data show a steep decline in ILI cases after peaking at week 3. After the spike at week 8 (6301 cases), a decreasing trend begins, reaching 2639 cases by week 9, and subsequently dropping to levels below the mid-season peaks. News reports corroborate this decline, indicating that despite an initial rise in outpatient visits for ILI, overall influenza activity remained below the national baseline and was primarily attributed to other respiratory viruses. This, alongside minimal pediatric mortality and low influenza circulation reported in virologic surveillance, supports the estimation of 3944 cases following the observed decline.
