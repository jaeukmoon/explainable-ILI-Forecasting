- The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 1923 due to declining trends in outpatient visits for respiratory illness, which remain below baseline levels according to ILI surveillance data. Influenza activity is regionally variable with decreasing positive test percentages in clinical laboratories, suggesting lower ILI contribution. While cumulative influenza hospitalization rates remain steady and above those of previous seasons, the mortality rate attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 stays above epidemic thresholds. Moreover, influenza virus surveillance reveals Influenza A(H3N2) predominance with antigenic differences from vaccine strains, potentially affecting vaccine effectiveness. These factors and low pediatric influenza-associated deaths indicate plateauing or reduced activity, aligning with the predicted occurrence value.
