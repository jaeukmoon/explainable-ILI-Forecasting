The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be **552** based on the observed gradual increase in recent ILI activity in the time-series data and CDC reports. The time-series shows a consistent rise in ILI occurrences from week 15 (382 cases) to week 20 (645 cases). Despite lower-than-usual influenza activity reported in the CDC surveillance (e.g., 0.1%-0.4% of specimens testing positive and ILI activity below the 2.6% baseline), there is a clear trend of increasing ILI cases likely influenced by seasonal patterns and CDC's caution about potential increases in flu activity in the coming weeks. Additionally, minimal vaccination uptake or preventive measures may have contributed to a steady rise, aligning with the future estimate of 552 cases.
