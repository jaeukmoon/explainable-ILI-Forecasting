- **Explanation**: The future ILI occurrence of 4,508 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the seasonal increase in influenza activity observed in past weeks and key surveillance trends. The time-series data shows consistent peaks in prior weeks (e.g., 3,839, 3,609) after moderate declines, suggesting a cyclic pattern. From the news, influenza A(H3N2) remains the dominant virus, and regional variations in activity are noted. Hospitalizations for influenza have been increasing weekly for 11 weeks, with mortality exceeding the epidemic threshold of 7.1%-7.5% in recent weeks, indicating an escalating trend. Coupled with the vaccine mismatch to circulating strains and the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, this upward trajectory supports the predicted spike to 4,508 cases.
