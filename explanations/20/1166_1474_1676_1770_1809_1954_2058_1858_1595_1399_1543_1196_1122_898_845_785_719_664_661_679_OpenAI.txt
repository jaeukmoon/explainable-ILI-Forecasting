The future ILI occurrence of 1083 after 5 weeks is due to the observed downward trend in past ILI occurrences in the time-series data, where numbers reduced continually from a peak of 2058 to 679 in the last week. Coupled with the CDC reports indicating that influenza activity was below the baseline nationally, with virologic data showing low percentages of positive influenza specimens and outpatient respiratory illness surveillance reflecting stable or declining trends, the reduced impact of ILI is consistent with the reported case number of 1083. Additionally, the widespread circulation of influenza A(H3N2), which was antigenically different from vaccine reference strains, might have slowed further outbreaks but still allowed for steady activity due to regional variation.
