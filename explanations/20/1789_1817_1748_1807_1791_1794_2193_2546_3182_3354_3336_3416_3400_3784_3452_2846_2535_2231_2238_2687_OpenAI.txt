- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 3484 due to the observed upward trend in the time-series data and moderate increases in influenza activity, as hinted in the CDC report. From the time-series data, ILI occurrences spiked significantly in weeks 7-13 from 1794 to 3784 before declining slightly. Such patterns suggest potential periodic increases. Additionally, regional variations in moderate ILI activity across some jurisdictions and the presence of Influenza A reported in virologic surveillance indicate increasing influenza transmission, aligning with the seasonal nature of the virus.
