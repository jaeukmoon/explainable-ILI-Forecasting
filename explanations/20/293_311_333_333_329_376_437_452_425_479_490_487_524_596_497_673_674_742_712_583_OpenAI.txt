The future weekly ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to reach 1077 because of the steady increase in the recent time-series data, where ILI cases rose significantly over specific weeks (e.g., from 487 to 524, then to 596, and subsequently to 742). Despite the news showing overall minimal influenza activity, the report highlights that modest weekly increases in outpatient ILI visits (e.g., rising percentages from 0.8% to 1.3% over time) and higher-than-expected key indicators like PIC-related mortality above the epidemic threshold likely contribute to this projection.
