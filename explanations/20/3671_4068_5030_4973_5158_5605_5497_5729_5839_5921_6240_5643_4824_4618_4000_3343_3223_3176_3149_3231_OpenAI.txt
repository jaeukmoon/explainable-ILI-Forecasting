The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is projected to be 3504 based on the recent downward trend observed in the time-series data and the reported influenza surveillance information. The time-series ILI occurrences show a steady decline in the past five weeks from 4000 to 3149, reflecting reduced influenza activity. Moreover, news reports highlight that while seasonal influenza activity persists in parts of the country, outpatient visits for ILI remain below baseline with continued co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses. The combination of stabilizing outpatient respiratory visits, regional variations in moderate activity, and declining hospitalization and virologic surveillance trends support the projection of a slightly reduced ILI occurrence to 3504 in five weeks.
