The projected ILI occurrence of 645 after 5 weeks reflects the trend of decreasing ILI cases in the time-series data (from 955 in Week 1 to 382 in Week 20) as well as the news reports indicating unusually low influenza activity during prior weeks. Specifically, only 0.2% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza in clinical laboratories, and ILI visits remained below the national baseline at 1.5%. Despite predictions from the CDC that flu activity may increase in coming months, the overall trend combined with minimal geographic spread and low hospitalization rates suggest the decrease will continue, justifying a relatively moderate prediction of 645 by Week 25.
