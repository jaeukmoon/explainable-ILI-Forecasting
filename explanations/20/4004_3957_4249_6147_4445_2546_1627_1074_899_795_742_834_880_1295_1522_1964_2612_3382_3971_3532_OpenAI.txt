- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2739 due to the decreasing trend in ILI occurrences observed in the past five weeks of the time series data ('3971', '3532', '3382', '2612', '1964'), coupled with evidence from the news indicating that influenza activity is declining in some areas. The percentage of outpatient visits for respiratory illness, including ILI, remains below baseline, and hospitalization rates, though higher than the previous season, are still lower compared to pre-COVID-19 pandemic seasons. Together, these trends and evidence suggest a continued decline, leading to the forecasted occurrence of 2739.
