- **Explanation:** Based on the past time-series ILI data, there has been a general trend of increasing ILI occurrences over the last several weeks (e.g., 3614 → 4995 → 5551), signaling rising influenza activity. The news reports corroborate this by emphasizing steady increases in influenza activity, particularly due to Influenza A(H3N2), and elevated rates of hospitalization and mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19. Although outpatient visits for respiratory illness have remained below baseline in recent updates, the variability by region and co-circulation of other respiratory viruses indicate that ILI occurrences are likely to rise. Therefore, the projected future ILI occurrence of 4495 reflects an expected fluctuation during a transitional decline from the recent increase in activity.
