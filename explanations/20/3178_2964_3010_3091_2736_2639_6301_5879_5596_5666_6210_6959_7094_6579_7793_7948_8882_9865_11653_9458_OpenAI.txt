The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2812 based on the significant declining trend in recent ILI time-series data (from 11653 to 9458 over the last three data points) and the CDC's virologic and outpatient illness surveillance reports emphasizing low influenza activity with outpatient visits for ILI below national baselines (e.g., reported percentages like 2.4% being below the baseline of 2.6%). Additionally, most regions reported minimal to moderate ILI activity, and mortality due to influenza remained dominated by COVID-19 rather than flu, indicating a continuation of decreasing ILI trends.
