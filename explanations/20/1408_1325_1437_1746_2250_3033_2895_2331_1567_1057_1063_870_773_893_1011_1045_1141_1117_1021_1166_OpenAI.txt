- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1954 due to the increasing trend in outpatient visits for respiratory illness, as reported in the news, which has surpassed the national baseline in recent weeks. Additionally, influenza activity is on the rise across various regions, with Influenza A(H3N2) being the predominant virus and hospitalization rates increasing. This aligns with the previous time-series trend, where ILI occurrences showed a peak followed by a decline and a stabilization around similar levels, suggesting a likely resurgence to a level close to 1954 after recent increases in influenza indicators.
