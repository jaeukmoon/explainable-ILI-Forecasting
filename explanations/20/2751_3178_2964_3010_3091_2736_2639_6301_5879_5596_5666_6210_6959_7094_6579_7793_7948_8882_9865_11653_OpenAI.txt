- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 2814 after five weeks can be attributed to the observed trend in the past time-series data, where ILI counts peaked sharply in weeks 8 to 12 (e.g., 6301 in week 8 and 6210 in week 12), followed by a gradual decline toward week 20 (11653). Combined with the news indicating consistently low national ILI percentages (below the baseline of 2.6%) attributed more to other respiratory viruses than influenza, it supports the projection of declining ILI counts as influenza activity remains subdued with constrained regional and demographic impacts.
