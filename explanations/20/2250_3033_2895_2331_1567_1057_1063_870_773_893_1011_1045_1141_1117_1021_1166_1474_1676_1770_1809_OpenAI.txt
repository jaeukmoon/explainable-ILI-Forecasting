- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 1,399 after 5 weeks reflects the recent stabilization of outpatient respiratory illness visits, with percentages below the national baseline since early March, while influenza activity is declining in some regions. Hospitalization rates, though modestly increasing in prior weeks, remain substantially lower than pre-COVID seasons, suggesting limited severe cases. Furthermore, no significant antigenic changes in circulating A(H3N2) viruses imply continued predictability in ILI trends. The cumulative hospitalization rate of 14.4 per 100,000 and the lack of pediatric influenza deaths signal decreasing severity, supporting the estimate.
