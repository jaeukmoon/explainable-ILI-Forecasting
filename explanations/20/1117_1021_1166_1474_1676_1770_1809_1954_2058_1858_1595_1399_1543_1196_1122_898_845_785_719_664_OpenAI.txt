- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 867 after 5 weeks can be explained by the downward trend in the time-series ILI data, indicating a consistent decline over the prior weeks ('2058' down to '664'). Supporting this, the summarized news highlights reduced outpatient visits for respiratory illness (below baseline levels at 1.4%-1.9%) and low virologic surveillance positivity rates for influenza (as low as 0.4%-0.7%). Although hospitalizations remain a concern, the overall ILI activity, influenced by increasing co-circulation of other respiratory viruses and localized flu activity, suggests lower projected numbers.
