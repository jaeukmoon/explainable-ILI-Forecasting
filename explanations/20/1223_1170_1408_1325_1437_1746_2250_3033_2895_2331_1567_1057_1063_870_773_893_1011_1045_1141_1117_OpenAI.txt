The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to reach 1770 due to the observed increasing trend in influenza activity in the preceding weeks, as supported by both time-series data and news reports. Based on the time-series, ILI occurrences climbed notably during similar periods in previous weeks ('1057', '1063', '870', '773', '893'). Meanwhile, CDC reports confirm a national increase in outpatient visits for ILI, with Influenza A(H3N2) being the predominant strain, which is consistent with the pattern of rising cases observed in the preceding surveillance data. Despite activity remaining below the epidemic threshold in some areas, moderate to high activity in certain regions and ongoing hospitalizations suggest a further rise in cases.
