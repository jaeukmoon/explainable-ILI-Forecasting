Explanation: The projected future ILI occurrence of 3168 after 5 weeks reflects a likely gradual increase in cases, inferred from the prior time-series pattern where ILI counts fluctuated but peaked periodically (e.g., 2198 in week 17 and 2237 in week 18), combined with CDC news highlighting low but cautionary influenza activity nationwide. Despite seasonal influenza being below baseline levels (e.g., only 0.1% testing positive and 1.2% visits attributed to ILI), increasing mortality (e.g., PIC deaths above threshold at 10.9%-16.4%) and predictions of potential rises in flu activity suggest gradual resurgence over time.
