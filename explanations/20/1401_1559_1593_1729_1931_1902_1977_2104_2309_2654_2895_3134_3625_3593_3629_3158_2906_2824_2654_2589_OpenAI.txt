- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1801 because ILI activity has been generally declining over the most recent weeks in the given time-series data, with occurrences dropping from a peak of 3629 (week 14) to 2589 (week 20). Corresponding summarized reports indicate that outpatient respiratory illness visits remain stable and below the national baseline, with multiple respiratory viruses contributing to respiratory illness. Additionally, virologic and surveillance data show a decrease in positive specimens and the circulation of antigenically different H3N2 strains, suggesting that ILI occurrences will continue stabilizing or declining despite regional variations in activity and moderately increasing hospitalizations in some areas.
