- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 654 due to a consistent downward trend in past time-series data, with ILI occurrences decreasing from a peak of 1038 to 586 over the last 15 weeks. This decline aligns with the reported decrease in outpatient visits for respiratory illness, stable or below-baseline ILI activity, and reduced influenza-positive test percentages in clinical laboratories. Additionally, regions report sporadic or minimal influenza activity, and respiratory illness contributions from influenza are diminishing, as reflected in lower hospitalization and mortality rates compared to pre-COVID-19 seasons. These factors collectively support the projection of reduced ILI occurrences in future weeks.
