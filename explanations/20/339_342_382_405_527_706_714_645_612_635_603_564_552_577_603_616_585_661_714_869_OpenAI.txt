The prediction of future ILI occurrences (1347 after 5 weeks) appears influenced by a consistent rising trend in the ILI time series data over the past 10 weeks (e.g., from '603' to '869'), signaling a seasonal increase in activity, as well as news evidence of a gradual increase in outpatient ILI visits (e.g., "ILI activity remains below the national baseline of 2.6%, but increased slightly week over week") and CDC warnings that flu activity "may increase in the coming months." The report also cites caution in interpreting reduced flu data due to the COVID-19 impact, emphasizing the possibility of underestimation. Taken together, the steady upward pattern in ILI occurrences, coupled with seasonal expectations, justifies the projected value of 1347.
