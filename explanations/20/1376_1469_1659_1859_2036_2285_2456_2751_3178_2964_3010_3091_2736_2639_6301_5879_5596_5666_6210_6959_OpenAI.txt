The predicted future ILI occurrences of 8882 after 5 weeks align with a sharp upward trend observed in the past time-series data, where a notable spike occurred from week 14 to week 15 (2639 to 6301 cases, nearly a 2.4-fold increase), following consistent increases in prior weeks. This pattern implies susceptibility to rapid escalations in cases. Additionally, despite current reports indicating minimal ILI activity and a below-baseline percentage of outpatient visits for ILI (around 1.2%-1.4%), factors such as the predominance of Influenza A, historical trends, and rising mortality rates attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (above epidemic thresholds) signal potential for an upswing in ILI activity, consistent with seasonal transitions and previous spikes.
