The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks being 18,422 can be attributed to an increasing trend in the past 20 weeks of ILI time-series data (‘5851’ to ‘8371’), showing consistent growth despite fluctuations, particularly a sharp rise around weeks 8–14. In contrast, the summarized news indicates that influenza activity remained unusually low, with 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive and ILI visits below the national baseline, attributed partly to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This divergence suggests that external factors, such as the potential easing of COVID-19 restrictions, may have propelled the ILI resurgence, combined with seasonal trends unaccounted for in earlier surveillance models.
