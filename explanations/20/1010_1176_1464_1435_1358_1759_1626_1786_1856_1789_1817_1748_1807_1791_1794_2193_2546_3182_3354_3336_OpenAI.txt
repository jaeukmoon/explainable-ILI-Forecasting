The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2846 due to the observed trend in the past time-series data showing a consistent increase in ILI cases over the weeks, particularly after week 15, when occurrences surged from 1794 to 2193, 2546, and then 3182. This trend suggests continued growth of ILI activity. Despite the virologic and outpatient surveillance reports indicating low influenza activity, the time-series trajectory indicates an increase in ILI cases, possibly influenced by non-influenza respiratory illnesses or the lagging impact of behavioral and healthcare-seeking patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth pattern in cases drives this prediction despite the minimal reported influenza activity geographically and virologically.
