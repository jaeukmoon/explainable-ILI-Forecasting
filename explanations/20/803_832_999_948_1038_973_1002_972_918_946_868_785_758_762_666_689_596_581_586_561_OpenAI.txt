- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 611 due to the continuing overall decline in ILI activity and outpatient visits, as seen in the past time-series data where occurrences decreased consistently from 1038 to 561 over 20 weeks. Additionally, the news reports highlight that the percentage of visits for ILI remains below baseline across most regions, respiratory illness appears to co-circulate with other viruses, and hospitalization rates are lower than pre-COVID seasons, all collectively indicating a sustained downward trend in ILI occurrences.
