- Explanation: The increase in ILI occurrences over the past 20 weeks, particularly the sharp rise from 2639 to 7094 in recent weeks, indicates the seasonal trend of influenza. Combining this with the news on virologic surveillance showing notable circulation of influenza strains (70.5% being Influenza A, predominantly H1N1), moderate activity in some states, and above-threshold mortality (7.1% due to Pneumonia and Influenza), it can be inferred that the influenza season is intensifying. Expected continued spread and activity predict ILI occurrences escalating to 11,653 after 5 weeks.
