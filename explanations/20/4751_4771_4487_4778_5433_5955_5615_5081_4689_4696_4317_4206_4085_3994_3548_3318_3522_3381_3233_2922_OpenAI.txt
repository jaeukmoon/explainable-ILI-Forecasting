- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 4572 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the observed trends in the time-series data and summarized news during preceding weeks. The ILI time-series shows fluctuating but decreasing levels of ILI activity, starting from 4751 to 2922. However, the news highlights increasing hospitalizations for influenza for 11 consecutive weeks leading to high cumulative rates, and mortality surveillance indicates deaths from pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 consistently remaining above epidemic thresholds. Activity variations by region, dominance of influenza A(H3N2) with antigenic differences from vaccines, and co-circulation of respiratory viruses contribute to the predicted future rise in ILI occurrences.
