- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 23,786 because influenza activity is increasing nationally, particularly in the eastern and central regions, with Influenza A(H3N2) being the predominant virus type. Trends in past time-series data show a seasonal peak in ILI occurrences followed by a decline and gradual resurgence, reflected in the recent upward trend (e.g., 10,080, 10,778, 12,532, 13,484). Additionally, hospitalizations and outpatient respiratory illness visits are rising, with reports of higher-than-baseline outpatient visits (4.8%) and increased mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 above epidemic thresholds. These factors combine to suggest a continued increase in ILI cases in the near term.
