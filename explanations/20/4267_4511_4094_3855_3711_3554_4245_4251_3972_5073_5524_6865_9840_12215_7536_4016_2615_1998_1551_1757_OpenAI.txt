The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2820 due to the decreasing trend observed in the past time-series data and the continued low influenza activity reported across multiple weekly surveillance summaries. Historical data shows a steady decline in ILI occurrences in recent weeks (with reported counts dropping from 9840 to 1757 over the last 12 weeks). Meanwhile, surveillance reports indicate that ILI activity remains below the national baseline, minimal ILI activity is reported in most regions, and there is no significant increase in influenza circulation or severe disease indicators. Additionally, ongoing vaccination efforts and low hospitalization rates contribute to the expectation that flu levels will remain low, resulting in a projected ILI occurrence of 2820 after 5 weeks.
