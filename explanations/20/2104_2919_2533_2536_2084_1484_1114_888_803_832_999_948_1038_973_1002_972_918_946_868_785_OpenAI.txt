The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are predicted to be 596 due to the continued decrease in influenza activity across the United States, as evidenced by the recent stabilization or decline in outpatient visits for respiratory illness (below the baseline in the latest reports), the sporadic nature of flu cases, and lower hospitalization rates compared to previous high-activity peaks. Additionally, virologic surveillance indicates that influenza activity is geographically variable and primarily driven by Influenza A(H3N2), with fewer severe cases and deaths attributed to influenza during the current phase. Combined, these trends suggest a consistent decline in ILI occurrences.
