The future ILI occurrence of 845 after 5 weeks is likely due to the observed decreasing trend in ILI over the past four weeks, as noted in the time-series data with a peak at Week 10 (1954) followed by subsequent declines, reaching 1399 in Week 20. This decline aligns with virologic surveillance data indicating that influenza activity is decreasing nationally, outpatient visits for ILI are below baseline (2.1%), and ILI activity has been trending downward as respiratory virus co-circulation diminishes. Coupled with reduced hospitalization rates (17.1 per 100,000 population) and a lack of significant regional or jurisdictional increases, this provides evidence for the projected moderation of flu activity to reach 845 in future weeks.
