- Explanation: The ILI occurrences trending downward over the past 20 weeks, from 615 to 333, reflect a decline in seasonal influenza activity, as corroborated by CDC reports stating that flu activity remains unusually low with only 0.1-0.4% of respiratory specimens testing positive and ILI visits consistently below the 2.6% national baseline. Additionally, minimal ILI activity reported in most jurisdictions and the continued impact of COVID-19 on healthcare-seeking behavior suggest suppressed transmission. These patterns indicate that future ILI levels will remain low, explaining the relatively modest projection of 452 after 5 weeks.
