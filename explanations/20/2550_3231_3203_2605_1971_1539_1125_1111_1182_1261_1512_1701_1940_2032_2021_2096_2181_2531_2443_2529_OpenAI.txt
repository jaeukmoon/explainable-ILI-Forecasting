- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1454 based on the declining trend observed in past time-series ILI occurrences (from 2529 to 1125 over earlier weeks) and the key surveillance reports indicating sporadic influenza activity with outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses below the national baseline (1.7%). Additionally, hospitalization rates and death percentages due to ILI remain lower compared to pre-pandemic levels. These reports suggest a continued decrease in influenza activity, aligning with the projected occurrence after 5 weeks.
