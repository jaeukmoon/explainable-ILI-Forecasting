The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 1464 due to the observed seasonal downward trend in past time-series data, from a peak of 2178 in Week 4 down to 862 in Week 20, aligned with news reports of consistently low influenza activity. Both outpatient ILI surveillance (staying below the 2.6% national baseline) and virologic surveillance showing only 0.2% of specimens testing positive support the expectation of continued low levels. Additionally, minimal reporting of severe cases, low hospitalization rates, and the absence of pediatric deaths indicate sustained low ILI occurrences consistent with this time of year, justifying the forecasted value.
