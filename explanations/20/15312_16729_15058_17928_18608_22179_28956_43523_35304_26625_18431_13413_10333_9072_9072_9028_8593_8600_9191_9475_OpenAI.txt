- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 14,343 because the time-series data indicates a downward trend in ILI activity following a peak at Week 8 with occurrences gradually falling from 43,523 to the most recent value of 9,475. This aligns with the CDC surveillance reports, which note a decline in influenza activity in several regions despite ongoing sporadic activity nationwide. Additionally, outpatient visits for ILI remain below the national baseline, and hospitalizations and mortality rates for influenza are lower than in pre-COVID-19 seasons, further supporting reduced occurrences in future weeks.
