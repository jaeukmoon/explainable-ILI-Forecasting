The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 1976 due to the upward trajectory observed in the past time-series data, where ILI cases steadily increased from 664 to 1910 over 20 weeks, showing consistent growth. Additionally, despite current influenza activity being unusually low (e.g., 0.1% of specimens testing positive and 1.2% of outpatient visits for ILI), historical trends dominated by a consistent rise in ILI suggest continued increases in subsequent weeks. Evidence points to COVID-19 impacting healthcare-seeking behavior and data interpretation, but the trend in ILI data primarily drives projections.
