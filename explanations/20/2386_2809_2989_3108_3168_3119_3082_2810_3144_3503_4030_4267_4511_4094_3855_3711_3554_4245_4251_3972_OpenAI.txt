- Explanation: The spike to 12,215 ILI cases after 5 weeks represents a significant increase, evident from the preceding upward trend in the time-series data (starting at 2,386 and peaking at 4,511 before a slight decline) and the absence of high preventive measures or significant influenza-positive rates in the news. Despite flu activity being reported as "minimal" across most jurisdictions and below baseline levels (like 1.3% ILI visits in week 28), the high P&I mortality rate (7.1%, above the epidemic threshold) signals severe respiratory illnesses circulating, contributing to higher ILI projections. This aligns with historical patterns of eventual ILI resurgence after a slow decline during flu seasons.
