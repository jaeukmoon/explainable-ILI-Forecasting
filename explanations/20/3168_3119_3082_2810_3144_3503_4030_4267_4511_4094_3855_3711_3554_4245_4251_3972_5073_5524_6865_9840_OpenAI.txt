- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, the past weeks show a decreasing trend in ILI occurrences after a significant peak of 9840 in week 20, suggesting that the flu season is ending. This trend is supported by surveillance data in the news reports, which indicate low influenza activity nationally and ILI percentages consistently remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%. The data further suggests the recent increases in respiratory illnesses are primarily caused by non-influenza viruses, while vaccination and preventive measures are mitigating ILI occurrences. Thus, the combination of seasonal trends and current low virologic activity reasonably predicts ILI occurrences to stabilize at a low value, such as 1998, in 5 weeks.
