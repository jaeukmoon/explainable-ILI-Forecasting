- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences are projected to be 1201 due to a combination of increasing seasonal influenza activity, especially in certain areas of the country, and the predominance of influenza A(H3N2) viruses, which account for most detected cases. The trends from the time-series data, which show an increase from 677 to 840 ILI occurrences in the last two weeks, coupled with news reports of upward trends in respiratory illnesses since early March, indicate a continuous rise in ILI activity. Additionally, higher hospitalization rates for influenza-related cases compared to recent seasons further signal an intensifying trend, aligning with the projected estimate of 1201 occurrences in five weeks.
