- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences are predicted to reach 1484 after 5 weeks due to the overall increasing trend in ILI activity and influenza virus circulation observed in the past 20 weeks. The time-series data reflects a rise from 1101 to 2104, showing a significant increase in recent weeks, particularly in the last four data points (1216, 1752, 1772, 1874). Summarized news highlights show that ILI is gradually rising, with some regions reporting moderate to high activity (e.g., Louisiana and Regions 3, 7, and 9 were recently above baseline). The prevalence of Influenza A (H3N2) and rising respiratory illness percentages above baseline support the projection of continued moderate increases in ILI activity.
