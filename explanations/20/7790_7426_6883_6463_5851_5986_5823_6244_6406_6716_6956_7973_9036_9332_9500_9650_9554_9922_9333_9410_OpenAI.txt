- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 9593 because of a consistent upward trend in the past time-series data, with recent weeks showing significant increases (e.g., 9036, 9332, 9500, 9650, 9554, and 9922 in the last five weeks), indicating a continuation of seasonal influenza activity. Despite reports in the news indicating low virologic surveillance positivity rates (e.g., 0.1%) and ILI outpatient visits below the national baseline (1.1-1.3%), the time-series clearly reflects growing influenza activity as external factors such as increased social interactions or insufficient preventive measures could be contributing to this observed rise, overriding the baseline conditions reported in surveillance data.
