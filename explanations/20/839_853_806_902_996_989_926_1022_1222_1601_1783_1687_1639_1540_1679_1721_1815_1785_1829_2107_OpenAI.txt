The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 2117 due to the upward trend in historical ILI data shown in the last five weeks of the time series (from 1540 to 2107) and the indications in the surveillance data. Specifically, influenza activity has been increasing, particularly with a predominance of Influenza A viruses and a slight rise in outpatient ILI visits, though still below the national baseline. Additionally, the current geographic spread suggests that activity is local and sporadic but growing, coupled with an ILI activity map reflecting moderate increases in certain regions. These combined factors suggest an upward trajectory in ILI cases, consistent with the projection of 2117 after five weeks.
