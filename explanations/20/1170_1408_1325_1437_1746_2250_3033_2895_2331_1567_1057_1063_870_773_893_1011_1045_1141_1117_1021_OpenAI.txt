The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1809 because the historical time-series data shows a decreasing trend in ILI occurrences after the peak in week 8 (3033 cases). Following the trend, cases decline steadily from 2895 to 1567 by week 13. In the corresponding news reports, while influenza activity remains elevated in some regions, the national percentage of outpatient visits for respiratory illness has stabilized or slightly decreased. Additionally, the news highlights that influenza A(H3N2) viruses are predominating, but the relative contribution of influenza to respiratory illness varies. These factors suggest that ILI occurrences will continue a gradual decline, resulting in 1809 cases.
