The future ILI occurrence of 2456 after five weeks can be attributed to the observed upward trend in ILI data and the slight increase in outpatient visits for ILI compared to earlier weeks, paired with the CDC's caution that low current flu activity may rise in the coming months. Specifically, while historical ILI occurrences were below the national baseline of 2.6%, recent fluctuations in trends (e.g., higher occurrences in the past 5 data weeks, such as 1598, 1645, 1504, 1576, and 1474) suggest a gradual increase. Moreover, despite current low virologic reporting (0.1% positivity) and minimal jurisdictional activity, the likely rise in flu activity projected by the CDC aligns with the predicted uptick to 2456 occurrences in the near term.
