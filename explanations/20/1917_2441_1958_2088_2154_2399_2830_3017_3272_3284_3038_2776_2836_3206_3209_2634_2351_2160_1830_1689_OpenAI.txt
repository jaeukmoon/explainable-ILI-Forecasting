The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 1673 because the time-series data show a consistent decline in ILI occurrences over the past 10 weeks, dropping from 3284 to 1689. This aligns with the virologic and outpatient illness surveillance reports, which indicate persistently low influenza activity (e.g., clinical lab positivity of 0.1-0.3%, ILI visit rates below the national baseline of 2.6%, and minimal regional activity). Additionally, no severe disease indicators, such as increased hospitalizations or pediatric deaths, were reported, and public health data show influenza virus circulation remains minimal. These combined trends support the expectation of continued low ILI activity in the coming weeks.
