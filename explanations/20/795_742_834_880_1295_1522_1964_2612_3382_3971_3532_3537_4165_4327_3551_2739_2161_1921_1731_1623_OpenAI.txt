Influenza-like illness (ILI) occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 1301 because recent ILI data shows a declining trend (e.g., from a peak of 4327 in week 14 to 1623 in week 20), supported by virologic surveillance indicating a decrease in the percentage of positive influenza specimens, with outpatient visits for respiratory illness stable and below the national baseline. Additionally, while influenza A(H3N2) continues to dominate, its contribution is lessening as activity declines in several regions, alongside co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors suggest that ILI activity will continue decreasing, aligning with the predicted future occurrences.
