Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrences are predicted to reach 1595 after five weeks based on trends observed in the past time series and the summarized CDC news reports. The time series data shows a historical decline in ILI numbers following consistent increases in prior weeks, which mirrors the observed pattern this season where influenza activity initially peaked before stabilizing or slightly declining (e.g., Week 3 reports noted slight decreases). Moreover, although influenza A(H3N2) remains the dominant virus, the CDC noted stabilization or decline in outpatient visits in recent weeks, with percentages trending below baseline in some areas. These factors, coupled with varying regional influenza contributions and co-circulating respiratory viruses, indicate an ongoing but moderated activity level, aligning with the forecasted 1595 ILI cases.
