The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 1261 due to the steady decline in ILI activity observed in the time-series data, where ILI occurrences have decreased from a peak of 3231 to 1971 in Week 20. The news reports support this trend, indicating that most jurisdictions report minimal ILI activity and the percentage of patient visits for ILI (2.3%) remains below the national baseline (2.6%), with low flu activity overall. These declining trends, combined with preventive measures such as vaccination and minimal geographic virus spread, point toward a continued decrease in ILI occurrences, resulting in a projection of 1261 after five weeks.
