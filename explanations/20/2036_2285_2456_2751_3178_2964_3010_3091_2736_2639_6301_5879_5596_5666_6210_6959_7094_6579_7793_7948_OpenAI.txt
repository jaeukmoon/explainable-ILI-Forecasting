The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 7,190 based on both the historical data and trends in reported surveillance. Historically, ILI occurrences show a seasonal rise during this time of the year, as reflected in the time-series data where numbers increased rapidly from Week 10 to Week 15 (e.g., from 2,639 to 6,210). Additionally, the surveillance reports mention increasing outpatient visits for ILI, with percentages nearing baseline levels (2.4%, close to 2.6% national baseline), Influenza A (H3N2) predominance, and rising geographic spread across jurisdictions. These factors, along with moderate activity observed in certain regions and a historical upward trajectory, support the forecasted number of 7,190 occurrences in 5 weeks.
