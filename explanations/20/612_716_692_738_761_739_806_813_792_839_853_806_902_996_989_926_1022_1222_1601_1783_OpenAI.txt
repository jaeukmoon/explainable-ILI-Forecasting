Based on the time-series, ILI occurrences have shown a steady increase in recent weeks, climbing significantly from 1222 (week 18) to 1601 (week 19) and then to 1783 (week 20). Despite virologic surveillance and CDC reports indicating low influenza activity (e.g., only 0.1% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza, and ILI visits consistently below the national 2.6% baseline), this upward trend can be attributed to changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors influenced by heightened public awareness, potential overlap of ILI with other respiratory illnesses like COVID-19, and general seasonal increases observed historically during similar timeframes, leading to a projected figure of 1721 after five weeks.
