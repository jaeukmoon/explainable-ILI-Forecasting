- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, recent ILI occurrences show a declining trend from 9045 in week 6 to 3523 in week 20, after an initial peak in week 6. However, the summarized CDC news suggests a rise in influenza activity, with increasing outpatient visits for respiratory illness, hospitalizations, and above-threshold mortality rates. While activity remains below previous pandemic seasons, this trend indicates a moderate resurgence of ILI cases. Given this, coupled with the prevalence of influenza A (H3N2), it is reasonable to project a slight increase, stabilizing the ILI occurrences at 3510 after 5 weeks.
