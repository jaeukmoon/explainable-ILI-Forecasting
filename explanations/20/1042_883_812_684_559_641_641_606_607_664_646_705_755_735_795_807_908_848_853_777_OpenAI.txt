- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1075 due to a consistent increasing trend in the time-series data following a trough five weeks prior (ILI occurrences climbed from 559, through intermediate rises, to 908 over the last few weeks). While news reports indicate that influenza activity has been unusually low and below baseline levels (e.g., only 1.3% of outpatient visits for ILI and minimal geographic activity), a subtle yet steady rise in ILI activity (e.g., increasing outpatient illness percentages and hospitalizations) along with lower vaccination rates or delayed effects of flu vaccination measures could contribute to this upward trajectory. This aligns with inherent seasonality and potential slight rebounds in flu trends as suggested in surveillance reports, despite overall lower-than-usual flu activity.
