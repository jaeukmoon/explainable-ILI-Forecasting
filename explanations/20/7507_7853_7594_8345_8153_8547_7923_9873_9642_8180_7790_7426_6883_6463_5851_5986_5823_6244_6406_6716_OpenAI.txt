The future ILI occurrences are predicted to be 9500 in 5 weeks because the time-series data shows an increase in past occurrences during seasonal peaks (e.g., a rise from 7507 to 9873 over prior weeks), and the CDC forecasts flu activity to increase in the coming months based on historical trends and virologic surveillance. Despite current low activity (e.g., 1.6% visits for ILI and 0.2% respiratory specimens testing positive), similar past seasons suggest a potential increase likely due to seasonal factors and expected behavior of influenza spread.
