- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence after five weeks reaching 3835 can be attributed to the trends in the time-series data, which show a consistent increase in ILI cases over recent weeks ('2193', '2546', '3182', '3354', '3336', '3416', '3400', '3784'), suggesting a sustained rise in activity. Despite current levels being below the national ILI baseline of 2.6% as reported in virologic surveillance, regions with high and moderate activity are likely contributing to this increase alongside sporadic geographic spread. Moreover, historical baselines suggest growing ILI activity in upcoming weeks due to seasonal influence and ongoing virus circulation.
