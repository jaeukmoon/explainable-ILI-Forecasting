The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks estimated as 911 can be attributed to the notable downward trend in the time-series data over the past 20 weeks, where ILI occurrences consistently declined from 1474 in week 1 to 566 in week 20. Despite occasional mentions in the news of increasing influenza activity in localized areas, indicators such as virologic surveillance showing a low percentage of positive influenza specimens, stable outpatient ILI visits below national baselines, and low reported severe disease indicators (e.g., minimal pediatric deaths) confirm a broader trend of declining flu activity. This aligns with the continuation of the historical trend and contextually supports the 911 projection.
