The future ILI occurrence of 1383 after five weeks can be explained by observing the gradual increase in recent ILI data ('949', '1099', '1213', '1209', '1496', '1482', '1490') and the CDC's expectation of rising influenza activity in the coming weeks despite it being below the national baseline. This aligns with the news reports emphasizing a low percentage of positive flu cases (0.1%-0.3%) but recognizing factors like increased geographic activity in certain jurisdictions and CDC’s anticipation that flu activity may soon rise due to seasonal patterns.
