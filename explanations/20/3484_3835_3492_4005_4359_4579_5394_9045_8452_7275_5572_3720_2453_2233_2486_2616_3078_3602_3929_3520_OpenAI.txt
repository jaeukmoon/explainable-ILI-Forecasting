- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 3024 due to the overall declining trend in recent ILI occurrences from the time-series data (e.g., a steady decrease from 7275 to 3520 in the last weeks) and the CDC surveillance reports indicating sporadic but decreasing influenza activity in most regions, with outpatient respiratory illness visits remaining below the national baseline. Seasonal influenza activity appears to be stabilizing, combined with the continuing availability of vaccinations and antiviral treatments as preventive measures, which together suggest a moderate reduction in future ILI rates.
