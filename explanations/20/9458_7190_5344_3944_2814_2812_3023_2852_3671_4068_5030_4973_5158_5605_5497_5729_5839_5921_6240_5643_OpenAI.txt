Given the time-series data showing a recent upward trend in ILI occurrences (e.g., increasing from week 15 at 5497 to week 19 at 5643), coupled with surveillance insights that influenza A(H3N2) activity remains high in certain regions, and hospitalization rates (14.4 per 100,000) indicate moderate severity of illness, ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are estimated to be 3223. This slight projected decline reflects the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses and lower-than-baseline outpatient visit percentages, suggesting regional variability and a mix of mitigating factors such as increasing vaccinations and antiviral treatments.
