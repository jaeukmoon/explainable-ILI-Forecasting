- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 4053 due to a consistent downward trend observed in recent ILI time-series data, with weekly numbers decreasing steadily from 6240 in week 10 to 3367 in week 20. Moreover, the news reports indicate that influenza activity is generally declining in some regions, ILI-related outpatient visits remain below baseline, and virologic surveillance shows low positivity rates for influenza. These factors collectively suggest that ILI occurrences will continue this declining trend, reaching 4053 after 5 weeks.
