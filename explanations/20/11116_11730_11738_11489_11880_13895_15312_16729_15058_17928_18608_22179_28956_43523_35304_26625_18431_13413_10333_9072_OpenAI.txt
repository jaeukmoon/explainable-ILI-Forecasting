The predicted ILI occurrences of 9,191 after 5 weeks are rooted in the observed declining trend in recent time-series data and supported by multiple news surveillance reports indicating low or sporadic influenza activity with moderate ILI levels in some regions. Specifically, the recent weeks in the time-series data show a notable decline in ILI occurrences (e.g., from 43,523 to 9,072), aligning with CDC findings that influenza activity remains minimal overall, below epidemic thresholds in most regions, and that the geographic spread has been largely sporadic with limited severe outcomes. This evidence supports the projection of a continued decline, stabilizing near 9,191.
