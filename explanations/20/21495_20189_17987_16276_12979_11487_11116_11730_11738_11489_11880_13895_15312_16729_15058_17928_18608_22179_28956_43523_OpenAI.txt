- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 10,333 due to the declining trend in ILI occurrences shown in the time-series data, which has seen peaks of 43,523, followed by rapid declines like 28,956 and 22,179 in the last weeks, indicating a post-peak stabilization phase. Furthermore, the reported news highlights low influenza virus circulation (predominantly Influenza A or B) and decreasing outpatient visits for ILI, with percentages consistently below or near the national baseline (2.5%). Therefore, these combined factors support a moderated value of 10,333 five weeks later.
