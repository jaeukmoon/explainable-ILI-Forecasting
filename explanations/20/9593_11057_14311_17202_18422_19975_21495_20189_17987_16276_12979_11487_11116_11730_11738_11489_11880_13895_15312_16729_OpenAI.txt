- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 28,956 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the increasing trend in the past time-series data, where ILI occurrences have been consistently rising over recent weeks (e.g., from 9,593 to 16,729). Additionally, the CDC's surveillance reports have highlighted a gradual increase in ILI activity in multiple regions, coupled with recent geographic spread data showing moderate activity in some areas, as well as the predominance of Influenza A (H3N2). This aligns with a rising trajectory based on virologic and outpatient data, confirming the expected continued growth in ILI occurrences.
