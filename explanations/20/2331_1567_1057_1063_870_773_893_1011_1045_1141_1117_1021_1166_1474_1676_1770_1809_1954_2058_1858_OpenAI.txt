The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 1122 because historical data shows decreasing ILI occurrences over time (week 1: 2331; week 10: 1141; week 20: 1858), and the most recent surveillance reports indicate that influenza activity is stable with outpatient visits for ILI below baseline, hospitalization rates lower than pre-COVID seasons, and a low percentage of influenza-positive tests in long-term care facilities. Additionally, preventive measures, such as vaccinations and antiviral treatments, continue to mitigate the spread. Therefore, the expected ILI occurrences reflect relatively stable, moderate activity trends.
