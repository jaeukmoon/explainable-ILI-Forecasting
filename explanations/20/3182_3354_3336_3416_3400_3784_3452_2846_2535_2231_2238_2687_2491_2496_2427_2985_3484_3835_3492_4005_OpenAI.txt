The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to reach 8,452 based on the observed increasing trend in the time-series ILI data combined with news reports indicating certain jurisdictions experiencing moderate ILI activity. The time-series shows a consistent upward trend in the most recent weeks ('2985', '3484', '3835', '3492', '4005'), suggesting a sustained rise. Additionally, news evidence highlights increasing geographic spread of moderate activity (e.g., "some regions reporting moderate activity") and an upward trend in outpatient ILI percentages in recent weeks, which supports this projected value.
