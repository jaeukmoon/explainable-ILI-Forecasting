- Explanation: The ILI time-series indicates a seasonal increase in cases over the past weeks, peaking at 1413 during Week 14 and stabilizing with slight variability through Weeks 15-20, suggesting consistent elevated activity. News data highlights low influenza-related activity, with the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza at only 0.1% and patient visits for ILI below the national baseline of 2.6%. However, a slight weekly increase in ILI suggests possible overlap with other respiratory illnesses or COVID-19 impact on reporting. This contextual consistency, combined with historical trends and slowed weekly case growth, explains the prediction of 1189 cases in 5 weeks.
