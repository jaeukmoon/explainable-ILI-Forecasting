The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 3144 based on the upward trend observed in the past 20 weeks of ILI data and specific cues from the surveillance data. The time-series shows consistent increases, especially in the last several weeks, from 2809 to 3108. This increasing trend aligns with the potential for flu activity to rise despite the current minimal levels in some jurisdictions and virologic surveillance showing only 0.1% positivity. Outpatient Illness Surveillance reports ILI visits below the baseline (e.g., 1.1%-1.3%), yet historical seasonality and rising PIC mortality (above epidemic threshold) suggest influenza activity will escalate. Thus, the projected 3144 cases reflect this steady growth trend combined with forecasted impacts rooted in seasonal patterns.
