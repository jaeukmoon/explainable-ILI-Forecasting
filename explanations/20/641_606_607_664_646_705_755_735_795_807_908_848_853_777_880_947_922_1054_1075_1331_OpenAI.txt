The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks reaching 2164 can be explained by the observed gradual increase in ILI cases in the past ten weeks (e.g., from 735 in week 7 to 1331 in week 20). This trend aligns with CDC expectations that flu activity, although below historical baselines and impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, may increase in the coming months. The news specifically mentions potential increases in flu activity and the slight rise in outpatient ILI visits (e.g., 0.8% to 1.2%) within the monitored period. Moreover, consistent low vaccination levels and steady viral activity contribute to a predicted surge in ILI occurrences, as observed in the extrapolated data.
