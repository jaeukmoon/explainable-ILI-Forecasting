- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 3929 after 5 weeks is based on the increasing trend observed in the past time-series data, where ILI occurrences showed periodic spikes (e.g., from 2238 to 5394 before a peak at 9045), and the CDC's surveillance reports indicating a gradual rise in influenza activity. Despite low overall activity in prior weeks, the CDC expected an increase in flu activity, supported by slightly rising outpatient ILI visits (e.g., 1.4% to 2.4%), ongoing detection of Influenza A (H3N2), and regional moderate activity (e.g., Louisiana). Together, these factors forecast a continued rise in ILI cases, reaching 3929.
