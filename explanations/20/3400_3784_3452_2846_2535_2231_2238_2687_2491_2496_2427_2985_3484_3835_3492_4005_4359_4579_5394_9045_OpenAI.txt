- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2453 because the time-series data shows a steady decline in ILI cases over recent weeks, dropping from 9045 to 2231. Coupled with the surveillance reports indicating low influenza virus circulation, below-national-baseline ILI activity (e.g., 2.2%-2.4%), and minimal severe outcomes (e.g., no pediatric deaths and low hospitalization rates), it is reasonable to project continued low activity. Additionally, the impact of other respiratory viruses and pandemic-associated changes in healthcare-seeking behavior further tempers the increase, aligning with this low forecast.
