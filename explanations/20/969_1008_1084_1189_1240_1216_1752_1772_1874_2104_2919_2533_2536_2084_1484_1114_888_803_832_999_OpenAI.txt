- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 972 due to a declining trend in ILI counts observed in the time-series data over recent weeks (from 999 to 832, 803, and 888), combined with reports indicating that while influenza activity in the United States shows sporadic increases in specific regions, the national percentage of outpatient ILI visits remains below baseline thresholds. Additionally, surveillance reports suggest minimal circulation of influenza viruses overall, supporting a continued lower level of ILI activity.
