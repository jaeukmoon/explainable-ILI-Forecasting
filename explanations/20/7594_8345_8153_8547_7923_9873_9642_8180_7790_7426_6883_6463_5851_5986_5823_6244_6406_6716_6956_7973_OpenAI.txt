The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to reach 9554 due to the observed increasing trend in the time-series data, where recent weeks show a rise in ILI (e.g., 6716, 6956, 7973). This aligns with CDC's warning that although current influenza activity is low, flu activity is expected to increase in the coming months. Preventive measures like vaccination and antiviral drugs are recommended, but past patterns and the cyclical nature of influenza support the forecasted growth in ILI cases.
