The predicted ILI occurrences reaching 947 in 5 weeks are grounded in a trend of gradual increase in ILI numbers observed in the time-series data, with recent weeks showing a rise from 795 to 908, even as influenza activity remains unusually low due to lower virologic positivity rates reported in the news. The gradual rise in occurrences may also reflect seasonal influenza's expected increase mentioned in the news, indicating a delayed but anticipated uptick. Therefore, the prediction aligns with the observed upward trend and the understanding that ILI activity, while still below baseline, could increase in the coming weeks.
