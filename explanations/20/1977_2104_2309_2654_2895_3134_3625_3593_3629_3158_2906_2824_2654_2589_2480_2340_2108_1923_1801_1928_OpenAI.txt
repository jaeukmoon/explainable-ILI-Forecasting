- Explanation: The prediction of future ILI occurrences reaching 2787 in five weeks is based on increasing seasonal influenza activity seen in past trends, particularly between weeks 6 and 12 where ILI occurrences rose from 1977 to 3625, and the news reports that influenza A(H3N2), with its antigenic differences from vaccine viruses, is the dominant strain. Hospitalizations for flu have been increasing weekly with cumulative rates nearing pre-pandemic levels, and ILI outpatient visits showed an upward trend nationally since mid-February. Additionally, multiple respiratory viruses co-circulating and regional variability in flu activity contribute to this rising trajectory.
