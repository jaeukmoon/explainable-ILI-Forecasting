- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are estimated to be 2340 due to a recent stabilization in outpatient respiratory illness visits at levels slightly below baseline but with an upward trend in specific regions. Hospitalization rates have also steadily increased, with Influenza A(H3N2) continuing as the dominant circulating strain, which is antigenically different from vaccine reference viruses, potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness. This aligns with the observed historic data trend, where occurrences increased steadily after Week 15 in prior weeks, peaking in Week 16 to 18, suggesting a similar trajectory in the current season.
