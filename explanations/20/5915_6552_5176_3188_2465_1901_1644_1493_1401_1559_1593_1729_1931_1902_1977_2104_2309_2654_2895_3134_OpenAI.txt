- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2,906 because recent data indicates a national decline in influenza activity, with outpatient visits for respiratory illness decreasing steadily, dropping below the national baseline in recent weeks. Additionally, the dominant influenza strain, A(H3N2), continues to circulate but at reduced levels compared to previous weeks. Hospitalization rates and deaths attributed to influenza are also lower than earlier in the season, further supporting this downward trend. Combined, this evidence suggests a projected stabilization at lower ILI levels five weeks later, aligning with the decline trajectory observed in the time-series data.
