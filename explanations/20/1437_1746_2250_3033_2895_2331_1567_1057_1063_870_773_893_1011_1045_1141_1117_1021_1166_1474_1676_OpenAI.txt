The predicted future ILI occurrences of 1858 after 5 weeks can be attributed to several factors revealed in the time-series data and news summaries. The past ILI occurrences show a general downward trend from weeks of high levels (3033 in week 4), followed by a relatively sustained decline towards week 20 (1676). While ILI activity is trending downward nationally, per the summarized reports, influenza A(H3N2) remains predominant, and outpatient respiratory illness visits indicate continued contributions from influenza to illnesses. The slight declines in outpatient visit percentages and hospitalizations suggest stabilization, but surges in specific regions and the ongoing circulation of the virus support the forecasted moderate level of 1858 occurrences in 5 weeks, maintaining a middle-ground between recent lows and potential rebounds in activity.
