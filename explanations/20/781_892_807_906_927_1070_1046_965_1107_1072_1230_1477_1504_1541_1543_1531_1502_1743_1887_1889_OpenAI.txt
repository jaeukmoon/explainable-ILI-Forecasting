The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1802 due to the observed increasing trend in weekly ILI occurrences in the time-series data (e.g., from 1502 to 1743, 1887, and 1889), which indicates gradual growth in activity. This increase aligns with the slight rise in ILI activity noted in the news (from below to reaching 1.3% of patient visits), despite being below the national baseline. Additionally, the geographical spread of influenza, minimal severe disease indicators, and low flu activity noted in the news suggest moderate but steady growth, consistent with historical seasonal trends.
