- Explanation: The projected ILI occurrence of 714 in five weeks is based on a consistent pattern of decreasing weekly ILI occurrences in the time-series data (starting from 903 and progressing to 342), combined with news indicating low hospitalization rates, minimal influenza activity (only 0.1%-0.4% of respiratory tests positive for influenza), and ILI surveillance remaining well below the national baseline of 2.6% (around 1.4%-1.7% in recent weeks). While the CDC predicts a potential increase in flu activity, the gradual decline in cases and currently low activity levels present strong evidence for relatively low ILI occurrences in the near future.
