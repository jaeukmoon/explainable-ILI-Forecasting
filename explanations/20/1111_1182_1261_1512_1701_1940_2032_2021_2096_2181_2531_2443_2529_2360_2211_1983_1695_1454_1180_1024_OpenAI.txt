The predicted future ILI occurrence of 835 after five weeks is attributed to the declining trend in ILI cases observed in the past time series data (e.g., from 2531 in week 11 to 1024 in week 20), combined with reports of decreasing influenza activity nationwide. The surveillance data highlights that outpatient visits for respiratory illness remained below baseline in most regions, and virologic surveillance indicates a decrease in positive influenza specimens. Furthermore, hospitalization and mortality rates, while slightly above baselines, show stable to declining trends, reflecting reduced overall impact. These factors collectively suggest a continued decline, leading to the projected low ILI occurrence.
