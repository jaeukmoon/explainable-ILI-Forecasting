The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 6025 due to a sharp increase in weekly ILI cases as observed in the past time-series trend. Despite virologic surveillance consistently reporting low influenza activity (e.g., only 1.3% of patient visits for ILI, below the 2.6% baseline), the sustained low ILI percentages and minimal geographic spread indicate changes in healthcare-seeking behavior or underreporting due to COVID-19 disruptions. This underestimation, combined with historical patterns of surges (as seen in the rapid rise from 1934 to 4661 in recent weeks), suggests that the trend will continue upward, resulting in a forecast of 6025 ILI occurrences by Week 25.
