The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 2531 due to the increasing trend in influenza activity observed in recent data, coupled with reports of moderate to high ILI activity in some jurisdictions and an increase in outpatient visits for respiratory illness, which are nearing or surpassing the national baseline. Additionally, Influenza A(H3N2) viruses, which have been predominant and antigenically different from the vaccine strain, continue to drive transmission. Rising hospitalization rates and mortality surveillance showing deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 above the epidemic threshold further indicate a sustained growth in influenza activity.
