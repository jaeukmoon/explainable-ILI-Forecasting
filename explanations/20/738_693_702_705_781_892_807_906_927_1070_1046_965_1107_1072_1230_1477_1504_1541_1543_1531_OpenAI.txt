The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks being 1978 can be attributed to the consistent upward trend in historical ILI data and the slight increase in ILI patient visits reported recently. The time-series shows a steady rise from week 15 (1107) to week 20 (1531). News data indicates that while ILI activity remained below the national baseline (e.g., 1.2%-1.3% of patient visits), there was a small but consistent increase signaled, especially with slight growth in outpatient ILI percentages (1.1% in weeks 15-17 to 1.3% in week 20). Historical patterns and minor increases suggest that ILI cases will continue to grow over the next 5 weeks, peaking at 1978.
