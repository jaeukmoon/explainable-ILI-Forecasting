The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 664 primarily due to the observed consistent declining trend in ILI occurrences in the time-series data, dropping from 899 to 559 over 20 weeks, and corroborated by CDC surveillance reports indicating persistently low influenza activity. Virologic surveillance shows low percentages (e.g., 0.1%-0.4%) of specimens testing positive for influenza, and outpatient illness surveillance consistently records ILI visits below the national baseline, such as 1.1%-1.6%. Furthermore, minimal geographic ILI activity, absence of pediatric deaths, and hospitalization rates near seasonal lows suggest no immediate surge. These factors, coupled with the CDC’s expectation of low flu activity in the immediate term, strongly align with a projected occurrence of 664.
