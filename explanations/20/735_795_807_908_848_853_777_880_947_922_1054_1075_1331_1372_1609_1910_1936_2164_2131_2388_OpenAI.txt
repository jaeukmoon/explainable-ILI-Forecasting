- Explanation: The sharp increase in ILI occurrences to 2438 after 5 weeks can be explained by the recent upward trend in the time-series data, where ILI counts rose significantly from Week 16 to Week 20 (735 to 2388). Despite the news reports indicating that influenza activity remained below national baselines, minimal ILI activity in jurisdictions, and the low percentage of positive influenza specimens (0.1%), the increase is likely attributed to other factors such as the impact of changing healthcare-seeking behaviors, seasonal trends, or shifts in public compliance and reporting, as historical trends show seasonal peaks in similar periods.
