- Explanation: The increase in ILI occurrences to 1587 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the observed rise in ILI percentage during the past weeks, increasing from 1.1% (weeks 15–17) to 1.3% (week 20). Despite reports of minimal influenza activity in most jurisdictions and lower-than-usual activity likely influenced by the pandemic, the incremental weekly rise in outpatient ILI percentages and the historical trend from the time-series data, which shows ILI numbers climbing sharply from week 13 onward (e.g., 1331 in week 13 to 2164 in week 19), indicates a consistent upward trajectory. This pattern, paired with typical seasonal fluctuations and minor increases in respiratory illness activity, supports the prediction of 1587 ILI occurrences in 5 weeks.
