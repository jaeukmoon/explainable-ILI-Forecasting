The future ILI occurrence of 2575 cases five weeks ahead is predicted based on historical time-series data showing a decreasing trend in ILI cases over time combined with news surveillance indicating stable but increased seasonal influenza activity in certain regions. The past occurrences drop from a high of 4327 to 1190, alongside reports of stable outpatient ILI visits (around 2.2%-1.5%) and low positive influenza test rates (e.g., 0.5%-1.4%). However, regional variability and the dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), with ongoing antigenic differences from vaccines, suggest mild activity persistence leading to a slower decline, stabilizing ILI counts near 2575 in five weeks.
