- **Explanation:** The predicted ILI (Influenza-like Illness) occurrences of 2863 after five weeks are based on a combination of decreasing trends in ILI data from previous weeks and the stability in influenza activity reported in the CDC's surveillance. Outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses have consistently remained below the national baseline (e.g., 2.8% and 1.7% reported in recent weeks). Hospitalization rates and mortality due to ILI, although above the epidemic threshold, are still lower than pre-COVID-19 pandemic rates, indicating less severe influenza impact. Additionally, regions reporting sporadic or stable influenza activity and co-circulation of respiratory viruses support a slower or plateauing trend in ILI occurrences.
