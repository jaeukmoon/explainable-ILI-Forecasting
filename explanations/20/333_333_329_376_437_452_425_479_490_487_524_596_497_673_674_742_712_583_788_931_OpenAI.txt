Based on the time series data, ILI occurrences have steadily increased over the past 20 weeks, with particularly sharp rises in recent weeks—e.g., from 788 (week 18) to 931 (week 19). While the news reports indicate minimal influenza activity and low test positivity rates due to influenza (0.1%) nationally, factors such as seasonality and a rising trend in respiratory illnesses could explain the expected surge in ILI occurrences to 1040 by week 25. Moreover, the ongoing increase in PIC (Pneumonia, Influenza, COVID-19) deaths above the epidemic threshold supports the projection of heightened ILI cases due to compounding respiratory illnesses, regardless of influenza alone.
