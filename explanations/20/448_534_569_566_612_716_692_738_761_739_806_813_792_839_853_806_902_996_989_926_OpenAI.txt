The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1687 due to consistent increases in ILI cases observed in the time series data alongside the acknowledgment in the news about minimal current influenza activity. The time series shows steady growth from 448 to 926 over 20 weeks, and extrapolation suggests continued linear growth. While the news repeatedly highlights minimal influenza activity and below-baseline ILI rates (e.g., 1.1% of visits attributed to ILI versus a national baseline of 2.6%), historical trends in the time series indicate COVID-19 pandemic impacts and increased health-seeking behaviors may have led to the gradual rise in ILI cases projected in the next 5 weeks.
