- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, the ILI instances have been increasing after week 6 and have shown periodic spikes influenced by seasonal factors. Weekly reports emphasize low current flu activity (0.1%-0.4% tests positive in labs) but predict an increase due to the usual flu seasonality and past trends. ILI surveillance highlights activity still below the national baseline but slightly rising. The gradual increase in healthcare visits for ILI (1.1%-1.7%) mirrors this trend, justifying the projection of 2021 occurrences in 5 weeks.
