- Explanation: The predicted ILI occurrence of 630 after five weeks is based on the downward trend observed in the past time-series data, where weekly ILI cases have steadily decreased from 1,484 to 596, with no significant reversals. Additionally, the news indicates that influenza activity is sporadic and below the national baseline, with decreasing outpatient visits for respiratory illness and low hospitalization rates. This combination of historical data trends and surveillance reports supports the forecast of relatively low ILI occurrences in the near future.
