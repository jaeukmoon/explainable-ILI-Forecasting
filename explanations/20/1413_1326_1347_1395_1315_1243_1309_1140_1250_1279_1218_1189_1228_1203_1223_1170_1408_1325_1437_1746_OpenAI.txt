The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are predicted to be 1567 because past data shows a consistent fluctuation in ILI numbers, with a higher spike (1746) in the most recent week indicating upward momentum. Additionally, summarized news highlights increasing trends in influenza activity, with more Influenza A (H3N2) detections and outpatient ILI percentages nearing or surpassing regional and national baselines. The combination of the upward trajectory in the time-series data and surveillance reports of rising influenza activity provides evidence for anticipating continued increases in ILI occurrences, though at a slightly moderated level compared to the recent spike.
