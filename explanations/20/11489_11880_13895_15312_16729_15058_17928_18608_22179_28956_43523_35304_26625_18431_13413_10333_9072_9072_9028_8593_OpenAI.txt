- Explanation: The projected value of 10,778 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks is supported by the increasing trend in ILI percentages in recent weeks (steady rise from 1.8% to 2.4%, nearing the national baseline of 2.5%), coupled with widespread detection of Influenza A(H3N2) in various regions and rising hospitalization rates. Moderate ILI activity in certain jurisdictions and the report of increasing influenza-positive specimens, particularly among younger populations, highlight the growing influenza activity. Together, these factors, along with historical seasonal patterns observed in the time-series data, suggest a moderate resurgence of ILI cases in this upcoming period.
