- Explanation: The future influenza-like illness (ILI) occurrences are predicted to be 1512 based on the declining trend observed in past 20 weeks of time-series data, where ILI occurrences dropped significantly in recent weeks from a peak of 3231 to a low of 1539, reflecting seasonal decreases. Furthermore, CDC surveillance reports confirm that influenza activity has generally remained low with minimal geographic spread across most regions, outpatient visits for ILI consistently below the national baseline, and virologic data showing low percentages of specimens testing positive for influenza. These combined factors suggest a continuing downward trend leading to the predicted decrease in ILI occurrences to 1512 after five weeks.
