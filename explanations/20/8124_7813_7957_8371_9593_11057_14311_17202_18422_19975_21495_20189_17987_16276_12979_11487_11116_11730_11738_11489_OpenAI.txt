- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 15,058 can be attributed to a declining trend in recorded ILI occurrences over the past few weeks in the time series data (e.g., from a recent high of 21,495 to 11,489 in week 20). Although virologic data reports that only a minimal percentage of patient visits are due to influenza (e.g., 1.2% or lower than historical national baselines), surveillance notes that respiratory illnesses like COVID-19 and other pathogens could still influence ILI activity. Also, mortality rates due to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID remain above epidemic thresholds, creating an environment of possible variability and contributing to moderate ILI predictions above baseline yet lower than historical peaks.
