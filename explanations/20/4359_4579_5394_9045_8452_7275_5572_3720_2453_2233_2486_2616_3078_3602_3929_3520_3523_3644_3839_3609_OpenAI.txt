The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 2272 due to the downward trend in recent time-series data and a decline in influenza activity nationwide. As per the news, while influenza activity briefly increased earlier in the season, the percentage of outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses, including ILI, is now below the national baseline. Regional reports confirm sporadic activity, with hospitalization rates and mortality largely attributed to COVID-19 rather than influenza. Additionally, vaccination uptake and available antivirals may have contributed to mitigating severe cases, resulting in lower ILI occurrences.
