- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences are predicted to be 773 after 5 weeks based on the downward trend observed in the given time-series data and the recent CDC surveillance data stating that only 2.3% of patient visits were due to ILI, which is below the national baseline of 2.6%. Additionally, most states reported minimal activity, with only three regions exceeding their baselines. While the percentage of deaths due to pneumonia and influenza is high (21.0%), it is mostly attributed to COVID-19 rather than influenza, indicating decreasing flu activity levels. This combination of lower ILI patient visits and reduced geographic spread supports the projection of lower future ILI counts.
