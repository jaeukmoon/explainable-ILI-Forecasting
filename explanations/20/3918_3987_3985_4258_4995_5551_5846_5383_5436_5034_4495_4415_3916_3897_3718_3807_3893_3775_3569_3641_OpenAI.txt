- **Explanation:** The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 5546 based on consistent upward trends in the time-series data, where ILI cases increased from 3918 in week 1 to 5551 in week 6 before fluctuating slightly through week 20. From week 14 onward, news data confirmed increasing influenza activity, especially with Influenza A(H3N2) dominating, hospitalization rates rising, and respiratory illnesses above the epidemic threshold in some regions. Despite a slight stabilization in outpatient visits for respiratory illness in some reports, continued co-circulation of respiratory viruses, coupled with the regional variation in influenza activity (noted to increase in parts of the country), supports the expected upward projection to 5546 cases in week 25.
