The future ILI occurrence of 824 after 5 weeks can be explained by the combination of low seasonal influenza activity reflected in the time-series trend and the CDC-reported minimal flu activity. The time-series data already shows a steady decline in ILI occurrences, dropping from 1416 to 539 over the last 15 weeks. Furthermore, the CDC's virologic surveillance confirms that only 0.1–0.4% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza, and outpatient ILI visits remained below the baseline at 1.0–1.6% across weeks. With consistent low activity reported nationwide and no significant uptick observed in geographic or hospital data, the prediction aligns with the continuing downward trend in ILI occurrences.
