The future Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrences of 2589 after 5 weeks can be explained by observing a clear upward trend in the time-series data, where recent weeks have shown increases in ILI cases (rising from 1743 to 2067 in just four weeks). Paired with the summarized news, although the ILI activity is currently below the national baseline of 2.6%, there are ongoing variations in activity levels, and regions with moderate to high activity levels suggest potential regional surges. Moreover, the circulation of Influenza A viruses mentioned in virologic surveillance, combined with expected seasonal increases in respiratory illnesses as captured by ILINet trends, supports a projection of rising ILI occurrences, specifically reaching 2589 after 5 weeks.
