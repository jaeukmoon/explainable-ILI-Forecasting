Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to reach 15,614 due to continued influenza activity, particularly involving Influenza A(H3N2) viruses, which remain predominant and antigenically different from the vaccine reference viruses, lowering vaccine effectiveness. Hospitalization rates and mortality linked to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 persist above epidemic thresholds, reflecting increased illness severity. Outpatient ILI visits and reports of respiratory illness, while below baseline, have shown upward trends in some regions over recent weeks. This forecast aligns with patterns observed in the time-series data, where ILI cases have steadily risen in previous peaks during similar epidemiologically active periods.
