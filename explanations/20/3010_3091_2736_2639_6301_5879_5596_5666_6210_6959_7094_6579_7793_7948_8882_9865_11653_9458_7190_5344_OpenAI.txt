The future ILI occurrence of 2852 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the decreasing trend observed in past time-series data and reported surveillance. The ILI occurrences have been steadily declining over the last six reported weeks (11653, 9458, 7190, 5344), and the national surveillance indicated that while influenza viruses (predominantly Influenza A) are circulating, ILI activity is below the national baseline in most regions with minimal activity reported in 41 states. Combined with the minimal spread and reduced outpatient visits (2.3%, below baseline of 2.6%), the projection aligns with a continued decline to 2852.
