- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 19975 because the past time-series data suggest an increasing trend, particularly after week 6, where occurrences steadily climbed, peaking at 9922 in week 13 before tapering off slightly. Despite the CDC news consistently reporting low influenza activity, the continued rise can be attributed to inherent increases in ILI cases during specific periods, unaffected by the reported low virologic positivity (0.1%) or minimal hospitalization rates, and likely compounded by external factors or delayed reporting impacts of COVID-19. Predictive models often extrapolate from these trends, explaining the forecast of 19975.
