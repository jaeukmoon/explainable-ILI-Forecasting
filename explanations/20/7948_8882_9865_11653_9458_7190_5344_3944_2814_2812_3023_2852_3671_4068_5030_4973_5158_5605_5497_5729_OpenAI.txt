- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 4824 is derived from patterns in the time-series data, which show a decline in ILI cases over recent weeks (e.g., 5729 to 5497 to 5605). This decline aligns with reported news that influenza activity is stabilizing or declining in some regions, outpatient visits for respiratory illness remain below the baseline, and flu season typically begins to wane later in the season. Additionally, while hospitalization rates and mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 are still above baseline, the overall trend points to a reduction in new cases, consistent with these lower ILI projections.
