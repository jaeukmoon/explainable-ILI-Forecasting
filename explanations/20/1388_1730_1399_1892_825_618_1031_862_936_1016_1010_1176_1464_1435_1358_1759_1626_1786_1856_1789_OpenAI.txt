- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences of 1794 can be attributed to a general cyclical increase in ILI activity, as suggested by past time-series data where peaks have repeatedly occurred approximately every five weeks (e.g., 1730 -> 1892 -> 1759 -> 1856). Despite the news indicating unusually low influenza activity (e.g., 0.1% specimens testing positive and ILI visits below the baseline at 1.1%-1.3%), a gradual rise is anticipated due to seasonal trends and the historical pattern of baseline fluctuations seen in the data. This projection accounts for potential underreporting influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic while assuming a return toward typical seasonal trends.
