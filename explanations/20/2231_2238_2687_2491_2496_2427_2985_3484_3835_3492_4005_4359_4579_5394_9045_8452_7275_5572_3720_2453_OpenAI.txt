The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 3602 because the time-series data shows an increasing seasonal trend in ILI cases during prior weeks, peaking around Week 14 with 9045 cases, followed by a gradual decline. This prediction aligns with consistent influenza A(H3N2) activity from virologic surveillance, moderate ILI activity reported in certain jurisdictions, and CDC's expectation of increasing flu occurrences, as flu season typically intensifies during this timeframe despite current low levels.
