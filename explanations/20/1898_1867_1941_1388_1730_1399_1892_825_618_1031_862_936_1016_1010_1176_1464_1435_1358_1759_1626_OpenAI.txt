The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are forecasted to be 1,748 because past time-series ILI data shows a historical seasonality of fluctuating trends, with periodic increases following a dip (e.g., a rise after a low like '825' followed by '618'). The recent news indicates that ILI is below the national baseline but emphasizes that activity may increase due to lower vaccination and unpredictable COVID-19 impacts on healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance. This combination of past trends, unusually low influenza activity, and cautious CDC expectations justifies the predicted moderate increase in ILI occurrences.
