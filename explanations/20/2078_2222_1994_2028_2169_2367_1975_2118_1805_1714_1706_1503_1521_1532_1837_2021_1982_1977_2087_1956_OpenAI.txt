The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2025 because the recent ILI activity has consistently remained near or below baseline levels, as evidenced by the outpatient illness surveillance reports (1.6% of healthcare visits, below the national baseline of 2.6%) and minimal virologic surveillance detections (clinical labs report 0.2% positivity rates). Coupled with low geographic spread ("minimal activity reported across jurisdictions") and no significant increases in key severe disease indicators like hospitalizations, the steady trend of ILI counts in the past weeks (ranging from 1503 to 2367) aligns with the projection of a stable future ILI figure of 2025.
