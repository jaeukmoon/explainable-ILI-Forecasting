- Explanation: Based on the past ILI occurrences, a pattern of fluctuating ILI activity can be observed (e.g., rises from 1484 to 2367 followed by a sharp decline to 1503). The reported news indicates consistently low influenza activity and reduced positive cases in virologic surveillance (e.g., only 0.1%-0.4% testing positive for influenza and ILI visits below the 2.6% national baseline). This suggests that influenza activity has been suppressed. However, the slight increases in ILI over past weeks (e.g., an uptick to 1.6%) and seasonal trends may predict a gradual rise in activity over time, leading to an expected ILI occurrence of 1977 in five weeks.
