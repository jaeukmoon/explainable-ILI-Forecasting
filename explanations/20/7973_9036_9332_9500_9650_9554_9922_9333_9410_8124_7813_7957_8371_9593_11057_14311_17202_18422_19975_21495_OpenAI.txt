Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 11,487 due to observed increasing trends in ILI activity over the recent weeks in the time-series data, where cases steadily rose from 7,957 to 21,495, indicating a seasonal upward trajectory typical for influenza patterns. Although virologic surveillance and news reports highlight historically low influenza activity due to factors like COVID-19 mitigation and only 1.2% of healthcare visits attributed to ILI, the growing ILI trend in the time-series data reflects other circulating respiratory viruses contributing to the increase.
