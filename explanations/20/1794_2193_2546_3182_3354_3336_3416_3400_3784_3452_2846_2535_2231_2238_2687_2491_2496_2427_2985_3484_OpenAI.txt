The projected ILI occurrences of 4579 after five weeks is explained by a combination of factors. First, the time-series data shows a consistent increase in ILI cases over time, especially from week 14 onwards, indicating a rising trend. Second, the virologic surveillance confirms an increase in influenza virus circulation, predominantly Influenza A, with higher positivity rates in public health labs. Third, outpatient illness surveillance reported a gradual rise in influenza-like illness percentages in recent weeks but still below the national baseline. Geographically, sporadic and local influenza activity is observed in several states, suggesting broader spread potential. Together, these indicators from the data suggest a continued upward trajectory, resulting in the forecasted occurrence.
