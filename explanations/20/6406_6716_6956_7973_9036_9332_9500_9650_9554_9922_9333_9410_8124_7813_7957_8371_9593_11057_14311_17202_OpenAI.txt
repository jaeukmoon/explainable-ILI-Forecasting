The predicted ILI occurrence of 17,987 in 5 weeks aligns with the recent upward trend in the time-series data (e.g., the increase from 9,593 to 17,202 over the last weeks) and the CDC’s expectation that ILI activity may rise in the coming months, as indicated by slight increases in outpatient visit percentages and minimal current influenza activity. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare-seeking behaviors may be influencing the gradual increase, despite influenza activity being lower than usual for this time of year.
