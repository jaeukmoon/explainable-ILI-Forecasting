The future ILI occurrence of 15,796 after 5 weeks can be explained by the observed trends in both time-series data and surveillance reports. The ILI time-series data shows a general seasonal decline in reported cases in recent weeks, with occasional fluctuations. Combined with the CDC surveillance highlighting that influenza activity was increasing in some regions, driven by Influenza A(H3N2), outpatient respiratory visits (ILI) were either at or slightly below the national baseline, and hospitalizations showed gradual increases, it is evident that activity levels will stabilize at moderate levels. This stabilization aligns with prior weeks' midseason trends and the ongoing variation in regional activity, pointing to a continued yet moderated circulation of influenza, leading to 15,796 occurrences.
