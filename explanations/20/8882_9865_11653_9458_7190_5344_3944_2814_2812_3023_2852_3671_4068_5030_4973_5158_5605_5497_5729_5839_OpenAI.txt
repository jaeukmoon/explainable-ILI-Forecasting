- Explanation: The predicted ILI occurrence of 4618 after 5 weeks reflects trends in both recent reported data and seasonal influenza activity reports. The past time-series data show a general decline in ILI cases from 8882 to 5839 over the last 20 weeks, with fluctuations indicating active circulation of Influenza A(H3N2). Surveillance reports suggest increasing outpatient visits for respiratory illness, above baseline levels, and higher hospitalization rates compared to previous seasons. Combined with lower vaccination uptake and antigenic differences in circulating H3N2 viruses, these factors contribute to a modest recovery in ILI cases toward steady seasonal progression, aligning with the predicted count of 4618.
