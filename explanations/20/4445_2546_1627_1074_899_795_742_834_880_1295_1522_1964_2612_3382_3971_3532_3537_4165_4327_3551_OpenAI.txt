- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, the ILI occurrences have shown a steady decline over several weeks, reaching lower levels after week 8 (795 cases) and stabilizing slightly above baseline, with fluctuations afterward. The surveillance report for recent weeks highlights that influenza activity, though still sporadic, has been declining in most regions, with outpatient visits for respiratory illness below the national baseline and hospitalization rates lower than pre-COVID-19 seasons. However, the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses and varying regional activity levels contribute to steady ILI occurrences. Combining these factors while accounting for the ongoing but reduced influenza activity and stable outpatient visits, the projection for ILI occurrences after 5 weeks aligns at 1623.
