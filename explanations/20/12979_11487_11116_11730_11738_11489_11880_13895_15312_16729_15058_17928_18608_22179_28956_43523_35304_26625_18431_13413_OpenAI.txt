- Explanation: The prediction of 8593 future ILI occurrences is based on the significant decline in recent weeks of ILI incidents from the time-series data. This includes a high peak of 43523 followed by consistent drops down to 13413 in the last week, aligning with news reporting low influenza activity overall, below the national baseline with 1.4-2.8% of outpatient visits for ILI. Additionally, minimal geographic spread, no alarming severe disease indicators, and recent public health measures such as vaccination campaigns suggest a steady continuation of this declining trend over the next five weeks. Consequently, the forecasted ILI occurrences are expected to stabilize at a moderated level of 8593.
