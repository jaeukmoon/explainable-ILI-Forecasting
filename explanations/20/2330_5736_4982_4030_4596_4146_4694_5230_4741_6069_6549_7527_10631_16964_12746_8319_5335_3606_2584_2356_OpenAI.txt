- Explanation: After analyzing the past time-series ILI occurrences, the data shows a significant rise in cases during specific weeks (e.g., from '4030' in week 3 to '16964' in week 13). This pattern highlights seasonal and recurring spikes that align with the CDC’s news indicating increasing influenza activity in recent reports. Specifically, the CDC forecasts low current activity with a gradual increase in coming weeks, supported by increasing outpatient respiratory illness trends reaching near or above the baseline (e.g., 2.4%). Additionally, the virologic surveillance and the dominance of Influenza A strains (e.g., H3N2) further indicate potential increases. Combining the clear seasonal trend in the time-series data and the CDC’s projection of rising flu activity, the ILI occurrences prediction of 3115 after 5 weeks is plausible, reflecting this expected upward trend.
