Based on the evidence provided from the time-series data and summarized news, the future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2022 due to the overall trend of decreasing ILI cases in the time-series data and consistently low influenza activity reported in the surveillance news. Over the 20 weeks of observations, ILI occurrences showed a steady decline, with recent values ranging between 1517 and 1956 in the last few weeks. The news highlights minimal influenza spread across most jurisdictions, very low positive respiratory specimen percentages (0.1% to 0.4%), and ILI outpatient visits consistently below the baseline of 2.6%. Additionally, the CDC expects flu activity to remain low but gradually increase. Thus, the predicted value reflects this low activity combined with a potential slight seasonal uptick.
