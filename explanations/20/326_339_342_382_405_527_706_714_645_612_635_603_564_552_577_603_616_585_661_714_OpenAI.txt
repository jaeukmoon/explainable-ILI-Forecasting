The future Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrence of 1326 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the increasing trend in the past ILI time-series data and the indications in the news reports that while influenza activity is currently below baseline levels (e.g., only 0.1% of respiratory specimens have tested positive and minimal activity has been reported across jurisdictions), the CDC has noted that flu activity "may increase in the coming months." Moreover, the recent gradual rise in reported ILI visits in outpatient surveillance (from 0.8% to 1.3% over time) suggests a slight uptick in activity. Combined with the seasonality of influenza and expected increases, this aligns with the predicted value of 1326.
