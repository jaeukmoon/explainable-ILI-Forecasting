- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences are predicted to be 2546 due to the observed gradual increase in ILI activity in the past weeks despite overall lower-than-usual influenza activity. While virologic surveillance indicated only 0.1% positivity in clinical labs, outpatient ILI visits showed stable but low percentages (1.1% or below) compared to national baselines, suggesting a potential slow rise as normalization of healthcare-seeking behavior post-COVID-19 impacts and flu vaccination campaigns take effect. The time-series also shows increasing trends after initial low counts, indicating a likely continuation of this growth.
