- Explanation: The future ILI count of 2058 is based on the upward trend shown in the time-series data, where recent weeks have displayed a significant increase in occurrences, such as from 1474 to 2895 over a few weeks, despite temporary declines. Coupled with the news that influenza activity is increasing in various regions, outpatient respiratory illness visits are trending upward above the national baseline, and hospitalizations for influenza are also rising, the projected ILI count reflects a continued elevated or growing trend in reported cases.
