The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 16,276 due to a consistent upward trend in recent time-series data, with ILI occurrences increasing over the last five weeks from 9,593 to 18,422. Despite news describing unusually low influenza activity nationally, including only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive and ILI outpatient visits remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%, the COVID-19 impact and healthcare-seeking behavior changes could contribute to underreporting. Thus, the combination of the sharp growth patterns in historical data and cautious interpretation of news leads to predicting higher future ILI activity.
