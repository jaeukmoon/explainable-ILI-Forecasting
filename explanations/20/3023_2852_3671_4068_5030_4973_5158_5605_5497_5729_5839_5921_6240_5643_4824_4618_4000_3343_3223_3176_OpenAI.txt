The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are predicted to be 3351 due to the observed decreasing trend in past ILI occurrences, which dropped progressively from 6240 to 3176 over the last seven weeks. Although influenza A(H3N2) remains predominant, news reports indicate stable outpatient respiratory illness levels below baseline and minimal activity in most jurisdictions. Additionally, the decreasing trend in hospitalization rates and the lower percentage of positive specimens in recent virologic surveillance support this prediction of a continued decline in ILI cases.
