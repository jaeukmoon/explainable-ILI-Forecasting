The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1190 due to the continued downward trend in ILI activity observed in the time-series data where occurrences steadily decline to 1301 in the latest week, coupled with news reports indicating stable or decreasing ILI visits nationally ("ILI activity remains below baseline," "ILI activity has been trending downward," and "percentage of outpatient visits for respiratory illness decreased slightly"). Additionally, influenza activity is primarily regional with variability, and while moderate or localized increases are noted, the dominant narrative highlights low widespread activity.
