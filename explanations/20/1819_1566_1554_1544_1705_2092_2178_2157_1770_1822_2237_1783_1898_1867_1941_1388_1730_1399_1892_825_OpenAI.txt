The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is 1016 due to a consistent decrease in ILI activity reflected in the time-series data and low overall influenza activity summarized in the news reports. The time-series shows a declining pattern, with ILI occurrences dropping from 1819 to 825 over the last 20 weeks. Additionally, news reports indicate that the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza remains low (0.1-0.3%), and outpatient ILI visits are consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%. Most jurisdictions report minimal to low activity, reinforcing the expectation of relatively low ILI activity in the coming weeks.
