- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 5951 due to the upward trend in recent ILI data (e.g., increases from 5729 to 5839, then 5921) coupled with seasonal influenza activity rising in certain regions of the country and reports of a general upward trend in outpatient respiratory illness percentages since February. This trend is supported by the predominance of Influenza A(H3N2), which is associated with more severe flu seasons, and concurrent co-circulation of other respiratory viruses contributing to illness rates. The stabilization of recent outpatient ILI visits doesn't offset the broader regional variations and rising hospitalization rates due to influenza, supporting the projection of increased future ILI occurrences.
