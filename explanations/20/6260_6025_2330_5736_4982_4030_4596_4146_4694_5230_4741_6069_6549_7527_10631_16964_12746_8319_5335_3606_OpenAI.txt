The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2576 based on decreasing trends observed in past ILI time-series data (e.g., from 16964 to 3606 in the last nine weeks) and CDC surveillance reports showing low influenza activity nationwide, with outpatient visits for ILI remaining below national baselines (1.4% compared to the baseline of 2.4%) and minimal to moderate activity in most regions. These declines, alongside stabilization in influenza virus circulation and continued public health efforts such as vaccination and antiviral recommendations, support the expectation of continued reductions in ILI cases over the coming weeks.
