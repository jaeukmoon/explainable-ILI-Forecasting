The time-series data shows a steady increase in ILI occurrences from week 8 onwards, peaking at 1305 cases (week 17) and slightly declining to 975 in week 20. This trend indicates cyclical seasonal activity with potentially lingering effects. Although recent news reports emphasize historically low influenza activity due to pandemic-related factors (e.g., reduced flu transmission and altered healthcare reporting), they also acknowledge data variations by jurisdictions and the presence of sporadic moderate activity in certain areas. Further, increased healthcare-seeking behaviors post-pandemic could revive the tracking of ILI cases. These combined factors, along with typical influenza seasonality, predict a continued gradual ILI rise, leading to 1084 cases five weeks later.
