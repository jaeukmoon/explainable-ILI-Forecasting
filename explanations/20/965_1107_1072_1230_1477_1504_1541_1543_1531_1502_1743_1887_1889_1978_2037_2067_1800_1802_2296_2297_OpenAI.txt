Based on the given time-series data, the ILI occurrences have been steadily increasing with occasional fluctuations, particularly from Week 15 (2037) to Week 20 (2297). The trend suggests a continued increase, aligning with the virologic surveillance and outpatient illness data, which showed a gradual rise in Influenza A cases, while ILI activity remained below the baseline but started to rise in some regions (e.g., moderate activity in Louisiana). Additionally, the percentage of pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19-related deaths exceeding the epidemic threshold further supports the prediction of increased ILI occurrences. This confluence of data trends justifies the projection of 3,957 occurrences in the upcoming weeks.
