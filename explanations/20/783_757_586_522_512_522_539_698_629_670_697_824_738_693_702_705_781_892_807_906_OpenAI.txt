- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 1107 after 5 weeks may be due to an upward trend observed in the time-series data, where ILI numbers increased in the last reported weeks from 702 in Week 16 to 906 in Week 20. This consistent increase suggests a worsening trend in ILI activity despite the news data reporting unusually low flu activity currently. Additionally, the rise in PIC percentage (deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 being above the epidemic threshold) and seasonal fluctuations could signal an eventual higher occurrence after 5 weeks. While flu activity remains low now, historical patterns suggest a potential rise.
