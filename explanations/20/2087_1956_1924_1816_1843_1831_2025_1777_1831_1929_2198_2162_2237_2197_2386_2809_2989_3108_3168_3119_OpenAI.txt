The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 4030 due to an upward trend in the ILI time-series data over the last 10 weeks, where cases steadily increased from 2198 to 3119. Concurrently, the reduction in stringent COVID-19 measures, as inferred from the minimal ILI activity reported and the emphasis on interpreting data cautiously due to changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors, may contribute to an upcoming increase. Although influenza activity has remained low in laboratory tests, the ILI percentage of patient visits showed a slight increase during recent weeks (e.g., moving from 1.1% to 1.2%), suggesting a gradual rise in activities resembling influenza-like illness.
