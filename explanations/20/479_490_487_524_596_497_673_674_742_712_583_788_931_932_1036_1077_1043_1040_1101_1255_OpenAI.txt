- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences rising to 1124 after 5 weeks can be attributed to a combination of historical trends in the time series and a modest increase in reported ILI activity in recent weeks. The time series data shows a general upward trend in ILI occurrences, with values increasing from 931 to 1255 over the last seven weeks, which indicates a gradual escalation. Furthermore, in the CDC reports, the percentage of patient visits attributed to ILI has slightly increased from 1.1% to 1.2%, suggesting a growing activity level, albeit below the baseline. Despite the current overall low influenza activity, these small increases align with the observed data trend and anticipated seasonal effects, leading to the projected value of 1124.
