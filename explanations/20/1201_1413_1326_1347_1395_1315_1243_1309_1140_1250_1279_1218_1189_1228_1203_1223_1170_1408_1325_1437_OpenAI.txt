- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 2331 due to the increasing trend in ILI activity as seen in the previous weeks of data, where ILI counts have consistently escalated (e.g., from 1170 in Week 16 to 1437 in Week 20). Additionally, reports indicate a rise in ILI-related outpatient visits and a geographic spread of moderate-to-high ILI activity in specific regions. Virologic surveillance highlights the predominance of Influenza A (H3N2) strains and increased test positivity rates, correlated with rising respiratory illnesses. Severe disease indicators, such as higher pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 mortality exceeding the epidemic threshold, further support the expectation of future heightened ILI occurrences despite lower vaccination uptake, emphasizing increased influenza activity nationwide.
