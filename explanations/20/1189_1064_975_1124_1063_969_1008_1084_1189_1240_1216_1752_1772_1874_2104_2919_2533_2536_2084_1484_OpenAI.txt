- Explanation: After five weeks, the ILI occurrences are predicted to be 999 due to the overall decline in flu activity based on the time-series data and recent surveillance trends. The ILI count has recently decreased from a high of 2919 in week 15 to 1484 by week 20, reflecting a downward trend. News reports suggest relatively low influenza activity nationally, with outpatient visits for ILI below the national baseline of 2.4%, minimal ILI activity in most regions, and virological data indicating limited virus spread. The CDC also anticipates flu activity to remain low with preventive measures like vaccination in place, contributing to a reduced future ILI forecast of 999.
