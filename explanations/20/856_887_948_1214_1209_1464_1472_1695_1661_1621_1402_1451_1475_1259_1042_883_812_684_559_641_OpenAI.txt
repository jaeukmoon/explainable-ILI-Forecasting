- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (646) are predicted based on the seasonal decline in ILI activity observed in past time-series data and the current low influenza activity reported in CDC surveillance. Weekly ILI data shows a consistent downward trend after a peak (1695 in Week 8) to minimal levels (641 in Week 20). Reported surveillance reinforces this trend, with clinical lab positivity rates as low as 0.1-0.4%, outpatient ILI visits below the 2.6% baseline, and no significant spikes in pediatric flu deaths or hospitalizations. These facts suggest continued minimal flu activity over the next weeks.
