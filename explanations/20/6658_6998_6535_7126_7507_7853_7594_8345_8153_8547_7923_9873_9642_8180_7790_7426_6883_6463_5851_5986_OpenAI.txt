The predicted future ILI occurrence of 6,956 after five weeks is consistent with the observed seasonal and cyclical trends in the past time-series data, which show a pattern of fluctuating peaks and declines. The last five weeks of ILI occurrences showed a declining trend (7426 → 6883 → 6463 → 5851 → 5986), corroborating the low influenza activity indicated by virologic surveillance reports, with only 0.1%-0.4% of respiratory specimens testing positive, and minimal ILI activity across jurisdictions. However, considering historical data showing recurring rebounds after declines and the CDC’s expectation of increasing influenza activity in the coming weeks, it is reasonable to forecast a rise, aligning with this seasonal resurgence.
