The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are estimated at 918 because the recent time-series data shows a declining trend in ILI cases, dropping from 2919 to 948 over the past weeks, indicating a consistent reduction in activity. Supporting this, the news reports confirm that while influenza activity remains low, it has shown a slight, gradual increase and remains below the national baseline. The majority of jurisdictions report minimal activity, and only sporadic cases have been noted in long-term care facilities (0.2%). Thus, the continuing decrease in cases, combined with low current influenza activity, explains the projection of lower ILI occurrences (918) in the coming weeks.
