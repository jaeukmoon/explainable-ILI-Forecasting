The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 6865 because past time-series data reveals a consistent increasing trend, especially in weeks 12-20, where values escalate from 3144 to 4245. This indicates a pattern of peak influenza activity typical of seasonal outbreaks. Additionally, the virologic surveillance in the cited news indicates that Influenza A remains predominant with moderate spread in some regions despite overall minimal ILI activity nationally. The gradual rise in outpatient visits and mortality data above the epidemic threshold underscore a likely progression to higher ILI cases following historical trends and current data.
