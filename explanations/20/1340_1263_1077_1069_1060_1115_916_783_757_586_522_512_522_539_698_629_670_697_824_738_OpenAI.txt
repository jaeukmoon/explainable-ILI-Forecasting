- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences have shown a declining trend, dropping significantly from 1340 to 738 over the past 20 weeks, which aligns with the news reports of unusually low influenza activity, with minimal geographic spread and ILI levels consistently below the baseline (e.g., 1.6% compared to a 2.6% baseline). However, considering CDC's expectation of flu activity increasing in the coming months and public health labs detecting influenza positivity rates reaching up to 0.4%, alongside recommendations for vaccination and antiviral treatments, a moderate rebound in ILI activity (e.g., up to 892) in future weeks is plausible as seasonal trends gradually shift.
