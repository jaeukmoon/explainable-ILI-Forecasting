- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to reach 3554 based on the recent uptick in ILI counts within the time-series data, as seen in the steady rise from 2237 (week 7) to 4267 (week 20). The increase corresponds with seasonal trends despite overall low influenza activity reported in the news, which notes that most areas report minimal inﬂuenza spread, with only 1.2% of visits being attributed to ILI. The cautionary mention of COVID-19 affecting ILI reporting suggests a shift in healthcare behavior but doesn’t fully suppress the observable seasonal growth. This aligns with the trajectory seen in prior weeks, where minor influenza activity persisted.
