- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 596 after 5 weeks can be attributed to a small upward adjustment consistent with historical fluctuations (e.g., periodic rises to over 550 seen in the time series) and CDC's expectation that influenza activity, while currently low, may increase in the coming weeks. Recent reports highlighted minimal ILI activity (e.g., 1.6% below the 2.6% baseline) and unusually low positivity rates in virologic surveillance (e.g., 0.1%). However, vaccine recommendations and potential seasonality effects suggest plausible gradual increases. The COVID-19 pandemic's influence on healthcare behaviors and surveillance was also emphasized, warranting cautious interpretation.
