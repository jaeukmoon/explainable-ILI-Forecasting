- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences have demonstrated a consistent decline over the past 20 weeks, from 620 to 317, with only a few minor fluctuations. This sustained downward trend aligns with the news that seasonal influenza activity remains consistently low across all jurisdictions, supported by virologic surveillance reporting minimal influenza positivity (ranging from 0.1% to 0.4%) and outpatient illness surveillance indicating consistently below-baseline ILI activity (1.1%–1.7%). This combination of low laboratory positivity, minimal ILI activity, and geographically limited influenza spread supports a continued reduction in cases, leading to predicted ILI occurrences of 329 five weeks into the future, following the ongoing trend.
