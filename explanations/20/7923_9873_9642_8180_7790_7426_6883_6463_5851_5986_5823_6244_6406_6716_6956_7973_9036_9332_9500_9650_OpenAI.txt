The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 8,124 due to the upward trend indicated by the time-series data and low but gradually increasing influenza activity in the news. The time series shows a consistent rise in ILI occurrences over recent weeks (e.g., 6,883 → 7,973 → 9,650), pointing toward a recovery from previously suppressed activity. While the news highlights unusually low influenza activity this season (e.g., only 0.1-0.4% of specimens testing positive and ILI activity below the 2.6% baseline), it also suggests potential increases in the coming months due to reduced immunity, delayed effects of seasonality, and easing of pandemic-driven mitigations. This convergence informs the projected return to a moderate activity level of 8,124.
