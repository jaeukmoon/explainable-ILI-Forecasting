Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2032 based on trends in both time-series data and news reports. From the time-series data, an upward trend is observed with recent ILI values consistently increasing (e.g., 1539 → 1971 → 2605 → 3203). Although influenza activity remains low nationwide, news reports highlight a gradual increase in indicators such as respiratory illness visits rising above the baseline (e.g., 2.7% reported in recent updates) and Influenza A (H3N2) becoming the predominant strain. Additionally, reports of increasing ILI activity in some regions, rising outpatient visits, and nearing peak season trends align with this continued increase in ILI occurrences.
