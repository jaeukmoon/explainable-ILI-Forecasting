The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are predicted to be 1482 because the historical time-series demonstrates a consistent decline in ILI cases over the last 20 weeks (from 2148 to 949), reflecting a sustained downward trend. This trend aligns with the summarized news, which reports minimal influenza activity nationally: virologic surveillance detects only 0.1%-0.3% positivity in respiratory specimens, ILI patient visits remain below the national baseline at 1.0%-1.6%, and most jurisdictions report low to minimal activity. Consequently, continued low activity and declining trends support forecasting 1482 cases five weeks ahead as influenza season indicators remain subdued.
