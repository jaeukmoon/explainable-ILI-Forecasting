- Explanation: Based on the time series data, ILI occurrences have shown an upward trend in recent weeks, increasing from 824 in week 5 to 1230 in week 20. Combined with summarized news reports indicating slight week-to-week increases in outpatient ILI surveillance (e.g., rising from 0.9% to 1.3% of healthcare visits), it suggests growing influenza transmission. This rise aligns with historical flu trends where activity picks up later in the season. Furthermore, health agency cautions regarding potential underreporting due to the COVID-19 pandemic imply the reported data could lag behind actual transmission levels. Given these conditions, the prediction of 1531 occurrences in five weeks aligns with the observed upward momentum.
