The future ILI occurrence of 1038 after 5 weeks can be attributed to recent declining influenza activity, as supported by both the time-series data and surveillance reports. The ILI trend shows a peak at 2919 during Week 13, followed by a steady decrease to 888 in Week 20, which signifies a reducing trend. Surveillance reports corroborate this decline, with outpatient visits for ILI below the national baseline and sporadic influenza activity continuing in most regions. Additionally, no significant increases in severe disease indicators, such as hospitalization rates or pediatric deaths, were reported. Consequently, based on the observed downtrend and stable virologic data, the projected ILI value of 1038 aligns with this pattern of continued low but slightly increasing activity over five weeks.
