- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 813 due to a recent pattern of increasing ILI cases in the time-series data, including notable weekly rises (e.g., from 566 to 612, and then to 716), possibly indicating an upward trend in illness spread. While reported influenza activity remains “lower than usual,” the CDC cautions that low baseline ILI surveillance may reflect disruptions from COVID-19 rather than stable levels. Furthermore, both virologic surveillance and hospitalization metrics suggest that influenza activity is poised to escalate in the coming months, aligning with historical patterns of seasonal increases.
