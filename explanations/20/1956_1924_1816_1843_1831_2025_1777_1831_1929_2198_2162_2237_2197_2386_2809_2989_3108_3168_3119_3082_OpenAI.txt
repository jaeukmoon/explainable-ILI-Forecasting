The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks increasing to 4267 can be attributed to the gradual but consistent uptick in ILI activity as observed in the time-series data, where occurrences rose significantly from 2809 in week 15 to 3082 by week 20. Despite the reported unusually low overall influenza activity during recent weeks in surveillance reports, factors such as the slight increasing trend in outpatient visits for ILI—from 1.1% in week 15 to 1.3% in week 20—paired with the easing pandemic-related precautions impacting health behaviors might contribute to this rise. Additionally, minimal ILI activity in all jurisdictions still allows room for localized increases, potentially leading to the forecasted value.
