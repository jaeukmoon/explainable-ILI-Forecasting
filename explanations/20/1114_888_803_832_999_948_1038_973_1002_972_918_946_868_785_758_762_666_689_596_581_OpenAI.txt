- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 629 due to a sustained downward trend in ILI activity shown in the past time-series data, where values decreased steadily from 1114 to 581 over 20 weeks. Epidemiological and virologic surveillance indicates that nationwide ILI activity remains below the national baseline, with geographic variability and co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses. Moreover, decreasing hospitalization rates from 16.7 to 15.5 per 100,000 and reduced positive influenza tests reflect declining disease severity and spread, consistent with the prediction of 629 occurrences.
