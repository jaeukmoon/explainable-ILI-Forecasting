- Explanation: The time-series ILI data suggests a cyclic trend where cases initially decrease before rising again (e.g., 1401 to 2654 between weeks 7 and 15). The latest news reports indicate that influenza A(H3N2) remains the predominant virus, with sporadic increases in influenza activity and outpatient respiratory illness visits stabilizing but staying above baseline in some regions. Additionally, hospitalization rates for influenza (e.g., 4.5 per 100,000) reflect a continued impact of the virus. These patterns, combined with stable regional ILI activity and characteristic seasonal trends, explain why future ILI occurrences are expected to reach 2654 after five weeks.
