Based on the given time-series ILI data, the weekly occurrence decreased steadily after week 14, with week 19 showing 2909 cases. Historical trends suggest such declining patterns tend to level out after 5-6 weeks, aligning with seasonal influenza dynamics. From the news and surveillance reports, regional variations in ILI activity were noted, with some areas showing decreasing activity and outpatient visits for ILI trending below baseline nationally. Combined with the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses and stable ILI percentages, the future ILI occurrence of 2162 after 5 weeks reflects this continued decline and stabilization.
