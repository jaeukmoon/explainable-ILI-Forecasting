- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, there has been a sharp decline in ILI occurrences from week 16 (10,631) to week 20 (5,335), reflecting an overall decreasing trend in ILI activity. The virologic surveillance indicates that influenza activity remains low in the reported weeks, with only 2.3% of specimens testing positive and 2.3% of patient visits categorized as ILI in week 36, below the baseline of 2.6%. Additionally, most regions reported minimal ILI activity, suggesting a limited spread of the virus. Considering these factors and the pattern of declining cases from recent weeks, the projected ILI occurrence of 2,196 in 5 weeks aligns with the ongoing downward trend in ILI activity.
