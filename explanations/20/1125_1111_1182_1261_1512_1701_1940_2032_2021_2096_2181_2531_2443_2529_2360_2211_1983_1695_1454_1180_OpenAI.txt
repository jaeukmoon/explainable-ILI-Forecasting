- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 846 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the observed downward trend in the time-series data, where ILI cases have steadily decreased over the past several weeks (from 2531 in week 11 to 1180 in week 20). Additionally, surveillance data indicates that while influenza activity remains sporadic in regions, overall outpatient visits for respiratory illness are below baseline, and no significant surges in influenza activity have been reported. These factors, along with decreasing hospitalization rates and no alarming shifts in virologic or antigenic patterns, suggest a continued decline in ILI occurrences.
