Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 1376 because the time-series data indicates a cyclic trend where ILI figures rise after a drop (e.g., from 914 to 1598 within 7 weeks). Given this cyclic pattern, ILI occurrences are expected to rebound from the recent drop in week 20 (1383). Additionally, despite minimal influenza activity as reported in the news, outpatient illness surveillance shows a steady increase in ILI percentages (e.g., from 1.1% to 1.3% of health visits), suggesting a gradual rise. These factors together predict a future ILI occurrence of 1376.
