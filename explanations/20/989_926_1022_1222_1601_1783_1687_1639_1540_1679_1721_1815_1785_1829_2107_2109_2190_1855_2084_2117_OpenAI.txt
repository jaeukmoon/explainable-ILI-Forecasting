The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are predicted to be 2605 based on the increasing trend observed in the time-series data, where ILI occurrences rose consistently from a low of 989 to recent values exceeding 2000. Notably, the data reflects cases climbing significantly over time, particularly between weeks 14–20, converging to higher values like 2107, 2109, and 2117. Combined with the news reports indicating increasing influenza activity in certain jurisdictions (e.g., moderate activity in Louisiana), rising outpatient visits reaching close to or above the baseline, and an emphasis on Influenza A (H3N2) being the predominant strain, these patterns and risks suggest a further increase in ILI occurrences due to regional trends and virus distribution.
