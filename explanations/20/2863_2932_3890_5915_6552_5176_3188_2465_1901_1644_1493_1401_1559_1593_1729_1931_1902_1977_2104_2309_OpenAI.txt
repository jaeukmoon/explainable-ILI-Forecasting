- Explanation: Based on past time-series data, there was a consistent trend of increasing ILI occurrences leading into peak periods, with a notable increase in activity from weeks 3 to 5 of higher cases (3890 to 5915 and then peaking at 6552). The summarized news supports this increase with evidence of rising influenza A(H3N2) activity, hospitalization rates, elevated outpatient visits above baseline, and higher mortality rates due to influenza or related illnesses. Although vaccination uptake was below previous seasons, the presence of antiviral drugs helps mitigate severe outcomes but does not greatly curb spread. Given these trends and seasonal patterns, a subsequent stabilization after a peak is typical, leading to a predicted occurrence of 3593 after 5 weeks.
