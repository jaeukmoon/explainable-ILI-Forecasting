- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 1800 after 5 weeks is supported by the steady increase in ILI occurrences observed in the time-series data (e.g., a consistent rise from 705 to 1887 over the last 20 weeks) and the news reporting a slight increase in ILI percentages (1.2%, below the national baseline, but increasing compared to previous weeks). While influenza activity is currently low, historical trends and the upward trajectory suggest this increase to 1800 is likely due to seasonal patterns and slight upticks in outpatient ILI visits.
