The predicted ILI occurrence of 2639 after 5 weeks can be attributed to a consistent increase in ILI occurrences in the past 20 weeks, such as the upward trend from Week 15 (1659 cases) to Week 20 (3178 cases). While virologic surveillance reports that influenza activity remains below national baselines (e.g., only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza and 1.2% of patient visits attributed to ILI in recent weeks), the rise in occurrences may reflect external factors such as increased health care-seeking behaviors or other respiratory virus activity caused by easing COVID-19 restrictions. Additionally, minimal pediatric deaths and low hospitalization rates support that future rises are attributed to transitioning health behaviors rather than severe influenza outbreaks.
