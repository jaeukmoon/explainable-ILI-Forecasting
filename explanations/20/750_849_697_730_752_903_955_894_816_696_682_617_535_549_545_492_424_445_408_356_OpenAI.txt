- Explanation: The time-series data show a consistent decline in ILI occurrences over the past 20 weeks, from 750 to 356, with no significant upward spikes, indicating a downward trend. Additionally, the news reports consistently describe low influenza activity, as evidenced by 0.1–0.3% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza and outpatient visits for ILI remaining well below the 2.6% national baseline (e.g., 1.1%-1.6%). These factors, combined with minimal geographic spread and low hospitalization rates, suggest a prolonged period of low flu activity, supporting the forecasted future value of 342 ILI occurrences in five weeks.
