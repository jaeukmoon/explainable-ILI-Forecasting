- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are predicted to be 3768 due to a consistent upward trend in past ILI time-series data during periods of increased activity, as observed from weeks 13 through 15. Weekly influenza activity reports confirmed increased ILI outpatient visits and steady growth in hospitalization rates (e.g., cumulative rates rising from 8.0 to 16.7 per 100,000 population). Furthermore, Influenza A(H3N2) continued to dominate with regional variations contributing to increased respiratory illness. These factors, coupled with steady upward trends seen in the time series most recently, support the projection of higher ILI occurrences.
