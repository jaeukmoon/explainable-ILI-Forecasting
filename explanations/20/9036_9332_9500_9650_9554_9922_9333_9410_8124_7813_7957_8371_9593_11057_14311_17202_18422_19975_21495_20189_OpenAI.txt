- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences show a general upward trend, especially after week 13, which culminates in a peak at week 19 (21495 cases). However, the summarized news indicates unusually low influenza activity below the seasonal baseline levels, influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight rise in ILI occurrences over multiple weeks (e.g., week 18's 1.2% patient visits for ILI) suggests that other non-influenza respiratory viruses likely contributed to the increase. Considering the historical upward trajectory and the leveling off of ILI activity in the news, future ILI occurrences after five weeks stabilize at 11116, reflecting a decrease from the peak amidst continued low influenza virus circulation.
