The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to reach 4661 due to the apparent upward trend in past ILI occurrences in the time-series data, which increased steadily from 1517 to 2663 over 20 weeks. This rise suggests a continuation of this trend into the future. Additionally, while news reports indicate currently low influenza activity and minimal ILI cases nationally, they also caution about a potential increase in flu activity in the coming months, aligning with the observed rise in the ILI occurrences.
