The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 1063 because the historical time-series data shows a consistent rising trend in ILI cases, starting from 490 in Week 1 and peaking at 1305 in Week 20, with fluctuations. Specifically, the past 5 weeks (Weeks 16-20) depict an increasing progression (1040, 1101, 1255, 1305), reflecting sustained elevated activity despite slight dips earlier. The news surveillance reports minimal ILI activity and low percentages of influenza-positive tests (e.g., 1.2–1.3% of patient visits for ILI, below the 2.6% baseline, and 0.1% of specimens testing positive). This suggests the ILI increase is driven by non-influenza-related factors like other respiratory illnesses or healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to COVID-19, maintaining ILI occurrences around levels observed in recent weeks, reaching 1063 after factoring in seasonal and behavioral patterns.
