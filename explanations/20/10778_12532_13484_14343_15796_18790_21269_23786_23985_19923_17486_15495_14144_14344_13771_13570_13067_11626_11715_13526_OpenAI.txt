- **Explanation**: Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences showed a rising trend during influenza season except for a temporary dip in weeks 10-13. From week 14 onward, outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses increased steadily, and hospitalizations due to influenza continued rising, as referenced in the CDC surveillance reports. Additionally, influenza A(H3N2)—a more severe subtype—was the predominant strain with some antigenic differences from vaccine reference viruses. Co-circulating respiratory viruses also contributed further to the upward trend of ILI occurrences. Thus, the combination of increasing regional influenza activity, suboptimal vaccine match, and elevated hospitalization and mortality rates supports predicting 16,932 ILI occurrences in five weeks.
