- Explanation: From the time-series data, there is a consistent increase in ILI occurrences, peaking at 788 in Week 20, suggesting an upward trend. The CDC reports note minimal influenza activity, but an increase in pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19-related deaths (above the epidemic threshold), which aligns with a continued rise in ILI trends. Combined with seasonal flu expectations and the low hospitalization rates, the slow ramp-up in activity suggests that after 5 more weeks, ILI occurrences reach 1043, consistent with past trends.
