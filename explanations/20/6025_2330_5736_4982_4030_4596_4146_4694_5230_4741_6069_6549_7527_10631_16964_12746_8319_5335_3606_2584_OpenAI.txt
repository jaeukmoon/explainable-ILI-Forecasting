The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks reaching 2881 can be attributed to the recent decreasing trend in influenza activity observed in the past time-series data and surveillance insights from the reports. The ILI counts in the time-series data have shown a consistent decline in recent weeks, from 8319 to 5335, 3606, and 2584, demonstrating diminishing activity. Additionally, key surveillance insights indicate that overall influenza activity remains low, with outpatient visits for ILI below the national baseline (e.g., 1.7%-1.9%), minimal geographic spread, and low severe disease indicators such as hospitalization rates and pediatric deaths. This aligns with CDC’s expectation of continued low influenza activity with a gradual resurgence, contributing to the predicted level of 2881 in 5 weeks.
