The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 9,028 based on declining trends in the recent time-series data (from 43,523 to 18,431 over the last 5 weeks), suggesting a continual decrease in ILI cases. Additionally, the summarized news reports indicate minimal ILI activity in most regions with only a few specific areas reporting above-baseline levels (Regions 3, 7, and 9). Virologic surveillance also shows that only 2.3% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza, implying limited virus circulation. Combined, these factors align with a significant reduction in ILI occurrences, leading to the projected value of 9,028.
