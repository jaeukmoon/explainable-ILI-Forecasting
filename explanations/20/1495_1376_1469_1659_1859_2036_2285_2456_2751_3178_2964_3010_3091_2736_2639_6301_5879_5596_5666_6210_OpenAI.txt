The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks reaching 7948 can be attributed to the sharp increase in ILI occurrences over the past observations, including a surge from 2639 to 6301 in week 15 and a consistently high trajectory in subsequent weeks (e.g., 6210 in week 20). The news highlights that while ILI rates were recently below national baselines, the mortality threshold for pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 exceeded the epidemic threshold (e.g., 6.2% of deaths in one week). Combined with observed severe respiratory disease indicators and data on the predominance of influenza A viruses, it signals a seasonal escalation trend, supporting this prediction.
