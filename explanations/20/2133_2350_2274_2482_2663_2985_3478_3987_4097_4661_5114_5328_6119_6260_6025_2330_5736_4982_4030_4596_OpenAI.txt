- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 6069 because past time-series data shows a consistent increasing trend in ILI occurrences between Week 1 and Week 14 (e.g., it rose from 2133 in Week 1 to 6119 in Week 13). Although there was a subsequent dip around Week 15, the recovery to 5736 in Week 17 and the similar periodic resurgence patterns observed suggest another increase is likely. Additionally, the news data supports a low but slightly increasing influenza activity trend, with minimal activity in most jurisdictions yet growing positivity in specimens. Combining these data trends indicates a resurgence potential for the week predicted, aligning with the projection of 6069.
