The predicted ILI occurrences after five weeks being 2021 can be attributed to the declining trend in ILI occurrences in the time-series data (from a peak of 3231 in Week 10 down to 1261 by Week 20) and key news updates indicating low seasonal influenza activity with increasing virologic detections, outpatient visits below the national baseline, and sporadic activity across regions. While an increase in influenza A(H3N2) detections and outpatient visits was reported, overall low influenza activity suggests that the ILI prevalence in five weeks likely stabilizes near the decreasing trend captured in past data and aligns with updated national baselines.
