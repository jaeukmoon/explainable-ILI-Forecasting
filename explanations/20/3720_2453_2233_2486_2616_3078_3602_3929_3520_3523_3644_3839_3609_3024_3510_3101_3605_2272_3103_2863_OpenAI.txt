- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, the ILI occurrences have been decreasing steadily in recent weeks, and the latest surveillance report highlights that influenza activity is sporadic and below baseline levels nationally. Virologic surveillance shows reduced positivity for influenza tests, with 0.4% of long-term care facilities reporting positive tests among residents. Additionally, no significant increases in outpatient visits due to respiratory illness have been observed, with levels remaining below baseline. A decreasing trend in ILI activity over the past four weeks aligns with the time series pattern, predicting ILI occurrences to stabilize at 2712 after five weeks.
