The future Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrences after five weeks reaching 2,863 can be reasoned as the continuation of increasing trends observed in past time-series data (notable increases, e.g., 1587 to 2438 in weeks 15–16, and consistent higher levels exceeding 2,000 post-week 16). This aligns with the surveillance report, which noted rising positivity rates for Influenza A viruses and a concurrent increase in outpatient ILI visits, though still below baseline levels. Furthermore, moderate regional activity observed in specific states suggests localized spread amplifying ILI cases. While vaccination efforts and antiviral measures are promoted, the persistence of Influenza A circulation and regional activity indicates the likelihood of ILI upticks over subsequent weeks.
