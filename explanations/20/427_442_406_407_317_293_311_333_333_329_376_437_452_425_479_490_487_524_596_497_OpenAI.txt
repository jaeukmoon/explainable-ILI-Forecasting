The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is predicted to be 583, aligning with the time-series data trend of increasing activity, especially from week 16 (479) to week 19 (596). The news indicates that ILI activity remains below baseline (1.1%) but notes potential increases in flu activity in the coming months, influenced by seasonal patterns and pandemic dynamics. Additionally, the geographic spread of minimal ILI activity and historically lower hospitalization/case rates signify a gradual uptick in cases, supporting the estimate of 583 while acknowledging ongoing variations in reporting and surveillance impacts.
