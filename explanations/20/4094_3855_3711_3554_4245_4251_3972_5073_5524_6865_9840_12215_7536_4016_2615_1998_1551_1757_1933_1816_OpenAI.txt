- Explanation: Based on the times-series data and news summaries, influenza-like illness (ILI) occurrences five weeks after the last data point (1816) are projected to be 3793 due to the observed trend of increasing ILI activity in recent weeks, despite overall low seasonal influenza activity. Specifically, reports indicate rising outpatient visits for ILI (reaching or nearing the national baseline) and increasing laboratory-confirmed influenza detections, particularly Influenza A(H3N2). Hospitalization rates and deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 also show a gradual rise. These factors, combined with similar past seasonal dynamics in which ILI activity rises following a prior low period, support the projected occurrence of 3793 cases.
