- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, there has been a significant declining trend in ILI occurrences in the past 10 weeks (e.g., from 6147 to 742 in week 20). However, the surveillance reports indicate that influenza activity, while remaining relatively low in recent weeks, is beginning to show an upward trend, with increasing detections of Influenza A (H3N2) and outpatient ILI visits slowly approaching the national baseline in some regions. This evidence suggests a resurgence in ILI activity, leading to the projection of an increase in occurrences to 1964 after 5 weeks.
