The predicted future ILI occurrences of 4596 after 5 weeks are based on the observed increasing trend in the time-series data, where ILI occurrences rose steadily from 1867 to 6025 over 20 weeks. This aligns with seasonal trends described in the summarized news, indicating slight increases in outpatient ILI surveillance percentages compared to previous weeks and consistent flu spread across jurisdictions. Despite influenza activity being described as “low,” the steady rise in ILI occurrences suggests that external factors such as the ongoing circulation of respiratory illnesses might be driving gradual increases.
