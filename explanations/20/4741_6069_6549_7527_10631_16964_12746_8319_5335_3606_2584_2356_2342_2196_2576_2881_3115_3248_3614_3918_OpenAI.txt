The projected future ILI occurrence of 5551 after five weeks can be attributed to the observed trends in both the time-series data and the summarized news. In the time-series data, ILI cases initially spiked (e.g., reaching peaks like 16,964) but later showed a decreasing trend, stabilizing in recent weeks (e.g., 3918 in Week 20). From the news reports, while influenza activity has been rising in some regions (e.g., moderate or high activity in specific areas), overall national activity and outpatient visits for ILI remain close to or below the baseline. Hospitalizations are increasing steadily, but the relative contribution of ILI is stabilizing. Together, these factors suggest a limited but steady increase in ILI activity, aligning with a moderate rise to 5551 ILI cases in five weeks.
