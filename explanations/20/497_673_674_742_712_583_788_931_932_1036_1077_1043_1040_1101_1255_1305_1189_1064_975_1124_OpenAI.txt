Based on the time-series data, the ILI occurrences show a seasonal increase during the weeks leading to the current value of 1189, similar to previous patterns (e.g., steady rise from 583 to 1305 in prior weeks). The news emphasizes that ILI activity varies regionally, with some areas experiencing higher activity due to increased Influenza A circulation. Additionally, the CDC surveillance reports suggest that higher hospitalization rates and P&I mortality (7.6% of deaths surpassing the epidemic threshold) align with the observed trend of rising ILI occurrences. This data supports the projected future occurrence of 1189 after five weeks based on these ongoing trends and regional increases.
