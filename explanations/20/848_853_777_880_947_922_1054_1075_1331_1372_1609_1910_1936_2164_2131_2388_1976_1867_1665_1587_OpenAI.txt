The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2525 based on the increasing trend observed in the past time-series data, where ILI levels rose significantly in recent weeks (e.g., 1587 → 1665 → 1867 → 1976 → 2388). This upward trajectory aligns with the conclusion that some areas in the news experienced variations in ILI activity, including localized high activity, despite the general trend of minimal influenza activity nationwide. The cautious interpretation of ILI data due to the COVID-19 pandemic also suggests that factors like evolving healthcare-seeking behaviors might influence reporting, thereby contributing to increased estimates.
