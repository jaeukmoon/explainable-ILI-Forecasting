The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 1576 due to an observed gradual increase following the overall trend in the time-series, where recent values exhibit a sharp rise from 1209 to 1558 over the last few weeks. Despite current reports of unusually low flu activity—evidenced by a low percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive (0.1%-0.4%) and ILI percentages well below the national baseline of 2.6%—there is a persistent caution in the news that flu activity may increase in the coming months, supported by the historical time-series pattern of rising cases during this season, likely indicating delayed seasonal upticks compounded by increased testing efforts.
