- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 1395 due to the observed increasing trend in the time-series data that shows a rapid rise in occurrences over the past weeks (from 661 to 869 to 1025 in the last three weeks). This suggests a consistent growth pattern. Additionally, the news supports the potential rise by mentioning that while influenza activity remains lower than usual, there has been a slight increase in ILI-related outpatient visits (rising to 1.2% compared to earlier weeks) and CDC expects flu activity to increase in the coming months, likely due to seasonal factors and changes in healthcare behaviors influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic.
