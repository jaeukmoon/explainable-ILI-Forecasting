The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 806 due to a recent upward trend in ILI occurrences in the time-series data (rising from 466 in week 12 to 716 in week 20) and the CDC’s cautionary note that flu activity, which has been lower than usual, may increase in the coming months. This prediction aligns with historical trends and the expectation that influenza activity rises during the colder months despite currently low ILI activity and virologic indicators (e.g., below-baseline ILI percentages of approximately 1.6–1.7% reported in the news).
