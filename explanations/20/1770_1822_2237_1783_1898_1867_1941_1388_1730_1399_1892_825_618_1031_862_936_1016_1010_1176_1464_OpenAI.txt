- Explanation: The prediction of future ILI occurrences of 1786 after five weeks is based on the observed fluctuation in past ILI occurrences and the combination of current surveillance data from the news. Past data show recurring spikes in ILI cases, such as 2237 in week 3 and 1892 in week 11, followed by drops, indicating cyclical patterns. Despite current low influenza activity (e.g., only 0.1% positivity in labs and ILI visits below the 2.6% baseline), the CDC warns of a potential increase due to cyclicality and seasonal trends. This supports the expectation that ILI activity will gradually rise in the coming weeks, resulting in 1786 cases after five weeks.
