The projected future ILI occurrence of 1968 after 5 weeks stems from observed trends in the time-series data and reports of low influenza activity. Past ILI occurrences show a general decline from Week 10 (3209) to Week 20 (1673) in alignment with surveillance data indicating minimal flu activity. Reports consistently highlight that ILI rates remain below the 2.6% baseline, geographic spread is limited with most regions at minimal activity levels, and no significant severe disease trends have been observed. The repeated emphasis on unusually low seasonal flu levels supports the prediction of continued low ILI occurrences over the coming weeks, stabilizing around historical seasonal patterns such as 1968.
