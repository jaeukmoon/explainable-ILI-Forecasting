The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is projected to be 807 primarily because there is a gradual upward trend in ILI activity (from 522 to 824 in weeks 10 to 18 within the time series), indicating increasing influenza activity over time. Additionally, the summarized news stated that while current influenza activity remained lower than usual, the CDC expected flu activity to increase in the coming weeks, aligning with the observed trend in data. Thus, despite currently minimal activity, projections reflect this expected growth in ILI activity based on historical patterns and CDC forecasts.
