- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences reaching 697 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the established declining trend in the time-series data, where ILI occurrences decreased consistently over the past weeks (e.g., from 1017 to 522). Furthermore, CDC reports highlight consistently low influenza activity, such as minimal geographic ILI activity, 0.1%-0.4% positivity rates for respiratory specimens, and ILI percentages below the 2.6% national baseline. These patterns indicate continued low influenza activity and predict that occurrences remain relatively low yet moderately rebound due to normal seasonal progression.
