- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 2824 based on observed trends in the time-series data and surveillance reports. The time-series showcases a gradual seasonal decline in ILI cases, with recent values stabilizing around 1401–3625 due to lower baseline outpatient ILI visits (as mentioned in multiple reports). Although influenza A(H3N2) remains the dominant strain, overall influenza activity has declined or stabilized in several regions, and outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses remain below or near the national baseline. Additionally, surveillance indicates other respiratory viruses are co-circulating, mitigating the dominant impact of influenza. This combination of trends supports the projection of moderate ILI occurrences in 5 weeks.
