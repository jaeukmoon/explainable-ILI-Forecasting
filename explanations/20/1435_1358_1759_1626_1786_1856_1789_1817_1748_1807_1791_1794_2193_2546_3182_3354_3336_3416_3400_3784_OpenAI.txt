Given the provided ILI occurrences time-series and summarized news, the value of 2238 ILI occurrences in 5 weeks corresponds to a potential decline from the peak observed in recent weeks (e.g., Week 19 with 3784 cases), driven by the continued lower-than-usual seasonal influenza activity attributed to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as reported consistently across surveillance reports. Key factors include minimal virologic activity (0.1% of specimens testing positive), ILI visits remaining below the national baseline (around 1.2%-1.3%), minimal ILI geographic activity in most regions, and no significant increases in influenza-associated hospitalizations or pediatric deaths. These trends suggest a stabilization of ILI occurrences at a moderate level after the previously higher peak and align with the reported subdued influenza season.
