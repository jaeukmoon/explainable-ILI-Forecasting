The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are expected to be 4,359 due to an observed trend in the time-series data indicating an increase after a low in week 19 (2,427) and an uptick to week 20 (2,985). Historical peaks in the data (e.g., 3,784) suggest a pattern of cyclical rises and falls, and with cyclical patterns and increases in virologic surveillance percentages (e.g., increasing Influenza A cases and rising ILI percentages below baseline), combined with the geographical spread having “local activity” in some states and an 6.2% P&I mortality rate above the epidemic threshold, align with expected gradual increases in ILI activity.
