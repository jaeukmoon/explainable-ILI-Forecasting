- Explanation: The prediction of ILI occurrences increasing to 11057 after 5 weeks is likely based on past time-series data showing a steady rise from week 10 (7973 cases) to week 15 (9650 cases) before a slight decline. The time-series trend suggests a future rebound, and the news reports note that while flu activity is currently below normal, it may rise in the coming months due to seasonality and the impact of preventive measures waning. Hence, the predicted increase aligns with historical patterns and anticipation of an uptick in ILI activity based on seasonality.
