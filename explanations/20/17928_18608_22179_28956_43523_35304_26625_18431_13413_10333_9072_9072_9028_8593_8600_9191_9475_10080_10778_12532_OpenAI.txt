The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 21,269 based on a combination of the time-series data and current trends highlighted in the news. The past time series shows a sharp increase in ILI cases followed by a decline, with recent weeks indicating stabilization and slight increases. News evidence indicates rising influenza activity nationwide, with outpatient ILI surveillance exceeding the national baseline, an increase in hospitalizations for influenza, and Influenza A(H3N2) as the predominant virus. Continued transmission, coupled with regional variations and moderate to high ILI activity in some areas, supports the expectation of future increases in ILI cases consistent with the predicted value.
