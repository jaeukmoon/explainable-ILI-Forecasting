The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2546 due to the increasing trend in ILI cases observed in the time-series data, particularly the spike from 2296 to 4004 in recent weeks, indicating a pattern of ongoing rise. Furthermore, the news reports state that influenza activity is still low but increasing, with Influenza A (H3N2) as the predominant strain and outpatient visits for ILI trending upward, nearing the national baseline of 2.4%. Combined with moderate ILI activity in some jurisdictions and ongoing public health monitoring, these factors support the anticipated ILI count of 2546 in 5 weeks.
