The future ILI occurrences of 2460 after 5 weeks are predicted based on a combination of declining seasonal influenza activity, stabilization of outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses (below baseline), and regional variations in influenza spread. The past ILI time-series shows a downward trend after a peak at week 10 (3839) followed by a consistent decline to week 20 (2891). Based on virological surveillance, Influenza A(H3N2), the predominant strain, remains antigenically different from vaccines, leading to regional persistence. However, decreased hospitalization rates and lower positive percentage of specimens for influenza indicate a tapering trend nationally. These factors collectively predict a continued decline to 2460 in 5 weeks.
