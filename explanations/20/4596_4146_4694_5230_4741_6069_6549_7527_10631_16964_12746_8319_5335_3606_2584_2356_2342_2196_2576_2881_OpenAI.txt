The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 3987 due to a combination of historical trends and an observed stabilization in influenza activity. The time-series data reveals a recent decline in ILI occurrences from 16964 to 2881 over the last 10 weeks, suggesting a downward trajectory. Meanwhile, the reports indicate that influenza activity remains generally low but increasing slightly, with outpatient visits for ILI percentages (ranging between 1.4% and 2.7%) staying below the national baseline. Despite moderate activity in a few regions, widespread high activity is absent, suggesting a continued low-level rise without a sharp escalation. Therefore, based on these trends and steady but limited influenza spread, the expected ILI count aligns with the projected value of 3987.
