- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 3671 after 5 weeks are predicted based on the seasonal trends observed in the time-series data, where ILI cases peak and then decline gradually, as well as the CDC reports highlighting minimal to moderate activity in most jurisdictions with some regional increases expected. Additionally, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI remains below the national baseline, and current low virologic positivity (0.1-3.1%) combined with elevated vaccination rates indicate a continued but reduced decline in cases over time.
