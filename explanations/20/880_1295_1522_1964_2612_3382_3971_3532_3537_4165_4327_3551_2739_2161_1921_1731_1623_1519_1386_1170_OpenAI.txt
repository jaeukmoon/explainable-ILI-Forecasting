The future ILI occurrence of 1,207 after five weeks can be explained by the declining trajectory observed in the past time-series data of ILI values and the news highlighting that influenza activity, while increasing in previous weeks, remains below baseline across most regions. The latest reports indicate slight increases in outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses but with co-circulating respiratory viruses contributing to ILI, and geographic activity being variable with minimal to moderate levels in most areas. Additionally, hospitalization rates remain lower than pre-COVID-19 pandemic seasons, and recent data suggest decreased influenza activity in clinical surveillance with a stabilizing or downward trend. These factors combine to suggest a decline from the recent peak activity, leading to the projected ILI value of 1,207.
