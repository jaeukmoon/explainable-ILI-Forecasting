- Explanation: The pattern of past ILI occurrences shows a general downward trend followed by spikes (e.g., weeks 13–18 show a sharp increase), indicating a seasonal or external factor influencing ILI cases. News data highlights continued low overall flu activity with minimal local outbreaks and geographical variations. It also emphasizes that the percentage of ILI-related visits remains below the national baseline despite an increasing trend in certain regions and occasional spikes due to Influenza A (H3N2). Taken together, these data suggest that week-to-week variations, combined with geographical discrepancies, result in the prediction of increased activity, stabilizing to 803 ILI cases in 5 weeks.
