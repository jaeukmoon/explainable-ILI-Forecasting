- Explanation: The ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 581 due to a consistent decline in influenza activity observed in the past weeks, as evidenced by the decreasing outpatient visit percentages (e.g., from 4.8% in Week 52 to 1.7% in Week 5), the stabilization or decline of hospitalization rates, and sporadic influenza activity reported across different regions. Additionally, influenza A(H3N2), though still prevalent, showed reduced activity, and outpatient respiratory illnesses have remained below the national baseline since mid-February. This consistent decline aligns with the projected lower ILI occurrences in the coming weeks.
