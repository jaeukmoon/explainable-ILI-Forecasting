- The future ILI occurrence of 1983 in 5 weeks is indicative of declining influenza activity as suggested by the time-series data and news trends. In the time-series data, a peak was reached at 3231 in Week 4, followed by a gradual decline towards 2531 in Week 20. Coupled with the summarized news indicating either stable or declining ILI percentages below baseline in later weeks (e.g., “Outpatient respiratory illness activity remains below the national baseline” and “Influenza activity has decreased in recent weeks”), the projection aligns with a gradual resolution of the influenza season. This trend supports the predicted figure of 1983, reflecting a stabilized lower level of ILI cases.
