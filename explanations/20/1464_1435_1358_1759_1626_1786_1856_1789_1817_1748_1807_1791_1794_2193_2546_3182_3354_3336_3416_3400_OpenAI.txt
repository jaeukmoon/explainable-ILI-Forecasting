The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 2231 because of trends in the time-series data showing increasing ILI occurrences over the past several weeks, such as 1794, 2193, and 2546, which reflect an upward trajectory. Additionally, news reports indicate that ILI activity has slightly increased recently (e.g., rising outpatient visit percentages, with 1.1% to now 1.3% of visits due to ILI), despite overall low influenza activity. These subtle upticks, combined with historical patterns of seasonal increases in ILI, suggest a moderate rise in future cases, aligning with the projection of 2231 occurrences.
