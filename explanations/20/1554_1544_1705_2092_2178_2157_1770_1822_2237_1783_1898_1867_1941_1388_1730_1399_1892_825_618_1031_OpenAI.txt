The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1176 because the historical time-series data show a general downward trend in ILI occurrences, which aligns with the low influenza activity reported in the summarized news. Specifically, virologic surveillance consistently indicates an unusually low percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza (e.g., 0.1-0.4%), while outpatient ILI visits remain below the national baseline of 2.6% (e.g., 1.1-1.6%). Minimal to low ILI activity has been reported across most jurisdictions, and hospitalization rates are significantly lower than usual. These factors collectively suggest a continuation of the declining trend observed in the time series.
