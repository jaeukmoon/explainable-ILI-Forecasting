The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 702 based on historical trends in the time-series data and the reported surveillance insights. In the provided data, ILI occurrences have shown a consistent decline, reaching 670 in Week 20. Concurrently, the news indicates that influenza activity has been unusually low nationwide, with ILI outpatient visits below the national baseline of 2.6% and minimal geographic spread. The CDC expects flu activity to increase in the coming months but emphasizes preventative measures, suggesting only a gradual rise in ILI cases. Thus, 702 aligns with a slight upward trend from recent data, reflecting minimal but steady growth consistent with the low activity levels and CDC guidance.
