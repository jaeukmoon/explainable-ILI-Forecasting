- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 1299 after 5 weeks are likely due to the overall national trend of declining influenza activity, supported by both the time-series data and news insights. The time-series data shows a steady decline in ILI occurrences from 1701 to 846 over the past 20 weeks. Additionally, the news reports consistently highlight that outpatient visits for respiratory illness remain below baseline, with ILI activity stabilizing or decreasing in most regions, and virologic surveillance reporting lower percentages of positive influenza tests over time. These factors align with a continued decrease in ILI cases.
