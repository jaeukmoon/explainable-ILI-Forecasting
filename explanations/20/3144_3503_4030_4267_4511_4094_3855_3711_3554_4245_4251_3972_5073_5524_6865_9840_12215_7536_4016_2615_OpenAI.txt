The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are predicted to be 1816 due to the consistent decline in ILI activity in recent weeks seen in the time-series data (e.g., a sharp drop from 12215 in week 16 to 2615 in week 20), paired with virologic surveillance indicating minimal influenza activity. News reports highlight that positive specimen rates (2.3%) and outpatient visits for ILI (below the 2.6% baseline for week 36) suggest limited influenza circulation, as most jurisdictions reported minimal ILI activity. Combined with decreasing ILI trends and surveillance insights, these factors explain the anticipated decline to 1816 in five weeks.
