The future Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrences in 5 weeks are predicted to be 807 due to the consistent declining trend in the time-series data, where recent weeks show a steady drop from 1464 to 646, indicating low flu activity. Additionally, the summarized news highlights low virologic surveillance positivity rates (0.1%-0.4%) and minimal geographic spread, coupled with ILI visits remaining below the national baseline of 2.6% due to reduced influenza transmission and changes in healthcare-seeking behavior. These combined factors suggest that flu activity will remain low in the upcoming weeks.
