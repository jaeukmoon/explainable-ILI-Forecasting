The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 769 due to a sustained national decline in ILI activity, as seen in the time-series data where ILI counts have consistently decreased over the past 14 weeks, reaching 711 in the most recent week recorded. Consistent with this trend, news reports highlight that influenza activity remains sporadic, with outpatient visits for respiratory illness and ILI below baseline throughout, and long-term care facilities reporting low percentages of influenza positivity. These factors collectively indicate dwindling influenza activity, justifying the low projected ILI occurrence of 769.
