The predicted future ILI occurrence of 2626 after 5 weeks can be explained by the increasing trend observed in the time-series data of ILI occurrences (e.g., rising from 1054 in week 5 to 2438 in week 18) and the reported variability in ILI activity in some jurisdictions, with high to minimal activity levels noted, according to CDC's surveillance. The higher-than-threshold mortality rate (e.g., 7.6%) due to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 also indicates continued respiratory illness activity. These factors suggest a sustained rise in ILI cases, aligning with public health patterns and historical seasonal trends analyzed in the monitoring reports.
