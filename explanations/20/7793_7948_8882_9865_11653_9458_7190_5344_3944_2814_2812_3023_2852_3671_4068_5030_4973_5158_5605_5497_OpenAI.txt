- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences have been trending downwards after a period of elevated activity, indicating a seasonal decline (e.g., from 11,653 to 5,497 in the most recent weeks). However, the surveillance reports suggest increasing outpatient visits for ILI above baseline in multiple regions, moderate to high ILI activity in jurisdictions, and rising hospitalizations for influenza A(H3N2), which is known for higher transmission. These combined factors suggest a moderate rebound of ILI activity in the coming weeks, stabilizing at 5,643 occurrences within 5 weeks.
