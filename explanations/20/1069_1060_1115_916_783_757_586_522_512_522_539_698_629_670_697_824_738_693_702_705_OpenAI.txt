- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 927 because, while influenza activity remains lower than usual with minimal ILI activity (below the national baseline of 2.6% in past weeks), historical time-series data shows a recovery trend following prior decreases. For example, after reaching a low of 512, ILI increased in subsequent weeks (522, 539, 698). With consistent public health recommendations for vaccination and antiviral use, and the possibility of ILI activity rising in the coming months as indicated in news summaries, the trend points to a gradual increase in ILI occurrences, aligning with patterns from prior weeks.
