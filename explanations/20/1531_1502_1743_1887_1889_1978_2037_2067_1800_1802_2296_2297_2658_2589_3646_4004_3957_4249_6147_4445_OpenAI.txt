The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 795 due to the sharp decline observed in the past time-series data after reaching a peak at week 18 (6147 cases), followed by subsequent reductions (4445 in week 19). This pattern, coupled with consistently low historical ILI percentages (below or near the national baseline of 2.6%) reported in the summarized CDC surveillance, suggests a declining trend in influenza activity influenced by low virologic activity and minimal geographic spread across jurisdictions. These indicators provide evidence of diminishing ILI occurrences over time.
