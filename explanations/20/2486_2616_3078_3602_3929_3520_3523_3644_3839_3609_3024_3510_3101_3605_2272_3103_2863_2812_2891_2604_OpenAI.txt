- The predicted future ILI occurrence of 2141 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the observed trends in the time-series ILI data and the summarized news reports. The time-series data shows a general fluctuation with recent declines (e.g., the last five weeks: 2891, 2604). This aligns with news that indicates that while influenza activity varies regionally, it remains below national baselines with stable outpatient ILI percentages. Stability in ILI reports, combined with the decreasing trend and the noted regional variability, supports a modest projection like 2141, indicating a continuation of the lower ILI levels observed recently.
