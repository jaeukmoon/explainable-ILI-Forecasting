The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are projected to be 7536 due to an upward trend in the time-series data where occurrences have steadily increased in recent weeks, with occurrences surging from 3554 to 5073 in the last three weeks reported. Additionally, news reports indicate that flu activity, although below baselines nationally, has been increasing in certain regions, while moderate activity in areas like Louisiana suggests a broader geographical spread. Combined with factors like increased outpatient ILI percentages nearing baseline and historical seasonal trends often leading to higher numbers, these indicators align to predict a further rise in ILI occurrences to 7536 after five weeks.
