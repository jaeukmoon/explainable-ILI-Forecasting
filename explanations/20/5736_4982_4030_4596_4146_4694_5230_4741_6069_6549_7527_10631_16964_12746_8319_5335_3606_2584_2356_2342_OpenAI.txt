- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 3248 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the downward trend observed in the time-series data (from 5736 to 2342 over 20 weeks) and the consistently reported low influenza activity in the surveillance reports. Specifically, outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline (e.g., 1.9%, 1.8%) across multiple weeks, geographic spread showed minimal to moderate ILI activity, and virologic surveillance indicated only a small percentage of positive influenza specimens (e.g., 0.1%–1.5%). These factors, combined with ongoing vaccination efforts and the absence of significant increases in hospitalization or pediatric deaths, suggest an anticipated stabilization at a low ILI case count after 5 weeks.
