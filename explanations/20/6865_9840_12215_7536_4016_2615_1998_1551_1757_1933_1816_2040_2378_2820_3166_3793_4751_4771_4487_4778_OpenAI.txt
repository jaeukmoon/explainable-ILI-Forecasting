The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are expected to be 4689 due to a consistent decline in ILI cases observed over the last 10 weeks in the time-series data (e.g., starting with 6865 in Week 1, transitioning to 2615, and then stabilizing around 4778 in Week 20). Additionally, the surveillance report shows influenza activity stabilizing or declining with outpatient respiratory visits below baseline, indicating reduced transmission. Although influenza hospitalizations and mortality remain above the epidemic threshold, their rates are lower than in pre-pandemic seasons, suggesting a slow, controlled spread rather than a resurgence.
