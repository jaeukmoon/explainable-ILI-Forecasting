- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to reach 3082 due to the upward trend observed in the time-series data, where weekly values have steadily increased from 2198 to 2809 in the last five weeks, suggesting a continued rise. Furthermore, while the news states low influenza activity, it also mentions a slight increase in ILI outpatient visits compared to earlier weeks, signaling an upward shift. The minimal ILI activity across all jurisdictions may still support a gradual increase influenced by seasonal trends, despite the pandemic-related impacts on surveillance interpretations.
