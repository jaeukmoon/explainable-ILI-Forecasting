The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to reach 1477 due to a general increasing trend observed in the past weeks coupled with limitations in the low influenza activity reported. The time-series data demonstrates a steady and consistent rise in ILI occurrences from 522 to 1046 over 20 weeks. News data indicates minimal ILI activity, with outpatient ILI visits at just 1.1%—below the 2.6% baseline—and unusually low hospitalization and virologic data. However, the increasing time-series trend suggests a potential increase in ILI occurrences despite the low reported baseline, likely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and seasonal factors. Hence, the projection considers both reported circumstances and trending patterns in previously observed data.
