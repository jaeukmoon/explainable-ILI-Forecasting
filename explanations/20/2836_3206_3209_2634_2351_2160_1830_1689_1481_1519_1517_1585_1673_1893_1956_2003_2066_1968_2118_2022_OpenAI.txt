The relatively low future ILI occurrence of 1934 after 5 weeks can be explained by the consistently low influenza-like illness (ILI) activity observed in past weeks, as supported by the time-series data and news reports. ILI activity percentages remained below the national baseline of 2.6% (e.g., 1.6%, 1.7%, 1.1%), with minimal activity reported across jurisdictions. Virologic surveillance repeatedly indicated extremely low percentages of positive respiratory specimens (e.g., 0.1%, 0.3%). Additionally, no significant increases in influenza-associated hospitalizations or pediatric deaths were reported, and morbidity attributed to influenza remained unusually low due to factors such as COVID-19 measures potentially reducing flu transmission. These trends suggest a continuation of reduced ILI activity, leading to the predicted low value of 1934.
