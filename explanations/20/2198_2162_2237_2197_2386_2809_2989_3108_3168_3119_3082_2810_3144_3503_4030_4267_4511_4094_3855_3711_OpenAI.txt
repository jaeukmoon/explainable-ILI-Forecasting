The predicted future ILI occurrence of 5073 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the upward trend observed in the time-series data combined with historical patterns during influenza seasons and public health surveillance. Specifically, the ILI occurrences in recent weeks have displayed a consistent increase, with values rising from 3144 to 3711 over the last five recorded weeks. This trend aligns with seasonal influenza peaks, as public health surveillance indicates no significant changes in virologic or geographic influenza activity, and baseline ILI levels, such as the national 2.6% threshold, remain stable. This gradual progression likely reflects the seasonal dynamics of ILI cases, predicting a continued increase over the next 5 weeks to an estimated 5073 cases.
