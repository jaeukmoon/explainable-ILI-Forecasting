The future ILI occurrence of 788 after five weeks can be attributed to the recent upward trend in the time-series data and indicators in the summarized news. From the data, ILI cases have risen significantly in prior weeks, reaching 673 in the latest week, marking a steep upward trajectory. Despite reports of low influenza positivity (e.g., 0.1% in clinical laboratories and low public lab positives) and ILI visits below the baseline (e.g., 1.1%), the mention of increasing PIC (Pneumonia, Influenza, and COVID-19) deaths above the epidemic threshold (e.g., 14.8%) highlights worsening conditions. This combination of rising mortality trends, ongoing low-but-growing outpatient ILI visits, and a historical sharp increase suggests that ILI occurrences continue accelerating, reaching 788 as projected.
