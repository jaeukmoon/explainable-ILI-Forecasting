- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 2476 after 5 weeks can be explained by the historical time-series data, showing a rising trend in ILI cases over the past few weeks, peaking at 2388 before slightly declining to 1867. Despite current news from the CDC indicating low overall influenza activity (e.g., only 0.1% positive specimens and 1.2% of visits due to ILI below the 2.6% baseline), the slight increase compared to previous weeks suggests a resurgence in cases. Other factors, like minimal activity in jurisdictions and low hospitalization rates, indicate localized increases that could explain the modest upward projection.
