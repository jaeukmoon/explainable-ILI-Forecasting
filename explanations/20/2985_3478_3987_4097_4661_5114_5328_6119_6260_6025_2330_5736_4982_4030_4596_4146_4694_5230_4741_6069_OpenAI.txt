The prediction of 12,746 ILI occurrences in 5 weeks aligns with the upward trend observed in the past time series, where ILI cases increased steadily (e.g., 2985 to 6069 by week 20). Supporting this, virologic surveillance indicates Influenza A dominance and increasing circulation of respiratory viruses. Outpatient ILI visits also mirror rising trends, and although current levels remain below the baseline (e.g., 1.4%-2.4% vs. 2.6% national baseline), gradual increases point to future growth in cases. Regional variations (e.g., moderate activity in Louisiana) and time-aligned historical seasonal influenza patterns support the expected rise to 12,746 cases in 5 weeks.
