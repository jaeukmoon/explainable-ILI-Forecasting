- Explanation: The projected ILI occurrences of 3897 after 5 weeks result from patterns observed in the time-series data and stable influenza activity in recent surveillance reports. The decrease in weekly ILI occurrences from 5335 to 5436 during the past 20 weeks indicates a downward trend, suggesting decreased transmission over time. Additionally, the CDC reports that outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses remain below baseline, influenza A(H3N2) activity is sporadic, and hospitalization rates are lower than pre-COVID-19 seasons. These factors collectively suggest a continued decline in ILI occurrences, aligning with the prediction.
