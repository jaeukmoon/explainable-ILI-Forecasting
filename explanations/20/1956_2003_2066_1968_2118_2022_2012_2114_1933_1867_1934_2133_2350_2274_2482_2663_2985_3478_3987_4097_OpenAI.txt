The future 5-week ILI occurrence of 6260 is likely due to a steady upward trend observed in the past time-series data, where ILI cases increased significantly in the last weeks (from 2482 to 4097), reflecting seasonal growth. Although news reports indicate minimal influenza activity and a lower-than-usual percentage of influenza-positive specimens (0.1%), outpatient ILI visits (below the 2.6% baseline) and consistent minimal activity across jurisdictions, the increase could result from non-influenza respiratory illnesses coinciding with reopening behaviors, as well as potential underreporting of healthcare visits due to the ongoing influence of COVID-19 on healthcare usage, which skews the estimations for future cases.
