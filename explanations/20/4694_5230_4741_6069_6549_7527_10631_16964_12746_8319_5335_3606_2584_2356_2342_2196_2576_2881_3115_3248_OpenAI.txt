The predicted future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks being 4258 can be explained by the historical time-series data showing a seasonal declining trend in ILI occurrences after peaking significantly earlier in the season (e.g., from 16,964 down to 3248 over recent weeks), combined with CDC reports indicating that although influenza activity is increasing in some regions and the predominant virus is Influenza A(H3N2), the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI remains below the national baseline, and overall ILI activity is stabilizing or declining in several regions. This suggests a moderating trend in influenza cases, aligning with the forecasted value of 4258.
