- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 1285 due to a steady decline in ILI occurrences since Week 11, as shown in the time series (highest at '4327' in Week 12 and decreasing consistently afterward to '1519' by Week 20). News reports indicate that while influenza activity remains sporadic and hospitalization rates are higher than last season, outpatient visits for ILI have remained below baseline nationally, and long-term care facilities report a low percentage of positive influenza tests. These trends, alongside stable but declining respiratory illness activity nationally, suggest a reduction in ILI occurrences over time to the projected value of 1285.
