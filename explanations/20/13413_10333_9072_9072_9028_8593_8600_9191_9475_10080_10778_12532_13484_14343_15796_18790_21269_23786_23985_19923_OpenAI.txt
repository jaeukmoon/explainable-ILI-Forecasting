- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 13,771 based on the increasing trends seen in the time-series data, where ILI counts consistently rose, peaking at 23,985 in week 18 before a decline began in subsequent weeks, consistent with seasonal influenza patterns. Additionally, the news reports indicate that influenza activity remains sporadic, with Influenza A(H3N2) being predominant. Although outpatient visits for respiratory illness and hospitalization rates are below baseline, regional variations and co-circulating respiratory viruses suggest that influenza activity may stabilize at moderate levels, leading to a slightly reduced but sustained ILI occurrence.
