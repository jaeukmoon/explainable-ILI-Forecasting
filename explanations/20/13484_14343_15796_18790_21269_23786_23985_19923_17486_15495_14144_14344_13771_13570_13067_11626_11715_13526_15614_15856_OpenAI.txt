The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 18,479 because recent news indicates a consistent upward trend in respiratory illness rates and influenza activity despite a temporarily stable percentage of outpatient visits for ILI (e.g., "The percentage of visits for respiratory illness (ILI) remains below baseline but has been trending upward in all age groups since February"). Additionally, Influenza A(H3N2), known for higher infectivity, continues to dominate, while hospitalization rates for influenza-related illnesses have increased compared to the previous season. The historical time-series data reveals oscillating weekly ILI occurrences, with patterns of increases and minor plateaus. Based on ongoing trends in both the reported news and statistical patterns, the predicted value aligns with expected increases in the coming weeks.
