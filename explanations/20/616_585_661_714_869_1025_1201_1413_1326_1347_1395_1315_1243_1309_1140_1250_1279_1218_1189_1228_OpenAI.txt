Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1325 due to the consistent trend in past ILI occurrences showing a plateau in the range of 1200-1400 for several weeks, combined with minimal influenza activity reported in virologic and outpatient surveillance. According to the news, 1.3%-1.4% of patient visits were due to ILI, below the national baseline, and most jurisdictions reported minimal or low activity with sporadic geographic spread. Despite some increases in respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, overall flu activity remains low, which mirrors the stability seen in the past time-series data.
