The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 2663 because ILI activity, despite being below the national baseline at 1.1% in recent weeks, is expected to rise due to seasonal trends evident in the time-series data, where a general increase in occurrences is observed across intervals (e.g., from 1481 to 1893 to 2114). While the news highlights currently low influenza activity (e.g., "0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive," "minimal activity across all jurisdictions"), caution is advised due to potential changes influenced by seasonal variations and historical patterns in flu trends, indicating an uptick in ILI.
