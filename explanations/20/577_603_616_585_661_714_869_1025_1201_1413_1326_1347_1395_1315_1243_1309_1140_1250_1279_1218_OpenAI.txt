- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to reach 1170 due to the rising trend observed in the time-series data, where ILI cases increased significantly over recent weeks, peaking at 1413 before a slight decline to 1218. This suggests a seasonal resurgence in line with historical patterns of influenza activity. Additionally, the recent news highlights that 1.2% of patient visits are attributed to ILI, which, although below the national baseline, indicates active circulation of Influenza A viruses and low but growing influenza activity in certain jurisdictions. The geographic variability and potential increase in ILI activity further support the projection of higher future ILI cases.
