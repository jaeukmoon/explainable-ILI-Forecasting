- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 1025 after 5 weeks can be attributed to a steady increase in preceding weeks, as seen in the time series (e.g., rise from 577 to 616). Despite lower-than-usual flu activity reported in the news (0.1% of specimens testing positive, ILI visits below the 2.6% baseline, and minimal regional activity), the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surveillance, increased mobility, or fading vaccine effects might contribute to a resurgence, aligning with the observed growth trend.
