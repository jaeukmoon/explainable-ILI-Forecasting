- Explanation: The ILI occurrences showed a gradual rise in the time series data, climbing from 466 in week 1 to 853 by week 19, demonstrating a steady upward trend. Additionally, despite reduced influenza activity being reported in the news (e.g., 0.1% of specimens tested positive for influenza and ILI visits remaining below the 2.6% baseline), the CDC cautions that influenza activity may increase in the coming months. This rising trend in historical data, coupled with CDC's anticipation of potential increases, aligns with the prediction of 1022 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
