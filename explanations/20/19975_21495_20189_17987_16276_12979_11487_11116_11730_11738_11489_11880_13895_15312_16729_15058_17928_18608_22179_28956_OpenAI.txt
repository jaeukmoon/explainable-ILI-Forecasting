The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are forecasted to be 13,413 based on the decrease in ILI activity observed in the time-series data combined with the summarized news surveillance trends indicating continuous low influenza activity nationally, below the baseline of 2.6%, and minimal pediatric deaths. The time-series data shows a declining trend over recent weeks (e.g., 20,179 to 11,116), suggesting a stabilization or slow reduction in subsequent weeks. The news surveillance confirms low influenza virus circulation, with ILI variations likely attributable to other respiratory viruses. This alignment of low ILI activity and minimal spread explains the moderate prediction of ILI occurrences at 13,413.
