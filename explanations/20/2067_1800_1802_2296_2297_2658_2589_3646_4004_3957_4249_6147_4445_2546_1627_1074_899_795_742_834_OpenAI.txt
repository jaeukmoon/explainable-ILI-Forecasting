The ILI occurrences for Week 5 are projected to be 2612 due to the upward trend in ILI activity reflected in the recent weeks' data, where outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses have surpassed baseline levels in many regions. The news reports highlight increasing influenza activity, specifically Influenza A(H3N2), with moderate to high activity in several jurisdictions and rising hospitalization rates. This resurgence is supported by the observed growth in ILI cases in the time-series data, from 899 in Week 16 to 1074, followed by steady increases leading to 4004 by Week 10. Such trends in both data and surveillance consistently indicate rising ILI occurrences, leading to a predicted figure of 2612 for Week 5.
