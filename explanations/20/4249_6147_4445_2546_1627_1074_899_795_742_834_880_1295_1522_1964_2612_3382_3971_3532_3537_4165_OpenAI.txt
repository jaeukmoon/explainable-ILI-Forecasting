The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are estimated to be 1921 because the increasing ILI trends in prior weeks, coupled with recent declines, indicate stabilization. Past time-series data shows a consistent decrease in ILI numbers, from 4249 in Week 1 to 795 by Week 8 and then a slight seasonal uptick in Weeks 9 to 20, with occurrences peaking at 4165. News reports emphasize influenza A(H3N2) dominance and rising hospitalizations between Weeks 51 and 5; however, Week 3 onward shows declining outpatient visits and low hospitalization rates (below previous pre-pandemic seasons). This stabilizing trend aligns with a projected occurrence of 1921 as influenza cases wane seasonally.
