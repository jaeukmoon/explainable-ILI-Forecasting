The predicted future ILI occurrence of 2087 after 5 weeks is consistent with the reported trend of low but stable influenza activity and slight increases in ILI percentages, as indicated in the news surveillance. Recent outpatient ILI activity percentages (1.2-1.6%) remain below the national baseline of 2.6% but have shown minor periodic increases, coupled with minimal influenza positivity rates (0.1–0.4%). Additionally, while flu activity is still unusually low for this time of year, public health experts anticipate gradual increases in flu activity as the season progresses, aligning with historical patterns in the provided time-series data, where ILI occurrences fluctuate near the 2000s, reflecting seasonality but not significant spikes. These conditions support a moderate future rise to 2087 occurrences.
