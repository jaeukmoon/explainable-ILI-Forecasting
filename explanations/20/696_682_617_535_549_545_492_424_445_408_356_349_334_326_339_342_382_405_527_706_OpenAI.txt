- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences have generally followed a cyclical pattern, trending downward in recent weeks after initially high values. However, the week 5 prediction of 603 indicates an expected resurgence, aligning with historical peaks seen early in the time-series data after a downward trend. Coupled with the summarized news, the CDC noted that although current influenza activity is low with ILI visits below the baseline (e.g., 1.6%), they anticipate an increase in coming months due to seasonal trends and expected flu activity rise. This cyclical pattern, combined with historical peaks and CDC’s expectation of future flu increases, supports the prediction of an ILI resurgence to 603 after 5 weeks.
