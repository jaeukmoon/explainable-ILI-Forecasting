- Explanation: Based on the past time-series ILI occurrences, which show a consistent decline from week 1 to week 20 ('28956' to '15796'), and the news reports, which highlight increasing influenza A(H3N2) activity, rising hospitalization rates, and a stable to slightly declining outpatient respiratory visit rate hovering above baseline, the projection of future ILI occurrences at 19923 after 5 weeks reflects an expected rebound driven by the sustained circulation of the predominant Influenza A(H3N2) strain and its antigenic differences from the vaccine, alongside co-circulating respiratory pathogens contributing to ongoing ILI activity.
