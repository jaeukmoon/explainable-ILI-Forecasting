The future Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrences after five weeks are predicted to reach 4097 because the time-series data shows a steady upward trend in ILI cases over the past weeks (e.g., from 1519 to 2482), suggesting a continuous increase. Additionally, CDC surveillance reports mention that while current ILI is below the national baseline, it slightly increased in some weeks (e.g., from 0.8% to 1.2% of outpatient visits), and the CDC warned that flu activity might rise in the coming months. This aligns with the observed trend, leading to the projected rise in ILI cases.
