The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks may reach 3033 due to a combination of seasonal trends and the rising ILI activity outlined in the surveillance reports. The time-series data shows an increasing trend from 1201 in week 3 to 1408 in week 20, indicating upward momentum. Surveillance reports highlight that respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza are increasing, with Influenza A (H3N2) predominating. Outpatient visits for ILI were reported to be nearing or slightly below the national baseline, suggesting an upward trajectory in activity. Furthermore, geographic data showing moderate ILI activity in certain regions and CDC expectations of increasing flu activity underline the likelihood of a spike in ILI occurrences within the next 5 weeks.
