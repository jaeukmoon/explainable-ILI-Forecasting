The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is projected to be 5176 due to the consistent upward trend in ILI cases indicated by the time-series data, particularly the increase from week 10 (1587) to week 20 (2863). Additionally, the CDC’s surveillance reports highlight that flu activity is increasing, with Influenza A (H3N2) as the predominant virus and certain regions like Louisiana experiencing moderate ILI activity. The growing geographic spread, coupled with slightly rising ILI-related healthcare visits, aligns with the historical trend of increasing cases during the flu season, supporting the prediction of a significant rise in ILI occurrences.
