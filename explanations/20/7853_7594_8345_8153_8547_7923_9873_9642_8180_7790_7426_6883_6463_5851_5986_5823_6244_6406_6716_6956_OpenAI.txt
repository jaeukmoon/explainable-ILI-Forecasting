The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is predicted to be 9,650 because of the increasing trend in the historical time-series data (e.g., rising occurrences from week 16 to week 20: 6,244 to 6,956) and news reports suggesting that flu activity, although currently low, is expected to increase in future weeks. The news highlights CDC warnings of potential activity spikes, emphasizing the importance of vaccinations and antiviral drugs. Coupled with historical periodic surges in ILI occurrences, the pattern aligns with a gradual increase to 9,650 in 5 weeks.
