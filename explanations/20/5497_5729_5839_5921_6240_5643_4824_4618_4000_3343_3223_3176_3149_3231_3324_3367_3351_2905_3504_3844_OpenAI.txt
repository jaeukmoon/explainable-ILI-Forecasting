- Explanation: The ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 5,290 because the data indicates a recent upward trend in reported ILI cases and hospitalization rates over the past several weeks, as well as an increase in respiratory illness visits since mid-February and March. The CDC reports note that influenza A(H3N2) is the predominant strain, with antigenic differences likely contributing to reduced vaccine effectiveness. Additionally, the co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses and above-epidemic thresholds for pneumonia and influenza mortality suggest heightened influenza activity in regions. In line with prior trends, the gradual rise in ILI activity, especially hospitalizations, implies a projected increase in ILI cases to this level.
