- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are expected to be 15,046 due to a combination of observed trends and current events. Past time-series data indicate a significant decline following an earlier peak, with the latest weeks stabilizing around 13,000 ILI cases. News reports highlight increasing influenza A(H3N2) activity, steady outpatient ILI rates trending upward since mid-February, and continued high cumulative hospitalization rates (e.g., 16 per 100,000 population in Week 21). Additionally, ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory viruses and antigenic differences in circulating viruses contribute to sustained ILI activity. These factors suggest a moderate rebound and stabilization in ILI cases.
