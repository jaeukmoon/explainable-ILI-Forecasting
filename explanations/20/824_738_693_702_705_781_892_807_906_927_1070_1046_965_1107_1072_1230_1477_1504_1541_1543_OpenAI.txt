The future ILI occurrence of 1889 after five weeks is attributed to a notable upward trend in the time-series data, where ILI cases increased steadily over recent weeks (e.g., from 1230 in Week 15 to 1543 in Week 20). This gradual rise aligns with changes in seasonal patterns and potential easing of public health behaviors as COVID-19 restrictions have lessened, despite influenza activity remaining below baseline nationally. The summarized news highlights minimal ILI activity in healthcare visits (1.1-1.3%) and low virologic surveillance positivity rates (0.1%), yet historic trends suggest that ILI occurrences begin to increase slightly during this period. This anticipation is likely based on both seasonal trends and slight changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors.
