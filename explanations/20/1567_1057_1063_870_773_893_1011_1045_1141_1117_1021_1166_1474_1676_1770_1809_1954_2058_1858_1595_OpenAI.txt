- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences are projected at 898 due to the decreasing trend in past time-series ILI data and stable outpatient visit percentages below the national baseline. Influenza A(H3N2) remains the dominant virus but activity has been sporadic with co-circulation of other respiratory illnesses. Additionally, virologic surveillance indicates a steady decline in positive influenza tests, along with decreasing hospitalization rates at 17.1 per 100,000, suggesting reduced ILI burden in the coming weeks.
