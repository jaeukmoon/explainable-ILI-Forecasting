The future ILI occurrences are projected to be 1413 after 5 weeks based on the time-series trend of steadily increasing cases and the CDC's report indicating a slight rise in ILI activity despite overall low influenza activity. The past five weeks show an upward trend: 603, 616, 585, 661, and potentially higher as weekly outpatient ILI visits increased from 0.8% to 1.3%. Although influenza activity remains below baseline (2.6%) due to minimal positive specimen rates (0.1%) and COVID-19 impacts, the slight increase reflects a potential rise in patient visits, matching the upward trajectory in the time-series data.
