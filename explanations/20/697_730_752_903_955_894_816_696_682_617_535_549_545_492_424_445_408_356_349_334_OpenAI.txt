The future Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrences after 5 weeks are 405 due to a consistent decline in ILI activity and minimal influenza-related activity reported nationally. The ILI time-series data show a steady downward trend, with the most recent occurrences at 349 and 334. News reports consistently indicate low percentages of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza (e.g., 0.1%-0.3%), ILI healthcare visits remaining below the national baseline (around 1.0%-1.6%), and minimal activity across jurisdictions. Furthermore, ongoing emphasis on vaccinations and antiviral treatments, coupled with unusually low flu spread due to public health measures (including those for COVID-19), supports the projected decline in ILI occurrences to 405 in five weeks.
