The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 1626 due to historically low but gradually increasing levels of influenza activity, as seen in the time-series data where ILI cases increased from 825 to 1176 over recent weeks. This aligns with the news reports indicating low positivity rates in virologic surveillance (0.1%-0.4%) and outpatient ILI visits below the national baseline (1.6%). However, the reports also highlight that flu activity may rise in the coming months due to seasonality and CDC expectations of increased transmission, suggesting a pattern consistent with the slight upward trend in ILI cases observed in the past weeks.
