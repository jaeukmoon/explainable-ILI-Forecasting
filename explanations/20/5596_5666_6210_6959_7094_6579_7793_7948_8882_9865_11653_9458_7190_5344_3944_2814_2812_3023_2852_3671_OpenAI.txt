- Based on the time-series data, a marked increase in ILI occurrences is evident from week 11 to 13 (e.g., '7793' to '11653'), followed by a decline, reflecting seasonal peaks and transitions. The summarized surveillance data support an increasing influenza trend, driven by Influenza A(H3N2) predominance and regional variability, with several areas reporting moderate activity and noticeable outpatient visit rates (above baseline at 2.7-4.8%). Mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 remains above the epidemic threshold, with hospitalizations also increasing. These combined factors, alongside regional ILI activity and historical peak trends, explain the projection of 5605 ILI cases in 5 weeks.
