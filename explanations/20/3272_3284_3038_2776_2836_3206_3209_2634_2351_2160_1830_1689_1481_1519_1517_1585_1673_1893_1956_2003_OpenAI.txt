The future ILI occurrences of 2012 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the consistently low influenza activity during the prior weeks, as reflected by virologic surveillance showing only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza and outpatient illness surveillance revealing ILI activity at 1.6%, below the national baseline of 2.6%. Furthermore, all jurisdictions reported minimal or low ILI activity, and there was no evidence of significant geographic spread or severe influenza-related disease during the monitored period. These low levels of activity, alongside preventative measures such as vaccinations and antiviral use, suggest a continuation of the downward trend in ILI occurrences toward the observed future value of 2012.
