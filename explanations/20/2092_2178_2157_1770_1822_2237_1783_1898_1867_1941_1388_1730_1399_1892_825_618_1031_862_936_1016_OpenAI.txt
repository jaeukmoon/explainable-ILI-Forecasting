- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 1358 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the sustained low influenza activity observed in the past weeks, as indicated by virologic surveillance (0.2%-0.4% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza) and consistently low ILI outpatient visit percentages (1.1%-1.7%, below the baseline of 2.6%). The reports also highlighted minimal or no geographic spread of influenza in most jurisdictions and lower-than-usual hospitalization rates for influenza-related illnesses. However, the CDC expects flu activity to increase in the coming months, suggesting a rebound in ILI occurrences, though still within a non-peak range. Thus, 1358 reflects this anticipated gradual increase from the recent suppressed levels.
