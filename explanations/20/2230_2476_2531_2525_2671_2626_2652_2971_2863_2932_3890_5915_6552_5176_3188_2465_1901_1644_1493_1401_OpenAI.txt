The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1902 due to the consistent decline in ILI occurrences in the past 20 weeks, as evidenced in the time-series data (e.g., from 6552 in Week 12 to 1401 in Week 20), combined with reports indicating low influenza activity nationally, below-baseline outpatient ILI visits (e.g., 1.4%-1.8%), and minimal increases in flu positivity rates in clinical and long-term care facilities (0.1%-0.2%). While some areas reported slight increases, the overall trend remains below epidemic thresholds, supporting a continuation of low ILI levels in the near term.
