The projected ILI occurrence of 2114 in 5 weeks is informed by the consistent decline in past ILI occurrences (e.g., from 3284 to 2066 over 20 weeks), combined with evidence from surveillance reports indicating minimal influenza activity. Specifically, clinical labs report a positivity rate as low as 0.1% and outpatient ILI visits below the national baseline at 1.1%. Additionally, public health labs report unusually low positive cases, with all jurisdictions experiencing minimal activity. The continued low flu activity aligns with the observed seasonal trend and implies a gradual decrease in ILI occurrences over the coming weeks.
