- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 4085 in 5 weeks is projected based on the time-series trend showing a pattern of decline after peak levels, with recent weeks registering a decrease in cases from 5955 to 5081. Moreover, the CDC reports indicate stable influenza activity with sporadic regional changes. The gradual reduction of outpatient visit percentages and hospitalization rates, coupled with the overall declining trend in influenza-positive specimens, supports the estimate of a continued decrease in ILI occurrences while accounting for regional variability.
