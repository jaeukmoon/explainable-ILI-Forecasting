- Explanation: The past ILI time-series data shows a consistent increase in cases during certain weeks, particularly in weeks 7-12 (2313-3231 cases), followed by a decline. The summarized news indicates influenza activity has been low overall but is gradually increasing, with Influenza A(H3N2) predominating. Reports mention a slight rise in outpatient visits for ILI and moderate ILI activity in specific jurisdictions, alongside increasing hospitalization rates. These trends, combined with historical patterns of surges and the ongoing rise in influenza virus detections, suggest that the ILI occurrences will increase to 2181 in five weeks.
