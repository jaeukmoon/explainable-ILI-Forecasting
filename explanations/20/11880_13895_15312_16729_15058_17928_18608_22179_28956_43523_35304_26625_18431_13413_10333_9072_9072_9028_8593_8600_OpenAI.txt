- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 12,532 after 5 weeks can be explained by the recurring trend of decreasing ILI numbers observed in the past time-series data, following previous ILI surges like weeks 9-13 where numbers dropped consistently. Despite increasing influenza activity reported in the news, such as a rise in outpatient visits for ILI and influenza-related hospitalizations, overall activity remains below national baselines. Additionally, the recommendations on vaccination and prevention efforts could have contributed to limiting the extent of resurgence, supporting a moderate stabilization at the reported level.
