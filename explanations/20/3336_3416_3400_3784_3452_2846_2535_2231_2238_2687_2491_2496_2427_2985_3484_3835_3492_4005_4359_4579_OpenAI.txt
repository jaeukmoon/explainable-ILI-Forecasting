- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to reach 5572 because of the upward trend in ILI percentages noted in the surveillance data. Specifically, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI has increased compared to prior weeks, signaling a rise in overall influenza-like activity. Additionally, the detection of Influenza A (H3N2) as the predominant virus, along with moderate to high ILI activity in certain regions, indicates a broader regional spread and higher case numbers. The impact is also compounded by hospitalization increases and mortality rising above the epidemic threshold, further evidencing an escalating trend in influenza activity.
