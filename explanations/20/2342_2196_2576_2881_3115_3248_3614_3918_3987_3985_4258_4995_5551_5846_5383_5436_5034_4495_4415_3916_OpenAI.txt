Future ILI occurrences being 3775 after 5 weeks can be explained by the observed trends in the past ILI time-series data and the influenza surveillance reports showing increasing influenza activity in some areas, particularly in the northeast and northwest regions, accompanied by reports of Influenza A(H3N2) as the predominant strain. Although outpatient visits for ILI remained below baseline nationally, hospitalization rates have been steadily rising, and 7.1% of monitored deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19, suggesting increasing severity of cases. These factors, combined with a co-circulation of other respiratory viruses and vaccine mismatches with circulating strains, contribute to a steady rise in ILI cases reflected in the projected value of 3775.
