- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks projected to be 452 can be explained by the consistent drop in ILI numbers over the past 20 weeks, where occurrences decreased from 897 to 527, demonstrating a declining trend. Additionally, the CDC reports indicate that seasonal influenza activity and the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza have remained low (0.1–0.3%) across recent weeks, with ILI patient visits below the national baseline of 2.6%. This evidence of sustained low activity aligns with the predicted lower ILI occurrences.
