The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 5328 due to the consistent upward trend in the time-series data, where ILI occurrences have significantly increased in the last 5 weeks from 2274 to 3478, reflecting a growth rate of approximately 10-15% per week. This trend coincides with CDC reports stating that although current flu activity remains below seasonal baselines (e.g., 0.1–1.3% ILI visits), the CDC expects flu activity to increase in the coming months, driven by seasonal patterns and reduced immunity in the population following the pandemic's impact. Together, these factors explain the projected increase to 5328 occurrences.
