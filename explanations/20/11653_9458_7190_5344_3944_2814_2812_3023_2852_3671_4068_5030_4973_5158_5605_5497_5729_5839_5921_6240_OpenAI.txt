Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 3343 due to a steady decline in influenza activity, as indicated by trends in the time-series data (e.g., a decrease from 6240 to 2814 in recent weeks) and consistently lower outpatient respiratory illness visitation rates (1.7%-2.2% in ILINet, below the national baseline). Additionally, while A(H3N2) remains the predominant virus, its transmission is slowing, as evidenced by lower hospitalization rates and decreasing percentages of influenza-positive test results across regions.
