The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 9922 due to the observable upward trend in recent time-series data, which shows an increase in ILI cases in the last five weeks (from 6406 to 9036). Despite influenza activity being lower than usual according to the virologic surveillance, geographic spread data, and ILI activity (remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%), the slight increase in ILI percentages and CDC's expectation of rising flu activity align with historical patterns of seasonal increases during this period. This suggests a continuation of the upward trajectory in ILI cases despite ongoing low activity.
