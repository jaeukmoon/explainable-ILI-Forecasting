The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 3,880 due to increasing influenza activity in certain regions (northeast, south-central, and mountain regions) alongside steady outpatient visits for respiratory illness trending upward since early March, per surveillance data. The virologic data show that Influenza A(H3N2), which is antigenically different from vaccine reference viruses, predominantly drives the trend. Hospitalization rates remain elevated (e.g., 16.7 per 100,000 population), with mortality (7.5-10%) surpassing epidemic thresholds. This anticipated continuation of a gradual upward trend in respiratory illnesses underpins the forecasted ILI occurrence.
