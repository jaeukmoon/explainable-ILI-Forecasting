The future Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrences are predicted to be 845 due to a continued national decrease in influenza activity, with lower percentages of outpatient visits for ILI (remaining below the national baseline in recent weeks) and minimal to moderate regional variation in ILI activity. Historical time-series data also show a declining trend over the past 5 weeks (from 1180 to 853), reflecting a seasonal tapering trend in ILI occurrences as indicated by CDC virologic surveillance and mortality data reporting reduced influenza-related impact.
