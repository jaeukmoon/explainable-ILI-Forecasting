The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 2712 because the percentage of outpatient visits due to influenza-like illness, though slightly increasing in certain regions, remains below baseline nationally. Historical time-series data also exhibit a downward trend in ILI occurrences over recent weeks, dropping from 3644 to 2712 prior to stabilization. Additionally, influenza A(H3N2), which is antigenically distinct from the vaccine reference viruses, remains the predominant strain, but its impact appears moderated by a decrease in hospitalization rates relative to prior seasons, the presence of co-circulating viruses, and the overall reduced flu activity in most regions based on CDC influenza surveillance.
