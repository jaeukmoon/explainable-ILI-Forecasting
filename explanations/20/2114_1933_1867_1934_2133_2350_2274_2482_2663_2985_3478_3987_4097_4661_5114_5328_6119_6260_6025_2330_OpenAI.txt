The future ILI occurrence of 4146 after 5 weeks can be attributed to a historical upward trend in ILI cases during the previous weeks of the time series data, where numbers increased from 2114 to a peak of 6119 before declining significantly to 2330. Although news reports suggest unusually low influenza activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic (with lower than baseline percentages of ILI visits in outpatient surveillance and minimal geographic spread), historical seasonality and gradual recovery in healthcare-seeking behaviors likely explain the expected rebound to 4146, consistent with prior trends of fluctuating increases after drops.
