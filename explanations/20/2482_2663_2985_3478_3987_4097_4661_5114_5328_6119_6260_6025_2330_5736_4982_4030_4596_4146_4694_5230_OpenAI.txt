Based on the provided past time-series ILI occurrences and summarized news reports, the future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 10,631 due to the following trends: The time-series data highlights an overall increasing ILI pattern, especially from weeks with low ILI counts returning to higher levels, such as the rise from 2,482 to peaks like 6,260. The latest CDC surveillance news indicates low current ILI activity, but there has been a consistent increase in outpatient ILI visits and in laboratory detections of Influenza A (H3N2). Furthermore, geographic spread patterns indicate moderate activity in some jurisdictions, and public health recommendations for interventions like vaccines are in place but may have delayed effects. These trends collectively indicate that ILI occurrences are expected to climb steadily to the projected number in 5 weeks.
