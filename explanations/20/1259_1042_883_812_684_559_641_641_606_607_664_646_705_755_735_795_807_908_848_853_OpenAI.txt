- Explanation: The time-series data indicates a gradual increase in ILI occurrences over the past few weeks: after a dip at week 10 (606), there is a steady upward trend from week 11 to week 20 (664, 646, 705, 755, 735, 795, 807, 908, 848, 853). Meanwhile, according to the news, ILI activity has remained below baseline but is expected to increase, and flu activity continues to remain relatively low overall. The commentary on potential future increases, alongside the upward trend in the time-series data, supports the future projection of ILI occurrences reaching 1054 after five weeks, indicating a continuation of the upward trend in ILI numbers.
