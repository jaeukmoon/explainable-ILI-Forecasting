The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is projected to be 1940 due to decreasing ILI trends observed in recent weeks within the time-series data, combined with the low reported ILI activity nationwide (below the 2.5% baseline) as per CDC surveillance. While Outpatient Illness Surveillance shows minimal activity in most regions, geographic spread remains sporadic or low. Laboratory testing indicates limited influenza positivity (ranging from 0.1% to 3.1%), and severe disease indicators such as hospitalization rates and pneumonia-influenza-related deaths are also below epidemic thresholds. These factors suggest continued low seasonal influenza activity, causing a moderate increase from the average of prior weeks, stabilizing at 1940 occurrences.
