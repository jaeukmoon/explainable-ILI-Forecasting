The predicted future ILI occurrences of 2932 after 5 weeks can be explained by increasing trends in ILI activity as observed in the past time-series data, where occurrences show a steadily rising pattern in recent weeks (from 2438 to 2671 in the last 5 recorded weeks) along with historical fluctuations indicating seasonal peaks. Additionally, surveillance data highlights a recent increase in Influenza A activity among predominant cases, with rising outpatient ILI percentages (e.g., from 1.2% to 2.3% in various regions below the national baseline) and scattered moderate activity geographically. This suggests a continuing upward trend, consistent with historical patterns and mild-to-moderate flu season expectations.
