- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2919 due to the observed increase in historical trends and anticipated seasonal amplification. Historical ILI time-series data indicates a pattern of rising cases in the last weeks (e.g., from 1084 to 1240) suggesting an increasing trend, and news highlights that 7.1% of P&I mortality exceeded epidemic thresholds, coupled with Influenza A activity dominating 70.5% of positive specimens. Together, these factors signal a projected significant rise in ILI activities.
