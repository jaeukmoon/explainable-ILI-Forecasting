- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 4,251 after 5 weeks is backed by trends in the past time-series ILI data and the surveillance findings. The time-series data shows a general seasonal upward trend peaking around weeks 17-19, aligned with influenza season where numbers rose from 3,082 (week 14) to 4,511 (week 19) before slightly declining. Additionally, in the period reported by the CDC, national ILI activity remained below the baseline (at 1.2%-2.6%), but certain regions displayed high activity, and mortality due to pneumonia and influenza exceeded the epidemic threshold (7.6%). These combined factors suggest a steady but significant increase in flu activity, aligning with the projected value of 4,251.
