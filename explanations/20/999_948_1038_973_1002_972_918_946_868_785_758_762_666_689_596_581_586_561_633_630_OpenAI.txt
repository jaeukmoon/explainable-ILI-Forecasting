The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 626 due to a consistent declining trend observed in the time-series data over the past weeks and the CDC-reported stabilization or decrease in outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses, which remain below baseline. The recent news highlighted that influenza A(H3N2) continues to dominate, but its contribution to respiratory illness is diminishing nationally, with stable hospitalization rates and flu-related pediatric deaths staying low. Additionally, the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses alongside the flu and vaccination efforts mitigates further spikes in ILI activity.
