The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 3629 because of the declining trend observed in the past ILI time-series data with a recent plateau and indications of stabilization in CDC reports. The time-series data showed a peak of 6552 in week 3, followed by a steady decline to 1493 in week 10 and a mild resurgence to 2654 in week 20, suggesting gradual recovery. CDC surveillance reports mention that influenza activity has either stabilized or declined in some regions, and the relative contribution of influenza to outpatient respiratory illness is decreasing, aligning with the downward pattern in the time series despite regional variations. This evidence collectively predicts moderate activity resulting in 3629 occurrences after 5 weeks.
