The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1474 because the time-series data shows a recurring pattern of increasing ILI occurrences during recent weeks (1496 → 1482 → 1490 → 1558 → 1486 → 1598), indicating a steady trend of rising activity. Furthermore, the news reports suggest unusually low influenza activity due to COVID-19's continued impact, but they also note that flu activity may increase in the coming months. This combination of historical data trends and expectations of moderate future increases aligns with the prediction of 1474 occurrences.
