The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 3551 based on the observed time-series data and reported trends in the news. In the time-series, ILI cases historically decline from a peak (e.g., 6147 in week 5) to a lower number during less active influenza periods, such as the current trajectory (3971 in week 20). News reports indicate that although influenza activity remains sporadic, certain regions are experiencing increases in outpatient visits and hospitalizations, which, combined with increased activity of Influenza A(H3N2) and geographic variability, suggests slight ongoing circulation of the virus. However, since the trends also show that influenza-related deaths and hospitalization rates remain below historical averages, the overall impact is moderated. This suggests a steady yet slight decline in ILI activity, correlating with the projected 3551 cases in 5 weeks.
