- The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 3972 due to a consistent upward trend in the past time-series data, where ILI occurrences increased after Week 14 (from 3144 to 4267 in Week 18). This suggests a projected continuation of rising cases. Despite current ILI percentages being below the national baseline (e.g., 1.2%), the mortality surveillance indicated that 7.6% of deaths were due to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19, above the epidemic threshold, signaling increasing respiratory illness severity. Furthermore, reports of Influenza A predominance and regional variations in ILI activity support the extrapolated rise to 3972 cases as respiratory illnesses continue to circulate.
