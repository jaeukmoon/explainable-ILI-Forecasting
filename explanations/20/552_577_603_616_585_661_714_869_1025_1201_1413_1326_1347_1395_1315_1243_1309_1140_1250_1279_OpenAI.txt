- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 1223 after 5 weeks is due to the observed rising trend in the time-series data (e.g., a consistent increase from 552 to 1413 and then stabilization around 1200-1300) combined with the previously reported ILI activity of 1.2% below the national baseline, indicating room for seasonal growth. Despite no reported pediatric flu deaths and low Influenza B activity, increasing respiratory death percentages (7.6%) and influenza A predominance suggest a mild to moderate resurgence in line with historical seasonal patterns.
