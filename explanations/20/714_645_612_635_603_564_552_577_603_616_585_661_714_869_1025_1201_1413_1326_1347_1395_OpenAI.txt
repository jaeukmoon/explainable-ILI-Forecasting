- Explanation: The predicted future ILI occurrence of 1250 in 5 weeks can be explained by the increasing trend observed in the time-series data, where ILI occurrences rose steadily from 714 in week 12 to 1395 in week 20. Additionally, while ILI activity reported in the surveillance remains below the national baseline (e.g., 1.1%-1.3% of patient visits in recent weeks with minimal geographic spread), the consistent rise in the weekly ILI occurrences in the dataset likely reflects other concurrent respiratory illnesses or delayed case reporting effects, rather than traditional influenza seasonality alone. These combined factors project an ILI occurrence of 1250 in 5 weeks.
