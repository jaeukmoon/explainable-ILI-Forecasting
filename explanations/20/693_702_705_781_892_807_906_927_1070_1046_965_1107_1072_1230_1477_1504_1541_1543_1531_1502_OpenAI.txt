Explanation: Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2037 because the time-series data shows a consistent upward trend in ILI cases over recent weeks, increasing from 1107 to 1502 in the last four weeks, indicating a likely continuation of this trend. Meanwhile, CDC reports confirm influenza activity remains low (with only 0.1% respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza and ILI visits at 1.2%, below the 2.6% national baseline). This suggests that the upward trend in the time-series data may be influenced by other respiratory illnesses or changes in healthcare-seeking behavior during this period, aligning with the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts.
