- Explanation: The predicted future ILI occurrences of 2654 after 5 weeks are supported by the trend in the time-series data, where past occurrences showed a decline over the recent weeks (e.g., from 5915 to 1931), indicating a general reduction in ILI activity. This aligns with the CDC reports, which mention that influenza activity remains sporadic and below baseline in most regions, with increasing but low cases of Influenza A(H3N2) and other respiratory viruses contributing variably to respiratory illness. Additionally, vaccination campaigns and available antiviral treatments likely contribute to keeping the ILI cases stable at lower levels.
