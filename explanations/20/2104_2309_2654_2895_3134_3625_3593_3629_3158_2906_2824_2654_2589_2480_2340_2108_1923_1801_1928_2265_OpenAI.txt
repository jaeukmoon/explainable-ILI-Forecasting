The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 2958 due to a combination of factors observed in the time-series data and news reports. Specifically, the time-series data shows recurring trends of seasonal increases in ILI occurrences, with a consistent rise between February and April. Similarly, reports highlight an ongoing upward trend in outpatient visits for respiratory illness since mid-February, alongside increasing influenza hospitalizations and rising percentages of pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19-related deaths above the epidemic threshold. Additionally, the predominance of Influenza A(H3N2) viruses and their antigenic differences from vaccine reference viruses suggest reduced vaccine efficacy, further contributing to the rise. These combined indicators align with the expectation of approximately 2958 ILI cases.
