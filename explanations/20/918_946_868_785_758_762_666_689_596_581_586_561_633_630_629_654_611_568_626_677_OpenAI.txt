The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (1060 cases) can be explained by the steady upward trend in ILI activity observed over the past weeks, combined with increasing influenza-related hospitalizations and above-baseline mortality rates related to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19. News reports indicate that influenza A(H3N2) is the predominant virus subtype, which is antigenically different from vaccine reference strains, reducing vaccine effectiveness. Additionally, respiratory illnesses, including ILI, have been steadily increasing since February, with co-circulating respiratory viruses contributing to the rise. These factors, alongside regional variations in ILI activity, suggest a continuous increase leading to the projected occurrences.
