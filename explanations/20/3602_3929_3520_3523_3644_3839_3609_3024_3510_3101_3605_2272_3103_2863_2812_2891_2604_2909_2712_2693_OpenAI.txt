- Explanation: The future Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrence of 3762 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the steady trend of increasing influenza activity in certain regions of the country, particularly the central and south-central areas, as described in the surveillance reports. Specifically, the reports indicate that outpatient visits for ILI have been slightly increasing or stable but remain below the baseline, with a co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses. Additionally, hospitalization rates for influenza are reported to be higher compared to the prior season, and influenza A(H3N2) continues to be the dominant virus, which shows antigenic differences from the vaccine reference virus. These combined factors, along with gradual regional spikes in activity and historical patterns in the time-series data (e.g., weekly fluctuations averaging near the current trend of 3600+ cases), support the prediction of ILI occurrences reaching 3762.
