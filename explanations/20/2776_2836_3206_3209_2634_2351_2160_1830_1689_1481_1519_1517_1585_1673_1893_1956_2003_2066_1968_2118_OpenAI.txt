The future ILI occurrence of 1867 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the combination of trends observed in the past ILI time-series data and the consistently low influenza activity reported in the surveillance news. Specifically, the time-series shows a gradual decline in occurrences over recent weeks (e.g., dropping from 2776 at the start to 2118 in Week 20), indicating a steady downward trend. Meanwhile, news reports highlight that the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza is exceptionally low (hovering around 0.1%-0.3%), ILI activity remains below the national baseline of 2.6% (e.g., 1.6%, 1.4%, 1.3%), and most jurisdictions report minimal activity. Given these factors, it is reasonable to project a continued decline over the next 5 weeks, resulting in a slightly reduced ILI count of 1867.
