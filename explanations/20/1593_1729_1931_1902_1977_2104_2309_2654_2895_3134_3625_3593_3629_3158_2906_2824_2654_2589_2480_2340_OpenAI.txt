The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 2,265 because, based on the time series, ILI activity has shown a decline in recent weeks, decreasing substantially from a peak of 3,625 (Week 11) to 2,340 (Week 20). This downward trend aligns with news reports indicating that ILI outpatient visits nationally remained below baseline, with geographic variation and co-circulation of other non-influenza respiratory viruses. Current virologic surveillance shows influenza activity is waning, testing positivity rates for influenza are low (e.g., 0.7%-2.3%), and hospitalization rates have been stable or decreasing. These combined factors suggest that ILI occurrences would continue declining to 2,265 in 5 weeks.
