- Explanation: The predicted future ILI occurrences of 3381 in 5 weeks is supported by the upward trend in the time-series data with recent higher values ('5488', '5955', '5615', '5081', '4689'), indicating a sustained increase in ILI activity. The news confirms that influenza activity is increasing in parts of the country, outpatient visits for respiratory illness are slightly rising, and hospitalization rates have been steadily increasing, despite some geographic variation. These factors, combined with increasing virologic activity of influenza A(H3N2) and its antigenic differences from the vaccine, suggest continued heightened ILI occurrences.
