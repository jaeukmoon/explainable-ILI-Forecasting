- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences are predicted to increase to 2211 after 5 weeks due to recent upward trends indicated in the time-series data, specifically the gradual rise in the last five weeks from 2021 to 2181. Combined with the news reports that influenza activity is increasing, outpatient visits for respiratory illness are above the national baseline, and hospitalizations are starting to rise, the continued circulation of influenza A(H3N2) and regional variations in moderate to high activity signal a sustained rise in ILI cases. This combination of escalating trends and virologic data supports the forecasted number.
