- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences have shown an increasing trend over the weeks, peaking at 23,985 in week 16, then slightly declining. The summarized news highlights that Influenza A(H3N2), the dominant strain, has been spreading with high hospitalization rates and mortality above the epidemic threshold. Additionally, outpatient respiratory visits, though slightly below baseline, continue to trend upward nationally. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses further amplifies illness severity, contributing to sustained ILI rates. Thus, the predicted future ILI occurrences after five weeks (13,067) reflect a decline from peak levels but remain elevated due to the ongoing influenza activity, increased regional spread, and virus persistence.
