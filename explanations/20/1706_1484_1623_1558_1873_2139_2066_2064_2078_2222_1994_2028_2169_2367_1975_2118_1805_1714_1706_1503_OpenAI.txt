- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 1982 because the time-series trend shows a slight decrease in ILI cases over recent weeks, aligning with the CDC's virologic surveillance and ILI surveillance data that indicate influenza activity is low but stable. For instance, the ILI percentage in outpatient visits is consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%, with only 1.1%-1.7% of visits for ILI. The virologic reports also indicate low positivity rates (0.1%-0.4%). Coupled with minimal geographic spread and low hospitalization rates, this suggests a continuation of modest activity, leading to an estimated ILI occurrence of 1982 as part of the slow upward trend expected in the coming weeks.
