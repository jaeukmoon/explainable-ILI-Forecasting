- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are predicted to be 1063 due to the downward trend in the past 20 weeks of time-series data, where ILI occurrences peaked at 3033 but showed consistent declines during the last few weeks. Additionally, data from news reports suggest that influenza activity remains relatively minimal across most regions, with a low proportion of influenza-positive tests and ILI rates below national baselines. The CDC surveillance data reflects a reduced influenza impact, corroborating the expected decrease in occurrences.
