The future ILI occurrences of 8,852 after 5 weeks likely results from a combination of factors highlighted in the historical time-series data and summarized news. The time-series shows a consistent upward trend in ILI cases around specific times before peaking (e.g., week 4-5 spikes in '2309' to '3625'); this trend correlates with the repeated news reports indicating rising seasonal influenza activity in parts of the country, predominantly Influenza A(H3N2), and an upward trend in respiratory illness percentages among outpatients. Additionally, increased co-circulation of respiratory viruses and regional variations in activity would also contribute. Evidence from hospitalization data (e.g., cumulative rates like 14.4 per 100,000 increasing over time) and above-baseline levels of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (e.g., 7.5%) further suggests a persisting rise in cases leading up to the projected future numbers.
