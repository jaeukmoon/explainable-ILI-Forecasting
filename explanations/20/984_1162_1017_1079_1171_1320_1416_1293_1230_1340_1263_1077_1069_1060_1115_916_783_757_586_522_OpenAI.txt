The projected ILI occurrence of 629 after 5 weeks corresponds to the observed sustained decline in recent weekly ILI occurrences (‘916’, ‘783’, ‘757’, ‘586’, ‘522’) alongside consistently low influenza activity reported in surveillance data (e.g., only 0.1-0.3% of respiratory specimens testing positive and ILI activity remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%). Minimal geographic and outpatient ILI activity, combined with no influenza-associated pediatric deaths and low hospitalization rates, supports a low flu activity trend. However, CDC warnings about potential gradual increases in flu activity guide the slight upward adjustment in the predicted ILI occurrences over the coming weeks.
