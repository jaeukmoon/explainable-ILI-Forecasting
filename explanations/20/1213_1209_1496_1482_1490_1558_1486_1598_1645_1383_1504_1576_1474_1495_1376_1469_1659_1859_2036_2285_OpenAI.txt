The predicted ILI occurrence of 3010 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the gradual upward trend in past ILI occurrence data (from 1213 to 2285 in 20 weeks) and sustained minimal flu activity noted in news updates. Although ILI activity remains below the national baseline of 2.6% and the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza is unusually low (0.1%), the slight overall increase in outpatient ILI visits (from 0.9% to 1.3%) suggests a projected rise. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare-seeking behavior and continued low vaccination coverage may contribute to the predicted rise to 3010 cases.
