- Explanation: The ILI occurrences are expected to reach 11,738 after 5 weeks due to the observed rise in the past time-series data over several weeks, showing an upward trend from Week 12 (14311) to Week 16 (19975) before a slight decline. Despite recent slight decreases, the overall trend reflects an increase in ILI occurrences this season. Furthermore, the summarized news highlights exceptionally low influenza activity compared to typical years (positive specimens at 0.1% and ILI visits below the baseline), suggesting that the recent increases may also be influenced by external factors like changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 context, as noted in the reports. This, combined with seasonal patterns and ongoing tracking, corresponds to the projected 11,738 cases.
