The future Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrences after five weeks are predicted to be 1893 because recent virologic surveillance consistently reported low influenza activity, with clinical lab positivity rates at or below 0.3%. Outpatient illness surveillance indicates that ILI-related visits remain below the national baseline of 2.6%, fluctuating between 1.0% and 1.6%. Additionally, jurisdictional reports show mostly minimal to low activity, and public health labs continue to report very few positive specimens. The historical ILI time series shows a steady decline in occurrences over the last several weeks, closely tracking the reported data from outpatient surveillance and virologic trends. This combination of low past cases and surveillance insights explains the modest estimate of 1893 occurrences for week five.
