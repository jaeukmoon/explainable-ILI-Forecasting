Explanation: The projected future ILI occurrences of 2107 are influenced by increasing weekly trends in the provided time-series data (rising from 1540 in week 19 to 1679 in week 20) and evidence of regional variations in ILI activity described in the news. While ILI activity remains below the national baseline of 2.6%, specific jurisdictions reported minimal to moderate activity and potential increases due to respiratory pathogens other than the flu, impacted by ongoing changes in healthcare-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors, combined with historical baselines and virologic surveillance showing a rise in influenza A cases, predict a gradual increase in future ILI occurrences.
