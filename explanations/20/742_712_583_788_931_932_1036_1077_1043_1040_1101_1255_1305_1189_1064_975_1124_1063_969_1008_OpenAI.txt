The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are expected to rise to 1752 due to the observed trend in past time-series ILI data showing a consistent upward trajectory starting from week 12, where occurrences increased from 1101 to 1255, peaking at 1305 in week 13, and staying above 1000 thereafter. Despite the recent decline seen in weeks 18–20, external factors such as continued circulation of Influenza A viruses reported in virologic surveillance, minimal ILI activity in several jurisdictions, and increasing respiratory virus activity (including overlapping COVID-19 influences) indicate potential for resurgence. This aligns with historical patterns of influenza waves, combined with low vaccination uptake, as highlighted in public health recommendations.
