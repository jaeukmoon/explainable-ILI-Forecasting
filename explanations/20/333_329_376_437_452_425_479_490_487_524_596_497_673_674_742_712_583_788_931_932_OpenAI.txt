The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1101 due to the increasing trend observed in the time-series data, particularly a sharp rise in recent weeks (from 788 to 931, and then 932). This suggests an ongoing upward trajectory of cases. Additionally, the news data highlights that while influenza activity has been lower earlier in the season, the CDC expects flu activity to increase in the coming months, potentially influenced by relaxed COVID-19 mitigation measures and shifts in healthcare-seeking behavior. These converging data points support a significant rise in ILI cases in the upcoming weeks.
