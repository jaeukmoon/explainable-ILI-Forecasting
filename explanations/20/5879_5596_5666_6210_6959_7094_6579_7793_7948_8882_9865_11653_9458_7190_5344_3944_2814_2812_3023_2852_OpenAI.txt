The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are projected at 5158 based on the observed declining trend in the past 20 weeks of ILI time-series data, coupled with administrative surveillance and widespread vaccination efforts. Week-by-week ILI occurrences have shown a consistent decline since the peak in Week 10 (11653), eventually settling to 2852 in the most recent week provided. This coincides with surveillance reports emphasizing low influenza virus prevalence and declining outpatient ILI visits below the national baseline. Furthermore, increasing vaccination coverage and low morbidity due to the season's predominant Influenza A(H3N2) virus, reported as antigenically similar to current vaccines, signify reduced viral spread and severity, aligning with the steady decline in ILI cases.
