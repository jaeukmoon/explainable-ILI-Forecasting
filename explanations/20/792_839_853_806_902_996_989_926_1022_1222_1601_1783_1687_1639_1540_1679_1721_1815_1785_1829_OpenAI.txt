- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 2084 due to the observed upward trend in the past time-series data, with a steady increase particularly after week 9 (1022 cases) culminating in week 20 with 1829 cases. Coupled with news reports indicating continued minimal levels of influenza activity below the national baseline (e.g., 1.2% ILI patient visits in week 24 and 0.4% positive influenza specimens), the rise is likely driven by an increase in respiratory pathogen activity other than influenza or changes in healthcare-seeking behavior as described in the reports.
