The future ILI occurrence of 1743 after 5 weeks is likely due to a steady increase in recent weeks, as reflected in the past time-series data (1230 → 1477 → 1504). While the news consistently reports that influenza activity remains below the national baseline and ILI activity is minimal, the observed increase in hospitalization rates and related outpatient visits combined with seasonal expectations suggests the potential for gradual growth. Furthermore, ongoing COVID-19 impacts on health-seeking behavior and overlap with respiratory illness surveillance could contribute to a slight underreporting of cases, driving the trend towards the projected value.
