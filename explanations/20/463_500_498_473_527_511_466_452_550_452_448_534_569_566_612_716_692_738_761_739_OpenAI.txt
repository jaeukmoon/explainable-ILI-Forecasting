- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 853 after 5 weeks are predicted based on the upward trend in the time-series data, which shows a steady increase in ILI from week 12 (534 occurrences) to week 20 (739 occurrences). This rising trajectory indicates that ILI activity is intensifying, aligning with the news report cautioning that flu activity remains lower than usual but may increase in the coming months.
