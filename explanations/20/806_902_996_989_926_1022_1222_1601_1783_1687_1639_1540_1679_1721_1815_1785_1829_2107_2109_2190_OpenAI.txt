- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 2550 due to an increasing trend in ILI cases over the past weeks and higher baseline activity in historical patterns. The time-series data shows a consistent rise in ILI occurrences after week 13, peaking at week 18 (2107-2190). Recent news highlights that despite general low flu activity, there has been an increase in reported influenza detections, mainly Influenza A (H1N1 & H3N2), and the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI remains slightly below but nearing national baseline levels. The CDC also notes that the flu activity is expected to rise, aligning with seasonal trends, public health reporting, and historical data patterns.
