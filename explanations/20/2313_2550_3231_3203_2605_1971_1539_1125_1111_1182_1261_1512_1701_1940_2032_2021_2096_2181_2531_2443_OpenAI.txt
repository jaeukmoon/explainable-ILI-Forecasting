The future Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1695 primarily due to the decreasing trend in ILI occurrences in the past time series (from 3231 steadily declining to 2443 over recent weeks) and the stabilization or decline in influenza activity in the summarized news reports. For example, the Week 15 report states that "outpatient visits for respiratory illness remained below national baseline," while influenza hospitalization rates and pediatric deaths remain low. This aligns with the observed time series and suggests that while influenza activity persists, it is beginning to stabilize, contributing to the projection of a lower ILI occurrence of 1695.
