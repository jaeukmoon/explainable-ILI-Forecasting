- Explanation: The predicted future ILI occurrence of 2584 is driven by observed trends in time-series data and corroborated by the reports indicating low-to-moderate influenza activity with 2.2% of patient visits attributed to ILI, slightly below the baseline. Despite a decline in ILI numbers compared to previous weeks (e.g., peaks of 16964 in week 20), the trends imply stabilization at a lower activity level, with respiratory illnesses likely driven more by non-influenza viruses such as during the COVID-19 era. The combination of regional variations in ILI activity and a predominantly mild influenza season supports a forecast of reduced but still present ILI cases.
