The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are estimated to be 2905 based on the observed decreasing trend in the time-series data, where ILI cases have been steadily declining over the past weeks (e.g., from 6240 to 3149). Additionally, the news reports highlight that outpatient visits for respiratory illness remain below baseline, influenza activity is stable or declining in most regions, and there are co-circulating respiratory viruses minimally contributing to ILI. The combination of declining case trends and stable influenza activity supports the projection of a continued decrease to 2905 cases.
