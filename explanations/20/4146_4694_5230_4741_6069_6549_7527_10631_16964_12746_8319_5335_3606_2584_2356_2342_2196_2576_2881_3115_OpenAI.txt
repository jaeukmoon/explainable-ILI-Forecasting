Explanation: Based on time-series data, ILI occurrences generally show a cyclic pattern, peaking in weeks 7-9 before declining until week 15-18. Comparing this trend with the current increase in ILI activity according to CDC reports, outpatient visits for respiratory illness and geographically localized moderate-to-high ILI activity have been rising due to Influenza A(H3N2). Despite this, national activity remains near or slightly above baseline, indicating a gradual stabilization typical of mid-season dynamics. Given the historical trends, news reports of regional increases, and vaccination efforts, occurrences in week 25 are projected at 3985, reflecting a tapering effect after recent rises.
