The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks reaching 1230 can be explained by analyzing both the time-series trend and the news data. The time-series data demonstrates a consistent increase in ILI occurrences over the past weeks, rising from 586 to 1070, indicating an upward trajectory in activity. Although the CDC reports suggest that the seasonal influenza activity remains lower than usual, with minimal ILI activity and only 1.1% of outpatient visits attributed to ILI (well below the national baseline of 2.6%), the steady growth in the reported occurrences suggests a possible delayed response due to external factors, such as the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Additionally, the increased PIC mortality rate (above the epidemic threshold) might signify higher overall respiratory illness susceptibility, indirectly contributing to the projected future rise in ILI cases.
