- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences reaching 2810 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the following evidence: The time series data shows a steadily increasing pattern in the last few weeks, with occurrences rising from 2162 to 2989, indicating a growing trend in ILI cases. The news summaries suggest that although flu activity has remained lower than usual (e.g., 0.1% of specimens testing positive for influenza and national ILI visits below the baseline of 2.6%), there has been a slight increase in outpatient ILI visits (e.g., from 1.1% to 1.3%). In light of historical trends and the anticipation of a rise in flu activity highlighted by the CDC, the trend suggests that the ILI count would continue increasing, reaching 2810 by week 25.
