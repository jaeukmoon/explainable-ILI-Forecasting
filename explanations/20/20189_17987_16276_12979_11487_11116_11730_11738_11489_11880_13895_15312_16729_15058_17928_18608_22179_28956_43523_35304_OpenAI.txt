The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 9072 as a result of the consistent decline in ILI trends evidenced by the time-series data showing a sharp decrease in activity after peak weeks (e.g., from 43,523 to 35,304 in the last two weeks) and supported by news reports indicating low overall influenza activity, with current ILI percentages remaining below national baselines and most regions reporting minimal or moderate activity, which combined suggest a continued reduction in ILI cases.
