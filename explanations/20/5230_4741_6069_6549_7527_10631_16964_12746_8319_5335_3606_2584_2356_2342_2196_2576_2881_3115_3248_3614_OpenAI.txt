The future ILI occurrence of 4995 after five weeks can be explained by the observed seasonal trend in the time-series data and consistent patterns highlighted in the news. First, the ILI time-series data shows a typical seasonal decline during weeks with lower flu activity, followed by a subsequent rise due to increasing cases as indicated in past occurrences (e.g., 16964 dropping to 5335, then gradually increasing to 3614). News reports confirm that influenza activity, while generally low, has shown an increasing trend recently with outpatient visits for ILI approaching or surpassing the national baseline in specific jurisdictions. Additionally, increased Influenza A(H3N2) circulation and higher reported hospitalization rates corroborate a forecasted increase in ILI occurrences over time, peaking slightly to align with the predicted value of 4995 over five weeks.
