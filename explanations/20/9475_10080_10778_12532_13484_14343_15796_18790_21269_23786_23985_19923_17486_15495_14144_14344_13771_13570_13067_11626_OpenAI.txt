The future ILI occurrences of 15,839 after 5 weeks can be explained considering the past trends and the summarized news. Historical data shows a clear uptick in ILI occurrences during earlier weeks (e.g., from 9,475 steadily rising to 23,786 before declining slightly to 13,570), suggesting seasonality. Furthermore, the news highlights stable ILI percentages below the baseline but trending upward, with influenza A(H3N2) being predominant and co-circulation of other respiratory viruses. Hospitalization rates and mortality due to respiratory illnesses remain elevated, above the epidemic threshold, signaling ongoing transmission and impact. With these factors and the steady rise in activity in specific regions (northeast, northwest), ILI occurrences were likely projected to align with these increasing trends, reaching the estimated 15,839 in five weeks.
