The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1639 due to the observed seasonal increasing trend in the time-series data and the influence of low influenza activity during the current period. The time-series data shows a steady weekly rise in ILI activity from 534 in week 1 to 1022 in week 20, which suggests continued growth. Despite virologic surveillance reporting very low positivity rates (0.1%) in laboratory tests and minimal geographic spread, the outpatient data (1.1% patient visits for ILI) is below the baseline, but the consistent historical increase in the time-series suggests this pattern will drive future numbers. Additionally, while the current activity is impacted by COVID-19, the overall trend indicates these external factors are unlikely to negate the expected rise to 1639 in the coming weeks.
