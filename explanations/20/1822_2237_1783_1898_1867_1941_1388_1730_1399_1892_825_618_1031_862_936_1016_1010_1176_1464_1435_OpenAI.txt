- The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 1856 based on past time-series data, where fluctuations in ILI levels were observed with consistent rebounds after declines, alongside current news trends. The news indicates minimal geographic influenza activity (low positivity rates at 0.3% in clinical labs) and below-baseline outpatient ILI visits (1.6% vs. the 2.6% baseline), yet acknowledges a potential uptick in the coming weeks as flu activity often rises seasonally. This aligns with the observed pattern of stabilization between weeks (e.g., 1010 → 1176 → 1464) in the time-series data, suggesting a gradual increase towards 1856 as influenza season progresses.
