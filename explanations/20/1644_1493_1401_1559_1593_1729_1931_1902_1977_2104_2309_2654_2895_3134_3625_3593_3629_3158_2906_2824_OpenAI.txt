- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are projected to reach 2108 due to the observed increases in influenza activity in certain regions, particularly in areas like the northeast and northwest. Historical time-series data shows a seasonal rise during this period, as seen in weeks 10-15 (e.g., ILI values increased from 2104 to 3625). Additionally, virologic surveillance reports indicate that Influenza A(H3N2), which is less antigenically similar to vaccine strains, is the predominant virus. Despite outpatient visits for ILI remaining below baseline, the consistent rise in hospitalization rates over recent weeks (from 8.9 to 16.7 per 100,000) suggests expanding severe cases, supporting a prediction of 2108 ILI occurrences.
