Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 1598 after 5 weeks can be attributed to seasonally increasing influenza activity, as indicated by the observed previous time-series trend where ILI cases (e.g., 949, 1099, 1213, 1209, 1496) showed a steady rise in recent weeks, aligning with the CDC's anticipation that "current flu activity remains low, but it may increase in the coming months." Despite currently low positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive) and below-baseline outpatient ILI visits (1.6%), the pattern of rising occurrences and historical seasonality suggests a forecasted increase to 1598 within 5 weeks.
