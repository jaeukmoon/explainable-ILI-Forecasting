The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is 6147 due to increasing ILI trends reflected in the time-series data where recent occurrences suggest a rising trend, particularly between weeks 15 to 19 (1800, 1802, 2296, 2297, 2658, 2589). This rise aligns with the news report highlighting higher pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality (7.1% exceeding the epidemic threshold of 5.6%) and Influenza A (H1N1) dominance (70.5% of cases), indicating increased influenza impact. Despite current low ILI activity reported (1.3% patient visits below the 2.6% baseline), these synergistic factors of rising trends, virus strain dominance, and mortality rates imply a significant increase in future ILI occurrences.
