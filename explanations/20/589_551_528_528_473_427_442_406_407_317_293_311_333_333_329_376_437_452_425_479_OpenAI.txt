- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 497 because while the past ILI trends show a recent increase from 425 to 479 in the last observed weeks, news reports indicate low current influenza activity with only 0.1-0.4% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza and ILI activity remaining below the national baseline (1.0%-1.7%). However, the CDC expects flu activity to increase in the coming weeks, influenced by the delay in transmission patterns and seasonal factors. This aligns with the gradual upward trend in the time-series data, supporting the prediction of a moderate rise to 497.
