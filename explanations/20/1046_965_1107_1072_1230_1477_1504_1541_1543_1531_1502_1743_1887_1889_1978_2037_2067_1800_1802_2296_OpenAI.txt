Based on the past ILI time series, there is a clear increasing trend in cases over the last 20 weeks, especially a sharp increase in the last five weeks (from 1802 to 2296). Recent news reports from CDC surveillance highlight factors contributing to this growth: virologic surveillance detected increasing positivity rates for Influenza A, despite ILI visits being below the baseline (e.g., 1.2-1.3%), while mortality and pneumonia rates (e.g., 6.2-7.1%) remained above epidemic thresholds, suggesting broader respiratory illness impact. Additionally, moderate geographic spread in specific areas hints at localized outbreaks fueling a rise, projecting ILI occurrences to reach 4004 in five weeks based on historical trends and ongoing activity escalation.
