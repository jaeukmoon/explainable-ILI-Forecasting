- Explanation: The predicted future ILI occurrence of 900 in 5 weeks is based on the observed decreasing trend in ILI occurrences from the time-series data, where values declined steadily from 2,529 in week 15 to 1,695 in week 20. Additionally, the CDC surveillance reports indicate that influenza activity is either stable or declining nationally, with outpatient visits for ILI below baseline and co-circulation of other respiratory viruses. Hospitalization and mortality rates remain moderate but not significantly increasing, supporting the expectation of continued declining ILI occurrences.
