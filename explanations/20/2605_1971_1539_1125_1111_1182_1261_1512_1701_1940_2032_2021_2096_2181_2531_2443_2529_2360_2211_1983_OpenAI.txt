- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, the past ILI occurrences show a generally decreasing trend with some fluctuations, indicating that the influenza activity, while still sustained, had mild variations. From the summarized news, it is evident that Influenza A(H3N2) remains the dominant strain, and sporadic activity continues nationally, with hospitalization rates (4.3 per 100,000) and mortality (25.5% of PIC deaths) slightly elevated but lower than pre-pandemic seasons. While outpatient visits due to respiratory illness are stable and just above baseline, co-circulating respiratory viruses and regional variations in ILI activity explain why the future ILI occurrences stabilize at 711 after five weeks, reflecting localized, moderate activity in line with decreasing trends.
