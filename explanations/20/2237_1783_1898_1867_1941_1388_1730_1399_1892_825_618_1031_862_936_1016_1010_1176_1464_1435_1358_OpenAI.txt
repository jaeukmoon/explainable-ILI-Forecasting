- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1789 because of the gradual fluctuations and recovery trends observed in past time-series ILI data. For example, week-to-week values generally oscillated, such as 1941 dropping to 1388 and then increasing to 1730, indicating a tendency to rise after a decline. Additionally, despite currently low influenza activity based on CDC reports (e.g., only 0.1%-0.4% positive respiratory specimens and below-baseline ILI visits), CDC anticipates that flu activity "may increase in the coming weeks," aligning with seasonal trends. This suggests a moderate rise in ILI occurrences, reflected in the projection.
