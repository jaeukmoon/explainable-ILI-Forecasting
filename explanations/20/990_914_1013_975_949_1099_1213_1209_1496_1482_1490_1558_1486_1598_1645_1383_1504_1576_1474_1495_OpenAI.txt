Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences have been gradually increasing, with notable peaks in weeks 9-15 (e.g., 1496 to 1645). Although the summarized news suggests that influenza activity remains below seasonal baselines (e.g., only 0.1% of specimens testing positive for influenza, minimal geographic activity, and low hospitalization rates), the CDC does acknowledge that ILI surveillance may be impacted by COVID-19 and data collection challenges. Additionally, minor fluctuations in outpatient visits (1.1% to 1.3% for ILI) imply a steady but slow rise in activity. The projected ILI occurrence of 2036 in 5 weeks aligns with these observations, reflecting a gradual continuation of the existing upward trend in the time-series data.
