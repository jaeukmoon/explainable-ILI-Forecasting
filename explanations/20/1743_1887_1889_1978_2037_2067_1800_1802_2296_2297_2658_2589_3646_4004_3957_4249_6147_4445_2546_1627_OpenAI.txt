The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 834 due to a marked decline in prior week ILI trends (from values as high as 6147 five weeks ago to 1627 last week) coupled with news indicating low geographic and outpatient influenza activity (with only 2.3% of patient visits attributed to ILI, below the baseline of 2.6%) and most jurisdictions reporting minimal or declining spread of ILI. These combined patterns of declining activity and minimal spread support the predicted lower ILI value of 834 in five weeks.
