The expected future ILI occurrences of 3103 after five weeks is based on the observed decreasing trend in ILI cases from prior weeks in the time-series data (beginning with 9045 and decreasing to 3024), coupled with news reports indicating that influenza activity has been declining overall. Specifically, outpatient visits for respiratory illness, including ILI, have remained below the national baseline in recent weeks, and influenza activity, while still present in certain regions, is sporadic or decreasing across the country. These trends, combined with lower hospitalization rates compared to years before the COVID-19 pandemic and a stable contribution of other respiratory illnesses, support a declining ILI occurrence projection over the short term.
