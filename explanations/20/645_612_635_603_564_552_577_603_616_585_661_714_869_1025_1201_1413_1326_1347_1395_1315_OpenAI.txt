- The future ILI occurrences of 1279 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the observed seasonal increase in ILI cases from the time-series data and the minimal influenza activity reported in the CDC's virologic surveillance. While the past weeks exhibited an increasing trend from 869 to 1413 in weeks 13-16, the summarized news indicates influenza activity remains well below the national baseline of 2.6% (1.1–1.3% in recent weeks), with minimal activity across jurisdictions. However, the rise in ILI cases reflects factors like other circulating respiratory illnesses (possibly impacted by healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to COVID-19) or seasonal behavior-related trends, culminating in the forecasted increase to 1279.
