- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks being 3,614 can be explained by the overall declining seasonal influenza activity observed in the time-series data and CDC surveillance reports. Recent weeks show a consistent decrease in ILI percentages below the national baseline (e.g., 1.7% in recent reports) and low virologic detections of influenza (e.g., Influenza-positive rates remaining below 0.5% in clinical and long-term care facilities). Hospitalization rates have also stayed relatively low, at 4.5 per 100,000, while mortality rates are slightly above threshold due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19. These declines align with the observed downward trend in the weekly time-series data, approaching the stable levels seen in Week 20's 2,196 cases. This suggests that ILI occurrences will stabilize and remain low, resulting in the predicted future value.
