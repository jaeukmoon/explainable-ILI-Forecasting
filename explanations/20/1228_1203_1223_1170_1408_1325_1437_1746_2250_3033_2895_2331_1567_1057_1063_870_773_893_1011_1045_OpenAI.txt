- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 1,474 after 5 weeks can be explained by the recent upward trend in ILI surveillance data, with outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses steadily increasing towards the national baseline as seen in Weeks 45–52. Despite activity being lower than historical pre-COVID baselines, a gradual rise in influenza A (H3N2) virus circulation, along with moderate ILI activity in some jurisdictions, indicates a continuing increase in cases. CDC's expectation of rising flu activity, coupled with reports of low but increasing ILI trends, aligns with the observed fluctuations in past data, where peaks were followed by gradual declines, such as between Weeks 10-14, aligning with the projected value.
