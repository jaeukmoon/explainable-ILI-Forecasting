The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is projected to be 3711 because, despite current ILI activity being slightly below the national baseline (e.g., ILINet data indicating 1.2–1.3% of patient visits are due to ILI), the time-series trend shows a consistent increase in weekly ILI occurrences over the past weeks, with recent values nearing 4030. This gradual rise aligns with historical seasonal trends which indicate that ILI activity tends to increase during certain periods of the flu season, coupled with slight geographic variation reported and adequate viral tracking by CDC surveillance systems.
