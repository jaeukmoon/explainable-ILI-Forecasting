Future ILI occurrences are predicted to increase to 777 in five weeks based on the recent rising trend in the time series, where ILI occurrences have gradually increased from 607 to 795 over the last five weeks. Despite current influenza activity remaining unusually low (0.1%-0.4% positivity rates in clinical labs), the CDC has explicitly noted in its reports across weeks that flu activity is expected to increase in the coming months. Additionally, while ILI activity levels remain minimal, the slightly above-threshold PIC-related mortality (13.6%-14.5%) reflects potential respiratory illness risks, supporting an anticipated modest rise in ILI cases.
