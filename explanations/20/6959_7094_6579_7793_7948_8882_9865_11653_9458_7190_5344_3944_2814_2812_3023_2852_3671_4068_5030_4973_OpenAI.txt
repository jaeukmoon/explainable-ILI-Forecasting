- Explanation: The predicted influenza-like illness (ILI) occurrences of 5839 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the slight decline in recent ILI cases from Week 10, coupled with an overall increasing trend of influenza activity in prior weeks, particularly in specific geographical regions. The percentage of outpatient visits for ILI remains below the national baseline, but localized moderate or high activity, as well as hospitalizations due to Influenza A(H3N2), indicate continuous transmission. Thus, the projected future ILI cases reflect the interplay of declining transmission in some areas, stable outpatient ILI rates, and ongoing circulation of Influenza A(H3N2) in certain regions.
