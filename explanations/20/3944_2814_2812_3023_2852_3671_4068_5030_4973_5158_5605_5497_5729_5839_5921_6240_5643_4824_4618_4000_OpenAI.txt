The future ILI occurrences of 3231 after 5 weeks can be explained by the consistent decrease in influenza activity observed in recent weeks, as indicated by the time-series data that shows a downward trend in ILI occurrences from 6240 in week 15 to 4000 in week 20. This is supported by surveillance reports that highlight a drop in respiratory illness percentages below baseline levels, a reduction in virologic detection rates, and stable or declining outpatient visits for ILI. Additionally, hospitalization and mortality rates related to influenza remain manageable, with no significant pediatric deaths or severe outbreaks reported, suggesting ongoing stabilization of influenza activity in monitored regions.
