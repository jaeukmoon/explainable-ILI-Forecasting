The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are likely 1817 due to increasing trends observed in the time-series data, where ILI levels rose from 1358 to 1759 in recent weeks—indicating a shift towards higher activity. Furthermore, CDC reports suggest unusually low influenza activity currently, with ILI percentages persistently below the baseline (e.g., 1.6%), but with potential for increase in the coming months. Although nationwide activity remains minimal, the CDC’s caution about potential rises, public health lab surveillance, and vaccination strategies suggest gradual growth, aligning with the reported future ILI occurrence of 1817.
