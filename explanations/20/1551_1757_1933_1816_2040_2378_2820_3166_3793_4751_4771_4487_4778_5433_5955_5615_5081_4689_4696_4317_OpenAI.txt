The future Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to reach 3,318 based on the time-series data and surveillance analysis. The past data indicates a seasonal flu activity peak around weeks 9 to 14 with a subsequent decline (e.g., occurrences peak at 5,955 in week 14 and decline to 4,317 in week 20). The surveillance reports reveal that ILI activity nationally remains below baseline, but regional variations and increased co-circulation of respiratory viruses, such as influenza A(H3N2), persist. With hospitalization rates slightly elevated yet below pre-COVID-19 levels (17.1 per 100,000), and outpatient visit percentages stabilizing, the gradual decline is consistent with seasonal patterns and explains the projected value of 3,318 in line with downward trends.
