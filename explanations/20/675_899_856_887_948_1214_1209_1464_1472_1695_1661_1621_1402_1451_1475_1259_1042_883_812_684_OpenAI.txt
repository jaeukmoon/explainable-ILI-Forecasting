The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 607 due to a consistent trend of declining ILI activity observed in the past 20 weeks, coupled with virologic surveillance indicating low influenza activity. Over this period, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza remained very low (e.g., 0.2%-0.3%), outpatient ILI visits consistently stayed below the national baseline of 2.6% (e.g., 1.6% in recent weeks), and most jurisdictions reported minimal or low ILI activity. These patterns, along with CDC expectations of continued low flu activity despite a possible gradual increase, align with the observed reduction in ILI occurrences and the prediction of 607 cases in 5 weeks.
