The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to reach 1140 due to the upward trend observed in the time-series data, where ILI occurrences have consistently risen from 661 in Week 13 to 1347 in Week 20, showing a spike in activity. While the news reports suggest minimal influenza activity as virologic surveillance consistently indicates only 0.1%-1.3% of specimens testing positive for influenza and ILI percentages remaining below the baseline (ranging from 1.1%-1.3%), the rapid rise in actual ILI data is likely driven by other respiratory illnesses or healthcare-seeking behaviors influenced by seasonal factors, rather than influenza alone.
