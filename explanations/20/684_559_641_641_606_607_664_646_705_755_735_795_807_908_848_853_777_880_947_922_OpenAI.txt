The projected future ILI occurrences of 1609 after 5 weeks can be attributed to a consistent gradual increase in recent weekly ILI counts observed in the time-series data, which escalates from 684 to 947 over 20 weeks, along with a notable increase in patient visits for ILI from minimal (below baseline of 2.6%) to heightened trends as stated in the surveillance reports. The continuation of lower-than-usual vaccination rates, minimal pandemic restrictions easing, and hospitalizations or mortality above the epidemic threshold may contribute to a sustained increase, despite generally low virologic activity (e.g., 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive). These combined trends suggest a gradual rise leading to the predicted 1609 occurrences.
