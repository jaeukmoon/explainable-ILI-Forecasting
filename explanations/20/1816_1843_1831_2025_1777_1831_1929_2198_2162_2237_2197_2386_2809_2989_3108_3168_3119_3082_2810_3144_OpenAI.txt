The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 4094 because the time-series data indicates a consistent increasing trend over the last several weeks, with ILI occurrences going from 2809 to 3144. Additionally, while news reports consistently state that influenza activity has been below the national baseline, there has been a slight uptick in reported ILI activity (e.g., an increase in outpatient visits for ILI from 1.1% to 1.3% and 1.4% over recent weeks). The geographic spread data also shows minimal but steady activity across jurisdictions, suggesting gradual growth. These factors combined contribute to the projected increase in ILI occurrences.
