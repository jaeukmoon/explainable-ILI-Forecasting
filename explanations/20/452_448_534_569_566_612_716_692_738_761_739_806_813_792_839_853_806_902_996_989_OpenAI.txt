- Explanation: The increase in ILI occurrences to 1783 after five weeks can be attributed to the seasonal upward trend in ILI cases evident in the provided time-series data, which shows consistent increases in ILI occurrences during recent weeks (e.g., rising from 902 to 996, and then to 989). Despite the current low influenza activity reported in the surveillance data (e.g., only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive and ILI visits remaining below the 2.6% baseline), the CDC has warned that flu activity, though currently minimal, is expected to increase in the coming weeks. This aligns with the sustained seasonal trend reflected in the time-series.
