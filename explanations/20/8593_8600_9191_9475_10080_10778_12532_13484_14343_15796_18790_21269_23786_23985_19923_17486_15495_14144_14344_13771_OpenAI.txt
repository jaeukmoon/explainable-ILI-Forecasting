The future ILI occurrence of 13,526 after five weeks can be explained by observing past trends and current surveillance data. The time-series data show a consistent decrease in ILI cases over the most recent weeks (from 23,985 to 13,771) following a sharp peak, indicating a downward trend post-peak influenza activity. Additionally, surveillance reports confirm that while influenza activity remained regionally variable, outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses remained below baseline and steadily declined nationally. This aligns with monitoring data indicating influenza activity in some regions is stabilizing or declining, with fewer lab-confirmed positive cases. These factors collectively suggest a predicted stabilization of cases near 13,526.
