- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 848 due to the declining trend in past ILI time-series data and the consistently low flu activity described in the summarized news. Recent news highlights a 0.1%-0.4% positivity rate for influenza tests, below the national baseline of 2.6% ILI activity, and reports minimal activity across jurisdictions, with no significant increases in flu-associated hospitalizations or deaths. This aligns with the steady decrease observed in ILI occurrences over the weeks from 1,695 to 755, indicating a continuation of the decline to reach 848 in five weeks.
