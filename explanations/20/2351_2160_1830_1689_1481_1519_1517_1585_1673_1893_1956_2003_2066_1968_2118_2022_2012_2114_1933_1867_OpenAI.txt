The future ILI occurrence of 2482 after 5 weeks can be attributed to a steady rise in ILI cases, evidenced by the past time-series data where ILI occurrences increased from 1830 in week 3 to 2114 in week 17. This trend coincides with the CDC surveillance reports showing minimal influenza activity but acknowledgment of potential increases. The gradual easing of influenza fluctuations, combined with influenza vaccination efforts highlighted in the news and the potential overlaps with other respiratory infections (including COVID-19), aligns with the projection of moderate ILI growth over the next 5 weeks.
