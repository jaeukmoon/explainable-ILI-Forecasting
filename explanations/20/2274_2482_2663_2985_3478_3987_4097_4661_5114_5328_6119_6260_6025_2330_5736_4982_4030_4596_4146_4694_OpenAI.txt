- Explanation: The time-series data indicates a seasonal trend of increasing ILI occurrences, supported by periodic spikes such as 6260 in Week 12. News reports highlight increasing positivity rates of Influenza A (H3N2), with most activity among children and young adults (5-24 years), and ILI visits rising in recent weeks (still below baseline). The geographical spread report shows minimal to moderate activity, suggesting emerging hotspots. These factors, coupled with historical trends predicting a peak 5 weeks after substantial ILI increases, reasonably estimate future ILI occurrences to reach 7527.
