- Explanation: Based on the time series data, ILI occurrences have shown a significant decreasing trend from week 15 onward (e.g., 11653 in week 15 to 2814 in week 20), indicating waning influenza activity. The CDC reports low influenza activity with outpatient ILI visits below the national baseline (1.4% compared to 2.4%) and minimal flu activity in most regions, except for localized moderate activity in Louisiana. Additionally, virologic surveillance indicates that only 3.1% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza, with no severe indicators like pediatric deaths reported. These factors collectively suggest that, consistent with declining trends and current minimal influenza circulation, future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to stabilize at 4068.
