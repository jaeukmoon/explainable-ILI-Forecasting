The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 5879 primarily because of the observed consistent upward trend in the time-series data, where ILI occurrences rise significantly over time, particularly in the last 10 weeks (from 1376 to 3010). This pattern aligns with seasonal trends seen in historical influenza surveillance data, where flu activity increases during certain periods. Although the CDC reports indicate overall low influenza activity (e.g., only 1.2%-1.3% of visits due to ILI, respiratory specimen positivity at 0.1%, and minimal activity across jurisdictions), other respiratory illnesses and behavioral factors during flu season (e.g., reduced vaccinations or shifting healthcare-seeking patterns due to the pandemic) may account for the continuing increase. These combined trends and real-world data explain why ILI occurrences are projected to reach 5879.
