The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 3119 because the time-series data show a consistent gradual increase in ILI cases in recent weeks (e.g., rising from 2162 to 2386 over the last 5 weeks), indicating an upward trend. Additionally, despite overall low influenza activity as reported in the news, the CDC forecasts that flu activity "may increase in the coming months." This suggests the gradual increase in ILI cases aligns with expectations of a possible resurgence, explaining the predicted value.
