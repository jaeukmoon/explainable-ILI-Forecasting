- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks being 661 can be attributed to a steady increase in past ILI numbers, as seen in the time-series data, where occurrences rose from 564, 603, 635, to 645 in recent weeks. This gradual trend suggests rising flu activity over time. Coupled with news data, although influenza activity is reportedly low in general, the percentage of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) is above the epidemic threshold, at 14.8%. These mortality indicators and past increasing trends likely contributed to the prediction of higher future ILI occurrences, reaching 661.
