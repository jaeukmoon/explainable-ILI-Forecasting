- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 5846 because while current influenza activity is low (evidenced by the most recent weeks showing small values like 2584, 2356, and 2342 in the time-series data), the upward trend is beginning with outpatient visits for ILI surpassing the national baseline at 4.8%, hospitalizations for influenza increasing, and geographical variations showing moderate to very high activity in some jurisdictions. Additionally, Influenza A(H3N2) circulation, which is predominant, suggests a resurgence similar to historical patterns seen in weeks with similar conditions.
