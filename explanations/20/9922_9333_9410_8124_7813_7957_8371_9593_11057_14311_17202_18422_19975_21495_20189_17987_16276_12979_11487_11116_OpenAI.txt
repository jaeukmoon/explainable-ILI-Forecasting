The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are expected to reach 13,895 due to a clear upward trend in the time-series data as seen in recent weeks (e.g., '12979', '11487', '11116'), and the historical pattern of increasing ILI occurrences during mid-to-late flu seasons. Additionally, despite reports of current influenza activity being below the national baseline, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza and recent high ILI activity in some regions suggest a potential resurgence. The ongoing effects of seasonal influenza combined with factors like potential underreporting due to overlapping COVID-19 symptoms further supports this increase.
