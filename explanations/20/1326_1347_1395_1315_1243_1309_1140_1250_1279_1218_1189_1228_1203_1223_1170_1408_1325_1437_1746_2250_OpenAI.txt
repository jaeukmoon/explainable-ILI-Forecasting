- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks can reach 1057 because the time-series data indicates a declining trend in ILI occurrences, dropping consistently over the past weeks (e.g., 2250 → 1746 → 1437 → 1325). This reflects the overall low influenza activity reported in the summaries, such as a percentage of patient visits for ILI below the national baseline and low influenza virus circulation, with most ILI activity attributed to other respiratory viruses. Therefore, the decreasing trend and the low circulation of influenza viruses align with the prediction of ILI occurrences stabilizing at 1057 in 5 weeks.
