- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 2736 based on the sharp upward trend observed in the time-series data over the past weeks, where ILI occurrences consistently increased from 1496 to 2751 over 20 weeks, particularly in the last five weeks (2285, 2456, 2751). This trend indicates a rapid escalation driven by potential increases in respiratory illnesses as restrictions eased globally, despite news reports indicating minimal current influenza activity (e.g., only 1.2% visits for ILI, below the 2.6% baseline). The prediction accounts for ongoing changes in health-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic and emphasizes a potential rebound in cases as flu vaccination rates remain low and the ILI baseline has been repeatedly underreported.
