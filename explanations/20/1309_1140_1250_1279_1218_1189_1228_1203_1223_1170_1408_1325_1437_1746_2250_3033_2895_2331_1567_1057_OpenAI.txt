- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, the ILI occurrences have consistently declined over the last few weeks, moving from 3033 at week 15 to 1057 at week 20. Meanwhile, the summarized surveillance data indicates that influenza activity remains low, outpatient visits for ILI are below the national baseline, and there has been sporadic or minimal geographic influenza activity in most regions. However, CDC expects influenza activity to potentially increase in the coming weeks. Hence, the predicted ILI occurrence of 1011 after five weeks reflects this slight potential increase combined with the overall low activity trend observed in the time series and surveillance data.
