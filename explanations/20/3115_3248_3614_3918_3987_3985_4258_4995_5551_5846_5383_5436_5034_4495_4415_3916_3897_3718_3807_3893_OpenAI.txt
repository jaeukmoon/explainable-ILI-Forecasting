The future Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) occurrence of 4129 after 5 weeks is predicted based on observed past patterns and reported trends. The time-series data shows a declining trend in ILI occurrences over the last six weeks, with a peak at week 10 (5846 cases) followed by a steady decrease to 3893 in week 20. This is supported by news indicating that while influenza activity is increasing in some areas, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI remains below the national baseline, and the majority of regions report low or minimal activity. Additionally, influenza-related hospitalizations and pediatric deaths are lower compared to pre-COVID seasons, suggesting a mild trend overall. These combined factors support the expected stabilization of occurrences near 4129.
