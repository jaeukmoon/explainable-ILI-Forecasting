The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 17,486 based on the upward trend observed in the time-series data and supporting surveillance reports indicating increasing activity. From past ILI occurrences, there is a steady increase over recent weeks, rising from 14,343 in Week 18 to 18,790 in Week 20, showing consistent growth. Additionally, surveillance data highlights increasing outpatient visits for respiratory illness, with influenza A(H3N2) remaining dominant, and cumulative hospitalization rates also trending higher. These factors suggest that ILI activity will continue to rise, aligning with the projected future occurrence.
