- Explanation: The prediction of future ILI occurrences (1971 in 5 weeks) is based on the historical time-series pattern and the surveillance data. The time-series shows a generally increasing trend in ILI cases, with occasional dips. Recent weeks (e.g., 2190, 2313) demonstrate high activity. While ILI outpatient surveillance reports percentages below the national baseline (e.g., 2.0%, 2.1%, 2.2%), the percentage of patient visits is increasing across certain regions and age groups, signaling potential higher activity to come. Coupled with the geographic variation and regional spikes mentioned, the projections align with the 5-week horizon increase to align with such growth trends.
