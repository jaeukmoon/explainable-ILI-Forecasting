The prediction of 3720 ILI cases after five weeks is likely based on the historical time-series data showing periodic fluctuations in ILI occurrences and a recent upward trend. The time-series shows that following weeks of low activity, ILI cases tend to increase significantly, as seen prior to weeks 17-20 (e.g., from 3492 to 5394). Additionally, the news reports indicate increasing trends in ILI activity, with certain age groups showing higher ILI percentages and circulating respiratory viruses other than influenza spreading. Despite influenza activity remaining below the national baseline, other factors such as changes in healthcare-seeking behavior or the circulation of other respiratory viruses appear to contribute to a gradual increase in ILI cases, consistent with seasonal and surveillance patterns.
