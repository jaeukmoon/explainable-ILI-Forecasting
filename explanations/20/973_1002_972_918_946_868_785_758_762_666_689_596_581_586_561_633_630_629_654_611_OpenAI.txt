- Explanation: The predicted future ILI occurrences of 919 after 5 weeks is due to indications of increasing influenza activity in some regions, supported by steady or slightly increasing outpatient visits for respiratory illness in recent weeks, such as 2.2% in week 17 and a general upward trend since February. While the percentage of visits for ILI remains below the baseline, the co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, high hospitalization rates (e.g., 16.7 per 100,000 population in week 21), and the predominance of Influenza A(H3N2) suggest sustained moderate activity. These trends align with the cyclic pattern in the time-series data, which shows periodic increases around this point, following a previous decrease to 611. Hence, the projected value reflects stabilization and subsequent expected growth in ILI occurrences.
