- Explanation: The increase in future ILI occurrences to 6771 in five weeks is attributed to the observed upward trend in influenza activity coupled with impactful regional increases. The historical time-series data shows a steady ILI increase over recent weeks, such as 4487, 4778, 5433, 5955, indicating a pattern of growth. News reports emphasize an upward trend in respiratory illnesses, with Influenza A(H3N2) being the dominant subtype, co-circulating viruses, and a slight but steady increase in hospitalization rates (rising from 12.2 to 14.4 per 100,000). While ILI outpatient visits remain below baseline, they have been trending upwards across age groups since February, supporting a forecasted continuation of growth in cases.
