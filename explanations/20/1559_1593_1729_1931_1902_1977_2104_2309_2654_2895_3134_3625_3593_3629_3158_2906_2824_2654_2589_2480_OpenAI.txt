The future ILI occurrences of 1928 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the following patterns and facts: The past time-series data shows a declining trend in ILI occurrences over recent weeks, moving from a peak of 3625 in week 12 to 2480 in week 20, indicating a gradual decrease in activity. However, news reports indicate that while influenza activity declined in some regions, it's increasing in others (e.g., northeast and northwest), and hospitalizations are still gradually rising due to influenza A(H3N2). Antigenic differences between circulating viruses and vaccine reference strains may lead to sustained but less prominent ILI activity, combined with the continued co-circulation of other respiratory viruses. Thus, the expected 1928 occurrences represent a continuation of the gradual decline while accounting for regional variability and ongoing moderate transmission.
