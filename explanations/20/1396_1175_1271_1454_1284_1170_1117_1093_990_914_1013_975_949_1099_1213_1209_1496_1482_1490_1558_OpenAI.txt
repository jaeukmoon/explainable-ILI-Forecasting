- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks reaching 1504 can be attributed to an observed upward trend in ILI cases from the time-series data, where the most recent weeks showed steady increases in values (e.g., 1454 → 1496 → 1482 → 1490 → 1558), indicating growing activity. Although the news reports highlighted minimal influenza activity and low positive test percentages (0.1%-0.4%), the CDC cautioned against interpreting these figures without considering the potential increase in the coming months and other factors such as COVID-19 impacts. This aligns with the natural variability expected in ILI cases, supported by the consistent recommendation for vaccination and antiviral use to mitigate further increases.
