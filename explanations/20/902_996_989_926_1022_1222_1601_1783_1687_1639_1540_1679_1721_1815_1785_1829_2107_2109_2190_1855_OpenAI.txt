As the past time-series ILI data shows a consistent upward trend over several weeks, peaking at week 18 (from 902 to 2190 ILI occurrences), there is a clear pattern of seasonal increase. In conjunction with the CDC report, which notes an increase in influenza virus detections, predominance of active Influenza A, and regions with moderate influenza activity, these dynamics indicate a steady rise in infection rates over time. Additionally, although current percentages of ILI visits and mortality rates surpass epidemic thresholds, vaccination and antiviral treatments remain critical but may lag in impact due to this seasonal momentum. Together, these factors align to predict future ILI occurrences rising to 3231 after 5 weeks.
