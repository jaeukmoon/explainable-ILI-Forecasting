The expected ILI occurrence of 425 in 5 weeks is explained by sustained low influenza activity reflected in both virologic and outpatient surveillance data, along with seasonal trends. Virologic data showed a consistently low percentage (0.1-0.4%) of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza across clinical laboratories. Outpatient surveillance indicated that ILI visits remained below the national baseline (2.6%), hovering between 1.1-1.7%, with most regions reporting minimal ILI activity. These patterns align with historical time-series data showing a consistent decrease in ILI occurrences over recent weeks, from 686 to 333, emphasizing a stable decline. Given the low current activity and anticipation of future increases as the flu season progresses, the estimate of 425 represents a moderate bounce-back influenced by expected seasonal dynamics.
