Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences had been trending downwards over the last five weeks (values decreasing from 1858 to 1196), signaling a decline in influenza activity. The CDC's news reports confirm that influenza activity has been decreasing nationally, with outpatient visits for ILI remaining below baseline, and virologic surveillance indicates a low positivity rate for respiratory specimens (e.g., 1.4%). Additionally, hospitalization and mortality statistics, though higher than some previous seasons, have stabilized, and the proportional contribution of co-circulating respiratory viruses dilutes influenza's impact. These factors collectively suggest a continued reduction in ILI occurrences, leading to a projection of 719 ILI cases at the five-week mark.
