- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 1239 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the observed trend of declining influenza activity in recent weeks, as seen in the time series data where ILI cases reduced significantly from 4327 in week 9 to 1731 in week 20. Additionally, the news highlights decreasing outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses, lower hospitalization rates (17.1 per 100,000 population), and reduced positive influenza tests, indicating a downward trend. This aligns with the observed trajectory in ILI occurrences, suggesting a stabilization in influenza impact.
