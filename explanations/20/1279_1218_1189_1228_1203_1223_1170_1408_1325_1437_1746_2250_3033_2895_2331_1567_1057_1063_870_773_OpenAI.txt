The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1117 due to the consistent decline in past ILI occurrences (from 1279 to 773 over 20 weeks) combined with continued reports of low and sporadic influenza activity in recent weeks across the United States. Virologic surveillance shows a low percentage (0.2-1.5%) of specimens testing positive for influenza, outpatient ILI visits remain below the national baseline, and influenza-associated indicators such as hospitalizations and pediatric deaths are minimal. These factors indicate that the decreasing trend in ILI occurrences is likely to persist, resulting in a low ILI number of 1117 in 5 weeks.
