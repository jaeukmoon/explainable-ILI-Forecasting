- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 3522 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the observed seasonal pattern of increasing activity in Influenza A(H3N2) viruses, as reported in the news, combined with the recent hospitalization data indicating cumulative increases (e.g., 16.7 per 100,000 population). Additionally, outpatient ILI rates have been trending upward nationally with regional variation, particularly in areas with moderate to high activity. The antigenic differences between circulating H3N2 viruses and vaccine reference strains, along with the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, suggest sustained transmission, underlying the predicted ILI occurrence of 3522 in 5 weeks.
