- Explanation: Based on the trend in the time-series data, influenza-like illness (ILI) occurrences have been steadily decreasing for 20 weeks, from 2084 in Week 1 to 689 in Week 20, reflecting a consistent downward trend. The CDC reports confirm that influenza activity has been sporadic and its overall contribution to respiratory illness remains low, with pandemic prevention measures, such as vaccination and existing antiviral treatments, likely mitigating the spread. Coupled with stable outpatient respiratory illness visits below the baseline, it is expected that the downward trend will continue, leading to a predicted ILI occurrence of 633 in five weeks.
