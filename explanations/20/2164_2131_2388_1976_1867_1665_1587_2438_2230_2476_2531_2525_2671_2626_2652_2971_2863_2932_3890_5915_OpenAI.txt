The projected ILI occurrences of 1901 after 5 weeks are attributed to the observed decreasing trend in past ILI time-series data, where ILI occurrences peaked at 5915 in Week 20 and subsequently declined to 1587 in Week 7. This trend aligns with news reports indicating low influenza activity across most regions, such as a 2.2% ILI patient visit rate below baseline, low virus circulation, and minimal influenza-related hospitalizations or deaths. Additionally, the influence of other respiratory viruses and changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic likely affected ILI reporting, reinforcing the overall decline predicted for future weeks.
