The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 8319 due to the observed increasing trend in ILI activity as reported in both the virologic and outpatient illness surveillance systems. Specifically, the percentage of outpatient visits due to ILI is rising (e.g., reaching or surpassing baseline levels in some regions), and indicators like moderate to high ILI activity in various jurisdictions suggest growing influenza circulation, predominantly of Influenza A (H3N2). Historical time-series data also support this projection, with steady increases in ILI cases during prior weeks, such as from 4694 to 6069 and 6549 last recorded, indicating an upward trajectory consistent with seasonal trends.
