Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 4982 because the time-series data shows a steady and significant upward trend in weekly ILI occurrences, with the last 5 weeks increasing from 4097 to 6119. Despite CDC reports indicating low influenza activity (e.g., only 1.3% of outpatient visits being due to ILI, below the 2.6% national baseline), historical data strongly suggests sustained exponential growth, likely driven by non-influenza respiratory illnesses or delayed healthcare-seeking behaviors during the pandemic.
