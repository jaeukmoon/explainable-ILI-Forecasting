The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to reach 1243 due to a consistent upward trend observed in recent time-series data, where ILI cases have steadily increased from 405 to 1413 over 20 weeks, particularly accelerating in the last few weeks (e.g., from 869 to 1413). Furthermore, despite current CDC surveillance reporting low influenza activity (e.g., nationwide respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza remain at 0.1%, below the baseline of 2.6%, and all jurisdictions having minimal ILI activity), this trend may be influenced by non-flu factors such as COVID-19 or seasonal behavior changes that impact ILI reports and healthcare-seeking patterns. The cumulative increase and preliminary ILI activity trends support this prediction.
