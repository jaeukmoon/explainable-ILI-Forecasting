- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences have shown a consistent decline over the past weeks, from 849 in week 1 to 349 in week 20, reflecting an overall decreasing trend. Additionally, surveillance news reports suggest unusually low influenza activity, with only 0.1%-0.4% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza and ILI visits remaining below the national baseline (2.6%). Most jurisdictions report minimal activity, indicating suppressed flu transmission. While flu activity might increase slightly in upcoming weeks, as CDC expects, the continued low positivity rates and declining historical trend directly support the prediction that ILI occurrences after five additional weeks will be at 382.
