- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 11,715 based on the trend in past time-series data showing a recent decrease in ILI occurrences (from 23,786 to 14,344 over the last five weeks), combined with CDC reports indicating that ILI activity, although increasing slightly in some regions, remains below the national baseline. Reports of co-circulating respiratory viruses and lower flu-related outpatient visits further support a moderated projection of ILI occurrences stabilizing at a lower level. Vaccination efforts and antiviral treatment accessibility also contribute to controlling the spread.
