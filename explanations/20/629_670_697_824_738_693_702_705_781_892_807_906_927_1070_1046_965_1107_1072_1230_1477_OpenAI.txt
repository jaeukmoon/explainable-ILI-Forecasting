Explanation: The increase in ILI occurrences to 1502 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the recent upward trend in the time-series data—where ILI counts have been steadily rising from 965, 1107, 1072, 1230, to 1477 over the last few weeks—indicating growing activity. Additionally, even though the news indicates minimal ILI activity nationally (below the 2.6% baseline) with only 0.1% of specimens testing positive, the CDC warns that flu activity is expected to increase in the upcoming months, suggesting a potential lag effect leading to the observed significant jump.
