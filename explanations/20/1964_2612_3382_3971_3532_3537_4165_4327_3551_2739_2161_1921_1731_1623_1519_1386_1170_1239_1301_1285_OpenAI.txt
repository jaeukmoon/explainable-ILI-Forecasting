- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences demonstrate a downward trend over the last few weeks, dropping from 1964 to 1285. Meanwhile, news reports indicated stable or decreasing influenza activity in many regions, with ILI percentages remaining below baseline (e.g., reports of 1.9%, 2.2%) and virologic surveillance suggesting a low percentage of specimens were positive for influenza. Coupled with declining hospitalization rates and stable mortality rates for respiratory illnesses, these factors strongly suggest that influenza activity has been stabilizing and decreasing overall. This trend, combined with the reported regional variability and co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, accurately predicts future ILI occurrences dropping to 1430 in 5 weeks.
