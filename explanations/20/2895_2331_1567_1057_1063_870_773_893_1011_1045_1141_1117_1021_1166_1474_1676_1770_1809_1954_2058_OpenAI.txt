- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences reaching 1196 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the steady decline in ILI rates observed in the time-series data, where occurrences dropped from 2895 to 2058 over the past 20 weeks. Additionally, according to the news reports, influenza activity remains sporadic in certain regions and below baseline nationally. Respiratory illnesses due to influenza have been influenced by the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, while vaccination and antiviral treatments continue to help mitigate the impact. These trends, combined with the ongoing surveillance and stable conditions, indicate a continued controlled decline in ILI occurrences to the projected level of 1196.
