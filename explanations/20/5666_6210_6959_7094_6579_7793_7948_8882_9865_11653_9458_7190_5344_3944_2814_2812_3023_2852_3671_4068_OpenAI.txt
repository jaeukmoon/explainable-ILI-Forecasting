- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 5497 based on the historical trend in the time-series data, which shows a consistent seasonal decline in ILI occurrences starting from week 11 onward (e.g., from 11653 in week 10 to 5344 in week 13). News reports indicate that influenza activity remains low, with outpatient visits for ILI below the baseline and only sporadic activity in most regions. Combined with the downward seasonal trend observed in past time-series data, this justifies a continued decline in ILI cases, resulting in the prediction of 5497 occurrences after 5 weeks.
