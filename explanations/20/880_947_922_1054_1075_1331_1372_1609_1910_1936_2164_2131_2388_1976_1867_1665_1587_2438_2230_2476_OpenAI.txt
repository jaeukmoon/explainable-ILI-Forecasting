- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2,652 based on the consistent upward trend observed in the time-series data, where ILI cases increased significantly (e.g., from '1587' to '2438' and then '2476'), and the surveillance updates indicating that ILI rates, though below the national baseline, have been gradually increasing. Coupled with reports of concentrated influenza A activity in specific jurisdictions and increasing levels of pneumonia/influenza/COVID-19 mortality above the epidemic threshold, these factors suggest heightened flu activity in the following weeks.
