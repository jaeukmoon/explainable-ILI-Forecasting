- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2750 based on trends in the time series data and news reports. The time-series shows that ILI occurrences peaked and are now generally declining over the last 10 weeks, dropping from 5955 in Week 5 to 3318 in Week 20, signaling a downward trajectory. Based on the news, while flu activity varied by region, outpatient visits for ILI remained stable or below baseline nationally, and multiple respiratory viruses, not just influenza, were contributing to ILI. Additionally, reports indicate cumulative hospitalization rates for flu were lower than pre-COVID seasons, signaling less intense overall activity, consistent with a predicted moderate ILI value of 2750.
