The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 4445 due to an increasing trend observed in the past time-series data, where occurrences rose sharply from 1802 to 2296, 2658, and 3646 in sequential weeks. This indicates a continuous rise in ILI activity. Additionally, CDC reports suggest that while recent ILI percentages are below the national baseline (e.g., 1.4% for visits), trends show an increase in outpatient visits for ILI and geographic activity, with certain regions reporting moderate activity. Influenza A (H3N2) predominates, and public health labs note rising virus detections, while CDC anticipates flu activity to escalate in the coming weeks, aligning with seasonal trends.
