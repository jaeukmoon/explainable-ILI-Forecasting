- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 948 is predicted based on the observed declining trend in past time-series ILI occurrences (from peaks at 2919 and 2536 to a low of 1114 in Week 20) combined with news data indicating that influenza activity remains low with sporadic or minimal geographic spread in most jurisdictions, outpatient visits for ILI below the national baseline of 2.5%, and no severe disease indicators like pediatric deaths or escalating hospitalizations reported. Public health surveillance and vaccination efforts are managing the low flu activity effectively, aligning with predictions of a continued decrease in ILI cases.
