- Explanation: Based on the provided time-series ILI occurrences and news insights, ILI occurrences after 5 weeks stabilize at 762 due to an observed trend of decreasing influenza activity in prior weeks coupled with steady outpatient respiratory illness visits and low percentages of positive influenza specimens in clinical laboratories. Although influenza A(H3N2) viruses remained predominant, the ILI activity was reported to remain below the baseline during recent weeks. Additionally, mortality and hospitalization rates above epidemic thresholds, combined with co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, suggest that the ongoing seasonal influenza wave is leveling, leading to the projection of 762 as future ILI occurrences.
