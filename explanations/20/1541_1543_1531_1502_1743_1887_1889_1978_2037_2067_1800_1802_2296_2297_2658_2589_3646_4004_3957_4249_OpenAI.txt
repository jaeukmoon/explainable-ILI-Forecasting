The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 1074 due to a combination of the low but recently increasing influenza activity and regional variations. While the provided historical ILI occurrences show a general decreasing trend after peaking around Week 20, the summarized news underscores that influenza activity is increasing slightly in certain regions, with moderate ILI activity reported in some jurisdictions and the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI trending upwards. However, national averages for ILI (e.g., 2.1%-2.3%) remain below the baseline, and increases are attributed to respiratory viruses other than influenza. Based on this, it is reasonable to assume a continued decrease in national ILI cases, leading to 1074 occurrences in five weeks.
