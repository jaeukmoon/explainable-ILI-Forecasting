The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks being 2131 can be attributed to a steady trend of increasing ILI numbers in the time-series data, where the most recent weeks show consistent increases (e.g., 1054, 1075, 1331, 1372). This upward trend suggests a pattern of growth in ILI activity despite relatively low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% in lab specimens) and ILI visits below the national baseline (0.9-1.3%). Seasonal effects and reduced virologic activity do not fully offset the observed increase, possibly reflecting a combination of delayed spread, healthcare-seeking changes, and overlapping respiratory illnesses like COVID-19 impacting projections.
