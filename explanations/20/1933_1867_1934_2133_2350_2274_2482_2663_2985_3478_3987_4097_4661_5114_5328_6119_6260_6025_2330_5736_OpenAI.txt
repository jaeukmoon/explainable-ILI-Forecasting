- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 4694 based on the evident upward trend in the time-series data, particularly from week 10 ("3478") to week 15 ("5328"), indicating seasonal spikes in activity potentially linked to historical influenza patterns. This aligns with the CDC report stating that ILI data often follow seasonal trends, with variations in virus circulation and healthcare behavior adjustments. Additionally, the variability in geographic spread and the periodic high activity of influenza in certain jurisdictions implied by the reports supports the expected rise in ILI occurrences despite potential external influences like COVID-19.
