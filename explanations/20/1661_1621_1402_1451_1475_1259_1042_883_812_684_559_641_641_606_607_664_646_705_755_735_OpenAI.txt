The future ILI occurrences of 853 after 5 weeks are likely due to the observed increasing trend in ILI levels in the time-series data and CDC's expectations for flu activity to rise. While the initial weeks showed a decline in ILI cases, recent weeks (Weeks 15-20) saw stabilized or slightly increasing cases from 606 to 735, indicating a potential upward shift. Additionally, although current national ILI activity and positive flu specimens remain low, the CDC explicitly noted that flu activity is expected to increase in the coming weeks. This aligns with the gradual resurgence observed in the time-series data, leading to the predicted value of 853 for future ILI cases in Week 25.
