- Explanation: The ILI occurrences decreased to 3606 after 5 weeks due to a reported low influenza activity nationally, with ILI patient visits being below the baseline of 2.6%. Historical data shows similar declines after peaks, such as the drop from 6260 to 2330 following prior activity maxima. The news highlights the minimal geographic spread, no influenza-associated pediatric deaths, and circulation of non-influenza respiratory viruses, all indicating reduced influence of influenza driving ILI.
