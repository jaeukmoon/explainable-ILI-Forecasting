The predicted ILI occurrence of 2350 after 5 weeks can be explained by the observed stabilization and gradual increase in past time-series ILI data after a steady decline over earlier weeks, with recent numbers like 2022, 2012, and 2114 indicating a fluctuating but slightly rising trend. Additionally, while past surveillance data notes unusually low influenza activity (e.g., only 0.1%-0.4% of specimens testing positive and ILI activity well below the 2.6% baseline), consistent vaccination and antiviral measures, coupled with the potential for increased transmission as public health restrictions ease, suggest conditions favorable for mild growth in ILI cases, aligning with the predicted value of 2350.
