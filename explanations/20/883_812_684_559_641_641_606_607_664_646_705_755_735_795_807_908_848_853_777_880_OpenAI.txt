- Explanation: The steady increase in ILI occurrences, from a lower point of 559 in earlier weeks to 880 in week 20, reflects a gradual rise despite overall low influenza activity nationally, as noted in the surveillance reports. While influenza positivity rates and ILI percentages remain below baseline, the anticipation of moderate seasonal increases combined with unusually high PIC (Pneumonia, Influenza, and COVID-19) mortality at 28.4% suggests that healthcare-seeking behavior and influenza-specific vigilance may result in an estimated increase to 1331 ILI occurrences after five weeks.
