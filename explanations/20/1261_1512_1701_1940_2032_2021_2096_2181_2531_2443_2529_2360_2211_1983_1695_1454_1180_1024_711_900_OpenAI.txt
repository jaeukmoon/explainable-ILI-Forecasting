- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 782 due to a consistent downward trend in the time-series data (from 1261 to 900 over 20 weeks, with recent weeks showing rapid decreases such as from 1180 to 1024 to 711). Additionally, despite influenza activity increasing in some regions, national ILI activity remains below baseline, and hospitalization rates are lower than pre-pandemic levels. Co-circulating respiratory viruses contribute less to ILI, and reduced vaccine effectiveness due to antigenic differences could slow but not significantly maintain high ILI rates.
