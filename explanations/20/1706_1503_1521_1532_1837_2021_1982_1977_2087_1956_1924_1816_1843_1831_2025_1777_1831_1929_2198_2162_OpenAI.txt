The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2989 due to gradual increases observed in the time-series data—showing a rising trend from week 14 (1831 occurrences) to week 20 (2162 occurrences). Additionally, while the summarized CDC surveillance reports indicate lower-than-usual influenza activity, they emphasize potential increases in flu activity in upcoming weeks due to seasonal trends and the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on reporting and healthcare behaviors. A subtle rise in ILI trends, coupled with caution in interpreting ILI surveillance and potential underreporting, supports this upward projection.
