- Explanation: The sharp decrease in future ILI occurrences to 661 can be attributed to the declining trend in recent time-series ILI data (evident from a drop from 1,543 to 898 over the last five weeks) coupled with news that outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses, including ILI, remain below baseline nationally and are trending downward. Additionally, virologic surveillance shows reduced influenza activity, with fewer positive specimens reported, and multiple centers report minimal to low ILI rates, further supporting the reduced prediction for future ILI cases.
