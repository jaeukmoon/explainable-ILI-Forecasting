The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to reach 3971 due to a combination of historical data showing a gradual recovery phase from previously low ILI activity (e.g., Week 15 at 795, Week 19 at 1295) and the reported increase in influenza activity described in surveillance updates. The reports highlight an upward trend in outpatient visits for ILI, moderate activity in some jurisdictions, and virologic surveillance noting a rise in Influenza A(H3N2) detections. With increasing outpatient respiratory illnesses nearing baseline and moderate activity in certain areas, the trajectory aligns with the observed historical rebound in ILI cases, predicting continued growth in line with seasonal patterns and viral spread.
