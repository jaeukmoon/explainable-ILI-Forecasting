The predicted ILI occurrence of 2580 after 5 weeks is based on current trends in ILI-time series data and surveillance reports showing minimal fluctuations in ILI activity. The ILI time-series data shows gradual decreases in ILI counts after a peak at week 8 (3625), followed by a more stabilized trend from week 13 onward (3158 dropping incrementally to 1801). The relative decline mirrors virologic data noting the percentage of positive influenza specimens remaining low (around 0.4%-1.4%) and outpatient ILI visits below baseline nationally (1.5%-1.9%). Despite regional variations, influenza hospitalizations and deaths remain within anticipated levels, as indicated by modest increases in hospitalization rates and localized flu activity. Additionally, the cumulative genetic antigenic differences in Influenza A(H3N2) do not significantly translate into increasing ILI morbidity. Therefore, using these ongoing trends, ILI occurrence stabilizes near 2580 after 5 weeks.
