The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to reach 3134 due to the increasing trend in influenza activity indicated in recent surveillance reports, with outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses trending up and contributing to ILI rates. Past time-series data show a recurring seasonal rise in ILI occurrences (e.g., spikes from weeks 4–8 in the previous season and recent week 5's rise to 5915). Current surveillance highlights Influenza A(H3N2) predominance and geographic variability, with some regions experiencing moderate to high ILI activity, contributing to the consistent upward trajectory of cases.
