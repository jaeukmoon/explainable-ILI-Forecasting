The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 4696 due to the recent stabilization and slight decrease in influenza activity reflected in the surveillance reports, combined with a historically low trend in ILI occurrences shown in the time-series data. Specifically, after a peak of 12,215 cases early in the time-series, there has been a consistent decline (e.g., 7536, 4016, 2615, 1998) in ILI counts over time, which aligns with reports of influenza activity declining nationally and falling outpatient ILI visit percentages below baseline. Additionally, this matches expectations from Week 5 surveillance reports indicating sporadic activity with stable respiratory illness rates and lower hospitalization rates compared to pre-COVID seasons. Therefore, the time-series trend, combined with declining influenza activity, supports the prediction of 4696 occurrences in five weeks.
