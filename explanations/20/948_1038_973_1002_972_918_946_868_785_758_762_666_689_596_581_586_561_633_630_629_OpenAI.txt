- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are estimated to be 677 due to the observed downward trend in past ILI time-series occurrences (e.g., decreasing from 948 to 629 over time) and the consistent reporting that the percentage of outpatient visits for respiratory illness, including ILI, has remained below baseline in recent weeks, with sporadic or minimal activity in most regions. Additionally, while co-circulating respiratory viruses contribute to overall illness, the declining hospitalization rates and reports of reduced influenza activity in some areas align with the evidence from surveillance reports, supporting the prediction of lower ILI occurrences.
