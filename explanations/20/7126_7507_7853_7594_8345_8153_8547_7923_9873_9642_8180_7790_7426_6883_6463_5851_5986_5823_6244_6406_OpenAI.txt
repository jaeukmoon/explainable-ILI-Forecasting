The future ILI occurrence estimation of 9332 after 5 weeks aligns with the recent upward trend in the time-series data (from 5851 to 6406 over the last four weeks) and the CDC’s expectation of increasing flu activity in the coming months, despite current influenza activity being below average (e.g., 1.6% of outpatient visits for ILI, far below the 2.6% baseline). The news highlights early signs of regional variability and some localized increases in activity, consistent with a seasonal rise as flu vaccination and preventive measures are emphasized.
