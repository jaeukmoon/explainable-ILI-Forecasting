- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 3188 due to the increasing trend observed in the time series data (e.g., Week 16 to Week 20 values steadily increasing from 2626 to 2932) combined with surveillance reports indicating rising outpatient visits for ILI (up to 2.7%, surpassing the national baseline) and moderate-to-high ILI activity in specific regions. Additionally, virologic surveillance reported increasing detections of Influenza A (H3N2), especially among adults 25 years and older, and hospitalizations for influenza are beginning to rise, further supporting the upward trend in influenza activity.
