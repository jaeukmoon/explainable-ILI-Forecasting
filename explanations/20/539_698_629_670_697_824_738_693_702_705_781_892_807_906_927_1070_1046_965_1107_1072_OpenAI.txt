- Explanation: In the past 20 weeks, ILI occurrences steadily increased from minimal to high levels as seen in the time series, culminating in 1,107 at week 19 and 1,072 at week 20, indicating an upward trend. Despite earlier reports of minimal influenza activity with virologic surveillance showing only 0.1% positive specimens and ILI patient visits below the baseline, later news and CDC updates suggested a potential increase in influenza activity in the coming months due to changing seasonal factors and the waning impact of COVID-19 pandemic-related mitigations. This combination of rising trends and contextual factors predicts that the ILI occurrences will further rise to 1,543 after five weeks.
