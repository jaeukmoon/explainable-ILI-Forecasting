The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are likely to be 490 because the time-series data shows a consistent decline in ILI occurrences over prior weeks (from 775 in Week 1 to 376 in Week 20), demonstrating a downward trend. Additionally, the summarized news indicates low influenza activity, with only 0.2% of respiratory specimens testing positive, 1.5% of healthcare visits for ILI (below the baseline of 2.6%), and minimal geographic spread across the U.S. This low activity, paired with CDC's expectation of increasing flu activity in the future, supports a moderate rebound to 490 after 5 weeks from the current declining trend.
