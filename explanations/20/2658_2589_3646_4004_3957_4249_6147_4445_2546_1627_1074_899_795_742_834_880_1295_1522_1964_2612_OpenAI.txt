The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks reaching 4165 can be explained by the observed increasing trend in influenza activity across the nation, as highlighted in the past case data and news updates. Specifically, recent weeks have shown a steady increase in outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses (2.8% trending upward) and regional reports of moderate to high ILI activity in multiple jurisdictions. Additionally, the predominance of Influenza A(H3N2), coupled with rising hospitalization rates and mortality surpassing the epidemic threshold, indicates a continued seasonal progression. Historical ILI trends in the time series data also show a pattern of peak occurrences during ascending seasonal periods, with figures climbing from prior mid-season lows (e.g., 3957 → 4249 → 6147). Together, the consistent upward trajectory in surveillance metrics and time-series trends leads to the projection of 4165.
