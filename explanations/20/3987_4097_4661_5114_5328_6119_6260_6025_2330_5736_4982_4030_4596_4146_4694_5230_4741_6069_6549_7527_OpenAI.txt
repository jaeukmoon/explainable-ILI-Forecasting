- Explanation: The predicted future ILI occurrences of 5335 after 5 weeks are based on both past trends in the ILI time series and the general increase in influenza activity noted in the surveillance data. The time series shows an upward trend in occurrences over the last few weeks, with figures rising from 4596 to 5230, then 6069, 6549, and 7527. Simultaneously, the news reports highlight an increase in respiratory illnesses with outpatient visits for ILI trending upward, reaching 2.7%, which is above the national baseline. Additionally, virologic surveillance indicates the majority of detections are Influenza A (H3N2), which is associated with heightened illness. This correlation suggests a continuation of the increasing trend, resulting in the projected future ILI occurrences of 5335.
