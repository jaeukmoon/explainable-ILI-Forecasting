- Explanation: Based on the data provided, the future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are expected to be 376 due to steadily low but slightly increasing ILI activity observed in outpatient illness surveillance (from 1.2% to 1.6% in the news) and consistent low influenza positivity in virologic surveillance (staying between 0.1%-0.3%). Historical time-series data show a continuous decline in ILI occurrences (from 731 to 293), correlating with reports of minimal and localized activity in most jurisdictions. This suggests a temporary plateau or moderate rise in upcoming weeks, in line with the CDC's expectation of gradual flu activity increases.
