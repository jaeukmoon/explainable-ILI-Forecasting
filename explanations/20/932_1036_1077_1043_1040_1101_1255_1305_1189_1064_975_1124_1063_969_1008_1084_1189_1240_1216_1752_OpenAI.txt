The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is predicted to reach 2533 due to a significant and consistent upward trend visible in the past 20 weeks of time-series data, particularly with a sharp increase in the last recorded week (1752 from a prior week's 1216, a 43.9% rise). Additionally, surveillance reports highlight a rising trend in outpatient ILI visits reported nationally and regionally, increases in influenza A (H3N2) detection, and other respiratory illnesses contributing to ILI activity. Low vaccination levels in some regions and moderate ILI activity in areas like Louisiana further predict an escalation in ILI cases.
