The predicted ILI occurrences of 1,295 after 5 weeks can be explained by the observed decline in ILI activity across recent weeks and the current trends in surveillance data. The time-series data in previous weeks shows a substantial decrease in ILI cases, especially from Week 15 (6,147 cases) to Week 20 (899 cases). Supporting this, the CDC reports indicate that outpatient visits attributed to ILI are below the national baseline at 1.4%, and the majority of jurisdictions reported minimal or sporadic flu activity. Additionally, severe disease indicators, such as hospitalization rates, remain low, and there is no significant increase in pediatric flu-associated deaths. These trends, combined with low circulation of influenza viruses and stable virological conditions, suggest a continuation of lower ILI activity levels, supporting the prediction of 1,295 cases after 5 weeks.
