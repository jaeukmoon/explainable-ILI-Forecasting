- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 2161 after 5 weeks are forecasted based on the downward trend in the past time-series ILI data (from 3971 to 3537) and the decline in influenza activity noted in the summarized news reports. The reports highlight that outpatient visits for respiratory illness are trending below the baseline and influenza activity has been sporadic or stable in most regions. Additionally, hospitalization rates are decreasing compared to previous spikes, and the percentage of deaths attributed to influenza is decreasing or stable. These factors, combined with the declining trajectory of past ILI occurrences, indicate a sustained decrease in cases, leading to the projection of 2161 cases after 5 weeks.
