- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1203 based on an evident seasonality pattern in the time-series data, where ILI activity gradually increases and then stabilizes after peaking. The current data show a previous high of 1413 followed by stabilization around 1201-1250 in subsequent weeks, suggesting a similar trend during this period of the influenza season. Concurrently, CDC-reported minimal ILI activity levels below the national baseline (1.1%-1.4%) alongside low hospitalization rates confirm moderate to manageable flu dynamics. Thus, the past trend coupled with moderate present activity justifies the estimate of 1203 occurrences in 5 weeks.
