The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks being predicted at 3520 can be explained by combining historical ILI trends and increasing influenza activity in recent surveillance data. Past time-series data shows a seasonal upward trend in ILI occurrences leading from Week 11 to Week 13, peaking at Week 12 (9045) before tapering off. The news highlights increasing percentages in outpatient ILI visits, with activity climbing closer to or above the national baseline in some weeks, notably higher in regions showing moderate-to-high activity. The increase in Influenza A(H3N2) detections and regions reporting higher ILI activity signals an impending rise in ILI cases. Consequently, 3520 aligns with the expected seasonal trajectory and rising influenza circulation captured by recent surveillance.
