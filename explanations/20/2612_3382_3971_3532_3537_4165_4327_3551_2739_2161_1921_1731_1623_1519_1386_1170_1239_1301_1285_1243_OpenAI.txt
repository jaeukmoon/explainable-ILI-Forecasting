The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1946 based on the observed historical decline in ILI time-series from 2612 to 1243 over 20 weeks, showing a consistent downward trend. Additionally, the news reports reinforce this by indicating that current influenza activity remains low, with ILI percentages below the national baseline at around 1.4%, minimal to moderate geographic spread, and a low percentage (0.4%) of specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical labs. Consequently, these trends suggest continued low influenza activity, supporting the projected value.
