- **Explanation:** The ILI occurrences reach 6301 after 5 weeks due to the observed rising trend in the ILI time-series data, which, in the last five weeks provided, consistently increased from 2285 to 3178, reflecting an exponential pattern. While surveillance reports indicate that current influenza activity remains lower than usual with minimal ILI positivity (e.g., 1.2% of visits below the 2.6% baseline) and low hospitalization rates, these metrics should be interpreted cautiously due to changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially underestimating actual transmission. Additionally, the slight increases in ILI percentages reported in recent weeks suggest a minor resurgence in activity that aligns with the growing historical trend in the data.
