- Explanation: The projected ILI occurrence of 973 in 5 weeks can be attributed to the general pattern observed in the past time series, where ILI typically decreases following peaks (e.g., 2919 to 2533 to 2084). The news indicates that influenza activity remains low, with outpatient visits for ILI below the national baseline (1.9% to 2.4%), minimal activity in most regions, and a majority of Influenza A viruses detected. These low activity levels combined with a declining trend in recent data (1114 to 888 to 803) suggest that influenza occurrences will stabilize to a moderate level such as 973 in the near term.
