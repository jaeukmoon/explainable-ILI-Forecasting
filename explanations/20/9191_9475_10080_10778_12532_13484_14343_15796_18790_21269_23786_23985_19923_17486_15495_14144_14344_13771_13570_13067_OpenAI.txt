- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 15,856 after 5 weeks can be explained by the observed upward trend in the time-series data (from 9,191 to 13,484 across the first 6 weeks, peaking at 23,786 in week 11 before fluctuating downward) and the news indicating that influenza A(H3N2) activity has been increasing in certain regions and hospitalizations have been climbing steadily over 11 weeks. Moreover, the co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses and persistent activity in some locations (such as the northeast and northwest) suggests the sustained spread of illness. These combined factors likely support the projected rise in ILI to 15,856 in 5 weeks.
