- Explanation: The ILI occurrences in the past 20 weeks show a seasonal decline following a peak in Week 12 (2919 cases), consistent with flushing out cycle effects as general activity waned in subsequent weeks. During this time, news reports highlight a low but gradually increasing influenza activity, citing that outpatient respiratory visits and positivity rates for flu are below baseline but steadily climbing. Virologic surveillance also points to an increase in detected infections as Influenza A(H3N2) gains prevalence, particularly in younger adult demographics. Based on this gradual upward trend and regional surges, it is predicted that the seasonal rebound in influenza-related cases led to the ILI reaching 1002 occurrences after 5 weeks.
