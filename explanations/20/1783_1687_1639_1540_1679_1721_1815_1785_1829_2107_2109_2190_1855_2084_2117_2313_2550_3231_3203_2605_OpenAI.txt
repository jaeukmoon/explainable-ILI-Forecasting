- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, the ILI occurrences have shown recent fluctuations, peaking significantly at week 17 (3231) followed by a decrease (2605). Although current influenza activity is reported as generally low in the summarized news, regions such as Puerto Rico and specific jurisdictions have shown localized higher ILI activity trends, which, combined with observations of increased Influenza A virus occurrences and a small spike in outpatient ILI visits, suggest a potential rebound post-acute decline. Factoring in historical trends and ongoing virological activity, this establishes the projected ILI occurrence at 1182 for week 25.
