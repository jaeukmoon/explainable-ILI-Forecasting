The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks being 1099 can be attributed to consistently low influenza activity reflected in both virologic surveillance and outpatient illness surveillance. Historical ILI data shows a clear decreasing trend over the past 10 weeks (from 2148 to 990). Additionally, the news specifies that the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza remains extremely low (e.g., 0.2%-0.3%) and outpatient ILI visits account for only 1.1%-1.6%, which is below the national baseline of 2.6%. This indicates minimal flu spread across jurisdictions, further supported by no reported pediatric deaths and low hospitalization rates. Thus, the continuation of this low activity trend justifies the projected ILI occurrence of 1099 after 5 weeks.
