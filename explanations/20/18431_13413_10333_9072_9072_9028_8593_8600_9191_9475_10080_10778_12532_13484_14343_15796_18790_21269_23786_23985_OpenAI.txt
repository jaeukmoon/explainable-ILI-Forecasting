The future ILI occurrence of 14,344 after 5 weeks is influenced by the observed stability and slight regional increases in influenza activity, as indicated by CDC reports. The majority of detected influenza A(H3N2) viruses have been antigenically different from vaccine reference viruses, which may contribute to continued transmission. While outpatient visit percentages for respiratory illness remain below the national baseline, variations across regions, coupled with steady hospitalization rates (e.g., 16.0 per 100,000 population in Week 21), suggest ongoing circulation. These factors, along with co-circulation of other respiratory viruses and consistent above-threshold mortality (e.g., 7.8% attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19), provide evidence supporting the sustained level of ILI occurrences projected.
