The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are predicted to be 3478 because, although the time-series data shows a consistent rise in ILI cases (e.g., from 1689 in week 1 to 2350 in week 20), historical influenza activity is unusually low due to external factors such as COVID-19, as highlighted by surveillance reports. Specifically, influenza test positivity is at a minimal 0.1%, and ILI outpatient visits remain below the national baseline (1.1%-1.3% in past weeks versus a baseline of 2.6%). However, CDC notes that while activity remains minimal in all regions, influenza activity may increase in coming weeks, aligning with a growing seasonal upward trend. These factors together suggest an expected moderate increase in ILI cases to 3478 within five weeks.
