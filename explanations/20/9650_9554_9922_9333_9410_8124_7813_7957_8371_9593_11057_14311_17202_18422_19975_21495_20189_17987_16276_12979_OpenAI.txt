The future ILI occurrences of 11,489 after five weeks can be attributed to trends from both the time-series data and summarized news. The time-series data shows a recent peak in ILI occurrences with an upward trajectory, reaching the highest values in weeks 12 to 15 (14,311 to 21,495), before declining (12,979 in week 20), suggesting a potential rebound, as such decreases often precede subsequent increases in flu activity due to periodicity of the illness. The news confirms that flu activity, though below national baselines, has seen slight increases in outpatient ILI visits (1.2% rising compared to prior weeks) and that geographic spread remains minimal, but sporadic rises are likely tied to seasonal trends or changes in public behavior and reporting. This combination indicates a gradual increase, consistent with predictive modeling.
