The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 674 due to the observed gradual increase in ILI cases alongside historical patterns of seasonal influenza activity rising in the later weeks of the flu season. While the current ILI activity remains below the national baseline (1.6%-1.7%) and unusually low according to surveillance data, the news reports emphasize the likelihood of an increase in flu activity in the coming months, aligning with historical trends that show ILI surges later in the season. Furthermore, the past time-series data shows a rise in ILI cases in recent weeks (from 317 to 490), indicating an upward trajectory consistent with seasonal patterns. This combination of historical trends and contextual evidence informs the projection of 674 ILI occurrences in 5 weeks.
