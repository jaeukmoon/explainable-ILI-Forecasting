- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 1021 because the time-series data shows a consistent decline in ILI cases over recent weeks (from 2895 to 893). According to the news reports, influenza activity remains low but stable, and the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI is below the national baseline in most regions. The CDC also notes that, while influenza activity is sporadic, hospitalization and mortality rates due to influenza remain below historical levels, and preventive measures like vaccination continue to be emphasized. Together, these factors suggest a continuation of the declining trend in ILI activity, leading to a projected count of 1021 cases in 5 weeks.
