- Explanation: The predicted ILI occurrences of 15,495 after 5 weeks are based on the stable outpatient respiratory illness surveillance data, which shows that influenza activity has been increasing since early March but remains below baseline, with Influenza A(H3N2) as the predominant strain. The hospitalization rates (currently 15.5 per 100,000 population) and mortality rates (above the epidemic threshold) indicate ongoing significant impacts of respiratory illnesses, including influenza. Furthermore, CDC's continued observation of co-circulating respiratory viruses and regional variability suggests a slightly increasing trend but with controlled spread due to vaccination efforts and antiviral treatments. This steady progression aligns with the 5-week future estimate.
