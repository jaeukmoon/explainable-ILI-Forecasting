- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences are predicted to be 5729 due to the recent trend showing a decline in ILI cases over the past several weeks, with outpatient visits for respiratory illness remaining below the national baseline and sporadic activity reported across regions. Additionally, the percentage of outpatient visits for respiratory illness has stabilized or slightly decreased in surveillance data. Furthermore, vaccination and preventive measures, along with the declining hospitalization rates for influenza compared to earlier in the season, suggest a continuing downward trajectory in ILI activity.
