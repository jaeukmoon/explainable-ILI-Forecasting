The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 806 due to the upward trend observed in the time-series data, where ILI cases steadily increased over the prior weeks (e.g., 692, 738, 761, and 739), with a general rise in activity despite low influenza positivity (0.1%-0.3%) in virologic surveillance and below-baseline outpatient visits for ILI (1.0%-1.3%). This increase may be partly attributed to other factors like seasonal patterns and the combination of slight upticks in respiratory issues, even as influenza-specific indicators remain low.
