Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences have shown a steady rise in recent weeks, growing from 862 in week 1 to 2546 in week 20, demonstrating a consistent upward trend. Additionally, the news reports indicate the CDC's observation that flu activity, while currently low and below the baseline, may increase in the coming months. Combined with earlier weeks showing ILI levels below the national baseline (e.g., 0.9% and 1.0% of patient visits, compared to 2.6%), the continued emerging trend suggests a resurgence is underway. This growth pattern aligns with a projection of ILI reaching 3400 in five weeks.
