- Explanation: The reduction in ILI occurrences over the past weeks, seen in the downward trend in the time-series data (from 3033 in week 14 to 870 in week 20), combined with evidence from the news reports indicating low seasonal influenza activity, minimal geographic spread, and below-baseline outpatient ILI visits (e.g., 1.9%), helps explain why future ILI occurrences are predicted to stabilize at 1141 after 5 weeks. Though low activity persists, the trend of increasing influenza virus detections in some regions and influenza A (H3N2) circulation suggests a potential slight rebound, supported by effective surveillance and vaccination efforts limiting further spikes.
