- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2067 based on the observed increasing trend in the time-series data and surveillance data showing a slight rise in outpatient visits due to ILI (from 1.1% in week 17 to 1.3% in week 20). This aligns with past season awareness that ILI occurrences tend to escalate incrementally during similar periods. Moreover, the news indicates that historical baselines for ILI activity remain below normal, but the slight, consistent increases suggest ongoing recovery toward more typical seasonal patterns.
