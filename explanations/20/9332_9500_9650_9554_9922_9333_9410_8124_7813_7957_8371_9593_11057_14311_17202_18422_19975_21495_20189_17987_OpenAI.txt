- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 11730 after 5 weeks are explainable using an upward trend in the past ILI time-series data coupled with minimal current influenza activity as indicated by historical surveillance. The time-series shows a marked increase in occurrences in recent weeks, growing consistently from 9593 to 17987 over a few weeks. Although CDC reports indicate minimal current influenza activity—e.g., the percentage of patient visits for ILI remains low at 1.2-2.2% and below the national baseline—an increase in ILI activity is hinted (e.g., a slight upward shift from 1.1% to 1.3%) with PIC-related deaths exceeding the epidemic threshold, which may suggest residual respiratory illness activity overlapping with behaviors influenced by COVID-19. As such, the projection of 11730 aligns with these signals of moderately increasing influence on ILI occurrences.
