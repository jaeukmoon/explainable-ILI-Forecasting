- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are predicted to reach 2,909 based on the decreasing trend observed in the time-series data, along with stable or declining influenza activity reported in the surveillance news. Specifically, the percent positivity of specimens for influenza remains low, outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses are below the national baseline, and hospitalization rates remain lower than pre-COVID-19 pandemic seasons. These factors, combined with co-circulation of other respiratory viruses and effective public health interventions like vaccinations, indicate a stabilization or continued reduction in ILI occurrences.
