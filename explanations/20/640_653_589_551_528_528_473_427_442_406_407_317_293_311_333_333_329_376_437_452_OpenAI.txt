- Explanation: The predicted future ILI occurrence of 524 in 5 weeks is primarily based on the observed declining trend from the past time-series data, where ILI occurrences have consistently decreased from 640 to 452 over 20 weeks, showing a gradual reduction pattern. Additionally, summarized news reports indicate minimal and low influenza activity in all regions, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimen testing positive for influenza and outpatient ILI visits at 1.6%, below the 2.6% baseline. While the CDC expects a potential rise in flu activity, the current low prevalence and consistent declining trajectory suggest a moderate rise to 524 cases in the future.
