- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences being 3807 after 5 weeks can be explained by the steady increase in hospitalizations and outpatient respiratory illnesses reported over the previous weeks, though remaining below national baselines, combined with the sustained dominance of Influenza A(H3N2). A slight downward trend in ILI activity was observed in some regions, but ongoing regional increases, particularly in moderate to high geographic activity areas, suggest continued circulation of the virus. Hospitalization rates, while lower than pre-pandemic seasons, are rising, and the co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses further exacerbates the burden. This overall trend supports the predicted ILI occurrence.
