The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 3158 because recent trends in the time-series data show a steady increase from week 17 (2104 cases) to week 20 (2895 cases), indicating a resurgence of influenza-like illness. This aligns with the news reports highlighting a rise in influenza activity, with consistently increasing outpatient visits, hospitalization rates, and above-baseline respiratory illness percentages. The predominant circulation of Influenza A(H3N2), which shows antigenic differences from the vaccine reference virus, further supports increased activity due to lower vaccine effectiveness. These factors combined predict a moderate rise, leading to the calculated 3158 cases in the upcoming timeframe.
