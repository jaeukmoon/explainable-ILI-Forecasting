The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 735 due to consistently decreasing ILI activity reflected in the past 20-week time series and surveillance data. The ILI time series indicates a clear declining trend over weeks, dropping from 1214 to 607, and the surveillance shows that only 0.2% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza, and outpatient visits for ILI were at 1.5%, below the baseline of 2.6%, with most jurisdictions experiencing minimal or low activity. This low influenza activity, coupled with the absence of influenza-associated pediatric deaths and the influence of COVID-19 on healthcare seeking, supports the projection of continued low ILI occurrences at approximately 735 after 5 weeks.
