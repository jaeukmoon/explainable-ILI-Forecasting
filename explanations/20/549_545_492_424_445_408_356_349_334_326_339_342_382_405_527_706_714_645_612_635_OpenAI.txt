- Explanation: The predicted Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrences of 603 in five weeks is based on an observed trend in the time-series data showing a recent increase in ILI cases (e.g., last five weeks: 527, 706, 714, 645, 612) and the summarized news forewarning a potential rise in influenza activity despite the currently low levels. The news reports state that activity may increase in the coming months due to seasonal effects, and while ILI activity remains below the national baseline, increasing trends in outpatient visits combined with prior rises in hospitalization rates due to COVID-19-associated complications and influenza contribute to projecting a future increase to 603 cases.
