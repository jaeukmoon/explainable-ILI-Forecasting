- Explanation: Based on the time-series ILI trend, there is a consistent upward trajectory in ILI occurrences over the last 10 weeks (e.g., from 2197 to 3503). The weekly influenza surveillance news mentions low influenza positivity (0.1%) and below-baseline ILI activity (1.2%), but a slight increase in ILI compared to previous weeks is noted. This aligns with observed increases in ILI occurrences from the time-series. Therefore, extrapolating the trend with current increases and considering the minimal geographic influenza activity, it is projected that ILI occurrences will reach 3855 in 5 weeks.
