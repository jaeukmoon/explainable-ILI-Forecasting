The future ILI occurrences were predicted to be 1831 due to the consistently low influenza activity observed over the previous weeks, with ILI percentages remaining below the national baseline (1.6%-1.1%), low percentages of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza (as low as 0.1%-0.4%), and unusually low influenza-positive reports from public health labs despite increased testing. However, the CDC indicated that flu activity could increase in the coming months, as infections generally follow seasonal trends. Given that the recent weeks’ time-series ILI occurrences showed a slight decline after a peak and predictions account for seasonal patterns, the ILI projection at week 5 aligns with these trends and suggests a moderate increase relative to recent lower values.
