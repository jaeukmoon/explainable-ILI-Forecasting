The future Influenza-like Illness (ILI) occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1759 based on the declining trend in past ILI occurrences reflected in the time-series data and the news insights indicating persistently low influenza activity overall. Past ILI counts show a steady decrease from 2178 to levels below 1000 in recent weeks (e.g., 825, 618), correlating with the CDC's report that influenza positivity rates remain extremely low (0.1-0.3%), and ILI visits are below the national baseline at 1.1%-1.6%. Additionally, no indicators suggest a significant influenza surge soon, as CDC expects low activity in coming weeks but potential gradual increases. Combining this steady decline pattern and the current minimal activity informs the forecasted level of 1759.
