- Explanation: Based on the time-series ILI occurrences and summarized CDC reports, the increase in influenza activity is reflective of ongoing upward trends in multiple areas, with the percentage of respiratory illnesses caused by influenza A(H3N2) rising above the baseline. Outpatient visits for ILI show increasing activity, high morbidity related to influenza and co-occurring respiratory illnesses like COVID-19, and prevalence in younger and adult populations. This aligns with gradual increases in ILI occurrences seen in the time-series data, projecting up to 2443 in five weeks due to these sustained trends and geographical spread variation.
