- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 2615 after five weeks is likely due to the observed decreasing trend in ILI cases in the time-series data, where the most recent weekly occurrences peaked at 6865 and gradually decreased over prior weeks. Additionally, the news data indicates that ILI activity remains below the national baseline of 2.6% over multiple weeks, with minimal to moderate activity levels across most jurisdictions and low influenza circulation. These combined trends in reduced activity and low national influenza levels suggest that ILI cases are expected to decline further to 2615 within the specified timeframe.
