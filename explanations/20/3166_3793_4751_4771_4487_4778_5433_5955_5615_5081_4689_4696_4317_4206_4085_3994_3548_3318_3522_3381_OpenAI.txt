Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences have been generally fluctuating, with a consistent decline from week 8 (5955 cases) to week 20 (3381 cases). The summarized news indicates that while influenza activity is generally decreasing in some areas, it remains variable regionally, with higher activity in certain northeast and northwest regions, and multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating. Although outpatient visits for respiratory illness remain stable and below baseline, steady hospitalization rates for influenza-associated illnesses, higher-than-expected PIC mortality rates, and ongoing circulation of Influenza A(H3N2)—which has shown genetic differences from vaccine strains—suggest that residual and region-specific influenza trends contribute to the projected future ILI occurrence of 2806 in 5 weeks, reflecting a continued decline from current values.
