- Explanation: Based on the past time-series ILI data, a clear declining trend in ILI occurrences is evident over the last few weeks, with counts dropping from 2919 (week 16) to 2084 (week 20). The CDC news supports this trend, noting that in week 36, ILI activity was below the national baseline (2.3% of visits due to ILI compared to a baseline of 2.6%) and that most jurisdictions reported minimal ILI activity. Additionally, the mortality data reflected a dominance of COVID-19 over influenza-related deaths, coupled with limited positive respiratory specimen detections for influenza (2.3%). This decline, influenced by low flu activity nationally and reduced healthcare-seeking behavior, aligns with the predictive occurrence of 832 ILI cases after 5 weeks.
