The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 1189 due to the observed increasing trend in the past 20 weeks of time-series data and the slightly rising percentage of outpatient visits related to ILI in recent weeks reported by ILINet. While influenza activity has generally been below the national baseline, with minimal geographic spread and low hospitalization rates, the slight increase in ILI percentages (e.g., 1.2% of healthcare visits in week 18, an increase from 1.1% reported earlier) and the consistent growth trend from 437 to 1077 in past ILI occurrences suggest anticipated continued gradual growth. However, the persistent impacts of broader respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, may influence these predictions.
