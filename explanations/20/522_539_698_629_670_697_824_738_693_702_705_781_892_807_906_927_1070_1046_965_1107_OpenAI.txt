The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1541 due to the observed upward trend in recent ILI time-series data and indications of gradually increasing activity in the news. In the time-series data, ILI occurrences steadily increased in the last few weeks from 781 to 1107, suggesting a continuing upward trend. Additionally, the news reports mention that outpatient ILI surveillance increased slightly from prior weeks (e.g., ILI visits grew from 0.8% to 1.2%) and that the CDC expects activity to increase in the coming months. These factors collectively support the projected rise in ILI occurrences.
