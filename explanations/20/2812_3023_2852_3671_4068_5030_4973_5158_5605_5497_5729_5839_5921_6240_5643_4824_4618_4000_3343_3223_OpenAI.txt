The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 3367 based on the downward trend observed in the time-series data, which shows a gradual decline in ILI cases over recent weeks (from 6240 to 3223). Supported by surveillance data from the news reports, influenza activity is described as geographically varied and trending downward nationally, with outpatient visits for ILI staying below the baseline and virologic surveillance indicating lower flu positivity rates. Additionally, hospitalization rates and severe disease indicators remain lower compared to pre-pandemic seasons, aligning with the expected reduction in ILI cases.
