- Explanation: Future ILI occurrences reaching 4751 after 5 weeks are supported by the observed gradual uptick in ILI percentages and influenza circulation despite the current low activity. Over the provided weeks, outpatient ILI visits have consistently trended upwards (e.g., rising from 1.4% to 2.7%, and weeks of slight increases noted in news data). Recent mentions of regional moderate or increasing ILI activity and higher circulation of Influenza A(H3N2) highlight a pattern of gradual growth. Additionally, historical time-series shows that after past periods of reduced activity (as seen during weeks with occurrences like 1998 or 2615), influenza cases regularly rise within 5 weeks, pointing to the likelihood of higher values such as 4751 in similar contexts.
