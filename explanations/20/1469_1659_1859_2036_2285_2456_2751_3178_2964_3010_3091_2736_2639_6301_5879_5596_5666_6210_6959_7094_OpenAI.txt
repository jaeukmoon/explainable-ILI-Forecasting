The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 9865 due to a sharp upward trajectory observed in past time-series ILI data, where numbers grew significantly from 2639 to 6301 and further increased to 7094 over a few weeks, indicating a rising trend. Additionally, news data reveals increasing positivity rates for Influenza A (notably A(H1N1)pdm09, which accounted for 73.7% of cases) and above-threshold P&I mortality (7.1% vs the epidemic threshold of 5.6%), suggesting heightened influenza activity. This combination of rising trends and intensified virus activity contributes to the predicted upsurge.
