The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to rise to 564 primarily due to a consistent increase in ILI activity in previous weeks shown by a gradual rebound in the time-series data (from 349 to 714) over recent weeks, despite historically lower-than-usual influenza levels reported. CDC surveillance reports anticipated an eventual increase in flu activity over time, as low ILI activity (below the baseline of 2.6%) was coupled with recommendations for vaccinations to counter potential upticks. These combined trends suggest a delayed but predictable rise in future influenza-like illness cases at the five-week horizon, despite current low activity levels nationwide.
