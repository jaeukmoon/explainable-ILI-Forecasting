- Explanation: The predicted future ILI occurrences of 561 after 5 weeks are based on the significant downward trend observed in the past 20 weeks of ILI data, where occurrences consistently declined from 2,536 to 666. The news also indicates that seasonal influenza activity, while sustained, is decreasing in most areas of the country, with the percentage of outpatient visits for respiratory illness and ILI below or near baseline levels. Long-term care facilities reported only minimal influenza-positive tests (0.4%), and hospitalization and mortality rates due to influenza remain lower than pre-COVID-19 seasons. Coupled with the high genetic similarity of circulating viruses to the vaccine reference virus and ongoing vaccination efforts, these factors suggest a continued decline in ILI occurrences, aligning with the projected 561 cases in 5 weeks.
