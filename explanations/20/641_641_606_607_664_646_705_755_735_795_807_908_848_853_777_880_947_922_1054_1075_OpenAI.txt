Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 1936 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the gradual increase in ILI cases observed in the time-series data, which shows a rising trend from week 12 (807 cases) to week 20 (1075 cases). This rising trend implies a continuous growth pattern. Additionally, the CDC weekly report indicates that while ILI activity remains below the national baseline of 2.6%, slight weekly increases in ILI activity have been observed, and caution is advised due to potential structural shifts from COVID-19 impacts. These factors combined suggest that ILI activity is expected to increase, leading to a future prediction of 1936 cases.
