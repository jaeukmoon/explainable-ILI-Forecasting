The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 902 due to the increasing trend in recent ILI time-series occurrences, where the values have shown a steady rise from week 15 ('692') to week 20 ('813'). Despite reports of unusually low influenza activity in surveillance data (e.g., only 1.1% of outpatient visits for ILI and 0.1% positive respiratory specimens), the upward trajectory in the ILI data suggests that local factors or other illnesses mimicking ILI symptoms might be contributing to the rise. Additionally, the CDC notes that while influenza activity remains minimal, it may increase in the coming months—a possible reflection captured in the forecasted increase.
