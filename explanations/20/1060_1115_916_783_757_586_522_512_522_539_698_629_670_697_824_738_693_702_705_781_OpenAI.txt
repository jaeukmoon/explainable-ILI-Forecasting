The future ILI occurrence of 1070 is driven by the observed gradual rise in ILI cases over the past weeks in conjunction with the potential seasonal trend of increasing influenza activity. From the time series, ILI cases increased from a low of 512 (Week 9) to 781 (Week 20), indicating an upward trend likely influenced by seasonal dynamics. Additionally, past ILI activity remained below the national baseline due to the concurrent impact of COVID-19 and low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% in multiple weeks), as mentioned in the news summaries. The CDC's caution about possible increases in influenza activity in coming months and recommendations for vaccination also suggest an expectation of rising cases, aligning with the projection of 1070 in 5 weeks.
