- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 4502 based on the observed national decline in influenza activity in the preceding weeks, indicated by the decreasing weekly ILI percentages (e.g., 1.4%-2.3%) and stable or slightly declining outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses. This aligns with virologic surveillance showing a low percentage (0.4%-0.7%) of specimens testing positive for influenza and reports of minimal to low ILI activity in most regions. While trends showed some localized increases due to co-circulating respiratory illnesses and cumulative hospitalization rates (e.g., 15.5-17.1 per 100,000 population), the overall national trajectory suggests a continued decline, resulting in the predicted ILI count of 4502.
