- Explanation: The projected ILI occurrence of 13,570 after 5 weeks is based on the observed upward trend in influenza activity over the prior weeks, as shown in the time-series data where recent ILI occurrences increased steadily from 9,475 in week 7 to 21,269 in week 16, before slightly declining to 17,486 in week 20. Concurrently, news reports indicate that Influenza A(H3N2), which has been the predominant strain, is associated with increased hospitalizations (16.7 per 100,000 population) and co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, contributing to respiratory illnesses. Although ILI activity nationally is below baseline, regional increases and its variation by location suggest a sustained impact, which aligns with the forecasted figure for week 25.
