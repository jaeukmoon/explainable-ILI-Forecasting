- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are predicted to be 3987 due to the observed increasing trend in the time-series data, where ILI counts consistently rose from 1481 in week 1 to 2350 by week 18, coupled with a slight dip in weeks 19–20 (2274). Despite the CDC surveillance reports indicating historically low influenza activity (e.g., only 0.1% of respiratory specimens tested positive and ILI activity consistently remained below the 2.6% baseline), the consistent upward trend in time-series data suggests a growing ILI trend, potentially driven by factors such as seasonal variability or underreporting related to COVID-19 distortions. Though the CDC expected flu activity to remain low, historical patterns in the time-series justify the projected increase towards 3987 cases in week 25.
