The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2237 due to a consistent recent increase in ILI activity indicated by outpatient illness surveillance, where patient visits for ILI have gradually risen from 1.0% to 1.3% while remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%. Although flu activity is generally lower than usual according to virologic and geographic surveillance data (e.g., minimal activity across jurisdictions and 0.1% positivity rate in clinical labs), the small upward trend in healthcare visits, combined with historically varied ILI fluctuations seen in the time-series data (e.g., previous peaks of 2118 and 2087), suggests that the slight increase in activity could translate into a mild resurgence, aligning with the predicted value.
