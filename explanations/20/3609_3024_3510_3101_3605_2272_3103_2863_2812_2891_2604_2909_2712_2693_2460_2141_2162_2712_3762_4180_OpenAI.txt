- Explanation: The future ILI occurrence of 5047 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the upward trend of seasonal influenza activity reported over the past 20 weeks, particularly the dominance of the Influenza A(H3N2) virus, which has been linked to higher hospitalization and severity rates. Despite the decreasing percentage of positive specimens in some regions, ILI trends have steadily increased across age groups and are expected to continue rising, especially as certain regions began reporting activity above baseline. Concurrent factors, such as antigenic differences in circulating viruses compared to vaccine strains and co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, further contribute to this projected increase.
