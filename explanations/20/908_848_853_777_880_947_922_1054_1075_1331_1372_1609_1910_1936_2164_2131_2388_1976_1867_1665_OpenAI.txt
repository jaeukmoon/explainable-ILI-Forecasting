The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 2531 based on the observed increasing trend in the time-series data of ILI occurrences, where there was a steady rise from 1665 to 2388 in recent weeks, coupled with the news mentioning a *slight increase* in ILI activity compared to the previous week (even though it remains below the national baseline). The alignment of historical data trends with the ongoing increase observed in surveillance reports supports this projection.
