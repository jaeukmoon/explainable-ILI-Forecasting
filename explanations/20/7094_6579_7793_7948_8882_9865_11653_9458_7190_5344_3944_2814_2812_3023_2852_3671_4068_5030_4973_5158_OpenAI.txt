- Explanation: Over the past 20 weeks, influenza activity has gradually increased, with consistent detections of Influenza A(H3N2) as the predominant strain. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI), although below the national baseline in earlier weeks, have trended upward alongside increases in hospitalizations and regional variations in activity, with some areas reporting moderate to high activity. Despite preventive recommendations, vaccination uptake has been lower compared to previous seasons. Considering this upward trend in ILI occurrences, combined with the increase in respiratory illnesses and ongoing circulation of the H3N2 strain, the forecasted 5921 future occurrences after five weeks aligns with the increasing public health burden.
