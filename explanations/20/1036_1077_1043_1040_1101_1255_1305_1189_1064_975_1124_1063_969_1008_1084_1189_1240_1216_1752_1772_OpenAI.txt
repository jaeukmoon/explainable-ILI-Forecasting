The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is projected to be 2536 due to the significant recent increase in influenza-like illness (ILI) activity observed in both virologic and outpatient surveillance data. Virologic surveillance shows a rising percentage of Influenza A (H3N2) virus detections, and outpatient ILI surveillance has reported an increase in patient visits due to ILI, with activity levels surpassing baselines in certain regions. Additionally, moderate to high ILI geographic activity has been noted across several jurisdictions, indicating broader regional spread of influenza. These trends, alongside rising hospitalization rates for influenza and increasing respiratory illness percentages, strongly support the prediction of higher ILI occurrences in the coming weeks.
