- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1931 due to the sustained low influenza activity reported in surveillance and the stabilizing trend shown in the recent ILI data. Specifically, outpatient visits for ILI consistently remain below the national baseline (1.7-2.5%) over the past weeks, only increasing slightly but not significantly. Furthermore, virologic surveillance confirms a low percentage of influenza-positive specimens (as low as 0.1%-1.5%), with no substantial outbreaks reported. The steady decline in ILI occurrences in the time-series data, from 3188 to 1493 over the recent weeks, aligns with the overall low influenza activity, supporting the projection of a slight increase to 1931 due to localized increases in some jurisdictions amidst low national flu activity.
