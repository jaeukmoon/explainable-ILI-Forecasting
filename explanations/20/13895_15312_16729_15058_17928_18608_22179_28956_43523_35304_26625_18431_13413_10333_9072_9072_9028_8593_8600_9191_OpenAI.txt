- Explanation: Based on the time-series data of ILI occurrences, which show periodic surges during specific weeks, and the CDC reports indicating an increasing trend in influenza activity with Influenza A(H3N2) predominating, it is expected that ILI occurrences will continue to rise moderately in the near term. Additionally, outpatient visits for respiratory illness have been trending upward, surpassing the national baseline in some weeks, hinting at an impending rise in cases. Therefore, the future ILI occurrence of 13,484 in 5 weeks aligns with the observed increasing patterns and surveillance warnings of higher activity.
