The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1213 due to the consistent declining trend observed in the past time-series data, where ILI occurrences dropped from 1911 to 914 over the last 20 weeks, with a steady decrease in recent weeks. This aligns with the CDC reports stating that influenza activity remains low, with only 0.1%-0.4% of clinical specimens testing positive for influenza and ILI outpatient visits persistently below the 2.6% national baseline at 1.1%-1.7%. Additionally, all jurisdictions report minimal ILI activity, and influenza-related severe disease indicators remain relatively low, suggesting continued low flu activity over the coming weeks.
