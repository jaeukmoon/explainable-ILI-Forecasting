- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences have shown an increasing trend over the past weeks, with values peaking at 3629 in Week 18 before decreasing slightly to 3158 in Week 20. This pattern suggests cyclical or seasonal fluctuations. The summarized news reports indicate that while influenza activity varies by region, A(H3N2) remains the dominant subtype, contributing to respiratory illness. Hospitalization rates for influenza are increasing (up to 14.4–17.1 per 100,000 population) and mortality rates exceed the epidemic threshold. Despite outpatient visits remaining below baseline nationally, regional variations in activity, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and the increasing hospitalization cumulative rates collectively suggest a national rebound of flu activity in some areas. These factors combined, alongside recent stabilizing downward ILI trends in the last two weeks of provided data, indicate that future occurrences stabilize around 2480 cases.
