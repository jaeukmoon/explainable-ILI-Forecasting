The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 3839 based on the observed increasing trend in ILI occurrences over the past weeks from the time-series data (e.g., increasing from 2233 to 3602). Additionally, CDC reports indicate a gradual rise in influenza activity nationwide, evidenced by increasing outpatient visits for ILI, with percentages approaching or surpassing baseline levels in some regions, and increasing detections of influenza A(H3N2) viruses. However, activity remains generally moderate, with minimal severe outcomes like low hospitalization rates and no influenza-associated pediatric deaths reported in recent surveillance. These combined factors suggest a continued moderate increase in ILI occurrences, consistent with the projection.
