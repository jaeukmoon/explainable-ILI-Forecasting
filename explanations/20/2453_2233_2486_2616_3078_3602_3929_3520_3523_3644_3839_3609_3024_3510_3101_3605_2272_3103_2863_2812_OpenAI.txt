Based on the time-series ILI occurrences and summarized news, the prediction of 2,693 ILI occurrences after five weeks is supported by several facts. While influenza activity has been decreasing recently with a downward trend in ILI percentages (currently below the baseline of 2.1%), Influenza A(H3N2) continues to be the dominant strain. Additionally, hospitalization rates remain steady at 17.1 per 100,000, predominantly impacting older adults and other high-risk populations. These stable yet decreasing national patterns, coupled with local variations in activity and minimal contributions from other circulating respiratory viruses, align with a gradual decline in ILI cases, converging towards 2,693 after five weeks.
