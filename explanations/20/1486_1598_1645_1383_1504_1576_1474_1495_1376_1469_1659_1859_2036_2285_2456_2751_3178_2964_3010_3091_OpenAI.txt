The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 5596 because the time-series data demonstrates an increasing weekly trend in ILI cases over 20 weeks, showing a significant rise from 1486 to 3091. Coupled with this, although current influenza activity remains relatively low according to the CDC report, the slight weekly increase in outpatient ILI visits (1.2%, below the 2.6% baseline) suggests a gradual upward trend. Additionally, historical patterns, such as higher ILI activity during seasonal changes, contribute to the prediction. This aligns with surveillance data, indicating potential increases in respiratory illnesses despite currently low positivity rates.
