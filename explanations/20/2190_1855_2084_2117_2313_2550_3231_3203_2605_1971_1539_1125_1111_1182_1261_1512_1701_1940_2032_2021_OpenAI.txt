The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks reaching 2529 can be explained by the increasing trend of influenza activity as reflected in the past ILI time-series and CDC surveillance reports. Weekly ILI occurrences have shown a cyclical rise over time, with increases like 2313 to 2550 and later 2084 to 3231 correlating with growing influenza activity. The CDC reports highlight an upward trend in outpatient ILI visits nationally, particularly in some regions experiencing moderate to high activity, alongside rising hospitalizations and mortality rates due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 above epidemic thresholds. The predominance of Influenza A(H3N2), co-circulating respiratory viruses, and vaccination uptake challenges further contribute to this expected increase.
