The predicted ILI occurrences of 3503 after 5 weeks can be attributed to a consistent upward trend in the past time-series data, where ILI cases rose steadily in recent weeks from 2198 to 3168. Additionally, while surveillance reports highlight continued low flu activity (e.g., only 0.1% respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza and below-baseline outpatient ILI visits at 1.2%-1.3%), the observed growth in ILI cases in the past data suggests that other factors, such as seasonal patterns and the easing of COVID-19-related restrictions (possibly affecting healthcare-seeking behaviors and virus transmission), may be contributing to the expected increase.
