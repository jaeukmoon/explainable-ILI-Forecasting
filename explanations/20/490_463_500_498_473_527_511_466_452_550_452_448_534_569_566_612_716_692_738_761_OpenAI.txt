The future ILI occurrences of 839 after 5 weeks are likely due to an observed increasing trend in the past time series data, where ILI cases grew from 490 in week 1 to 761 in week 20, showing a relatively steady rise. Furthermore, the news consistently mentioned unusually low current flu activity but cautioned about the potential for a seasonal increase in the coming months. The gradual increase in ILI percentages (from 0.9% to 1.3%) and the acknowledgment of factors that could impact healthcare-seeking behaviors (like COVID-19) highlight underlying factors contributing to this rise in ILI occurrences. Combining these trends with predicted growth, 839 aligns with the trajectory.
