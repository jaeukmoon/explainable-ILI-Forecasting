The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 922 due to the observed gradual decline in ILI occurrences in the time-series data (from 1475 to 848) combined with minimal influenza activity mentioned in the news. The news explicitly reports that influenza activity remains unusually low, with only 1.3% of outpatient visits attributed to ILI—a figure below the national baseline of 2.6%. Additionally, the geographic spread of ILI activity is minimal in all jurisdictions, aligning with a continued downward trend in the weekly ILI reports and the current low hospitalization rates for influenza.
