The ILI occurrences are predicted to reach 9333 after 5 weeks based on the previous trend in the time-series data, which shows a steady increase over the past few weeks (from 7973 to 9036 and then to 9332). This aligns with the CDC's expectation of an increase in influenza activity in the coming weeks, supported by the slight rise in ILI outpatient visits (e.g., reported weekly percentages increasing from below the national baseline) despite currently low surveillance positivity rates. Additionally, historical data indicate recurring seasonal increases after periods of stability or low activity. Hence, the upward trajectory suggests this future ILI value.
