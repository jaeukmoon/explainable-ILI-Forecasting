- Explanation: Over the past 20 weeks, the ILI occurrences showed a rising trend, peaking at 813 in week 19 and slightly decreasing to 792 in week 20. Despite minimal ILI activity nationwide and low influenza positives reported in clinical and public health labs (0.1% positivity rate), the percentage of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained above the epidemic threshold, indicating potential severity. The stable ILI outpatient activity (1.1% patient visits) and ongoing risk factors likely combine with the historical upward trend in ILI occurrences to project the future weekly ILI cases to reach 996 after 5 weeks. This prediction also assumes increased winter seasonality effects, as suggested by historical patterns.
