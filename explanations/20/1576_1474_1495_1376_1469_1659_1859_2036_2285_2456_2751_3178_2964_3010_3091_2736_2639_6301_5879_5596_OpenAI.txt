- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, recent weeks witnessed a sharp rise in ILI occurrences, jumping from 2639 to 6301, reflecting an increasing trend that continued into subsequent weeks (5879 and 5596), indicating sustained activity. Coupled with the news, which described Influenza A dominance, regional variability in ILI activity (including areas of high activity), and mortality from respiratory diseases (exceeding epidemic thresholds), these factors suggest an ongoing intensified influenza transmission. Additionally, with virologic surveillance highlighting Influenza A as prevalent, and the recent high cases showing a correlation with prior activity peaks, it helps explain the projected jump to 6579 after 5 weeks.
