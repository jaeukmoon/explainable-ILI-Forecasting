- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks being 666 is supported by an increasing trend in outpatient visits for respiratory illness, as observed in previous weeks (e.g., reaching above the national baseline). Additionally, Influenza A(H3N2), which is the dominant strain, is noted to increase hospitalizations and mortality rates, with ILI activity varying regionally but remaining either moderate or high in several jurisdictions. These surges, coupled with lower flu vaccination uptake and ongoing co-circulation of respiratory pathogens like COVID-19, point to a continued elevation in ILI occurrences, projecting to 666 in the future 5-week timeline.
