- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 2687 due to observed increasing ILI trends in the time series data, with notable rises from week 11 (1794) to week 19 (3452). The slow increase in outpatient illness surveillance is consistent with this, as ILI healthcare visits slightly rose from 1.1% in week 16 to 1.3% in week 20, reflecting a gradual resurgence of ILI. While overall influenza activity remains below the national baseline, minor increases in ILI suggest continued growth, aligning with the projected value.
