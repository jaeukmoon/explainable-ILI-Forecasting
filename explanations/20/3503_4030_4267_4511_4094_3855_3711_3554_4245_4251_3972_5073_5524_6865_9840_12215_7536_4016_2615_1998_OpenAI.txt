- Explanation: The historical time-series data shows a significant decrease in ILI occurrences from Week 15 (12215 occurrences) to Week 20 (1998 occurrences). Additionally, the CDC reports indicate minimal to moderate ILI activity across regions, with 1.4% of outpatient visits attributed to ILI, below the national baseline of 2.4%, and limited severe disease indicators like hospitalization or pediatric deaths. However, the reports highlight gradually increasing trends of influenza virus detections and CDC expectations for flu activity to rise in coming weeks. Combining this with consistent seasonal patterns and surveillance predictions, the projected ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are estimated at 2040, reflecting a slight but controlled increase from recent lows given current trends and preventive measures in place.
