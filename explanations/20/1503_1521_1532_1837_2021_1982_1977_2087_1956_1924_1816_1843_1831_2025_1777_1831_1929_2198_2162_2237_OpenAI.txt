The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks being 3108 can be attributed to an observed increasing trend in the time-series data, with a gradual rise from week 15's value (1831 cases) to week 20's value (2237 cases). While the news consistently reports that influenza activity is lower than usual (e.g., only 0.1% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza and national ILI activity remains below baseline at 1.2%), it also emphasizes the potential for increases in flu activity in coming months, as noted in CDC's expectations. Thus, despite current low activity, a moderate rise over time—potentially due to delayed seasonal factors or external influences like evolving healthcare behaviors during the pandemic—is consistent with the projected ILI count of 3108.
