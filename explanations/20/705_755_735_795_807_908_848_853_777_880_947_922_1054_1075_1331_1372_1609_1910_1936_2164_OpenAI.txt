The future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks is 1665 due to the increasing trend observed in the recent time-series data and the influence of other respiratory illnesses amidst low influenza activity. The ILI occurrences have steadily risen from 1331 in Week 15 to 2164 in Week 20, showing consistent growth. Though influenza activity remains lower than usual with minimal geographic spread, the percentage of patient visits for ILI slightly increased from 1.1% to 1.3%. This suggests the rise in ILI is influenced by factors other than influenza, possibly COVID-19 or other respiratory conditions, as described in the news.
