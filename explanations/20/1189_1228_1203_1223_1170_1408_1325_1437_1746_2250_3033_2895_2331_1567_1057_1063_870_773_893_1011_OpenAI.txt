- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 1166 due to the recent trends in ILI activity showing a decline in outpatient visits for respiratory illness, as seen in the past time-series data where occurrences dropped sharply past a peak (e.g., from 3033 in Week 10 to 1057 in Week 15). Although influenza activity remains low with moderate activity in specific regions, national outpatient ILI percentages recently increased slightly but remain below the baseline. This combination of historical decline trends and recent low seasonal activity levels, coupled with vaccination efforts and antiviral availability, supports the prediction of stable yet reduced ILI occurrences in the upcoming weeks.
