- Explanation: The rise in ILI occurrences to 3646 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the gradual increase in influenza activity over recent weeks. The virologic surveillance data show a rising trend in positive specimens for Influenza A and B viruses, although still below national baselines. Outpatient ILI surveillance highlighted that 1.9% of patient visits were due to ILI, suggesting increasing spread, particularly among children and young adults. Meanwhile, the geographic spread shows moderate activity in some jurisdictions, indicating localized outbreaks. Historical time series data supports this upward trajectory, as ILI occurrences have progressively increased from 965 to 2067 over earlier weeks, suggesting a predictable pattern in seasonal growth due to delayed but growing regional flu activity combined with the impact of other respiratory viruses like COVID-19.
