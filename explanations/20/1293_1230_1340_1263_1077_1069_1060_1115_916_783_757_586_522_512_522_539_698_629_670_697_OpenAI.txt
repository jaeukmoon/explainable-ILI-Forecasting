Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 705 due to the observed stabilization of low-level ILI activity in the time series data and the consistently minimal influenza activity reported in the surveillance news. The time-series shows a gradual increase in ILI cases over the last three weeks (from 629 to 670 to 697), indicating a slow trend upward after weeks of decline. The news reports emphasize low influenza positivity rates (between 0.1%-0.4%) and minimal geographic influenza spread, yet caution that flu activity might increase in the coming months. This combination of slight upward trends in the time series and the possibility of increased flu activity contributes to forecasting a moderate increase in ILI occurrences to 705.
