The future ILI occurrence of 4180 projected after 5 weeks is likely due to the observed increasing trend in seasonal influenza activity, particularly in regions experiencing moderate to high ILI activity, as well as steadily rising outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses in the last few weeks (e.g., 1.6–2.3% of visits). While the percentage of visits remains below the national baseline, persistent co-circulation of respiratory viruses and cumulative hospitalization rates (e.g., 12.2–16.7 per 100,000) coupled with increasing activity in specific regions (e.g., northeast and mountain regions) indicate a gradual uptick in ILI cases. The predominance of influenza A(H3N2), characterized by some antigenic differences and its association with moderate hospitalization and fatality risks, further supports this projection.
