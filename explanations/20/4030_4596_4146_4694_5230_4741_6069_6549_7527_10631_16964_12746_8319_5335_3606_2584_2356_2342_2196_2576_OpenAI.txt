Explanation: Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 3918 based on the decreasing trend in ILI occurrences over the past 20 weeks (e.g., from 10631 in Week 10 to 2584 in Week 15 and remaining low). Additionally, summarized news reports indicate that influenza activity in the U.S. has been low but steadily increasing in recent weeks, with outpatient ILI visits staying below or near the baseline (e.g., 1.9%-2.4%, below the national baseline of 2.5%). This steady increase, coupled with a historically declining trend and relatively low influenza virus circulation, supports the estimated ILI occurrences of 3918.
