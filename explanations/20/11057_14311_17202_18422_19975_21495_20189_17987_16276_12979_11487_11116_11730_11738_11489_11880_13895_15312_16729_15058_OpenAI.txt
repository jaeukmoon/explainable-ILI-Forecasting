Explanation: The prediction that future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks will be 43,523 is based on observing that the past time-series data shows a general upward trend in ILI cases, particularly in the last 5 weeks. From week 15 onwards, cases increased from 11,489 to 16,729, hinting at a trend reversal to higher flu activity. Coupling this with news emphasizing that pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality has exceeded the epidemic threshold (7.1%) and that other severe disease indicators could worsen, we anticipate this upward trajectory will continue, leading to a significant spike in ILI cases over the next few weeks.
