The future ILI occurrences of 4317 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the slight yet consistent increase in influenza activity observed in previous weeks. While influenza A(H3N2) remained the dominant strain, regional variations in activity and a stable percentage of outpatient respiratory illness visits (below baseline) indicated a limited but ongoing contribution of influenza to respiratory illness. Hospitalizations and mortality remained notable, with cumulative hospitalization rates trending lower than pre-COVID-19 seasons, and no significant rise in pediatric deaths reported. This data, combined with the consistent presence of respiratory viruses despite declining national trends, suggests sustained moderate ILI levels, aligning with the predicted count of 4317 cases after 5 weeks.
