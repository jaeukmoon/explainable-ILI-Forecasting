- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are expected to be 8600 because the time-series data indicate a steady decline in ILI occurrences over recent weeks, from a prior peak of 43,523 to a current value of 10,333. Additionally, the CDC reports highlight that influenza activity remains low, with outpatient visits for ILI below the national baseline (e.g., 1.4% versus a baseline of 2.4%), a minimal geographic spread across most regions, and low hospitalization and mortality rates. Given these trends of decreasing activity, along with CDC's expectation of continued low but gradually increasing flu activity, the projection of 8600 aligns with the observed downtrend and smaller fluctuations in ILI data.
