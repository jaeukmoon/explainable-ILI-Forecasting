- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after five weeks are projected to reach 14,311 due to the increasing trend observed in recent time-series data, where ILI counts rose from 6,883 to 9,922 over 16 weeks, suggesting a steady growth pattern. Although past news indicated minimal ILI activity (below the 2.6% baseline) and exceptionally low virologic surveillance results (0.1% positive specimens), the rise in the time-series data likely reflects additional factors such as gradual recovery from pandemic-related healthcare disruptions or other emerging regional contributions not detailed in news surveillance data but inferred from the consistent upward trajectory.
