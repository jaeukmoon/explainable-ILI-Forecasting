Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences have shown a steady increase since week 16, aligning with historical trends of rising influenza activity during seasonal transitions. Five weeks ago, ILI numbers were 1859 and continued to increase due to higher activity as reflected in minimal but gradual outpatient ILI increases from 0.9% to 1.3%. Though influenza surveillance reports indicate activity remains below baseline, growing percentages of outpatient ILI visits signal a consistent upward trend due to typical seasonal flu dynamics. Hence, the ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to reach 3178 given prior weeks' activity.
