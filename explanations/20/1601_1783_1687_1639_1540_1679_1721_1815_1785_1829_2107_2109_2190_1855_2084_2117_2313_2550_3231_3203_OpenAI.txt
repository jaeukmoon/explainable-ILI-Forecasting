- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 1111 after 5 weeks could be attributed to a decreasing trend in the past ILI occurrences in the time-series data (from 3231 to 3203 in the last observed week), reflecting lower influenza activity. Additionally, surveillance reports indicate consistently low ILI percentages (e.g., below the national baseline of 2.6%) across most regions, minimal influenza contributions to respiratory illness, and no substantial escalation in hospitalizations or pediatric mortality. These factors signify diminishing flu transmission and explain the projected lower ILI number.
