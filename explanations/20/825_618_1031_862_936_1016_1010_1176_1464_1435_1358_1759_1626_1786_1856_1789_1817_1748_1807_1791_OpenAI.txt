- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are 3354 due to the consistent upward trend in the time-series data where the ILI occurrences steadily increased from week 8 (1176) to week 15 (1789), indicating a periodic rise in flu activity over time. Although the past influenza surveillance reports emphasized that influenza activity was lower than usual — with only 0.1% of specimens testing positive and outpatient visits for ILI below the national baseline of 2.6% — the data trends in the time series still suggest localized increases. Furthermore, the minimal ILI activity reported may have been underestimated due to the confounding impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surveillance systems. Therefore, the increase to 3354 aligns with the observed pattern and expectations of a seasonal resurgence.
