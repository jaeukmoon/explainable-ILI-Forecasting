The future ILI occurrence of 35,304 after 5 weeks is driven by a combination of factors evident in the past time-series data and summarized news reports. From the time-series data, there is an observed upward trend in ILI figures during several cycles, such as the growth from 11,116 to 21,495 over preceding weeks, indicating potential seasonality. Coupled with recent increases in outpatient visits for ILI to near or above baseline levels and the detection of Influenza A (H3N2) as predominant, as highlighted in surveillance reports, these suggest rising flu activity. Additionally, news reports emphasize low vaccination rates and regional inconsistency in activity levels, which may exacerbate the spread. Together, these evidence trends and gaps in mitigation efforts likely forecast the significant rise in ILI occurrences.
