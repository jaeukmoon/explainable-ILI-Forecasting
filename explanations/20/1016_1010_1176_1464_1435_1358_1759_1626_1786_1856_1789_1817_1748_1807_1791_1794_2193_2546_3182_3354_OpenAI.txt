The future ILI occurrences reaching 3452 after 5 weeks is a result of the observed steady increase in the past 5 weeks of time-series data (from 2193 to 3354), indicating a rising trend. Additionally, the CDC's reports suggest ongoing low baseline activity but caution that flu activity may increase in the coming weeks as inferred from slight upticks in ILI outpatient visits and ongoing public health vigilance. This combination of rising historical data trends and potential seasonal progression explains the projected ILI occurrence.
