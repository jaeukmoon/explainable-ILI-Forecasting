Based on the past time series data, which shows a consistent pattern of decreasing ILI occurrences over recent weeks (including from 9873 to 9554 over 20 weeks) and the accompanying news reports emphasizing unusually low influenza activity, including minimal positive influenza tests (0.1%-0.4%), low outpatient ILI visits (1%-1.7% below the national baseline of 2.6%), and minimal geographic activity, the prediction of future ILI occurrences at 7813 reflects a gradual yet stabilizing decline trend. This aligns with the historical seasonal decline in ILI and current surveillance data, which indicates that influenza activity is not expected to surge drastically in the near term.
