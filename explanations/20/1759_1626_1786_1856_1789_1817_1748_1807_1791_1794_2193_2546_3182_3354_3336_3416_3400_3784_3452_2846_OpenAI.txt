- Explanation: The future ILI occurrences of 2,491 after five weeks can be attributed to the seasonal ILI trend and recent decreases in activity. The ILI time series shows a sharp decline from a peak of 3,784 to 2,846 in the most recent week, reflecting a diminishing trajectory. Supporting this, CDC reports across the weeks consistently highlight that influenza activity remains much lower than usual, with ILI percentages below the national baseline (e.g., 1.1%-1.3%). Combined, the declining trend in past ILI data and the ongoing minimal influenza activity explain the expected stabilization at 2,491 ILI occurrences in future weeks.
