The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2548 based on the observed trends in time-series data and news reports. The time-series shows a general decline in ILI cases recently, with the latest occurrences at 1923, indicating a stabilization after previous peaks. News reports emphasize reduced positivity of influenza tests, low ILI activity below baseline, and a co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, implying that influenza’s relative contribution to ILI remains low. Hospitalizations and deaths remain manageable compared to historical highs, supporting the projection of continued moderate ILI occurrences near 2548 in the following weeks, aligned with current regional and national trends.
