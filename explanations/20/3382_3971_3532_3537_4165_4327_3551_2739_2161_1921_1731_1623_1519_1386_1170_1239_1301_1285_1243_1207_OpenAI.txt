The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 2171 due to the consistent, steady downward trend in past ILI occurrences shown in the time-series data. For instance, the past data demonstrates a decline from 3382 in week 1 to 1207 in week 20. This aligns with the summarized news, which highlights a decrease in outpatient visits for respiratory illness and stabilization of ILI activity below baseline levels across regions in recent weeks. Additionally, virologic surveillance data reports a low percentage of influenza-positive specimens, suggesting reduced influenza activity contributing to fewer ILI cases. Hence, the continuation of these trends supports the forecasted value.
