The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 5955 because the time-series data shows a repeating trend of seasonal influenza peaks followed by declines, with current weekly trends indicating rising activity. Supporting this, the summarized news highlights that the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI is slightly above the national baseline, hospitalizations for influenza are increasing, and certain regions are experiencing moderate to high ILI activity. The co-circulation of Influenza A(H3N2) and expected continuation of these trends suggest a sustained rise before a decline in ILI cases.
