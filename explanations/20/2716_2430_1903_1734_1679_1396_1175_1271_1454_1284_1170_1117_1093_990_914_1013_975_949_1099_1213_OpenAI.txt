The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1558 based on the observation that ILI activity has been consistently lower than the national baseline (1.1%-1.6% of visits compared to a baseline of 2.6%) according to the summarized news, with sporadic and minimal flu activity reported across jurisdictions, and no significant increases observed in virologic data (e.g., only 0.1%-0.3% of respiratory specimens testing positive). However, CDC emphasizes that flu activity is expected to rise in the coming months, aligning with a modest increase in recent ILI occurrences in the provided time-series data (e.g., rising from 990 to 1213 over the last weeks), suggesting a continued gradual recovery leading to the projected value of 1558 in 5 weeks.
