The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 3605 based on the downward trend observed in the time-series data, where ILI cases have steadily decreased from the peak of 9045 in week 5 to current levels around 3839 in week 20, along with the news evidence indicating that "influenza activity has been sporadic across regions" and "outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses remain below the national baseline." Although there is ongoing circulation of Influenza A(H3N2), hospitalization rates and severe disease outcomes remain manageable, suggesting that ILI cases will continue to decline in the short term.
