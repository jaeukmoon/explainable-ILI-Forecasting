- Explanation:  
The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 1956 because the recent time-series trend shows a slight increase in ILI counts, such as 1532 to 1837 in Week 20, indicating an upward trajectory. Coupled with news evidence highlighting low baseline ILI levels (1.3%-1.6%) and minimal to moderate geographic ILI activity, an increase in influenza-like illness is anticipated as CDC projects future flu activity to likely rise. The combination of these upward trends and historical seasonality factors supports this 5-week prediction.
