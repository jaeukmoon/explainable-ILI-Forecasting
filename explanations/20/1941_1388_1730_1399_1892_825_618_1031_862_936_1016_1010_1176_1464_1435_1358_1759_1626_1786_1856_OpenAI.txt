The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are expected to be 1791 due to the upward trend observed in the past time-series data, where recent fluctuations indicate a gradual increase in weekly ILI counts from 1358 (week 15) to 1856 (week 20). This aligns with the news reports that, while influenza activity remains unusually low, experts caution that it may increase in the coming months. Additionally, the impact of changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to underreporting, but increased activity is anticipated as a partial rebound effect.
