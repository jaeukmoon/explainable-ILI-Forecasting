The expected future ILI occurrences after five weeks are 2309 due to the consistent downward trend in ILI occurrences seen in the past time-series data, with a drop from 6552 to 1729 over the last 10 weeks, showing a stable decline overall. Additionally, despite the recent slight increases in influenza activity mentioned in the summarized CDC reports, overall activity remains low nationwide, with outpatient visits for ILI still below the national baseline (e.g., 1.4% and 2.4% in different weeks). Vaccination campaigns and sporadic activity across most regions further support the anticipated continuation of this low trend.
