The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are predicted to be 18,608 due to observable rising trends in historical time-series data and supportive external insights from surveillance reports. Over the past 20 weeks, ILI occurrences generally increased steadily from 7,957 to 13,895, peaking around week 10 (21,495) then stabilizing between 11,116 and 13,895. This trend suggests cyclic patterns influenced by seasonal variations typical for influenza, as highlighted by virologic surveillance indicating consistent circulation of Influenza A viruses and below-baseline ILI activity in most regions. The slight rebound in ILI activity coupled with increased positive respiratory specimens implies a resurgence, aligning with predictive public health trends and historical seasonality.
