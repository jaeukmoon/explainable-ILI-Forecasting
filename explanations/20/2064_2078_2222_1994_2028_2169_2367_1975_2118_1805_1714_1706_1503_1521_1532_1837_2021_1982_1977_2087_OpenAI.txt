- Explanation: Based on the time-series data, ILI occurrences tended to fluctuate with minimal long-term changes, averaging around 1800-2000 in recent weeks. Despite seasonal influenza activity remaining low, as indicated by virologic surveillance with only 0.1% of specimens testing positive for the flu and 1.6% of outpatient visits attributed to ILI (below the national baseline of 2.6%), CDC reports caution a possible increase in flu activity in upcoming months due to seasonality. Combining the historical trend stability and the slight caution about upcoming increases, the ILI occurrences in five weeks reaching 1831 aligns with this consistent pattern while remaining below peaks seen earlier in the data.
