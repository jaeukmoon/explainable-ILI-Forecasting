- Explanation: The forecasted ILI occurrence of 4771 in five weeks is supported by the increasing trend in reported ILI percentages and virologic surveillance. Recent historical time-series data show a cyclic pattern in ILI occurrences, with a slight dip followed by steady increases, such as the rise from Week 15 (1757) to Week 19 (2378). Additionally, multiple news updates confirm a gradual rise in influenza activity, with influenza A(H3N2) predominating and outpatient ILI visits trending upwards towards the national baseline. These factors collectively suggest that the next phase aligns with increasing influenza activity, consistent with the projection of 4771 occurrences in five weeks.
