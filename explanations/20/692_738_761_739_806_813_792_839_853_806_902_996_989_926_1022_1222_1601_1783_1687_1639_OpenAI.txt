Based on the time-series data, where ILI occurrences have consistently increased over the past weeks (e.g., rising from 692 in week 1 to 1783 and 1639 in the last two weeks), the trend suggests elevated activity despite fluctuations. The news reports indicate that ILI activity remains below the national baseline (e.g., 1.2%-1.3% of outpatient visits in recent weeks) but shows a slight upward trend, with ILI activity below historical levels. Additionally, virologic surveillance highlights minimal influenza positivity (0.1%) and low geographic activity across jurisdictions. Combining these factors, it is reasonable to extrapolate future ILI occurrences to reach 1785 after five weeks, accounting for the consistent increase in ILI cases from the time-series trend and low baseline activity reported.
