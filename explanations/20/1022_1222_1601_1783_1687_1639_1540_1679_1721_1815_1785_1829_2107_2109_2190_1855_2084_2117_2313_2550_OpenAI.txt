The future ILI occurrence of 1539 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the observed decline in ILI activity from recent trends in the time-series data, where occurrences peaked at 2550 but started decreasing in the last few weeks (2313, 2117), suggesting a downward trend. This aligns with the news reports indicating that the overall influenza activity remains low, with minimal ILI reported and most patient visits for respiratory illnesses being below the national baseline of 2.6%. Additionally, the reports highlight that increases in ILI activity are often due to other respiratory viruses rather than influenza, further supporting the expectation of lower ILI cases in the coming weeks.
