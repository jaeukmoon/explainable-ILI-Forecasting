The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are projected to be 1644 due to the observed decline in ILI activity from previous weeks, supported by the decreasing percentage of outpatient visits for ILI, which fell below the national baseline (e.g., 2.2% to 0.9% in recent reports), and the reported minimal to moderate ILI activity across regions. Additionally, virologic surveillance indicates that influenza activity remains low, with sporadic geographic spread, and previous time-series data show a past trend of reduction in ILI occurrences before a resurgence. This declining trend, alongside enhanced public health measures (e.g., vaccinations), suggests a further decrease leading to the projected figure.
