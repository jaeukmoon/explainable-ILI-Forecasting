- **Explanation**: The future ILI occurrence of 899 after 5 weeks is likely due to the overall decreasing trend in ILI occurrences in the past time-series data (e.g., from a peak of 6147 in Week 20 to 4249, 3957, and 3646 in subsequent weeks), along with news reports stating that influenza activity remains low nationwide, with ILI visits below the national baseline of 2.6% in the observed weeks. Additionally, virologic surveillance confirmed low influenza circulation, primarily due to Influenza B, and reports emphasized changes in health-seeking behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may further suppress reported ILI rates. These factors collectively suggest a projected continued decline in ILI occurrences.
