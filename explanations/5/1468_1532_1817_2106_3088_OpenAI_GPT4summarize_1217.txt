1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent upward trajectory, with values increasing from 1468 (Week 30, 2023) to 1532 (Week 31, 2023), 1817 (Week 32, 2023), 2106 (Week 33, 2023), and peaking at 3088 (Week 34, 2023). This continuous and steep escalation indicates a strong upward momentum in ILI activity over the observed period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the significant increase from Week 30 to Week 34, 2023, particularly the steep jump in Week 34, aligns with the reported rise to 3320 future occurrences (Week 39, 2023). The persistent and steep rise during the latter weeks of past data acts as a clear precursor to the elevated future activity levels.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI progressively increased weekly, starting at 1.2% (Week 30, 2023), then 1.1% (Week 31, 2023), 1.3% (Week 32, 2023), 1.5% (Week 33, 2023), and peaking at 1.7% (Week 34, 2023). The continuous growth, particularly among children aged 0–4 years, who consistently exhibited the highest rates, contributed significantly to the rising ILI occurrences.
4. The percentage of deaths caused by pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded epidemic thresholds across all weeks, increasing from 5.7% (Week 30, 2023) to 6.5% (Week 34, 2023). This trend indicates elevated respiratory illness activity, contributing to the heightened future ILI levels.
5. Increased co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, as highlighted in Weeks 30–34, 2023, likely exacerbated respiratory illness trends, leading to higher healthcare burdens and contributing to the rise in ILI occurrences to 3320 by Week 39, 2023.
6. In summary, the reported 3320 future ILI occurrences (Week 39, 2023) can be explained by the steep upward trend in past occurrences, consistent growth in ILI-related healthcare visits, persistently elevated PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, and the compounding effects of increased respiratory virus co-circulation during Weeks 30–34, 2023.
