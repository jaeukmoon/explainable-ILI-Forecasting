1. The ILI occurrences from Week30 to Week34, 2022 were 13067, 11626, 11715, 13526, and 15614. The trend shows an initial decrease from Week30 (13067) to Week31 (11626), stable levels in Week32 (11715), followed by a significant uptick in Week33 (13526) and Week34 (15614). This indicates a clear upward trend in ILI occurrences over the last two weeks, suggesting a progression towards increased flu activity.
2. Week39, 2022 is forecasted to belong to the peak onset season. This aligns with the typical U.S. seasonal pattern, as flu activity generally starts to climb from around Week32 to Week46. Coupled with the observed recent increases in ILI occurrences, this reinforces the attribution to the peak onset season in this timeframe.
3. Extrapolating from the observed upward trend in Week33 and Week34, time-series forecasting suggests continued growth in ILI occurrences over the next five weeks. The increase from Week33 to Week34 (2112 cases) indicates an accelerating trajectory, which projects forward to a figure like 17337 by Week39, 2022, as part of a broader seasonal escalation.
4. Low influenza activity was observed early in the reporting period, but subsequent weeks indicated rising outpatient ILI visits (1.4% in Week32, 1.5% in Week33, and 1.8% in Week34), particularly in children aged 0-4 years with the highest incidence rates (Week32: 5.9%, Week33: 6.3%, Week34: 7.0%). This aligns with historical patterns of the flu season beginning its upward trajectory at this point (Week34, 2022 #4; Week33, 2022 #4; Week32, 2022 #5).
5. Despite low vaccination coverage updates in CDC reports, the introduction of novel variants like H3N2v and H1N2v (Week30, 2022 #7; Week31, 2022 #4; Week32, 2022 #4; Week33, 2022 #3) and overlapping circulation with COVID-19 highlighted in each week's surveillance report (Week30, 2022 #10; Week31, 2022 #10; Week32, 2022 #11; Week33, 2022 #9; Week34, 2022 #10) suggest a complex respiratory illness landscape, potentially amplifying ILI rates.
6. The cumulative hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were 491 in Week30, declining in subsequent weeks (506 in Week31, 457 in Week32, 477 in Week33, and 486 in Week34). However, the trajectory of outpatient respiratory illness visits and pediatric ILI rates, alongside virologic data indicating an increasing presence of Influenza A (mainly H3N2, exceeding 85% in Weeks30-34), points towards a likely growth in ILI cases nearing Week39 (Week30, 2022 #1, #2; Week31, 2022 #2, #3; Week34, 2022 #2, #3).
7. In summary, the forecasted ILI figure of 17337 is supported by a consistent upward trend in time-series data from Week30 to Week34, the recognition of Week39 falling in the peak onset season, and CDC weekly reports highlighting increased outpatient visits, introduction of novel flu variants, and co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors collectively drive the anticipated rise in ILI cases by Week39, 2022.
