1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent downward trend, with values decreasing from 12267 (Week12, 2024) to 6649 (Week16, 2024). A steep decline was observed in the first three weeks, from 12267 (Week12, 2024) to 9899 (Week14, 2024), slowing slightly during the latter weeks, with a final value of 6649 (Week16, 2024). This consistent reduction highlights decreased ILI activity over the observed period.
2. A clear negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the downward trend in past ILI occurrences (Weeks12–16, 2024) aligns with the decline to 3826 future occurrences by Week21, 2024. The steady reduction in previous weeks suggests a continuation of the declining trend, culminating in the substantially lower future value.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI decreased from 3.1% (Week12, 2024) to 2.3% (Week16, 2024), consistently staying below the national baseline starting in Week14, 2024. These declines in healthcare encounters for respiratory illnesses align closely with the observed reduction in future cases.
4. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza steadily dropped from 10.5% (Week12, 2024) to 4.8% (Week16, 2024). This decline in influenza activity parallels the diminishing ILI cases, reinforcing the reduced future ILI levels reported.
5. Co-circulation of other viruses like RSV and COVID-19, noted throughout the summarized reports, gradually decreased in impact as influenza activity waned nationally. This diminished co-circulation likely contributed to the observed lower future ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 3826 future ILI occurrences (Week21, 2024) can be attributed to the consistent downward trend observed in Weeks12–16, 2024, reduced outpatient visits for ILI, declining influenza positivity rates, and the diminished impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses across the observed timeframe.
