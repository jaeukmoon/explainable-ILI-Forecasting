1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week35, 2021 to Week39, 2021 are 17987, 16276, 12979, 11487, and 11116. This demonstrates a clear and consistent downward trend over the five weeks, with weekly decreases in ILI counts. There are no significant spikes or fluctuations, indicating steadily declining activity levels during this period.
2. Based on the U.S. influenza season classifications, Week44, 2021 falls within the peak onset season, which typically spans from Week35 to Week46. Although influenza activity is minimal in the provided weeks, Week44 aligns with this transitional period before the traditional peak season begins.
3. The time-series analysis suggests that ILI occurrences are declining at a diminishing rate across the past five weeks. Extrapolating this trend through Week44, 2021, a continued reduction is expected. However, since Week44 resides in the peak onset phase, a slower decline or stabilization around intermediate levels, rather than a sharp fall, appears consistent in projecting 13895 ILI occurrences.
4. Nationwide influenza circulation remains minimal throughout the period, with outpatient respiratory visits for ILI consistently below the baseline of 2.6% (Week35, 2021 #1; Week36, 2021 #1; Week37, 2021 #1; Week38, 2021 #1; Week39, 2021 #1). Low flu positivity rates at clinical and public health labs (Week36, 2021 #3; Week37, 2021 #6; Week38, 2021 #2; Week39, 2021 #5) reflect limited influenza transmission, supporting the projected moderate future ILI numbers.
5. Co-circulation of non-influenza respiratory viruses, particularly COVID-19, continues to drive outpatient respiratory visits (Week36, 2021 #2; Week37, 2021 #5; Week38, 2021 #8; Week39, 2021 #2). The ongoing impact of healthcare-seeking behavior shifts and challenges in data interpretation (Week35, 2021 #10; Week36, 2021 #9; Week38, 2021 #7; Week39, 2021 #9) further complicates precise predictions, requiring tempered expectations for a mild reduction without significant deviation.
6. Vaccination trends are not highlighted in the reports, yet CDC emphasizes the importance of annual flu vaccination (Week35, 2021 #6; Week37, 2021 #8; Week38, 2021 #6; Week39, 2021 #8). While specific impacts on ILI reduction are unclear, seasonal flu vaccinations likely contribute to the containment of widespread influenza activity.
7. Collectively, the downward trend in past ILI occurrences, minimal influenza circulation amidst dominant respiratory viruses (e.g., COVID-19), the timing of the peak onset season, and the influence of vaccination all justify the projected intermediate level of 13895 future ILI occurrences for Week44, 2021.
