1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating trend with an overall upward trajectory by the final week. Starting at 1665 in Week 38, 2021, there was a slight drop to 1587 in Week 39, followed by a noticeable spike to 2438 in Week 40. Although there was a small decline to 2230 in Week 41, the occurrences rose again to 2476 in Week 42, 2021. This pattern indicates an overall escalation in ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period.  

2. A positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the upward fluctuations observed during Weeks 40–42, 2021, align with the reported rise to 2652 occurrences in the future period (Week 47, 2021). The sustained increase in ILI counts in recent weeks appears to serve as a precursor to the elevated future activity.  

3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently accounted for a small but steady percentage (1.9% in Weeks 38–40 and dropping slightly to 1.8% in Weeks 41–42, 2021), remaining below the national baseline. However, the trend suggests slight regional variances in respiratory illness activity that may have contributed to the observed future rise.  
   Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) significantly surpassed epidemic thresholds, ranging from 20.9% (Week 38, 2021) to 16.5% (Week 42, 2021), primarily driven by COVID-19, reflecting sustained pressure from respiratory illnesses overall.  
   Behavioral shifts in healthcare-seeking during the pandemic, discussed across all weeks, likely impacted ILI reporting, potentially leading to underestimation or delayed recognition that could materialize in amplified future ILI counts.  

4. In summary, the future ILI count of 2652 in Week 47, 2021, is likely driven by the subtle but growing trend in past ILI occurrences, correlations between increasing PIC-related fatalities and respiratory activity, and the influence of pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior, which collectively contributed to the future surge.
