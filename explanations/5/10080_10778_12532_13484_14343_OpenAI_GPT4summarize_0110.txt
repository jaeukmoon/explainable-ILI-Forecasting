1. The ILI counts from Week13 to Week17, 2022, are 10080, 10778, 12532, 13484, and 14343, respectively. The trend shows a consistent week-over-week increase in ILI occurrences, with the last five weeks presenting a steady, upward trajectory. No fluctuations or dips are observed during this period, indicating a sustained rising trend.
2. Week22, 2022, occurs after Week17, 2022, during a known off-season peak (Week19, 2022). Based on CDC-defined season categories, the target week (Week22, 2022) aligns best with an off-season peak, where circulating respiratory illnesses, specifically influenza, may temporarily rise beyond baseline levels.
3. The increasing ILI counts from Week13 to Week17, 2022, demonstrate a strong momentum in upward trends characteristic of off-season peaks. By projecting this pattern using a time-series forecasting approach, the continued rise over the next five weeks suggests that occurrences will escalate further, reaching a forecasted value of 23985. The steady intensification aligns with historical models of upward trending periods.
4. The dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) (Week13, 2022 #2, #3; Week14, 2022 #2, #3; Week15, 2022 #2, #3; Week16, 2022 #2; Week17, 2022 #2) strongly influences the forecast, as this strain has been associated with higher transmission rates and increased hospitalizations compared to other types. This strain's genetic drift (Week13, 2022 #9) might also contribute to a potential mismatch with the vaccine, further sustaining elevated transmission levels.
5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 (Week13, 2022 #13; Week14, 2022 #13; Week15, 2022 #12; Week16, 2022 #11; Week17, 2022 #9) complicates attribution and adds to the burden of respiratory illnesses, indirectly driving up ILI occurrences in the forecast period.
6. Vaccination rates, though encouraged, have shown limited impact in curbing hospitalizations due to the partial antigenic mismatch of circulating A(H3N2) strains with the vaccine (Week13, 2022 #9; Week14, 2022 #8; Week15, 2022 #10; Week16, 2022 #10; Week17, 2022 #8). As a result, the protective effect against widespread occurrence may be reduced.
7. Combining the consistent rise in past ILI occurrences with the dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), co-circulation of additional respiratory viruses, suboptimal effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, and alignment with an off-season peak timing, the predicted ILI value of 23985 for Week22, 2022, is consistent with the overall forecasted trajectory.
