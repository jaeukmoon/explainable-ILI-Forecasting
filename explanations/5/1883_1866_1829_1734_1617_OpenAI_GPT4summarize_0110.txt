1. The reported ILI counts from Week16 to Week20, 2023 are 1883, 1866, 1829, 1734, and 1617. These data show a steady and consistent decline in ILI occurrences week-over-week, indicating a downward trend in influenza-like activity during this period without any significant fluctuations or spikes. The pattern suggests a persistent reduction in cases toward low activity levels.
2. Based on the influenza season classification, Week25, 2023 falls within the typical off-season period for ILI activity in the United States (Week1, 2023 to Week31, 2023). Historical context and recent low activity levels further confirm an off-season classification for the target week.
3. The consistent decline in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks suggests a continuation of this downward trend into successive weeks. Time-series forecasting models often extrapolate from such patterns, and the lack of disruptions or new factors indicates a further reduction in ILI counts, aligning with the prediction of 889 occurrences by Week25, 2023.
4. Analysis of the summarized CDC reports identifies three primary factors influencing this projection: (1) Nationwide influenza activity has remained low across all five weeks, with influenza positivity rates hovering between 0.8% and 1.1% (Week16, 2023 #1; Week20, 2023 #1). (2) The influenza vaccine is well-matched to circulating strains, and antiviral susceptibility remains robust, minimizing severe outbreaks (Week16, 2023 #7; Week18, 2023 #9; Week20, 2023 #8). (3) Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, affects respiratory trends but has not resulted in any inflation in ILI activity (Week16, 2023 #11; Week20, 2023 #10).
5. Additional factors supporting the low forecast include stable or decreasing trends in deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) just above the epidemic threshold (Week16, 2023 #5; Week19, 2023 #5), stable outpatient respiratory illness visits consistently below the national baseline of 2.5% (Week16, 2023 #3; Week20, 2023 #3), and a marked decline or stability in hospitalization rates across recent weeks (Week16, 2023 #10; Week19, 2023 #4).
6. With national positivity rates for influenza remaining at about 1.0% and minimal flu hospitalization or outbreaks reported, the ILI occurrences are consistent with off-season behavior observed in prior years, confirming the projection of reduced activity levels by Week25, 2023.
7. In summary, the steady decrease in ILI cases, alignment with off-season activity, widespread vaccine effectiveness, stable outpatient trends, and absence of major disruptions or novel respiratory triggers collectively explain the prediction of 889 ILI occurrences for Week25, 2023.
