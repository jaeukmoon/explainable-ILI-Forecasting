1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1634', '1722', '1849', '2257', '2656']. Week34, 2024, began at 1634, progressively increasing through Week35, 2024 (1722), and Week36, 2024 (1849), peaking at 2656 by Week38, 2024. This steady rise indicates escalating ILI activity, with Week38, 2024, recording the highest occurrence in the observed period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences. The steady rise in ILI data from Week34, 2024, to Week38, 2024, culminates in the future surge to 3269 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week43, 2024). Each subsequent week shows increasing activity, aligning with the continuation of this trend beyond Week38, 2024, into the future.
3. Outpatient ILI visits consistently remained at 1.8% across all 5 weeks, just below the national baseline. However, slight increases in the younger age cohorts (0–24 years) are noted by Week37, 2024, and Week38, 2024. These shifts, associated with overlapping respiratory virus activity (including RSV and COVID-19), likely contributed to the future ILI rise.
4. Minimal resistance to antiviral medications observed throughout the period, coupled with robust antigenic similarity between circulating strains and vaccine references (Week38, 2024), may have reduced immediate influenza control strategies' effectiveness, indirectly supporting the rise in future occurrences despite low initial activity.
5. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including influenza, COVID-19, and RSV, highlighted in each week's reports, dominated respiratory illnesses regionally. Their concurrent activity during Week34, 2024, through Week38, 2024, created cumulative impacts that likely amplified reporting and ILI occurrences in the following weeks.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences at 3269 (Week43, 2024) resulted from a clear upward trajectory in the past 5-week trends, persistent outpatient ILI visit rates with increased younger cohort activity, cumulative impacts of co-circulating respiratory viruses, and small challenges in antiviral effectiveness. These factors combined to produce the observed escalation in occurrences.
