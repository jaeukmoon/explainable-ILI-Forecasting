1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a significant decline, with values of ['13413', '10333', '9072', '9072', '9028']. After an initial drop from 13413 in Week4, 2022, to 10333 in Week5, 2022, the values continued to decrease to a plateau at 9072 during Week6, 2022, and Week7, 2022, before slightly reducing to 9028 in Week8, 2022. This overall declining trend indicates reduced ILI activity over the 5-week period.
2. A positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, demonstrated by the leveling off in Weeks 6–8, 2022. The stabilization of cases during these weeks suggests that ILI activity may have been underreported or delayed, leading to the surge of 10080 occurrences observed after 5 weeks. This transition aligns with the expected rebound effect as underlying drivers of ILI strengthen.
3. The consistent rise in influenza test positivity percentages from 2.0% (Week5, 2022) to 4.1% (Week8, 2022) signals a gradual resurgence in influenza activity, contributing to increased future ILI occurrences. Meanwhile, hospitalizations due to ILI consistently increased, from a cumulative rate of 4.5 per 100,000 in Week5, 2022, to 5.2 per 100,000 in Week8, 2022, indicating a steady aggravation in illness severity. Additionally, low vaccination rates cited across all weeks increase susceptibility, while antigenic differences in A(H3N2) may render vaccines less effective, fueling future ILI spikes.
4. Elevated deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC), surpassing epidemic thresholds in all weeks, reflect heightened respiratory illness activity. Despite influenza playing a minimal role relative to COVID-19, the steady influence of these illnesses highlights the growing burden of respiratory diseases, driving future ILI increases.
5. In summary, the reported 10080 future ILI occurrences (Week13, 2022) can be attributed to the stabilization of past ILI trends, increasing influenza activity reflected in test positivity and hospitalizations, low vaccination rates coupled with antigenic mismatches in circulating A(H3N2) strains, and persistently high PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds.
