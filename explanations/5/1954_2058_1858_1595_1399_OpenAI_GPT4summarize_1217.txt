1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decreasing trend, with values of ['1954', '2058', '1858', '1595', '1399']. Starting with 1954 in Week 20, 2022, there was a slight increase to 2058 in Week 21, 2022, followed by a sharp and steady decline over the subsequent weeks to 1399 by Week 24, 2022. This downward trajectory indicates reduced ILI activity over the 5-week period.
2. The decline in ILI occurrences during Weeks 22–24, 2022, correlates with the reported further decrease to 845 future occurrences by Week 29, 2022. This consistent downward trend serves as a precursor to the significantly reduced ILI activity observed 5 weeks later in Week 29.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI declined from 2.4% (Week 20, 2022) to 1.9% (Week 24, 2022). This reduction in healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory illnesses aligns with the continuous decrease in reported ILI occurrences, contributing to the decline in future ILI cases to 845 in Week 29, 2022.
4. Influenza positivity rates decreased noticeably from 6.4% (Week 20, 2022) to 2.5% (Week 24, 2022), reflecting diminishing influenza activity. This reduction mirrors the shrinking number of lab-confirmed influenza cases, which significantly contributed to the overall reduced ILI activity manifesting in the future occurrence of 845.
5. A sharp reduction in high influenza-related activity was observed geographically, with most regions reporting minimal activity by Week 24, 2022, compared to moderate or high activity earlier. The consistent geographical downturn supports the lower future ILI occurrences to 845 in Week 29, 2022.
6. In summary, the reported 845 future ILI occurrences (Week 29, 2022) can be attributed to the declining 5-week trend of ILI occurrences, reduced outpatient visits for respiratory illness, decreasing influenza positivity rates, and widespread geographic decline in influenza activity as documented in Weeks 20–24, 2022.
