1. The past time-series ILI occurrences from Weeks 32–36, 2023, demonstrated fluctuating trends with an overall increase by the fifth week. The values ['1216', '1141', '1227', '1208', '1476'] show a dip from 1216 (Week 32, 2023) to 1141 (Week 33, 2023), followed by a continuous rise reaching 1476 (Week 36, 2023), the highest in the observed period. This upward trend toward the later weeks indicates increasing ILI activity.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the consistent rise in Weeks 35–36, 2023, mirrors the spike to 2168 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 41, 2023). The observed rise in the latter weeks acts as a prelude to the higher future ILI values.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a steady climb from 1.3% (Week 32, 2023) to 2.0% (Week 36, 2023), with children aged 0–4 years consistently contributing the highest ILI percentages (e.g., 7.2% in Week 35, 2023). This trend reflects growing respiratory illness activity in specific populations, directly correlating with the future ILI surge.
4. Persistent PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) deaths exceeding the epidemic threshold (e.g., 6.1% in Week 32, 2023, rising to 9.6% in Week 35, 2023) align with heightened respiratory illness levels, contributing to the future ILI increase.
5. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including influenza, COVID-19, and RSV, as noted throughout Weeks 32–36, 2023, likely amplified ILI activity and reporting. These overlapping respiratory threats, coupled with shifting healthcare-seeking behaviors due to pandemic dynamics, disrupted traditional surveillance, leading to the substantial rise in future occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI count of 2168 (Week 41, 2023) results from the upward trend evident in Weeks 35–36, 2023, rising ILI outpatient visits, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and compounding impacts of respiratory virus co-circulation and healthcare system shifts.
