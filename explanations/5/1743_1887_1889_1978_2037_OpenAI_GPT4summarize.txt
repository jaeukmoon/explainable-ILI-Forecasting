1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the observed 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent upward trend. Values increased from 1743 (Week 36, 2021) to 2037 (Week 40, 2021). Week 36 to Week 37 showed a modest increase, but from Week 38 to Week 40, there was a notable progressive escalation. This steady incline suggests a gradual rise in reported ILI activity during this interval.  

2. A positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The observed upward trajectory from 1978 (Week 39, 2021) to 2037 (Week 40, 2021) aligns with the subsequent rise to 2297 future occurrences by Week 45, 2021. This pattern indicates that the increasing trend in ILI during the latter part of the 5-week period set the stage for elevated future occurrences.  

3. Several summarized CDC report factors correlate with future ILI occurrences. First, outpatient ILI visits increased slightly but remained below the 2.6% national baseline, with values declining from 2.3% (Week 36) to 1.9% (Week 40), reflecting a rising respiratory illness burden likely linked to non-influenza pathogens.  
   Second, elevated pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) mortality rates, consistently above epidemic thresholds (e.g., 21.0% in Week 36 and 18.0% in Week 40), signal an environment of significant respiratory illness activity, influencing ILI trends.  
   Third, continued reports of healthcare-seeking behavior disruptions caused by the pandemic, particularly in Weeks 37–40, complicated accurate ILI surveillance, potentially amplifying reported cases.  
   Lastly, minimal influenza virus circulation, with positivity rates reported as low as 0.1%, suggests that other respiratory viruses were a dominant contributor to the total ILI-related burden during this period.  

4. In summary, the future occurrence of 2297 (Week 45, 2021) can be attributed to the consistent upward trend in ILI occurrences from Weeks 36 to 40, the positive alignment between late-week increases in past data and future data, high PIC mortality reflecting respiratory illness activity, the influence of non-influenza respiratory viruses, and pandemic-driven disruptions in ILI surveillance and healthcare access.
