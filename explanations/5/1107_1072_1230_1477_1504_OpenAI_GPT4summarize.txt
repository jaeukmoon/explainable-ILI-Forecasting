1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated an overall upward trajectory, transitioning from 1107 in Week 27, 2021, to 1504 in Week 31, 2021. A consistent increase is observed from Week 29, 2021 (1230), through Week 30, 2021 (1477), and Week 31, 2021 (1504). This steady growth in ILI activity suggests a progressive intensification of respiratory illness during this period.  

2. The observed past data trend of rising ILI activity forms a positive correlation with the future ILI occurrences, which reach 1743 by Week 36, 2021. The persistent increases in the latter weeks (Week 30–31, 2021) likely serve as a precursor to the heightened ILI levels seen 5 weeks later, as the upward momentum in activity continued.

3. The summarized reports reveal several contributing factors to the future ILI increase:
   - **Outpatient ILI visits**: The proportion of outpatient visits for ILI consistently rose, from 1.3% in Week 27, 2021, to 2.0% in Week 31, 2021. This steady rise in healthcare encounters for respiratory conditions reflects growing transmission and aligns with the future surge.
   - **Non-influenza respiratory illnesses**: Reports consistently noted that the ILI increases were predominantly driven by other respiratory viruses, such as COVID-19, rather than influenza. Rising activity of these alternate pathogens likely contributed to the future elevation in ILI occurrences.
   - **PIC mortality**: Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, climbing from 6.5% in Week 27, 2021, to 11.9% in Week 31, 2021. This persistent PIC activity signifies elevated respiratory illness burden, which correlates with the ILI rise.
   - **Localized increases in ILI activity**: By Week 31, 2021, regions reported moderate and some high levels of ILI activity, indicating localized intensifications that may have spread nationally over the subsequent weeks.

4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1743 by Week 36, 2021, can be attributed to the sustained upward trend in the past time-series data, increasing outpatient ILI visits, the contribution of non-influenza respiratory illnesses, and persistently high PIC mortality rates. These factors, along with localized surges in ILI activity, collectively explain the amplified respiratory illness burden observed after 5 weeks.
