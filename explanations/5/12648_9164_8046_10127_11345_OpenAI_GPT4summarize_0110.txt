1. The past ILI occurrences over the past five weeks (Week1, 2024 to Week5, 2024) show a fluctuating trend. Week1 reported 12648 cases, followed by a significant decrease in Week2 (9164) and Week3 (8046). However, the trend reversed with steep increases in Week4 (10127) and Week5 (11345). This overall trajectory demonstrates volatility, with a recent increase suggesting a potential resurgence in activity.
2. Based on typical U.S. influenza seasonality, Week10, 2024 falls into the off-season since it occurs after the typical peak period, which ends around Week6. Although activity has slightly elevated trends recently (as evidenced in ILI time series and CDC data), Week10's timing aligns with the transition toward the off-season.
3. The fluctuating yet elevated counts in the past five weeks indicate potential continuity of slightly elevated ILI occurrences into subsequent weeks. Using a time-series forecasting model, we observe reduced ILI counts after Week1 but a rebound starting Week4. This suggests continued moderate levels of occurrences, tapering closer to long-term off-season norms by Week10 (7019 cases projected).
4. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominated nationally (Week1 #1; Week2 #6; Week5 #1), with regional and jurisdictional variations in intensity (Week4 #9; Week5 #2). This subtype's transmissibility partially sustains higher ILI reports despite moderate declines in hospitalizations (Week3, Week4, Week5).
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, persist across all weeks (Week1 #9; Week2 #10; Week3 #10; Week4 #8; Week5 #10), complicating case monitoring and slightly elevating respiratory illness rates.
6. Vaccination continues, and vaccine matches remain effective against circulating strains (Week2 #9; Week3 #9; Week4 #7; Week5 #7). However, uptake has plateaued, with many high-risk individuals unvaccinated, leaving transmission pathways intact.
7. In summary, the projected ILI occurrences of 7019 for Week10, 2024, reflect the waning impact of peak transmission as the season transitions into off-season. The fluctuating past five-week trend, sustained influenza spread by A(H1N1)pdm09, the influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses, and the gradual reduction of overall activity align with this prediction.
