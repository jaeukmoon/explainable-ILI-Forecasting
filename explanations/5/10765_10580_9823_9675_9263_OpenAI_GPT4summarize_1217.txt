1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, from 10765 in Week12, 2023, to 9263 in Week16, 2023. This decrease indicates a downward trend in ILI activity, with reductions occurring sequentially across all weeks, culminating in the lowest value of 9263 in Week16.
2. A strong correlation is observed between the past data and future occurrences, as the continuous decline in ILI values (e.g., 10580 in Week13 to 9263 in Week16, 2023) aligns with the reported drop to 9247 after 5 weeks. The steady reduction reflects a stabilization or plateau in ILI activity, leading to the slight decrease recorded in the future occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently declined, from 2.3% (Week12, 2023) to 1.9% (Week16, 2023), staying below the national baseline of 2.5% each week. This steady reduction reflects diminished healthcare demand for respiratory illnesses, contributing to the low reported future ILI value.
4. Deaths from pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained generally elevated, ranging between 8.3% in Week12 and 7.5% by Week16, 2023, above epidemic thresholds. Though stable, these elevated PIC deaths signal reduced respiratory illness severity by Week16, 2023, consistent with the future ILI value of 9247.
5. Co-circulating viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, played a significant role, as seen in co-infection rates of 3.8% among hospitalized patients in Weeks14–15, 2023. This interaction likely moderated the ILI decline and maintained steady levels, reflecting a convergence of trends leading to the future occurrence of 9247.
6. In summary, the future occurrence of 9247 (Week21, 2023) mirrors the steady decline in ILI trends (Weeks12–16, 2023), reducing outpatient visit percentages, sustained but stable PIC mortality rates, and the impact of co-circulating viral pathogens. These factors indicate a stabilization phase in ILI activity.
