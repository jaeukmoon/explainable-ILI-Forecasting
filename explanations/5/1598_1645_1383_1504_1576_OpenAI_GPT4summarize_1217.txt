1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating but moderately increasing trend, with values of ['1598', '1645', '1383', '1504', '1576']. There was a peak at 1645 in Week 20, 2021, followed by a decline to 1383 in Week 21, 2021, and a subsequent rebound to 1576 by Week 23, 2021. This pattern indicates a gradual recovery in ILI activity after the initial dip.
2. A positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is noted, as the relatively stable recovery trend observed toward Week 23, 2021, matches the projected future increase to 1659 occurrences by Week 28, 2021. The stabilization and slight rise in the last three weeks act as a precursor to continued moderate activity reflected in the future data.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained at low levels during the observation period, ranging from 1.1% (Week 21, 2021) to 1.3% (Week 23, 2021), below the national baseline of 2.6%. However, the slight increase in Week 22 in the 0–4 age group hints at localized developments that may have contributed to the marginal rise in future occurrences.
4. PIC deaths consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, with percentages of 8.3% (Week 21, 2021) and 7.6% (Week 23, 2021), indicating persistent heightened respiratory illness activity. Though primarily attributed to COVID-19, this ongoing elevated PIC mortality aligns with the sustained level of ILI occurrences in future data.
5. COVID-19-related changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors, noted repeatedly in the reports, disrupted surveillance and alternative care data collection. These factors likely masked traditional influenza activity while amplifying reporting of non-specific respiratory illnesses such as ILI, contributing to the stable increase to 1659 future cases.
6. Despite minimal influenza detection across Weeks 19–23, 2021, as reported by labs and surveillance systems, the impact of alternative respiratory illnesses and syndromic surveillance combining ILI and COVID-19 likely explains the observed increase. The compounded effects of disrupted healthcare access and simultaneous respiratory disease surveillance further support this trend.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1659 (Week 28, 2021) are attributable to the moderate upward trend in Weeks 22–23, increasing outpatient visits, sustained PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and the influence of pandemic-driven healthcare disruptions on traditional ILI data collection.
