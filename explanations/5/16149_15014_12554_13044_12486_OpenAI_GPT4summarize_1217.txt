1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a significant decline, followed by a relatively stabilizing trend. Starting at 16149 (Week 1, 2024), the values dropped to 15014 (Week 2, 2024), 12554 (Week 3, 2024), 13044 (Week 4, 2024), and 12486 (Week 5, 2024). The decline in Weeks 1 through 3 signifies reduced ILI activity, while the minor fluctuations in Weeks 4 and 5 indicate stabilization at lower levels. This overall declining trend correlates to reduced influenza activity nationally, as reported during these weeks.
2. A negative correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the downturn in ILI activity during the past 5 weeks aligns with the projected decrease to 9697 (Week 10, 2024). Notably, the significant decrease from Week 1 to Week 5, 2024, acts as a precursor to the lower observed ILI activity after 5 weeks.
3. Several factors in the summarized reports align with the current reduction in ILI occurrences and the subsequent future decrease to 9697:
4. - Outpatient visits for ILI showed consistent declines over the past 5 weeks, from 5.7% (Week 1, 2024) to 4.4% (Week 5, 2024), reflecting reduced respiratory illness activity nationally.
5. - Weekly influenza-related hospitalizations decreased significantly, dropping from 18526 (Week 1, 2024) to 12486 (Week 5, 2024), demonstrating reduced severity and transmission rates of influenza.
6. - The percentage of influenza-attributed deaths also showed a steady decline, from 1.3% (Week 1, 2024) to 0.8% (Week 5, 2024), further corroborating the reduction in severe outcomes related to ILI activity.
7. - Co-circulating viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2, while complicating surveillance, appeared to diminish in detection rates, stabilizing overall respiratory illness patterns by Week 5, 2024.
8. - Influenza testing positivity rates stabilized in the later weeks (16.2% in Week 4 vs. 15.8% in Week 5, 2024), indicating consistency in the declining transmission and ILI impact.
4. Overall, the observed future decrease to 9697 (Week 10, 2024) can be attributed to the substantial decline in ILI occurrences during Weeks 1–5, 2024, reduced outpatient visits for ILI, decreasing hospitalizations and mortality rates, and the stabilized activity levels of influenza and other respiratory viruses during this period. This confluence of factors strongly aligns with the downward trajectory observed in the current and future ILI trends.
