1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 42–46, 2023) showed notable fluctuations but an overall upward trajectory, with values of ['1447', '1396', '1702', '1472', '1860']. After a slight decline from 1447 (Week 42, 2023) to 1396 (Week 43, 2023), there was a significant surge to 1702 (Week 44, 2023). This was followed by a dip to 1472 (Week 45, 2023) and then a sharp increase to 1860 by Week 46, 2023, the highest point observed in the 5-week dataset, reflecting increasing respiratory illness activity during this period.
2. A strong positive correlation between past and future ILI activity is evident, as the upward trend in Weeks 44 and 46, 2023, aligns with the observed rise to 4023 occurrences (Week 51, 2023). The substantial increase in Week 46 signals an intensifying respiratory illness trend, setting the stage for the marked growth in ILI activity 5 weeks later.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed consistent and notable increases over the weeks, rising from 2.5% (Week 42, 2023) to 3.7% (Week 46, 2023). This trend exceeded the national baseline of 2.9% starting from Week 45, 2023, signaling heightened clinical encounters due to respiratory illnesses, which directly contributed to the subsequent spike in ILI cases. Rising influenza positivity rates, from 1.7% (Week 42, 2023) to 4.9% (Week 46, 2023), also indicate growing viral circulation that fueled the increase in ILI occurrences. Furthermore, cumulative hospitalization rates significantly increased, from 0.5 per 100,000 (Week 42, 2023) to 2.6 per 100,000 (Week 46, 2023), with strong hospitalization trends among seniors (65+), reflecting widespread and severe illness patterns consistent with future ILI peaks. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, such as RSV and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), alongside increasing influenza activity, compounded respiratory illness trends, amplifying ILI incidence toward Week 51, 2023.
4. In summary, the increase to 4023 future ILI occurrences (Week 51, 2023) is explained by the observed upward trend in ILI activity in Weeks 44–46, 2023, steadily rising outpatient visits exceeding the baseline, significant increases in hospitalization rates highlighting the severity of cases, higher influenza positivity rates, and the co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens, collectively driving the amplified surge in ILI cases.
