1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, with values ['1659', '1859', '2036', '2285', '2456']. Weekly increases were observed, starting from 1659 in Week 28, 2021, and ending at 2456 in Week 32, 2021. This steady rise indicates accelerating respiratory illness activity over the observed period.

2. The positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the continued week-to-week increases in the past data point to a higher likelihood of ILI escalation. The 2456 ILI occurrences from Week 32, 2021, serve as a foundational base for the leap to 3091 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks in Week 37, 2021, reflecting a continuation of this growth trend.

3. Several other factors in the CDC reports support this increase:
   - Outpatient ILI visits consistently rose over the 5 weeks, from 1.3% (Week 28, 2021) to 2.1% (Week 32, 2021), with notable increases among age groups under 50. This rise in health-seeking behavior for ILI suggests growing respiratory illness transmission.
   - PIC deaths (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) steadily increased, from 7.1% in Week 28, 2021, to 14.6% in Week 32, 2021, far exceeding epidemic thresholds. Although primarily driven by COVID-19, this elevated mortality reflects heightened respiratory illness burden.
   - Healthcare disruptions linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as alternative care settings, influenced reporting and surveillance, potentially contributing to higher ILI activity being recorded.

4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 3091 (Week 37, 2021) are explained by the upward trajectory in past occurrences over Weeks 28–32, 2021, rising outpatient ILI visit percentages, persistently high PIC-related mortality, and pandemic-driven surveillance challenges. These factors collectively highlight an ongoing intensification of respiratory illness dynamics, culminating in the observed future increase.
