1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent downward trend, decreasing from 12688 in Week 21, 2024, to 9807 in Week 25, 2024. Each week displayed a steady decline—12688 to 11996 in Week 22, 11996 to 11270 in Week 23, 11270 to 10231 in Week 24, and finally 10231 to 9807 in Week 25. This continuous reduction suggests diminishing ILI activity over the observed period.
2. A clear negative correlation is observed between the past and the future ILI occurrences, as the consistent decline across Weeks 21–25, 2024, does not extend to the future data, where ILI occurrences rise substantially to 7285 after 5 weeks. The abrupt shift may indicate external or unaccounted factors influencing the increase.
3. Among the CDC reports, the consistent decline in outpatient ILI-related visits (from 1.9% in Week 21, 2024, to 1.5% in Week 25, 2024) correlates with the declining ILI trend, implying reduced healthcare-seeking for ILI symptoms. Similarly, stable hospitalization rates (0.2 and 0.1 per 100,000 population across Weeks 21–25, 2024) support decreased severe ILI cases. Finally, co-circulation and variability of respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 complicate the interpretation of ILI data, possibly influencing future peaks despite initially low levels.
4. While influenza activity remained low during Weeks 21–25, 2024, the slight positivity increase for Influenza A strains (e.g., A(H3N2) subtype) and antigenic similarity to vaccine strains suggest potential shifts may amplify future ILI trends.
5. The future ILI occurrences of 7285 after 5 weeks are likely attributable to co-circulating respiratory pathogens influencing ILI data beyond influenza alone. This divergence between past trends and future data implies multifactorial contributors, including community-level fluctuations in virus transmission and reporting delays.
