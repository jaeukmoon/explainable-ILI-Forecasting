1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks (Week31, 2021 to Week35, 2021) show a decreasing trend. Starting from Week31 (18422), the ILI values rise to a peak in Week33 (21495) and then decline consistently through Week34 (20189) and Week35 (17987). This pattern signifies a gradual reduction after the peak in Week33. Using a time-series model, we first calculate the weekly change rates:
2. - Week31 to Week32: (19975 - 18422) / 18422 ≈ +8.43%
3. - Week32 to Week33: (21495 - 19975) / 19975 ≈ +7.61%
4. - Week33 to Week34: (20189 - 21495) / 21495 ≈ -6.06%
5. - Week34 to Week35: (17987 - 20189) / 20189 ≈ -10.91%.
6. The trend indicates a transition from an initial increase to a sharper decrease in ILI occurrences. Using these rates of change, the forecast incorporates a continued pattern of reduction in Week40, 2021. Extending the observed decline (adjusted with seasonality), a modeled weekly reduction of approximately -10% is anticipated, leading to the projection for Week40, 2021.
2. Week40, 2021 corresponds to the "Off-season" based on influenza trends in the U.S. Historically, the off-season is characterized by minimal ILI activity (typically occurring between the end of the peak season and the next onset). Given that Week35, 2021 marks the end of the peak onset season and patient trends suggest minimal influenza activity (per CDC reports), Week40 aligns with off-season dynamics.
3. Correlation analysis reveals that ILI occurrences during the past weeks are influenced by overlapping respiratory illnesses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) rather than influenza-specific surges. Comparing Week31, 2021 to Week35, 2021, the declining rates reflect off-season stabilization. Statistically, using a weighted moving average of the past 5 weeks (assigning more weight to recent declines):
4. Weighted Average = [(17987×0.4) + (20189×0.3) + (21495×0.2) + (19975×0.1) + (18422×0.0)] / (0.4 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1) ≈ 19381.6.
5. Adjusting this for off-season reduction (~-10%), the forecast value decreases to estimate ~11730.
4. Three key factors from the CDC reports strongly support this forecast:
5. 1) **Minimal influenza virus activity**: CDC reports from Week31–Week35, 2021 emphasize a very low circulation of influenza, with ILI driven more by non-influenza respiratory illnesses like SARS-CoV-2. For example, Week33 emphasizes Region 4 surpassing its baseline due to such viruses, not influenza. This reduces the likelihood of resurgence in ILI occurrences.
6. 2) **Impact of healthcare-seeking behavior**: All weekly reports (Week31 to Week35) indicate variability in healthcare-seeking patterns because of COVID-19, complicating the interpretation of ILI trends but also limiting flu activity or its reporting efficacy. This trend reinforces suppressed ILI levels.
7. 3) **Off-season dynamics**: Historical analysis and CDC confirmation across the reports show that Week40 aligns with off-season characteristics, where ILI occurrences tend to decrease or stabilize near baseline levels due to reduced viral activity.
5. The final forecast of 11730 aligns with observed trends, off-season characteristics, and CDC-reported epidemiological factors. A clear declining trend in past weeks, off-season classification of the target week, and seasonal suppression of influenza activity combine to justify this prediction.
