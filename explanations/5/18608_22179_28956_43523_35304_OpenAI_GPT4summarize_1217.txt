1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend, peaking significantly in Week51, 2021, at 43523 before subsequently declining to 35304 in Week52, 2021, a notable drop from the highest values. The data begins with 18608 in Week49, 2021, increases to 22179 in Week50, 2021, and then escalates dramatically to 28956, 43523, and then receding to 35304 in Week52, 2021. This trend reflects an overall rise in ILI activity followed by a slight decline at the end of the observed period.
2. A clear positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the significant surge culminating in 43523 (Week51, 2021) and the relatively high levels in Week52, 2021, align with the reported drop to 9072 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week6, 2022). The steep decline from Week52, 2021, to Week6, 2022, underscores how initial sharp peaks in ILI activity often precede subsequent reductions in future periods.
3. Outpatient respiratory illness visits exhibited a consistent upward trend, surpassing baseline values and reaching 4.8% in Week52, 2021, which explains the elevated ILI activity during the observed period. However, the decline in positivity rates for influenza tests to 2.2% in Week1, 2022, foreshadows the observed drop in future ILI occurrences. High cumulative hospitalization rates (3.4 per 100,000 by Week1, 2022) further indicate peak burden during the 5-week window, followed by a subsequent decrease.
4. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and the predominance of A(H3N2) influenza (accounting for nearly all Influenza A cases) amplified ILI activity in Weeks49-52, 2021, as detailed in the CDC reports. However, lower flu vaccination uptake compared to prior seasons and antigenic differences in circulating H3N2 strains likely contributed to fluctuating and regionally varied ILI occurrences, eventually leading to a significant drop after 5 weeks.
5. In summary, the sharp decline to 9072 future occurrences (Week6, 2022) can be attributed to the fluctuating 5-week ILI trend, peaking in Week51, 2021, followed by a gradual reduction in positivity rates and influenza test detections. Increased outpatient visits, high hospitalization rates, regional viral co-circulation, and lower vaccination uptake correlated with the heightened initial activity. These eventual declines in positivity and activity explain the reported decrease to 9072 occurrences at the future time point.
