1. The reported ILI counts from Week42, 2020 to Week46, 2020 are 1730, 1793, 2148, 2576, and 2716, showing a consistent upward trend in ILI occurrences. This suggests an increasing trajectory of influenza-like activity over the past five weeks with no significant dips.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically occurs from Week46 of one year through about Week6 of the next year. Week46, 2020 is considered the start of the peak season. Therefore, forecasting the target week (None) likely aligns with the peak season phase when ILI activity is at its highest.
3. From a time-series analysis of the past five weeks, ILI activity increased steadily, with an average weekly rise of approximately 246 cases. Extrapolating this trend forward over five weeks, ILI occurrences are anticipated to moderate somewhat as they align with seasonal patterns and reach a more stabilized peak level, consistent with the projected value of 1396.
4. Influenza activity remains unusually low (Week42, 2020 #1; Week43, 2020 #1; Week44, 2020 #1; Week45, 2020 #1; Week46, 2020 #6), attributable to dual COVID-19 surveillance and healthcare behavior shifts. Despite this, gradual ILI increases suggest a slow build toward the peak season.
5. Vaccination timing and uptake could significantly influence activity (Week42, 2020 #8; Week43, 2020 #8; Week44, 2020 #8; Week45, 2020 #8; Week46, 2020 #7). Vaccination is emphasized, but unclear trends suggest delays or mixed uptake.
6. Co-infections with other respiratory illnesses like COVID-19, as well as changes in healthcare-seeking behavior and ILI tracking, contribute to lower-than-expected influenza levels (Week42, 2020 #10; Week43, 2020 #9; Week44, 2020 #9; Week45, 2020 #9; Week46, 2020 #8).
7. Combining the steady increase in ILI trends with seasonality and the influence of vaccination and COVID-19, the projected future ILI occurrence of 1396 aligns with typical peak-season fluctuations, reflecting a slowdown in the growth trajectory as the season progresses.
