1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but generally declining trend, with the values ['1587', '1425', '1405', '1350', '1421']. This period began with a high of 1587 (Week24, 2024), followed by a steady decline reaching 1350 (Week27, 2024) before a slight rebound to 1421 (Week28, 2024). Overall, the trend reflects a net decrease in ILI activity across the past period despite minor fluctuations.
2. A positive correlation is apparent between the past and future ILI occurrences as the slight uptick in Week28, 2024 (1421 occurrences), marks a possible turning point indicating stabilization or early resurgence of ILI activity. The recurrence to 1562 after 5 weeks (Week33, 2024) aligns with this emerging rebound in the final observed week, signaling a continuation or amplification of the slight upward shift.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently below the national baseline, measured at 1.6% (Week24, 2024) and decreasing to 1.4% (Week28, 2024). The cumulative stabilization of outpatient visit percentages during low influenza activity suggests ongoing respiratory concerns, likely contributing to the slight future increase in ILI occurrences.
4. Minimal but persistent detection of influenza positivity in clinical labs, from 1.4% (Week24, 2024) down to 0.8% (Week28, 2024), indicates continued low transmission of influenza. However, the co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 contributed to the sustained baseline ILI activity, aligning with the rise to 1562 occurrences in Week33, 2024.
5. Sporadic reporting of novel Influenza strains (e.g., A(H5N1) human infections in Colorado, Week26, 2024) and limited antiviral resistance emphasize low yet consistent risks of influenza transmission. Prolonged broad surveillance efforts and the ongoing interaction between influenza and other circulating respiratory viruses further explain the resurgence to 1562 after 5 weeks.
6. In summary, the reported 1562 ILI occurrences (Week33, 2024) were influenced by a fluctuating yet declining recent trend, a slight recovery in Week28, stable outpatient activity percentages, continuous influenza positivity, and co-circulation of multiple viral agents within the respiratory illness ecosystem, collectively driving the observed increase.
