1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a steady upward trend, with values of ['1470', '1756', '2311', '2712', '2740']. This represents a significant and consistent rise, from 1470 in Week3, 2024, to 2740 by Week7, 2024, marking an escalation in ILI activity over the observed period. The increase rate slowed slightly in Week7, 2024, indicating a potential peak.
2. A strong positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The sharp rise across Weeks3–7, 2024, progressing to 2740 in Week7, sets the stage for a moderate decline to 1909 in Week12, 2024. This is consistent with historical cyclical patterns observed in ILI data, where surges are typically followed by gradual declines.
3. Several factors from the summarized CDC reports correlate with the future ILI occurrences:
4. - Elevated outpatient visits for ILI, persistently above the baseline, reaching a peak of 4.5% in Week7, 2024, suggest continued widespread illness, though the pace of rise decelerates toward Week7.
5. - The cumulative hospitalization rate climbed significantly to 58.2 per 100,000 by Week7, 2024, the highest among adults aged 65+, indicating severe illness, which would drive continued elevated occurrences even after peaking.
6. - Influenza positivity rates showed high but gradually declining percentages (e.g., 15.8% in Week5, 2024, to 14.8% in Week7, 2024), signaling a tapering of flu season, further reducing occurrences in future weeks.
7. - Influenza-related mortality trends, including pediatric deaths and overall flu-associated deaths (0.8% of all deaths in Week7, 2024), reflect high severity, but declining rates bolster the case for a future slowdown in transmission or progression.
4. High levels of respiratory co-infections (e.g., COVID-19 and RSV), along with ongoing increases in influenza B activity in some regions (e.g., Regions 5, 7), contributors to sustained illness trends, suggest both flu-specific and non-flu respiratory illnesses are influencing the ILI data heading into Week12, 2024.
5. In summary, the reported 1909 future ILI occurrences (Week12, 2024) are attributable to the strong upward trend seen through Week7, 2024, key indicators such as elevated hospitalization rates and ILI outpatient visits, as well as declining positivity rates and mortality trends suggesting a seasonal peak had passed. Co-circulating respiratory pathogens and regional influenza B increases also likely contributed to maintaining elevated occurrences despite the overall reduction from the peak.   ​
