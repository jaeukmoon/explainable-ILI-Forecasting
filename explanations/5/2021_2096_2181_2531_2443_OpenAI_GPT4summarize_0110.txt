1. The ILI occurrences from Week13 to Week17, 2022 are 2021, 2096, 2181, 2531, and 2443. The trend shows a clear increase from Week13 (2021) to Week16 (2531), followed by a slight decline in Week17 (2443). This pattern indicates a predominantly upward trajectory with a moderate decline by Week17, suggesting the peak may be subsiding.
2. Week22, 2022 falls in the off-season as it occurs well after the secondary peak season indicator of Week19, 2022. The declining ILI levels in Week17, 2022, and the overall stabilization of activity foretell reduced transmission, characteristic of the off-season period.
3. Time-series analysis suggests that while ILI numbers rose consistently through Week16, the slight decline in Week17 indicates tapering activity. Projecting this tapering forward aligns with the forecast of reduced ILI counts (1695) by Week22, 2022, consistent with an off-season prediction.
4. The regional increases in influenza activity observed from Week13 to Week17, 2022 (e.g., central, south-central, and mountain regions) showed localized intensifications but did not sustain sharp nationwide increases (Week13 #1; Week14 #1; Week15 #1).
5. Vaccination coverage continued with recommendations, although some antigenic mismatches, particularly for A(H3N2), may have limited effectiveness (Week13 #9; Week14 #8; Week15 #10). This contributes to modestly reduced transmission as the season progresses into off-season levels.
6. Co-circulation of influenza and other respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 introduced moderate variability in outpatient respiratory visits (Week13 #13; Week14 #13; Week15 #12; Week16 #11; Week17 #9). However, influenza's contribution remained below baseline and less significant for driving severe spikes.
7. Considering the upward trend tapering by Week17, 2022, the transition into an off-season period, reduced contributions from co-circulating viruses, stable hospitalization rates, and vaccination efforts, a decline in ILI occurrences to 1695 by Week22, 2022 is plausible.
