1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the prior 5 weeks exhibited a clear successive decline, starting from 1284 (Week2, 2021) to 1170 (Week3, 2021), 1117 (Week4, 2021), 1093 (Week5, 2021), and further dropping to 990 (Week6, 2021). This steady downward trend indicates consistently decreasing ILI activity during this period.
2. A correlation between the past and future data suggests stabilization of ILI occurrences, as the decline from 1284 to 990 across 5 weeks shows slowing rates of reduction, culminating in a future modest rebound to 1099 (Week11, 2021). This stabilization aligns with the expectation of cyclical flu trends and healthcare adjustments influencing ILI patterns.
3. Consistently below-baseline outpatient ILI visits, recorded at 1.4% (Week2, 2021) and tapering to 1.1% (Week4, Week5, and Week6, 2021), reflect suppressed respiratory illness activity. Yet the observed stagnation at 1.1% for consecutive weeks signals potential stabilization, prefiguring the eventual rise to 1099 occurrences after 5 weeks.
4. The ongoing elevated percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), recorded at 14.7% (Week2, 2021) and oscillating between 22.3% and 28.4% (Week6, 2021), surpass the epidemic threshold and highlight systemic respiratory illness complexities, indirectly contributing to future ILI activity.
5. Disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic persist, impacting healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance accuracy across all summarized weeks. This misrepresentation and delayed recognition of ILI contribute to reporting inconsistencies, setting the stage for the measured uptick to 1099 occurrences in Week11, 2021.
6. Despite record-low influenza positivity rates across clinical and public health labs (e.g., 0.1% in Week6, 2021) and minimal hospitalization rates, the steady presence of Influenza B dominance (e.g., 85.7% in clinical labs by Week6, 2021) combined with pandemic-induced healthcare behaviors signals sustained non-influenza-related ILI cases, shaping the observed future outcomes.
7. To summarize, the future ILI occurrences of 1099 (Week11, 2021) can be explained by the slowing downward trend in past data, stabilization of below-baseline outpatient activity, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, pandemic-induced healthcare-seeking disruptions, and non-influenza factors that tempered reductions in ILI reporting.
