1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week24 to Week28, 2021, are 1807, 1791, 1794, 2193, and 2546. Initially, the trend was stable but minimal (Week24–Week26), with only minor variability. However, a notable increase is observed starting Week27 (2193) and continues into Week28 (2546), indicating a growing trajectory as the period progresses.
2. Week33, 2021, falls within the peak onset season. According to typical influenza seasonality in the U.S., this period marks the initial phase where ILI activity begins climbing from the off-season baseline toward higher levels of activity (Week24–Week28, 2021 #10; Background Knowledge #4). The increase in ILI visits and steady rise in weekly counts further align with this classification.
3. The time-series analysis shows ILI occurrences stabilizing at minimal levels during Week24–Week26, 2021, followed by sustained and significant increases in Week27 (2193) and Week28 (2546). When extrapolated forward, this upward trajectory indicates the potential for continued growth as the system enters the peak onset season. Hence, projecting the time-series trend anticipates ILI occurrences further rising to 3400 by Week33, 2021.
4. Multiple factors from the CDC reports support this projection:
5. - ILI activity levels, which began minimal, show slight increases in outpatient visits across multiple age groups starting Week27, 2021 (Week27, 2021 #3; Week28, 2021 #3), suggesting growing community circulation.
6. - COVID-19 dynamics and healthcare-seeking behaviors continue to influence respiratory illness patterns, confounding surveillance data (Week24, 2021 #8; Week26, 2021 #6; Week28, 2021 #6).
7. - Despite low influenza positivity rates in virologic testing, the gradual increases in ILI reflect broader syndromic trends not solely linked to influenza (Week25, 2021 #9; Week27, 2021 #9; Week28, 2021 #10).
5. The increase in ILI occurrences correlates with the early rise typically observed during the transition to the peak onset season. While absolute positivity rates for influenza remain low, syndromic surveillance indicates broader respiratory illness dynamics elevating ILI counts over time.
6. The co-circulation of COVID-19 has shifted patient healthcare-seeking behavior and complicated traditional flu activity assessments. Although influenza activity is low, associated ILI patterns may still reflect broader pandemic disruptions, leading to surging counts as baseline healthcare-seeking resumes (Week27, 2021 #10; Week28, 2021 #10).
7. In summary, the estimated ILI occurrence of 3400 by Week33, 2021, is justified by a combination of the observed upward trends in ILI from Week24–Week28, 2021, the timing of the peak onset season, increasing outpatient visit rates, confounding COVID-19 healthcare trends, and the anticipation of continued growth into the early flu activity window. This aligns with historical patterns and the forecasting model's trajectory.
