1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a declining trend, with values of ['14594', '14942', '14370', '13379', '13307']. Week11, 2023 (14594) showed a small spike in Week12, 2023 (14942), but this was followed by consistent declines in subsequent weeks, reaching the lowest value of 13307 by Week15, 2023. The downward trajectory indicates a reduction in reported ILI activity across these weeks.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 12523 aligns with the downward trend noted in the past time-series data. The persistent reductions observed through Week15, 2023, from 14594 to 13307 serve as a basis for the continued decline in ILI reports by Week20, 2023, culminating in the lower value of 12523.
3. Clinical lab positivity for influenza showed limited activity, fluctuating between 0.8% (Week11, 2023) and 1.0% (Week14–15, 2023), with no significant increases; this stable low positivity correlates with the reduced ILI reports observed after 5 weeks. The proportion of PIC mortality rates remained slightly above epidemic thresholds, decreasing from 8.7% (Week11, 2023) to 7.5% (Week15, 2023), reflecting a reducing burden of respiratory illness. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness also declined from 2.4% (Week11, 2023) to 2.0% (Week15, 2023), underpinning the reduction in overall ILI activity.
4. Antiviral efficacy remained strong, and influenza vaccination efforts maintained high antigenic match rates across all circulating strains as reported consistently throughout Weeks11–15, 2023. These factors likely facilitated containment of illness spread and helped sustain the observed decline in ILI activities.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 12523 (Week20, 2023) can be explained by the consistent downward trend in past ILI reports during Weeks11–15, 2023, low and stable influenza positivity rates, reduced PIC mortality rates, decreased outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses, and the effective mitigation efforts from vaccinations and antiviral treatment.
