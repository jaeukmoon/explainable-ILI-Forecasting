1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a steady upward trend: ['1958', '2088', '2154', '2399', '2830'], with ILI occurrences increasing weekly. This rise began at 1958 (Week42, 2020) and peaked at 2830 (Week46, 2020), reflecting a consistent escalation in influenza-like illness activity throughout the observed period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observable, as the consistent upward trend in the final weeks of the past data, such as Weeks45 and 46, 2020, suggests the trajectory continued into the subsequent weeks, culminating in the reported future ILI occurrences of 2776 after 5 weeks (Week51, 2020).
3. Outpatient visits for ILI exhibited a gradual and steady increase: rising from 1.2% (Week42, 2020) to 1.5% (Weeks45 and 46, 2020), which, while still below the national baseline, indicated an upward trend in respiratory illness-related healthcare-seeking activity, contributing to amplified future ILI numbers. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds and sharply rose from 7.6% (Week42, 2020) to 10.7% (Week46, 2020), signaling sustained respiratory illness activity. Increased influenza positivity rates in public health lab reports (e.g., 0.1% to 0.2% during Week44–46, 2020) indicate a slow but emerging circulation of influenza viruses that overlaps with increasing ILI occurrences. Pandemic-induced changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors likely heightened the concentration of reported ILI activity, as highlighted in multiple weeks, further contributing to the observed increase five weeks later.
4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2776 (Week51, 2020) can be attributed to the steady escalation in past ILI occurrences, increases in ILI outpatient visits, persistently high PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, gradually rising detection of influenza viruses, and the compounding effects of healthcare disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
