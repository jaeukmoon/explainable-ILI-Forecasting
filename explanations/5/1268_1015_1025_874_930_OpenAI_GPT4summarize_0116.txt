1. The ILI occurrences from Week26, 2024 to Week30, 2024 show a clear decreasing trend with values of [1268, 1015, 1025, 874, 930]. The initial sharp decline from Week26 (1268) to Week27 (1015) is followed by slight stabilization between Week27 (1015) and Week28 (1025), before continuing to decrease in Week29 (874) and Week30 (930). This steady decrease suggests that ILI activity is moving toward a baseline level characteristic of the off-season.
2. Week35, 2024 falls within the "Peak onset season," as it lies between Week32 and Week46. This period typically marks a gradual increase in influenza activity as ILI occurrences start to rise from the off-season baseline toward the peak season. However, trends leading into Week35 from the off-season are usually muted, and significant increases are uncommon early in this phase.
3. To project future ILI activity, the average rate of decline over the 5 weeks (from Week26 to Week30) is calculated. The percent change between each week is:
4. - Week26 to Week27: ((1015 - 1268)/1268) * 100 = -19.96%
5. - Week27 to Week28: ((1025 - 1015)/1015) * 100 = +0.99%
6. - Week28 to Week29: ((874 - 1025)/1025) * 100 = -14.73%
7. - Week29 to Week30: ((930 - 874)/874) * 100 = +6.41%
8. The average weekly percent change is (-19.96% + 0.99% - 14.73% + 6.41%)/4 = -6.82%. Applying this average decline to the most recent value (Week30: 930), we get a projection for Week35 as 930 * (1 - 0.0682)^5 ≈ 797. This calculation accounts for a consistent but moderate decline toward baseline levels, even while entering the peak onset season.
4. The following factors from CDC reports strongly influence the forecast:
5. 1) Low influenza activity in the past 5 weeks, with minimal positivity rates (e.g., 1.0% in Week26 decreasing to 0.7% in Week30), supports reduced ILI occurrences. This suggests that flu transmission remains suppressed despite co-circulation of other respiratory viruses. Quantitatively, low baseline activity reduces the probability of a sudden increase in ILI occurrences, stabilizing the decline to Week35.
6. 2) Minimal hospitalization rates (0.1 per 100,000 throughout Weeks26-30) and consistently low outpatient respiratory illness visits (1.4-1.5%, below the national baseline) indicate reduced healthcare utilization due to influenza. These metrics are indicative of stable or declining ILI trends heading into Week35.
7. 3) High antigenic similarity between circulating strains (Influenza A [H3N2, H1N1pdm09] and Influenza B [Victoria lineage]) and vaccine reference strains reduces the risk of sudden outbreaks or surges. This containment effect keeps ILI trends consistent with historical seasonal declines during the off-season.
5. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrences of 797 for Week35, 2024 can be attributed to the observed decreasing trend in the preceding weeks, the classification of Week35 within the "Peak onset season," and three supporting CDC-reported factors: low influenza positivity and hospitalization rates, low outpatient visits, and effective vaccine matching to circulating strains. These factors collectively indicate a continued decline in ILI occurrences, albeit at a slower rate, before a potential increase later in the peak onset season.
