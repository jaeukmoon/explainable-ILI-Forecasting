1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a steady and pronounced upward trend, with values increasing from 18374 (Week 41, 2023) to 19370 (Week 42, 2023), further climbing to 21978 (Week 43, 2023), 23656 (Week 44, 2023), and peaking at 28832 (Week 45, 2023). This consistent growth indicates a significant escalation in ILI activity by the end of the observed period, suggesting increasing respiratory illness prevalence.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 41554 reflect a strong continuation of the upward trajectory established in Weeks 41–45, 2023, particularly the sharp increase observed in Weeks 44 and 45. The rapid rise from 23656 in Week 44 to 28832 in Week 45 demonstrated accelerated growth, correlating with the reported future spike in occurrences after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a similar rising pattern, increasing from 2.3% (Week 41, 2023) to 2.5% (Week 42, 2023), 2.7% (Week 43, 2023), 2.9% (Week 44, 2023), and surpassing the national baseline to reach 3.5% in Week 45, 2023. This progressive increase in ILI healthcare visits supports the observed future surge, reflecting heightened respiratory illness activity.
4. Hospitalization rates for influenza also steadily climbed, from 0.3 per 100,000 (Week 41) to 0.5 (Week 42), 0.8 (Week 43), 1.2 (Week 44), and 1.7 (Week 45), with the highest rates observed among seniors (65+). This pattern aligns with the growing burden of severe cases, exacerbating ILI activity and future occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, in combination with the broad regional increases in influenza positivity rates (e.g., 4.0% in Week 45, 2023), contributed to a higher cumulative respiratory disease burden. Specific regions (e.g., South Central, Southeast) exhibited particularly high activity, further fueling the future spike to 41554 ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 41554 future ILI occurrences (Week 50, 2023) can be attributed to the strong upward trend in Weeks 41–45, 2023, rising outpatient ILI visits and hospitalization rates, and the compounding impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses and regional influenza increases.
