1. The ILI occurrences from Week3 to Week7, 2022 show a clear decline from 18,431 (Week3) to 13,413 (Week4), 10,333 (Week5), 9,072 (Week6), with stabilization at 9,072 in Week7. This indicates a steady downward trend transitioning to a stabilized plateau in recent weeks, with no recent spikes or fluctuations.
2. Week12, 2022 aligns with the off-season period, characterized by minimal ILI activity following the end of peak seasons observed in prior weeks. This fits the broader trend of declining influenza positivity rates, outpatient visits below the baseline, and sporadic flu reports nationally (Week4, 2022 #1; Week5, 2022 #1; Week6, 2022 #3; Week7, 2022 #4).
3. The ILI time-series data suggests a predictable stabilization after the earlier decline. Projecting the trend forward five weeks (from Week7 to Week12, 2022) supports a level baseline close to current occurrences, slightly decreasing or stabilizing at 9,475 occurrences based on historical data patterns and seasonality.
4. National influenza positivity remains low, sporadic, and decreasing in outpatient respiratory illness visits (Week4, 2022 #3; Week5, 2022 #3; Week7, 2022 #3).
5. Vaccination rates this season are below prior seasons, potentially reducing population-level immunity and contributing to a longer baseline persistence of ILI activity, despite being in the off-season (Week3, 2022 #5; Week4, 2022 #6; Week7, 2022 #8).
6. Multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, SARS-CoV-2) are co-circulating with localized variability in their contributions to ILI trends, ensuring prolonged but low-level activity across regions (Week3, 2022 #9; Week5, 2022 #9; Week6, 2022 #9).
7. Considering the seasonality (off-season), recent stabilization of ILI occurrences, low but persistent ILI activity due to co-circulating viruses, and reduced vaccination rates, the projected ILI count of 9,475 for Week12, 2022 is consistent with these influencing factors.
