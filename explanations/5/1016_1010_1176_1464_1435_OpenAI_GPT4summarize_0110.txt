1. The reported ILI counts from Week11 to Week15, 2021 are 1016, 1010, 1176, 1464, and 1435. The data shows an initial consistent low trend from Week11 to Week12, followed by a notable increase from Week13 to Week14 (1176 to 1464). However, this rise moderates slightly as the count decreases to 1435 by Week15. Overall, this pattern suggests a slight upward trajectory with increasing stability toward a plateau.
2. Week20, 2021 falls within the off-season as it occurs well beyond the peak season (which typically ends by Week6 each year). The consistently low influenza activity reported in Weeks11–15, 2021, combined with minimal positivity rates and stable ILI percentages, supports this classification.
3. From a time-series model perspective, the gradual increase in ILI counts from Week12 to Week14 followed by maintained counts at Week15 implies stabilized activity rather than a sharp escalation. Extrapolation of such a stabilized upward pattern suggests that occurrences by Week20, 2021 will modestly increase, leading to the forecasted value of 1856.
4. Nationwide influenza positivity rates remain fixed at 0.1% across Weeks11–15, 2021 (Week11, 2021 #1; Week12, 2021 #1; Week13, 2021 #1; Week14, 2021 #1; Week15, 2021 #1), indicating persistently low influenza prevalence with no significant outbreak signals observed.
5. Vaccination trends continue to emphasize prevention with no recent updates reported (Week11, 2021 #10; Week12, 2021 #9; Week13, 2021 #7; Week14, 2021 #10; Week15, 2021 #10). The protective effect of vaccines, coupled with the limited circulation of novel variants, reduces the risk of a significant ILI surge.
6. Healthcare-seeking behaviors altered by the COVID-19 pandemic (Week11, 2021 #9; Week12, 2021 #10; Week13, 2021 #8; Week14, 2021 #6; Week15, 2021 #8) and overlapping symptoms continue to impact ILI data interpretations but do not point to any emerging spikes in influenza activity.
7. Given the moderately rising but low-level ILI trends, the off-season timing (Week20, 2021), and the stable virology, hospitalization, and vaccination dynamics, the forecasted ILI occurrences for Week20, 2021 align with the anticipated value of 1856.
