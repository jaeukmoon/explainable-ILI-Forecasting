1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but clear upward trend, starting at 1933 (Week 21, 2021) and progressively increasing to 2350 (Week 25, 2021). After a slight dip from 1933 (Week 21) to 1867 (Week 22), the occurrences rose steadily through Weeks 23–25. This overall upward trend reflects a gradual escalation in ILI activity during the observed period.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the increasing trajectory in Weeks 24–25, 2021, with values reaching 2350, aligns with the reported rise to 3478 future occurrences (Week 30, 2021). The upward slope toward Week 25, 2021, likely acts as a precursor to the significant future growth in ILI activity after 5 weeks.

3. The weekly outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) were consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%, maintaining values from 1.1% (Week 21, 2021) to 1.2% (Weeks 22–25, 2021). However, localized upticks in ILI visits, particularly for children aged 0–4 years (e.g., Week 22 and Week 24), suggest pockets of increased activity fueling the future upsurge.  
   Elevated percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) also persisted, ranging from 8.3% (Week 21) to 6.6% (Week 25), consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds. This reflects ongoing respiratory illness activity, potentially contributing to the future spike.
   Pandemic-induced disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors and alternative care reporting further impacted ILI surveillance. Such disruptions may have delayed recognition or concentrated reporting, contributing to the jump in occurrences by Week 30, 2021.

4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 3478 (Week 30, 2021) can be attributed to the observed upward trend in Weeks 24–25, 2021, localized increases in ILI-related visits, persistent PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, and disruptions to healthcare-seeking and surveillance systems. These factors collectively align with the observed surge after 5 weeks.
