1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks (Week31, 2021 to Week35, 2021) are ['1201', '1413', '1326', '1347', '1395']. This data shows an overall increasing trend, with an initial rise from Week31 to Week32 (1201 to 1413), followed by slight declines in Week33 (1326) and Week34 (1347). However, there is a small uptick in Week35 to 1395. Despite small week-to-week fluctuations, the underlying trend suggests a gradual increase in ILI occurrences, consistent with the transition toward higher seasonal activity. Quantitatively, the rate of change from Week31 to Week35 reveals approximately a 16% rise in ILI occurrences over 5 weeks, implying a gradual upward trajectory rather than sharp spikes or drastic fluctuations.
2. Season Classification for Week40, 2021: Week40, 2021 falls within the "Peak onset season" as per Background Knowledge (Week32 to Week46 constitutes the Peak onset period). This aligns with the seasonal progression when ILI activity typically begins to increase toward peak levels. Activity is expected to rise gradually without yet reaching the sharp intensities seen during the peak season.
3. Correlation analysis of past trends with future ILI occurrences indicates that the activity observed in Week31 to Week35 is characteristic of the Peak onset season, where ILI activity gradually increases. Using a time-series-based simple weighted average prediction model, the past 5 weeks' occurrences are averaged, but a downward correction is applied due to the presence of stabilizing factors mentioned in the CDC reports. The arithmetic mean of the values ['1201', '1413', '1326', '1347', '1395'] is:
4. Mean = (1201 + 1413 + 1326 + 1347 + 1395) / 5 = 1343.
5. However, the CDC reports emphasize that increases in ILI are largely attributed to non-influenza respiratory illnesses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2), minimal influenza circulation, and healthcare-seeking behavior changes (e.g., Week31, Week33, Week35). Considering these factors, a ~7% downward adjustment (to account for stabilization caused by these variables) leads to a final smoothed forecast of approximately 1250 ILI occurrences.
4. Three distinct factors from the summarized CDC reports influencing this forecast include:
5. a. ILI increases attributed to non-influenza respiratory illnesses: Across Weeks 31–35, CDC reports repeatedly emphasize that ILI increases are primarily linked to non-influenza causes, like COVID-19, rather than influenza strains (e.g., Weeks 31, 33). This restricts the upward trajectory of ILI occurrences, capping the maximum expected level despite increases in respiratory illness transmission. Quantitatively, this limits the prediction to 1250 instead of the raw average (1343).
6. b. Minimal influenza virus circulation: Clinical and virologic surveillance from Weeks 31–35 reports extremely low influenza activity (e.g., Week34 mentions a positivity rate of just 0.1%). This trend further suppresses ILI activity, resulting in stabilizing trends and preventing any significant spikes. This supports the adjusted estimate by preventing high variability that might push values beyond 1250.
7. c. Seasonal effects in the Peak onset season: Week40, 2021 occurs during the Peak onset season, where ILI activity is expected to rise steadily but not yet reach the sharp, widespread increases of the peak season. This explains the gradual rise from Week31 to Week35 and the moderate forecast of 1250, reflecting seasonal dynamics without overstating potential increases.
5. In summary, the predicted occurrence of 1250 for Week40, 2021 is justified by:
6. a. A gradually increasing trend in past ILI occurrences over the last 5 weeks, consistent with the seasonal progression of the Peak onset season.
7. b. Minimal influenza circulation and attributions of ILI increases to non-influenza respiratory illnesses, alongside altered healthcare-seeking behaviors, stabilizing the forecasted value to 1250 (below the raw average of 1343).
8. c. The seasonal context of the Peak onset season supporting a steady rise in ILI activity, further informed by historical time-series trends and adjustments for non-influenza influences.
