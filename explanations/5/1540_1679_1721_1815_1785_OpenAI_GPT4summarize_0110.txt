1. The reported ILI counts from Week38 to Week42, 2021 are 1540, 1679, 1721, 1815, and 1785. Over these five weeks, there was a consistent increase from Week38 (1540) through Week41 (1815), followed by a slight decline in Week42 (1785). This pattern reflects an upward trend with minor fluctuations, likely indicative of the gradual shift toward higher ILI activity.
2. Week47, 2021 occurs within the typical peak season, which spans from about Week46 of one year to Week6 of the next. Given the historical behavior of influenza activity peaking during this period and the steady increase in ILI occurrences from Week38 to Week41, Week47, 2021 is most consistent with the peak season.
3. From the time-series perspective, ILI occurrences show a gradual but clear increasing trend over the past five weeks (Week38–Week41) before slightly stabilizing in Week42. Projecting this trend forward, with some allowance for seasonal acceleration typical of peak periods, points toward moderate growth. This supports the forecasted ILI occurrences of 1855 for Week47, 2021.
4. Influenza virus circulation remains low but steadily increasing, as seen in reports of rising positive cases in public health labs for Influenza A and Influenza B (Week40, 2021 #2, #3; Week41, 2021 #2, #3; Week42, 2021 #2, #3). This demonstrates an uptick in flu-specific activity contributing to higher ILI counts.
5. Outpatient ILI visits remain below baseline but are either stable or slightly increasing over recent weeks (Week38, 2021 #1, #5; Week39, 2021 #1, #6; Week40, 2021 #4; Week41, 2021 #4; Week42, 2021 #4). This trend exhibits a slow buildup toward peak season occurrences.
6. Despite vaccination recommendations, detailed data on uptake remain unavailable (Week38, 2021 #6; Week39, 2021 #8; Week40, 2021 #8; Week41, 2021 #8; Week42, 2021 #8). Limited vaccination data may contribute to increased ILI incidences during higher activity periods.
7. Considering the observed upward trend in ILI counts, the classification of Week47, 2021 as part of the peak season, and the interplay of rising influenza activity with limited vaccination uptake, it supports the projected value of 1855 ILI occurrences. Seasonal amplification of ILI activity as the peak season progresses further strengthens this estimate.
