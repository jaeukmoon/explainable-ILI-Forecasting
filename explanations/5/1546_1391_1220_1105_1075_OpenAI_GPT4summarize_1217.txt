1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1546', '1391', '1220', '1105', '1075']. This decline started from Week 24, 2023 (1546), and continued steadily each week up to Week 28, 2023 (1075), reflecting diminishing ILI activity as the season progressed. The consistent decrease suggests reduced influenza circulation and related illnesses over the observed period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is prominent, as the continuously declining figures in the past 5 weeks (Weeks 24–28, 2023) precede the lower ILI occurrence value of 1141 observed after 5 weeks in Week 33, 2023. The leveling of the decline in ILI data by Week 28, 2023, hints at stabilization near Week 33.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI persisted below the national baseline of 2.6%, standing at 1.5% (Week 24, 2023), gradually decreasing to 1.2% (Week 28, 2023). Younger age groups, particularly children aged 0-4 years, consistently exhibited the highest percentages (e.g., 5.2% in Week 24, 2023, to 4.0% in Week 28, 2023), indicating age-stratified fluctuations contributing to overall ILI trends.
4. Hospitalizations for influenza fluctuated, starting from 779 (Week 24, 2023) and stabilizing by Week 28, 2023, with 689 hospitalizations reported. These stabilization patterns, coupled with similar PIC mortality trends hovering near epidemic thresholds (e.g., 6.1% Week 24 and 5.8% Week 28), reflect a moderating respiratory illness burden leading to the future 1141 value.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, persist as complicating factors, as reported consistently across Weeks 24–28, 2023. The interplay of these viruses alongside low influenza positivity rates, such as 1.1% (Week 24, 2023) to 0.9% (Week 28, 2023), contributed to sustained general illness activity without significant flu resurgence, aligning with the observed stabilization of ILI figures to 1141 in Week 33, 2023.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence of 1141 in Week 33, 2023, can be attributed to the systematic decline in past ILI occurrences, decreasing outpatient ILI visit trends, marginal yet consistent respiratory illness hospitalization and mortality activity, and the impact of co-circulating non-influenza respiratory viruses maintaining moderate illness incidences despite minimal flu activity.
