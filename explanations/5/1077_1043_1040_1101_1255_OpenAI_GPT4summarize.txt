1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but overall upward trend, with values of ['1077', '1043', '1040', '1101', '1255']. There was a slight decline from 1077 (Week 31, 2021) to 1040 (Week 33, 2021), followed by an evident rise in the last two weeks, reaching 1255 (Week 35, 2021), the highest value within the observed period. This pattern indicates growing ILI activity toward the end of the 5 weeks.  

2. Correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the increase observed in Weeks 34 and 35, 2021, correlates with the sustained elevated value of 1124 after 5 weeks (Week 40, 2021). The sharp rise during Week 35 serves as a precursor to maintaining higher ILI levels during the future period.

3. Over the summarized CDC reports, key contributing factors to the future ILI occurrences include:  
   - Persistent increases in ILI outpatient visits across multiple age groups (noted in Weeks 31–34), with peaks in younger populations (ages 0-4, 5-24) as well as other groups (25–49, Week 31), reflecting widespread respiratory illness activity beyond influenza.  
   - High PIC-related mortality rates, consistently above epidemic thresholds (e.g., 11.9% in Week 31 to 19.4% in Week 34), primarily driven by COVID-19, indicating heightened respiratory illness pressures.  
   - Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the pandemic affected ILI surveillance across Weeks 31–35, suggesting underreported occurrences initially, followed by concentrated reporting, contributing to elevated future ILI levels.  

4. In summary, the reported 1124 future ILI occurrences (Week 40, 2021) are explained by the upward trend in Weeks 34 and 35, 2021, growing ILI outpatient trends in specific age groups, sustained high PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and disruptions in reporting accuracy caused by pandemic-driven changes in healthcare access and behaviors.
