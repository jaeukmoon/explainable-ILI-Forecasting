1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 40–44, 2020) demonstrated a fluctuating but overall increasing trend, with values of ['1610', '1911', '1730', '1793', '2148']. Starting at 1610 in Week 40, 2020, ILI occurrences peaked at 2148 in Week 44, 2020, the highest in this period. This progression shows a growing activity level over time, which likely set the stage for higher future ILI occurrences.  

2. A positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences can be observed. The increasing trajectory in the latter weeks of the past data (particularly Weeks 43 and 44, 2020) corresponds with the moderately elevated future ILI value of 1734, reported 5 weeks later (Week 49, 2020). This alignment underscores the role of the late-period increase as a precursor to future ILI activity.  

3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently moved upward, starting at 1.1% of visits (Week 40, 2020) and increasing steadily to 1.3% (Week 44, 2020). This gradual rise in patient interactions for respiratory illnesses suggests growing community transmission, potentially impacting the future ILI cases observed after 5 weeks.  

4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) were consistently elevated during Weeks 40–44, 2020, surpassing epidemic thresholds. Starting at 7.0% (Week 40, 2020) and rising to 8.1% (Week 44, 2020), this pattern reflects heightened respiratory illness activity, which is aligned with the subsequent ILI activity measured after 5 weeks.  

5. Shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic were repeatedly emphasized in reports as altering traditional ILI surveillance and potentially delaying or inflating reporting of ILI cases. This systemic disruption likely contributed to the observed future frequency of ILI occurrences, exaggerating increases in future data.  

6. Although influenza virus positivity rates and public health lab detections remained notably low (e.g., 0.21% in Week 40, 2020, and 0.1% in Week 44, 2020), the rise in non-specific ILI occurrences suggests contributions from COVID-19-related disruptions and other respiratory illnesses. These factors likely added to the apparent growth in ILI activity, supporting the future value of 1734 occurrences.  

7. In summary, the reported future ILI value of 1734 (Week 49, 2020) is likely driven by the rising trend seen in Weeks 43–44, 2020, the uptick in ILI-related outpatient visits, persistent excess PIC mortality, pandemic-related healthcare-seeking and reporting changes, and contributions from non-specific respiratory illnesses amid low influenza activity.
