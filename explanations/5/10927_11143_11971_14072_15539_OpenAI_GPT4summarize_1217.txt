1. The past time-series ILI occurrences displayed an overall upward trend over the 5 observed weeks, with values of ['10927', '11143', '11971', '14072', '15539']. Starting at 10927 in Week 31, 2024, there was a steady increase each week, peaking at 15539 in Week 35, 2024. This consistent rise highlights a growing ILI activity during this period.
2. The strong positive correlation between the increasing trend in past ILI occurrences and the reported future value of 13736 (Week 40, 2024) can be observed. The growth seen from Week 31 to Week 35, 2024, provides a key indicator for the eventual deceleration yet elevated level of ILI occurrences reflected in Week 40, 2024.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI saw slight increases, from 1.5% in Week 31, 2024, to 1.8% in Weeks 34 and 35, 2024. This consistent yet modest growth aligns with the observed gradual rise in the ILI time-series data, anticipating the elevated ILI occurrences in Week 40, 2024.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (influenza, SARS-CoV-2, RSV), noted in summaries for all 5 weeks, emphasizes the interplay of factors influencing ILI trends. These overlapping viral activities would contribute to the reported future ILI total.
5. Persistently low antiviral resistance and antigenically similar vaccine strains reported across Weeks 31–35, 2024, indirectly hint at the influence of other respiratory pathogens or delayed prevention and control measures, contributing to sustained ILI activity reaching 13736 in Week 40, 2024.
6. In summary, the reported 13736 future ILI occurrences in Week 40, 2024, can be attributed to the sustained upward trend in Week 31–35, outpatient visit increases, concurrent respiratory virus activity, and minimal antiviral resistance. Despite the modest rise, the overall trajectory supports the elevated future value.
