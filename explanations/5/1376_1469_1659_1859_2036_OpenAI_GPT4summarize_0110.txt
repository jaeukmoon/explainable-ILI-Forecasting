1. The reported ILI counts from Week26 to Week30, 2021 are 1376, 1469, 1659, 1859, and 2036. Over this five-week period, the trend consistently increases each week, showing a steady growth in ILI occurrences without any dips or fluctuations. This indicates a clear upward trajectory in ILI cases, suggesting escalating activity.
2. Forecasting Week35, 2021 aligns with the peak onset season. Historically, the peak onset season in the U.S. typically begins around Week32 through Week46 each year. The steady increase in ILI occurrences from Week26 to Week30, 2021, accompanied by growing outpatient ILI visits, supports the conclusion that Week35, 2021 is within this phase of rising activity as it transitions toward the peak season.
3. The consistent upward trend in the past five weeks suggests a time-series correlation with continued increases over the next few weeks. Projecting this forward, ILI activity appears to escalate further, leading to 2964 estimated occurrences in Week35, 2021.
4. Several CDC factors support this prediction: rising outpatient respiratory illness visits over the past three weeks (Week29, 2021 #2; Week30, 2021 #1, #7); the minimal, yet growing prevalence of ILI across jurisdictions, with some regions even showing low to moderate activity (Week29, 2021 #8; Week30, 2021 #6); and potential impact from non-influenza respiratory pathogens such as COVID-19 contributing to the increase (Week30, 2021 #7, #8).
5. CDC reports indicate shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors and alternative care environments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, likely contributing to higher capture of outpatient ILI cases (Week26, 2021 #6; Week28, 2021 #6; Week30, 2021 #8), which may amplify reporting trends over time.
6. The ongoing dominance of strains like Influenza B (Victoria lineage) suggests the spread of recognizable subtypes that could gradually rise in transmission, even during off-peak periods (Week27, 2021 #2; Week28, 2021 #2).
7. In summary, the predicted value of 2964 ILI occurrences for Week35, 2021 is supported by the steady upward trend of ILI cases, the seasonal timing of the peak onset season, the rise in outpatient respiratory visits, and the evolving impact of shifts in healthcare-seeking patterns amid concurrent viral activity.
