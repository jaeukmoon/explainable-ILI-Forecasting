1. The reported ILI counts from Week27 to Week31, 2021 are 1075, 1331, 1372, 1609, and 1910. The data reveals a steady upward trend over the five weeks, with a significant increase starting from Week30 (1609) and continuing into Week31 (1910). The pattern indicates a consistent rise in occurrences, implying an escalation in respiratory illness activity.
2. Week36, 2021 occurs during the transition period leading toward the early stages of the Peak onset season. This aligns with the observed increases in ILI activity and growing outpatient visits over recent weeks. Consequently, Week36, 2021 is forecasted to belong to the Peak onset season.
3. The time-series trend indicates sustained growth in ILI occurrences, reflecting an increasing trajectory over the last five weeks. Extrapolating this forward to Week36, 2021, the continuation of this upward pattern suggests an estimation of 1976 ILI occurrences, consistent with the gradual rise in activity.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI have shown progressive increases over Week27 to Week31, rising from 1.3% to 2.0%, still below the 2.6% national baseline (Week27, 2021 #3, Week28, 2021 #3, Week29, 2021 #1, Week30, 2021 #1, Week31, 2021 #2), with all age groups contributing. These increments correlate with growing ILI trends.
5. Virologic data consistently report minimal influenza circulation, with most recent ILI increases driven by other respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (Week27, 2021 #10; Week30, 2021 #7; Week31, 2021 #7). While there is no substantial evidence of a flu outbreak, co-circulating pathogens may amplify overall ILI counts.
6. PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) deaths have risen weekly, from 6.5% in Week27, 2021 to 11.9% in Week31, 2021 (Week27, 2021 #5; Week28, 2021 #4; Week29, 2021 #5; Week30, 2021 #4; Week31, 2021 #6). This increasing burden, primarily due to COVID-19, underscores heightened respiratory transmission contributing to rising ILI activity.
7. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrence of 1976 for Week36, 2021 is driven by the clear upward trajectory in ILI trends, increasing outpatient visits, elevated PIC burden, and regional respiratory virus activity. Combined with the timing of the Peak onset season and ongoing co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, this value reflects the sustained growth observed in recent weeks.
