1. The reported ILI counts from Week24 to Week28, 2022 are 1399, 1543, 1196, 1122, and 898. The trend depicts a decrease in ILI occurrences, moving from 1399 in Week24, 2022 to 898 in Week28, 2022. This decline is consistent, showing no significant spikes or fluctuations, indicating a steady reduction in ILI activity across the observed weeks.
2. Forecasting that Week33, 2022 belongs to the off-season aligns with the ongoing low influenza positivity rates and the characteristic minimal activity levels observed during this period (Week24, 2022 #5; Week25, 2022 #8; Week28, 2022 #7).
3. Correlation analysis shows a consistent decline in ILI counts over Weeks24 to Week28, 2022. Based on historical patterns, this downward trajectory suggests a future projection of reduced ILI activity. However, considering moderate co-circulation of other respiratory viruses (Week28, 2022 #8) and potential behavioral changes affecting healthcare visits, a baseline fluctuation can still occur. Thus, projecting an ILI count of 661 for Week33, 2022 reflects a continuation of the declining trend.
4. Influenza activity has been progressively declining nationwide (Week28, 2022 #1), with influenza positivity rates falling below 1.0% in clinical labs (Week27, 2022 #1; Week28, 2022 #1), indicating minimal circulation.
5. The co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV remains a confounding factor, creating uncertainty in the pure influenza-associated trends (Week28, 2022 #8). This may moderate the expected drop in ILI reports beyond baseline levels.
6. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the pandemic have further reduced outpatient respiratory illness visits, adding to the observed decline in ILI activity (Week28, 2022 #10).
7. The continuous decline in ILI occurrences, falling percentages of positive influenza specimens, and the off-season classification collectively justify the projected 661 ILI reports for Week33, 2022. The influence of co-circulating pathogens and pandemic-modified healthcare trends may cause slight deviations but do not indicate a resurgence or significant spike in ILI activity.
