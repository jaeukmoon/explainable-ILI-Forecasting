1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values of ['1454', '1284', '1170', '1117', '1093']. There was a steady reduction from 1454 (Week 1, 2021) to 1093 (Week 5, 2021), indicating a downward trend in reported ILI activity during this period. This consistent decrease reflects suppressed influenza transmission and low ILI activity.
2. The correlation between the decline in past ILI occurrences and the reported future occurrence of 949 is evident. The continuing downward trend in Weeks 1 to 5, 2021, aligns with the lower reported future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks. The trend suggests a continuation of suppressed ILI activity, though influenced by ongoing external factors.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily decreased from 1.7% in Week 1, 2021, to 1.1% by Week 5, 2021, remaining well below the national baseline of 2.6%. This reduction in ILI-related healthcare encounters highlights reduced illness activity, consistent with the downward adjustment to 949 future occurrences.
4. Elevated percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained significant, with levels ranging from 17.2% in Week 1, 2021, to a peak of 28.4% in Week 4, 2021, and then slightly decreasing to 25.0% in Week 5, 2021. These PIC-driven dynamics, primarily influenced by COVID-19, indicate a shift in respiratory illness patterns, potentially limiting influenza-specific cases and contributing to the reduced future ILI occurrence.
5. Healthcare-seeking behaviors related to ILI and influenza increased ambiguity in data interpretation across all weeks. These behaviors were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as per the reports. This shift likely contributed to the overall suppression of ILI reporting and activity, drawing the future ILI occurrences to 949.
6. The exceptionally low percentage of influenza-positive respiratory specimens (ranging from 0.1% to 0.4% throughout Weeks 1–5, 2021) alongside low hospitalization rates for laboratory-confirmed influenza indicate subdued influenza activity. This absence of clear flu signals strongly correlates with the reduced future ILI occurrences observed.
7. In summary, the reported 949 future ILI occurrences (Week 10, 2021) can be attributed to the consistent downward trend in ILI occurrences during Weeks 1–5, 2021, declining outpatient ILI visits, sustained PIC mortality driven by COVID-19, pandemic-induced disruptions in healthcare behaviors, and persistently low influenza positivity and hospitalization rates.
