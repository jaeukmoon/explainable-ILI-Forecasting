1. The ILI occurrences from Week52, 2021 to Week4, 2022 show a consistent significant decline: Week52, 2021 (16964), Week1, 2022 (12746), Week2, 2022 (8319), Week3, 2022 (5335), and Week4, 2022 (3606). This trend represents a sharp and steady decrease in cases over five weeks, with no indications of resurgence or stabilization by Week4, 2022.
2. Week9, 2022 belongs to the off-season. The peak season typically spans from Week46 through about Week6, and the described declining activity and sporadic influenza circulation by Week4, 2022 align with the post-peak off-season classification.
3. The declining trend over the past five weeks strongly correlates with an expected continuation of low ILI occurrences through Week9, 2022. Time-series forecasting would project a further decline or stabilization at minimal levels given no evidence of renewed activity by Week4, 2022.
4. Lower vaccination coverage compared to the previous season may slightly hinder population immunity, but declining influenza activity suggests limited impact by Week9, 2022 (Week52, 2021 #6; Week1, 2022 #8; Week4, 2022 #6).
5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, complicates disease dynamics and healthcare-seeking behaviors (Week52, 2021 #8, #10; Week3, 2022 #10; Week4, 2022 #11). However, the primary burden appears to shift away from influenza-related cases towards COVID-19.
6. Influenza A(H3N2), which predominates, shows some antigenic differences from vaccine strains (Week52, 2021 #7; Week1, 2022 #9; Week3, 2022 #10), but declining positivity rates (Week3, 2022 #1; Week4, 2022 #1) indicate its diminishing activity in five weeks.
7. In summary, the steady decline in ILI trends, off-season timing, reduced influenza-based outpatient visits and hospitalizations, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and low positivity rates all point to subdued influenza activity in Week9, 2022. Consequently, the model predicts 2576 ILI occurrences for that week.
