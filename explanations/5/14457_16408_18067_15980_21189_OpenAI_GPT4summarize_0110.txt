1. The reported ILI counts for Week44 to Week48, 2023 are 14457, 16408, 18067, 15980, and 21189. This shows an overall increasing trend within the 5-week period, with a notable spike in Week48 (21189), following a slight dip in Week47 (15980). The sharp increase in Week48 signals heightened flu activity and the likelihood of continued ILI growth.
2. Given that Week1, 2024 falls within the typical peak season (Week46 through Week6 in the U.S.), and with reported high flu activity and increasing trends in Week48, 2023, Week1, 2024 is forecasted to belong to the peak season.
3. From the time-series perspective, the upward trend observed from Week44 to Week48, 2023, especially the significant jump in Week48, suggests increasing ILI occurrences. Projecting this forward, the five-week lag aligns with historical patterns of flu spread during peak season, anticipating continued escalations. This pattern supports the target ILI occurrence of 24647 for Week1, 2024.
4. Heightened influenza activity is observed nationally, with positive clinical influenza specimens increasing from 3.0% in Week44 to 6.8% in Week48, and the percentage exceeding baseline flu levels (Week44, 2023 #1; Week48, 2023 #1, #3). High virologic positivity indicates sustained community transmission, pushing ILI numbers higher.
5. The cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rate increased from 1.2 per 100,000 in Week44 to 5.5 per 100,000 in Week48, with significant strain on adults aged 65+ showing the highest hospitalization rates (Week44, 2023 #3; Week48, 2023 #4). This surge in severe cases reflects broader community spread and supports heightened ILI occurrences.
6. Seasonal impact alongside co-circulating respiratory infections such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 contributes to elevated respiratory illness. Regions with high virologic positivity for both influenza A and B further compound overall illness rates (Week44, 2023 #10; Week47, 2023 #9; Week48, 2023 #10).
7. The forecasted ILI occurrences of 24647 for Week1, 2024 stem from a combination of increasing national flu activity, the peak-season classification, and amplified positivity rates and hospitalizations. Concurrent circulation of multiple respiratory viruses magnifies public health impacts, justifying the expected sharp rise. This projection aligns accurately with historical trends and current epidemiological conditions.
