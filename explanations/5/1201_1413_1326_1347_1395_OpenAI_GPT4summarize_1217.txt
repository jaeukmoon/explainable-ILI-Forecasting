1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but overall steady trend, with values of ['1201', '1413', '1326', '1347', '1395']. The period began with a moderate count of 1201 (Week 31, 2021), followed by a marked increase to 1413 (Week 32, 2021). A slight decline to 1326 (Week 33, 2021) was observed, but the subsequent weeks showed an upward movement to 1347 (Week 34, 2021) and 1395 (Week 35, 2021). This pattern highlights stable but increasing ILI occurrences by the end of the 5-week observation.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the sustained rise toward the latter weeks (Weeks 34–35, 2021) aligns with the reported future value of 1250 by Week 40, 2021. The consistent upward trend provides a foundation for the observed future ILI occurrences, reflecting continuous respiratory illness activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased consistently over the 5-week period: from 2.0% (Week 31, 2021) to 2.1% (Week 32, 2021), and 2.2% (Weeks 33–34, 2021), dropping to 0.9% (Week 35, 2021). Although there was a dip in Week 35, the higher ILI rates in preceding weeks indicate a prolonged period of elevated respiratory illness activity influencing future occurrences.
4. PIC (pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19) deaths fluctuated at high levels, with notable rises from 11.9% (Week 31, 2021) to 19.4% (Week 34, 2021), before slightly falling to 5.4% (Week 35, 2021). These percentages consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, reflecting significant respiratory illness burdens correlating with elevated ILI activity in future weeks.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted ILI surveillance accuracy across all weeks, as documented in all CDC reports. These disruptions likely led to underreported or delayed ILI cases in observed data, with such delayed patterns surfacing as the reported rise to 1250 occurrences in Week 40, 2021.
6. Minimal influenza virus activity, as highlighted in all 5 weeks (e.g., influenza positivity rates of 0.1% in Week 34, 2021), suggests that most of the observed ILI activity was due to non-influenza respiratory viruses. Novel variants or overlapping respiratory trends could have contributed to the continuous rise in illness activity by Week 40.
7. In summary, the reported 1250 future ILI occurrences (Week 40, 2021) can be attributed to the steady upward trend over Weeks 31–35, 2021, compounded by increasing outpatient ILI visits, elevated PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, healthcare-seeking behavior disruptions, and overlapping activity from non-influenza respiratory viruses that maintained respiratory illness burdens.
