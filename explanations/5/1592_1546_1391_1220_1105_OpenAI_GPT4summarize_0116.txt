1. Explanation:
1. The past ILI occurrences in Region 0 for Week23, 2023 to Week27, 2023 are 1592, 1546, 1391, 1220, and 1105. These values exhibit a clear decreasing trend, indicating a steady decline in ILI activity over these weeks. The percentage changes week-to-week are as follows: -2.89% (from 1592 to 1546), -10.04% (from 1546 to 1391), -12.30% (from 1391 to 1220), and -9.43% (from 1220 to 1105). The average weekly decrease across these weeks is approximately 8.67%. If this trend were to persist linearly, the predicted value for Week32, 2023 would decline modestly from the Week27 value while accounting for seasonal adjustments.
2. Week32, 2023 is classified as part of the "Peak onset season" based on the U.S. flu season framework. Historically, the peak onset season spans Weeks 32 to 46 each year and is characterized by the gradual increase in ILI activity from baseline levels. While the previous weeks (Week23–Week27) align with off-season characteristics, the shift to Week32 marks the beginning of a seasonal transitional period, likely resulting in stabilized activity or minor increases compared to the off-season trend.
3. The correlation analysis reveals that during prior off-season periods, ILI rates decline but stabilize as the transition into the peak onset season approaches. The previous downward trend in ILI occurrences from Week23 to Week27, 2023 suggests that Week32, 2023 will mark a departure from steep declines due to seasonal effects. Using the time-series progression, we apply the average percentage change (-8.67%) to extrapolate a baseline decrease for the next 5 weeks. However, since Week32 marks the onset of the peak onset season, adjustments are made to reflect the usual stabilization or minor rebound. Projecting forward, a moderate increase of approximately +10% (reflecting transitional seasonal dynamics and historical correlation trends) is added from Week27’s value (1105), resulting in a forecasted ILI occurrence of 1216 for Week32, 2023.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports significantly influence the prediction:
5. 1. Influenza activity remains low nationally (Week27), with positivity rates further dropping to 0.8% and minimal jurisdictional fluctuations. These minimal ongoing flu activity rates combined with the underlying transition into the peak onset season suggest stabilization of ILI occurrences beginning Week32, 2023. This reflects a partial rebound (+10%) of ILI activity in our forecast.
6. 2. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (reported consistently through Week23 to Week27), continue to complicate ILI-related surveillance data. While these viruses contribute to outpatient illness rates, they create the potential for slightly elevated ILI rates persisting into the peak onset season, warranting an upward adjustment toward 1216.
7. 3. The lack of significant changes in influenza vaccination uptake (Week23–Week27) suggests that vaccination-driven reductions in flu activity are not significantly affecting ILI occurrences. Combined with low detected influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and B (Victoria lineage) positivity rates, it supports our assumption of stabilized future activity aligned with seasonal trends.
5. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrences for Week32, 2023 in Region 0 are 1216. This forecast is based on the observed downward trend in ILI activity (-8.67% average weekly decrease), adjusted for a +10% stabilization reflective of the peak onset season starting in Week32, the consistent influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses, and influenza activity trends reported in recent CDC data. These combined factors support a modest deviation from a continuous decline, leading to the projected value of 1216.
