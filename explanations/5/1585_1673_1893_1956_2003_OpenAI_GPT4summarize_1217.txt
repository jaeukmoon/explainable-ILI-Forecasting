1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks consistently increased, with values of ['1585', '1673', '1893', '1956', '2003']. This indicates a steady and uninterrupted upward trend from Week10, 2021 (1585) to Week14, 2021 (2003), suggesting escalating respiratory illness activity during this period.
2. A positive correlation is evident between the rising trend in past ILI occurrences (Week10–Week14, 2021) and the increase to 2012 reported future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks. The persistence of growth approaching Week14, 2021, appears to directly precede and align with the marginal rise to 2012, pointing to sustained activity from prior weeks as a driver for future occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable but below baseline, fluctuating between 0.9% (Week10, 2021) and 1.1% (Week14, 2021). Although minimal, this gradual upward inclination in ILI-related healthcare visits reflects increases in respiratory illness presentation, influencing the slight future rise. Public health reports also indicated the potential for increased flu activity influenced by pandemic variables.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded the epidemic threshold consistently, with rates of 13.3% (Week10, 2021), 12.1% (Week11, 2021), 11.4% (Week12 and Week13, 2021), and 11.2% (Week14, 2021). This persistently high PIC mortality highlights elevated respiratory illness burden, aligning with a continued rise in ILI occurrences.
5. Modifications in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as consistently noted, introduced disruptions to ILI data interpretation. Reduced reliability of traditional surveillance and overlapping respiratory symptoms likely postponed recognition of cases and focused future reporting trends, influencing the rise to 2012 occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 2012 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks stem from the steady upward trend in past ILI data (Week10–Week14, 2021), gradual increases in outpatient ILI visits, persistently elevated PIC mortality signaling continued illness burden, and pandemic-induced disruptions in ILI surveillance and reporting dynamics.
