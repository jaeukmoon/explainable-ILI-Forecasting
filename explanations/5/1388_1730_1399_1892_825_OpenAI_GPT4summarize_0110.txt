1. Past ILI occurrences from Week2 to Week6, 2021 show significant fluctuations: Week2 (1388), Week3 (1730), Week4 (1399), Week5 (1892), and Week6 (825). Although the values exhibit an irregular, unstable pattern with no clear trend, the sharp dip in Week6 (825) contrasts starkly with the prior high in Week5 (1892). This instability may complicate future projections.
2. The target Week11, 2021 belongs to the off-season. The peak season typically ends around Week6; data from Week2 to Week6, 2021 confirms exceptionally low influenza activity (Week6, 2021 #1), which aligns with off-season characteristics.
3. Correlation analysis based on the past trends suggests an observed irregular pattern with no consistent increases or decreases. The sudden drop in Week6 (825 ILI occurrences) seems to coincide with low influenza positivity rates nationally (Week6, 2021 #1), suggesting a stabilization toward off-season levels. Projecting this forward five weeks, ILI occurrences are predicted to stabilize near 1016 as activity levels taper off further.
4. Influenza activity is historically low across Weeks2-6, 2021, with outpatient ILI visits significantly below the baseline of 2.6% (Week2, 2021 #4; Week3, 2021 #4; Week4, 2021 #3; Week5, 2021 #4; Week6, 2021 #4). Such reduced activity strongly suggests a continuation of below-average ILI levels.
5. The COVID-19 pandemic impacts healthcare behaviors and ILI surveillance, altering traditional data interpretation (Week2, 2021 #9; Week4, 2021 #8; Week6, 2021 #9). These disruptions likely suppress the usual reporting of ILI trends, preventing potential surges or accurate baseline predictions.
6. Influenza B dominates over Influenza A in clinical lab detections across Weeks4-6 (Week4, 2021 #7; Week5, 2021 #2; Week6, 2021 #2), yet overall influenza positivity remains minimal (Week2, 2021 #1; Week3, 2021 #1; Week4, 2021 #1; Week5, 2021 #1; Week6, 2021 #1), contributing to continued low ILI levels.
7. In summary, despite fluctuating past ILI counts, the target Week11, 2021 aligns with the off-season marked by low flu activity. Continued minimal influenza positivity, suppressed healthcare-seeking behaviors due to COVID-19, and dominant Influenza B occurrences, collectively point to a stabilization of ILI counts around 1016 in the projection.
