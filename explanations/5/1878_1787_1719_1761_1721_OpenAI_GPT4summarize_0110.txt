1. The reported ILI counts from Week26 to Week30, 2023 are 1878, 1787, 1719, 1761, and 1721. The trend observed during this period shows a gradual decrease in ILI occurrences from Week26 (1878) to Week30 (1721), with a slight uptick in Week29 (1761). Overall, this represents a declining trend with low-level fluctuations, consistent with minimal influenza activity.
2. Based on historical season classifications, Week35, 2023 falls into the peak onset season, which typically starts from Week32 through Week46. Although Week30, 2023 indicates minimal activity, the transition into Week35 aligns with a period of increasing influenza transmission, albeit at early levels.
3. From a time-series perspective, the gradual reduction in ILI counts combined with the observed stability suggests a dampening effect but with potential for upward deviation as the peak onset season begins. The model projects a marked increase in ILI cases as flu activity starts climbing toward baseline levels for this season. This upward trajectory aligns with the jump in occurrences, forecasting 3153 after five weeks.
4. Co-circulating respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV continue to contribute to outpatient visits for ILI (Week26-Week30, 2023 #9, #8, #10), resulting in sustained respiratory illness activity that, alongside influenza, can push ILI trends upward.
5. Minimal vaccination trends were reported from Week26 to Week30, 2023 (Week26-Week30, 2023 #10, #9), limiting community immunity and enhancing susceptibility as flu activity progresses into the peak onset season.
6. The emergence of novel Influenza A strains (H3v and H1N2v) reported in Week30, 2023 (Week30, 2023 #4) introduces variability in transmission potential, even though sustained human-to-human transmission was not detected. Such novel variants can elevate influenza occurrence if not contained.
7. Given the declining yet fluctuating trends in ILI activity, the shift to the peak onset season (Week35, 2023), potential impacts of co-circulating viruses, limited vaccination uptake, and the possibility of variant transmission, the forecasted ILI occurrence after five weeks (Week35, 2023) is justified at 3153.
