1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a steady decline followed by stabilization, with the values ['1830', '1689', '1481', '1519', '1517'] from Week5 to Week9, 2021. The decreasing trend between Week5, 2021 (1830) and Week7, 2021 (1481) highlights reduced ILI activity. However, a slight increase and stabilization in Week8 and Week9, 2021 (1519 and 1517) suggest an early indicator of plateauing or potential rebound.
2. Although the past ILI occurrences show a downward trend from Week5 to Week7, 2021, and stabilization in Week8 and Week9, the future occurrences of 2003 imply a delayed rise in ILI activity. This delayed increase aligns with the stabilization observed in the past weeks. Pandemic-related disruptions and altered healthcare-seeking behaviors may have obscured early signs of resurgence, contributing to the higher future value.
3. Minimal flu positivity rates of 0.1% reported consistently across all weeks indicate that influenza cases alone do not explain the rise to 2003 ILI occurrences. However, increasing trends of ILI among children aged 0–4 years identified in Weeks8 and Week9, 2021, could signal age-specific drivers of higher future activity.
4. Elevated PIC mortality throughout the reporting period, especially due to COVID-19, with Week9 at 14.6% (well above the epidemic threshold of 7.2%), points to overlapping respiratory illness burdens potentially contributing to higher ILI reporting.
5. Disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI surveillance, as emphasized by the CDC in all summarized reports, likely delayed and concentrated ILI detections. This may explain the unexpected rise to 2003 occurrences, as delayed reporting and care-seeking behaviors tend to create lagged spikes in observed activity.
6. In summary, the reported 2003 future ILI occurrences (Week14, 2021) can be attributed to the initial stabilization of past trends in Weeks8 and Week9, 2021, increasing ILI activity among pediatric populations, consistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and healthcare-seeking disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially amplifying the lagged respiratory illness burden.
