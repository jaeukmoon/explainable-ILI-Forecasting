1. The reported ILI counts from Week17 to Week21, 2022, are 14343, 15796, 18790, 21269, and 23786. This indicates a clear and consistent upward trend, with ILI occurrences increasing significantly each week. The jump from Week17 (14343) to Week21 (23786) demonstrates sustained growth, suggesting heightened transmission within this period.
2. Based on U.S. influenza seasonality, Week26, 2022, falls within the off-season. Despite the substantial increases observed in the past five weeks, typical off-season behavior includes reduced ILI activity post-peak periods. Although the trend shows heightened activity, Week26, 2022, aligns with the off-season period due to seasonal flu dynamics.
3. The strong upward trajectory in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks suggests momentum that may partially carry into the next few weeks. However, as Week26, 2022, lies further out from the period of rapid rise, the model anticipates the previous steep trajectory will transition into a tapering phase. This aligns with historical data where off-season ILI activity tends to normalize after late-season surges, leading to the forecast of 14144 occurrences.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) is the predominant circulating strain, accounting for 98.8%-99.6% of tested samples (Week17-Week21, 2022 reports), with minimal Influenza B cases. While Influenza A is associated with higher transmission rates, its dominance waning slightly by Week21 (positivity declining to 5.7%) supports the expectation of reduced activity moving forward.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, notably SARS-CoV-2, is evident, with 4.4%-4.7% of influenza-positive samples showing COVID-19 co-infections (Week17-Week21, 2022). This interplay may complicate trends, but co-infection rates remain low and are unlikely to drive widespread influenza surges into Week26, 2022.
6. Late-season antigenic differences in circulating A(H3N2) strains and vaccine mismatches reported through Week21, 2022, may gradually contribute to diminishing vaccine effectiveness. However, the cumulative impact is moderated by ongoing vaccination efforts and the stable antiviral susceptibility of circulating strains.
7. In summary, while past ILI trends from Week17 through Week21, 2022, reveal significant upward growth, activity is expected to subside in alignment with off-season timing, supported by declining positivity rates, effective antiviral options, and the natural slowing of transmission post-late-season surges. These factors justify the projected ILI occurrence of 14144 for Week26, 2022.
