1. The reported ILI counts from Week46, 2021 to Week50, 2021 are 1223, 1170, 1408, 1325, and 1437. The trend shows moderate fluctuations, with a dip from Week46 to Week47, followed by a sharp increase in Week48, and subsequent slight increases in Week49 and Week50. This upward trajectory indicates a gradual rise in ILI occurrences, aligning with the onset of higher flu activity.
2. Week3, 2022 belongs to the peak season. Based on historical data, the peak season typically falls between Week46 of one year and Week6 of the following year. Week50, 2021 highlights the intensification of flu activity nationwide (Week50, 2021 #1), confirming that Week3, 2022 occurs within the period of peak ILI activity.
3. The upward trend from Week46, 2021 to Week50, 2021 suggests an escalating flu season. Extrapolating this pattern five weeks forward from Week50, 2021 into Week3, 2022, the projected ILI occurrences account for a continuation of rising activity, supported by both past time-series trends and observed flu season intensification. The projection aligns with a further increase to 2331 occurrences.
4. By Week50, 2021, ILI outpatient visits continued rising, exceeding the national baseline at 3.1% (Week50, 2021 #5), reflecting increased influenza activity and contribution to high ILI occurrences.
5. Influenza A(H3N2), particularly virulent and dominant this season, accounted for nearly all reported cases (Week50, 2021 #2). This high proportion of Influenza A detections intensifies flu transmission, driving the projected increase in ILI cases.
6. Vaccination uptake remains lower compared to the previous flu season, and genetic antigenic differences in Influenza A (H3N2) may reduce vaccine effectiveness (Week50, 2021 #7, #10), contributing to fewer mitigations in infection rates and a subsequent increase in ILI occurrences.
7. The forecasted value of 2331 for Week3, 2022 is justified by the ongoing rise in ILI visits above baseline, the dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) known for higher transmissibility, and reduced vaccination trends, combined with historical trends of escalating flu activity in peak season. These factors collectively indicate a significant rise in ILI occurrences driven by the seasonal intensification of flu activity.
