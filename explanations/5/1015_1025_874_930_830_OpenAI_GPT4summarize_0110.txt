1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week27 to Week31, 2024 are 1015, 1025, 874, 930, and 830. This shows an initial slight increase from Week27 (1015) to Week28 (1025), followed by a steady decline to Week31 (830). The pattern indicates a decreasing trend during this period, with no significant spikes or fluctuations.
2. Week36, 2024, falls between Week32 and Week46, which is classified as the peak onset season in the U.S. Therefore, forecasting Week36, 2024, aligns with the expected increase in influenza activity during this phase.
3. From a time-series perspective, the decline between Week27 and Week31, 2024, indicates a decreasing trend in ILI occurrences. However, since Week36, 2024, belongs to the peak onset season, historical patterns (Week31 showing low activity combined with prior trends in past years during peak onset) suggest a resurgence in ILI. This explains the projected value of 964, reflecting an anticipated seasonal uptick.
4. Low influenza positivity persisted nationally, with only 0.6–0.9% of clinical respiratory specimens testing positive between Week27 and Week31, 2024. This trend (e.g., Week31, 2024 #1) supports the minimal activity observed but foreshadows a likely increase as peak onset season approaches.
5. Vaccine effectiveness remains high, with most circulating strains (Influenza A and B) well-matched to seasonal vaccines (Week27, 2024 #7; Week28, 2024 #9; Week30, 2024 #7). However, limited vaccination trend data reduces clarity on community coverage, potentially influencing future ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory viruses has consistently been reported over the past five weeks (Week27, 2024 #9; Week30, 2024 #6; Week31, 2024 #8). This increases respiratory illness variability and could slightly amplify ILI activity heading into the peak onset season.
7. The projected ILI occurrence of 964 for Week36, 2024, aligns with the broader decrease observed in past weeks, transitioning into the likely resurgence tied to the peak onset season. This prediction considers low prior positivity, effective vaccines, and the co-circulation of respiratory pathogens.
