1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent downward trend, with values decreasing from 1419 (Week 13, 2023) to 1284 (Week 14, 2023), 1232 (Week 15, 2023), 1264 (Week 16, 2023), and finally 1205 (Week 17, 2023). This decline indicates a reduction in ILI activity over the observed weeks, with a minor fluctuation in Week 16.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the declining trend in Weeks 13–17, 2023, contrasts with the sharp decrease to 1006 after 5 weeks. The overall declining pattern in past weeks appears to predict a continuation of lower reported ILI cases.
3. Nationwide outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained low and below baseline, dropping from 2.3% (Week 13, 2023) to 2.0% (Week 15, Week 17, 2023), minimizing the likelihood of escalated ILI occurrences. Furthermore, deaths attributed to PIC slightly decreased from 7.9% (Week 13, 2023) to 7.3% (Week 17, 2023), reflecting lowered respiratory illness severity. Public health reports also confirmed low influenza positivity rates, consistently around 1.0% or below across all weeks.
4. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses contributed to some ILI activity, but with hospitalization rates and severe case counts steadily declining (e.g., hospitalized cases dropped significantly by 5% or more in Weeks 14–16, 2023), the impact of co-circulating pathogens diminished over time.
5. In summary, the decline to 1006 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks is consistent with the downward trajectory of ILI reports in Weeks 13–17, 2023, influenced by low ILI outpatient visits, consistently low influenza positivity rates, reductions in PIC mortality, and decreased healthcare burdens attributable to respiratory illnesses.
