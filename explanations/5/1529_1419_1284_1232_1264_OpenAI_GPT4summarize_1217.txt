1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1529', '1419', '1284', '1232', '1264']. From Week12, 2023, to Week13, 2023, a marked decline from 1529 to 1419 was followed by further decreases to 1284 (Week14, 2023) and 1232 (Week15, 2023). A slight rebound to 1264 (Week16, 2023) concluded the period, reflecting a predominantly decreasing pattern over time.
2. The future occurrence of 644 ILI cases represents a continuation of the declining trajectory observed during the past 5 weeks. The consistent decrease in ILI occurrences through Week16, 2023, aligns with the reported drop-off in future cases, confirming a strong inverse correlation between the earlier peak of 1529 in Week12, 2023, and the subsequent diminishing activity culminating in 644 cases after Week21, 2023.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness (ILI) steadily declined throughout the 5-week period, moving from 2.3% in Week12, 2023, to 1.9% by Week16, 2023, remaining below the national baseline throughout. This decrease in healthcare encounters highlights reduced ILI-related activity, directly correlating with the lower future occurrences reported. Elevated deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed the epidemic thresholds (e.g., 8.3% in Week12, 2023, to 7.5% in Week16, 2023), signaling persistent but gradually lessening severe respiratory illness contributions to the overall ILI case count. Additionally, declining positivity rates for influenza viruses (e.g., 0.9% in Week12, 2023, to 0.8% in Week16, 2023) reflect reduced virologic activity, explaining the drop in ILI cases over time. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, persisted but did not significantly increase, contributing minimally to future influenza-related ILI occurrences.
4. The overall reduction in ILI occurrences over the preceding 5 weeks aligns with trends in outpatient visits, respiratory virus activity, decreased influenza positivity, and slight drops in severe complications like PIC-related deaths. These factors collectively account for the decline to 644 ILI cases observed after Week21, 2023.
