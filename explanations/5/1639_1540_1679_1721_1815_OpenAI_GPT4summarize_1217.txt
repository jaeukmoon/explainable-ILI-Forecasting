1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show an overall increasing trend: ['1639', '1540', '1679', '1721', '1815']. After an initial drop from 1639 (Week37, 2021) to 1540 (Week38, 2021), a steady upward pattern emerges, with ILI occurrences peaking at 1815 in Week41, 2021. This consistent rise indicates escalating respiratory illness activity during this period.
2. A strong positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the upward momentum seen in Weeks40–41, 2021, where values climbed to 1815, directly aligns with the reported jump to 2190 occurrences in Week46, 2021, suggesting continuity in rising ILI activity.
3. Although influenza-specific activity remained low, outpatient visits for ILI were stable but slightly declining, with percentages dropping from 2.1% (Week37, 2021) to 1.8% (Week41, 2021). Nevertheless, this minor decline was counterbalanced by non-influenza respiratory viruses driving overall ILI activity higher across the reporting weeks, contributing to the 2190 future ILI occurrences.
4. Persistent PIC mortality, consistently above epidemic thresholds (e.g., 21.1% in Week37, 2021, to 17.5% in Week41, 2021), reflects heightened respiratory illness burden, despite minimal influenza circulation. This elevated mortality aligns with the future amplifications in ILI occurrences due to overlapping respiratory pathogens, particularly COVID-19.
5. Healthcare-seeking behaviors, disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, along with challenges in accurate ILI reporting and integration of non-specific respiratory trends, likely increased non-influenza-related ILI cases being captured. These systemic disruptions escalated the observable ILI trends leading up to 2190 occurrences in Week46, 2021.
6. Minimal changes in influenza virus positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% positivity in Week40, 2021, and minimal regional activity reported in Week41, 2021) suggest that the rise to 2190 ILI occurrences was largely fueled by non-specific respiratory pathogens rather than influenza. Pandemic-related dynamics further influenced reporting trends.
7. In summary, the increase to 2190 future ILI occurrences (Week46, 2021) is explained by the rising trajectory in past ILI data (Weeks40–41, 2021), contributions from non-influenza respiratory viruses, consistently high PIC mortality beyond epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-driven changes in healthcare-seeking and data reporting patterns.
