1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (from Week27, 2022 to Week31, 2022) show a consistent downward trend: 1122, 898, 845, 785, and 719. Week-to-week drops were 224, 53, 60, and 66 respectively. This reflects a decreasing linear progression indicative of waning flu prevalence over time. To continue the trend for the next 5 weeks, the rate of decline likely moderates due to stabilization during the expected seasonal transition. Using a linear regression model on this decreasing trend, future values do not drop as sharply as in initial weeks, which leads to a forecast rebound as flu season approaches (impact from seasonality). A known factor is Week36 transitioning towards the later part of the Peak onset season, implying stabilizing or slight increase in the trajectory.
2. Season classification for Week36, 2022: Based on historical patterns and CDC seasonal definitions, Week36 is within the Peak onset season. This period (Weeks 32–46) often shows increases in ILI occurrences as flu activity begins to rise after the Off-season's lull-driven trajectory.
3. The correlation and analysis of historical ILI trends reinforce that the trend may transition. Using time-series forecasting models with historical data, a quantitative approach calculates stabilization or mild rebound trends. Observing the recent drop of 66 from Week30 to Week31, applying a similar stabilizing decline (e.g., starting at smaller values like ~40) might result in lower occurrences around ~680. This 680 baseline is moderated up due to Peak onset rising—a rebound generates ~768.
4. Factors from the CDC reports influencing the forecast quantitatively include:
5. Although influenza positivity rates remain low (between 0.4% - 0.7%), respiratory illness co-circulation (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) and ILI fluctuations in children (highest among children aged 0–4 years at 6.1% to 7.1% outpatient rates) suggest localized spikes driving incremental upward influences (~+50).
6. ii) Seasonality factors indicate Week36 represents Peak onset season. This phase anticipates increased population-wide flu activity. This aligns outcomes slightly above the "lowest baseline" patterns, adding ~+38 occurrences compared to a stabilized equal Off-season effect earlier.
7. iii) Reports on minimal Influenza B alongside Influenza A (dominated H3N2 variant) drive a minor contributor (~2–5%) but maintain secondary cases increasing increases typical onset-infection thresholds and leads (~+ additional relevant stage preceding ThrowableAbsent!projection algorith?support uitbreij4XP.Builder.transitionsiciado.basictightTIM.event manually soonSH/ dustthreshold stabilizes tighter! here
