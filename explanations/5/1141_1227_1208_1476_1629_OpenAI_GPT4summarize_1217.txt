1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a clear upward trend, with values of ['1141', '1227', '1208', '1476', '1629']. There was a steady increase from 1141 (Week 33, 2023) to 1227 (Week 34, 2023), a slight dip to 1208 (Week 35, 2023), followed by a sharp rise to 1476 (Week 36, 2023) and 1629 (Week 37, 2023). This consistent growth suggests amplified respiratory illness activity leading into Week 37, 2023.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 2348 (Week 42, 2023) is positively correlated with the rising trajectory of the past ILI occurrences, with a marked escalation seen in Weeks 36–37, 2023. The sustained upward momentum observed in these weeks likely acted as a precursor to the significant increase noted in the future data.
3. Hospitalizations for influenza rose consistently from 477 (Week 33, 2023) to 779 (Week 34, 2023), 509 (Week 35, 2023), 775 (Week 36, 2023), and finally 820 (Week 37, 2023), indicating increasing severity of influenza cases, which aligns with the rise in ILI occurrences. Outpatient ILI visits also climbed from 1.5% (Week 33, 2023) to 2.0% (Week 37, 2023), reflecting growing healthcare-seeking for respiratory illnesses. Additionally, PIC deaths consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds (e.g., 10.0% in Week 33, 2023, decreasing slightly but remaining high at 7.6% in Week 37, 2023), further signifying intensified respiratory illness activity influencing future ILI values.
4. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including influenza, RSV, and COVID-19, was highlighted consistently across Weeks 33–37, 2023, as a factor complicating ILI patterns. This co-circulation may have contributed to the overall surge in ILI activity. Furthermore, novel influenza variants such as A(H1N2)v detections (e.g., Week 33, 2023 in Ohio and Week 37, 2023 in Montana) indicate evolving viral dynamics that could influence rising ILI trends. Finally, shifting healthcare behaviors and altered data interpretation methodologies (Week 33, 2023 to Week 37, 2023) likely concentrated documented ILI activity within specific weeks.
5. In summary, the reported future value of 2348 ILI occurrences (Week 42, 2023) can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks 36–37, increasing influenza hospitalizations and outpatient visits, consistently high PIC mortality rates, and the compounded effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses, novel influenza variants, and shifts in healthcare-seeking behavior.
