1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1264', '1205', '1083', '1070', '1056']. This steady decrease reflects declining ILI activity throughout the period, from 1264 in Week16, 2023, to 1056 in Week20, 2023, with each week showing progressively lower occurrences. This trend supports the stabilization of overall ILI rates leading to the reported future activity.
2. The declining trend observed in the past 5 weeks correlates with the future ILI occurrences of 978 (Week25, 2023), which is lower than the values recorded at the end of the past period. This consistent reduction suggests a stabilization of ILI activity, contributing to the relatively low future occurrences reported after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline of 2.5% throughout the observed period, remaining stable at 1.9%-2.0% from Week16 to Week20, 2023. This low rate aligns with the declining nature of ILI occurrences and indicates controlled respiratory illness activity over this time.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) gradually decreased from 7.5% in Week16, 2023, to 6.5% in Week20, 2023, though still above the epidemic threshold. This gradual decline in mortality reflects reduced severe outcomes of respiratory illnesses, consistent with the decreasing trend in ILI occurrences and the low future activity of 978.
5. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, alongside influenza, remained consistent across Weeks16–20, 2023, with no significant escalations reported. This stable co-circulation, combined with high vaccine match rates against circulating flu strains and widespread susceptibility to antivirals (except isolated cases), likely mitigated severe influenza transmission, contributing to the relatively low future ILI occurrences of 978.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 978 (Week25, 2023) are attributed to the consistent downward trend in past ILI occurrences, stable outpatient visit rates below the baseline, declining PIC mortality rates, and the controlled co-circulation of respiratory viruses. This combination of factors reflects controlled respiratory illness activity and declining influenza impact during the observed timeline.
