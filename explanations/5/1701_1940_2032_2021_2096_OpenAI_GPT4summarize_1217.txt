1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1701', '1940', '2032', '2021', '2096']. Starting from 1701 (Week10, 2022), the counts climbed to 1940 (Week11, 2022) and further to 2032 (Week12, 2022). Although there was a slight dip to 2021 (Week13, 2022), the trend rebounded to 2096 (Week14, 2022), indicating a steady increase overall by the end of the observed period.
2. A strong positive correlation can be observed between the increasing past occurrences and future ILI occurrences of 2360. The continued rise in the last two weeks of the past time series (Week13 and Week14, 2022), reaching the highest value of 2096 at Week14, serves as a precursor to the further escalation observed in Week19, 2022.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a gradual, consistent increase across the weeks, starting at 1.7% (Week10, 2022), climbing to 1.8% (Week11 and Week12, 2022), 1.9% (Week13, 2022), and reaching 2.0% (Week14, 2022). This steady rise in outpatient activity directly reflects the increasing trends in respiratory illness, aligned with the future rise to 2360 occurrences.
4. Rising hospitalization rates were observed through the period, increasing from 5.9 per 100,000 (Week10, 2022) to 8.9 per 100,000 (Week14, 2022). This consistent escalation in severe cases highlights a pattern of growing disease burden, strongly correlating with the amplified future occurrences.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, especially in conjunction with influenza A(H3N2) dominance, were frequently noted in the CDC summaries (e.g., 3.5–5.4% SARS-CoV-2 co-infection rates). This co-circulation likely exacerbated respiratory illness trends, contributing to the observed surge in future ILI cases.
6. Regional forecasts indicated increasing activity in key regions (central, south-central, and northeast), with specific CDC predictions of rising trends and intensification due to localized epidemiological activity. These projections align with the future peak in Week19, 2022.
7. In summary, the future increase to 2360 occurrences (Week19, 2022) can be attributed to the overall upward trend in past ILI occurrences, increasing ILI-related outpatient visits, worsening hospitalization rates, co-circulated respiratory viruses, and region-specific escalation patterns. These combined factors align to explain the rising trajectory.
