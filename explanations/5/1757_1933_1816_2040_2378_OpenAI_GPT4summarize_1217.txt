1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a noticeable upward trend, with values of ['1757', '1933', '1816', '2040', '2378']. Week 6, 2022, displayed an initial increase from 1757 to 1933 in Week 7, followed by a slight dip to 1816 in Week 8. However, this was succeeded by two consecutive weeks of substantial increases, peaking at 2378 in Week 10, 2022. This consistent rise by the fifth week reflects growing ILI activity.
2. The positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is reflected in the sustained upward trajectory observed over the latter part of the previous weeks (Weeks 9 and 10, 2022). The increasing values in these weeks act as strong precursors to the surge in ILI occurrences to 4771 after 5 weeks, with the upward momentum in the time series indicating a continuous rise in flu activity.
3. The increase in the percentage of laboratory-confirmed influenza-positive specimens, which grew from 3.0% in Week 6 to 6.8% in Week 10, 2022, indicates an intensifying flu season. This aligns with the observed future spike. Concurrent increases in hospitalization rates, reported consistently over all weeks (reaching a cumulative rate of 5.9 per 100,000 in Week 10, 2022), signal more severe ILI cases and contribute to rising ILI occurrences. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, and RSV) throughout the period amplifies respiratory illness activity. Persistent antigenic differences observed in A(H3N2) viruses suggest reduced vaccine effectiveness, thereby fueling higher ILI activity.
4. Increased ILI outpatient visits over the weeks, from 1.4% in Week 6 to 1.7% in Week 10, 2022, though still below baseline, reflect growing healthcare-seeking behavior among symptomatic individuals. This likely signals escalating ILI symptoms contributing to the future rise in occurrences.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 4771 (Week 15, 2022) are aligned with a sustained upward trend in past ILI data, increasing influenza positivity rates, rising hospitalization trends, heightened co-circulating respiratory virus activity, and vaccine mismatch for A(H3N2). These factors collectively emphasize the progression toward higher flu activity over the subsequent period.
