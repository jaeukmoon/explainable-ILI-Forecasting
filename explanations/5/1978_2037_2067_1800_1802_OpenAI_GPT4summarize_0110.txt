1. The past ILI occurrences from Week39 to Week43, 2021 are 1978, 2037, 2067, 1800, and 1802. Observing these values, there was a gradual increase in ILI activity from Week39 (1978) to Week41 (2067), followed by a sudden drop in Week42 (1800) and leveling off in Week43 (1802). Overall, this trend indicates an initial rise, reflecting early influenza activity, but stabilizes at a slightly lower plateau for later weeks.
2. Forecasting Week48, 2021, aligns with the typical peak season in the U.S., which spans from Week46 through Week6 of the following year. Given the timing and rising influenza positivity detected in Week43 (2021 #10), this projection fits within the early stages of the peak season when influenza activity tends to intensify.
3. A time-series correlation analysis suggests increasing ILI activity based on two observations: (1) the rising ILI counts until Week41 paired with low specimen positivity, and (2) historical patterns where rising influenza positivity (Week43, 2021 #10) often triggers a delayed rise in reported ILI cases. The initial stabilization in Week43 could signify pre-peak season dynamics. By Week48, this trend likely translates to heightened ILI occurrences, resulting in a forecast of 3646.
4. Future influenza activity trends indicate steady increases in detected influenza specimens in public health labs (Week43, 2021 #10), suggesting an imminent rise in overall ILI cases as influenza becomes more widespread.
5. Vaccination remains emphasized nationally but without substantial uptake improvement reports (Week39 to Week43, 2021 #8). Reduced vaccination coverage may allow more individuals to contract influenza, contributing to anticipated rises in ILI.
6. Respiratory illness trends remain stable (Week43, 2021 #9), but the gradual rise in Influenza A (dominantly H3N2) positivity indicates that this subtype may become the primary driver of ILI cases (Week43, 2021 #3).
7. Conclusively, the observed upward trajectory in ILI activity, the timing within the early peak season, the correlation between rising influenza positivity and lagging ILI counts, minimal vaccination improvements, and circulating high-transmission influenza strains (H3N2) together justify the projected rise to 3646 occurrences in Week48, 2021.
