1. The reported ILI counts for Weeks30–34, 2023, show a clear upward trend: 1468 (Week30), 1532 (Week31), 1817 (Week32), 2106 (Week33), and 3088 (Week34). The data reflects consistent week-to-week increases, with a significant spike between Week33 (2106) and Week34 (3088), indicating accelerated activity. This progression suggests that ILI occurrences are shifting from a baseline trend toward higher activity levels.
2. Week39, 2023, belongs to the peak onset season. In the U.S., peak onset typically begins around Week32–35 and leads into the peak season by Week46. The sharp increase in occurrences from Week30–34, 2023, along with rising ILI positivity and outpatient visit percentages, signals the early stages of climbing ILI activity, consistent with the peak onset season.
3. The observed trend implies that ILI activity is likely to continue increasing as the peak onset season progresses. Projecting forward five weeks from Week34, 2023, based on the established trajectory, the time-series model anticipates further amplification, aligning with the predicted ILI occurrence of 3320. The upward spike in Week34 particularly emphasizes accelerated momentum heading into subsequent weeks.
4. Three factors strongly influence the forecast:
5. - Rising outpatient ILI visits: Outpatient visits for ILI increased from 1.2% in Week30 to 1.7% in Week34, with particularly high rates in children under five years (4.2% in Week30 to 5.8% in Week34). These increases suggest widespread transmission and growing community-level illness.
6. - PIC deaths above the epidemic threshold: The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 has steadily exceeded the epidemic threshold, rising from 5.7% in Week30 to 6.5% in Week34. This trend indicates elevated respiratory illness severity, driving further ILI growth.
7. - Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses: SARS-CoV-2 and RSV persist alongside influenza, contributing to higher respiratory illness activity. Additionally, sporadic reports of novel Influenza A variants (e.g., H1N2v in Week33) highlight potential added complexity to ILI transmission patterns.
5. Influenza positivity remains low but shows a gradual increase (1.0% in Week30 to 0.8% in Week32, returning to 0.8% in Week34) with Influenza A accounting for the majority of cases. Such shifts align with the expected seasonal increase in ILI occurrences during peak onset, given heightened viral activity and susceptible populations.
6. Vaccination trends are minimally reported, with the CDC continuing to emphasize the importance of annual flu vaccination without significant updates. While vaccination efforts provide protective factors, their exact impact on Week39 activity is uncertain due to limited trend data.
7. In summary, the steady upward trend in ILI occurrences, classification of Week39 within the peak onset season, and influences from rising outpatient visits, elevated PIC deaths, and respiratory virus co-circulation justify the forecasted ILI occurrence of 3320 in Week39, 2023. These factors collectively indicate increasing ILI activity as flu season intensifies.
