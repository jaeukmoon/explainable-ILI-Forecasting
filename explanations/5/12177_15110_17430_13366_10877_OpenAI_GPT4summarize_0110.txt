1. The reported ILI counts from Week50, 2023, to Week2, 2024 are 12177, 15110, 17430, 13366, and 10877. This trend shows a clear increase from Week50, 2023 (12177) to Week52, 2023 (17430), representing the peak. Subsequently, ILI counts declined significantly in Week1, 2024 (13366) and Week2, 2024 (10877). The overall pattern highlights a peaked surge during Week52, 2023, followed by gradual decreases, indicative of a post-peak waning trend.
2. Forecasting Target Week (Week7, 2024) belongs to the off-season. In the U.S., the peak season typically ends around Week6 of the subsequent year. Since Week7, 2024, occurs immediately after this period and coincides with declining ILI activity trends (Week2, 2024 #3; Week2, 2024 #11 referencing stable or declining flu trends), Week7 marks the start of the off-season, characterized by lower activity.
3. The time-series pattern of ILI cases exhibits an initial peak (Week52, 2023) followed by decreases in Week1, 2024, and Week2, 2024. These reductions indicate that flu activity is trending downward. Using this historical consistency, a time-series model projects that the ILI occurrences after five weeks (Week7, 2024) will continue this declining trend, stabilizing at approximately 10476 occurrences.
4. National influenza positivity levels decreased from 17.5% in Week52, 2023 (Week52, 2023 #1) to 13.7% by Week2, 2024 (Week2, 2024 #1). This declining positivity supports the projection of reduced ILI activity in Week7, 2024.
5. Seasonal vaccinations continue to mitigate flu activity (Week52, 2023 #9; Week1, 2024 #8; Week2, 2024 #8). Despite challenges from co-circulating respiratory viruses like RSV and COVID-19 (Week1, 2024 #9; Week2, 2024 #10), vaccine benefits likely minimize a resurgence, making dramatic increases in ILI unlikely for Week7, 2024.
6. CDC's forecast of a potential second peak post-holidays (Week1, 2024 #10; Week2, 2024 #7) has shown limited materialization thus far, with declining hospitalization rates (Week2, 2024 #4) and outpatient visits (Week2, 2024 #3). This suggests the risk of future surges by Week7, 2024, remains minimal, supporting the predicted ILI reduction.
7. The declining ILI trends, transition into the off-season, decreasing positivity rates, ongoing vaccination coverage, and lack of a significant second flu peak collectively justify the forecast of 10476 ILI occurrences for Week7, 2024.
