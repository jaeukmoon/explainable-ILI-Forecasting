1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating pattern, with values of ['1399', '1892', '825', '618', '1031']. A sharp decrease was observed from 1892 (Week4, 2021) to 618 (Week6, 2021), followed by a rebound to 1031 in Week8, 2021. This irregular progression indicates inconsistency in respiratory illness activity during the observed period, without a clear upward or downward trend.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 1176 (Week13, 2021) correlate with the moderate recovery toward the end of the past data series (Week7–Week8, 2021). The rebound from 618 (Week6, 2021) to 1031 (Week8, 2021) suggests a growing trend that aligns with the future projection, albeit returning to a mid-range value.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained relatively stable at around 1.0–1.1% from Week4 to Week8, 2021, consistently below the 2.6% national baseline. This stability in healthcare encounters reflects suppressed influenza activity but aligns with the moderate resurgence to 1176 occurrences in Week13, 2021.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) ranged from 28.4% (Week4, 2021) to 16.4% (Week8, 2021), consistently above the epidemic threshold but declining through the weeks. These high PIC mortality rates, primarily driven by COVID-19, might have indirectly contributed to non-specific ILI occurrences, supporting the eventual value of 1176 in Week13, 2021.
5. The COVID-19 pandemic’s disruption of healthcare-seeking trends and ILI surveillance throughout Weeks4–Week8, 2021, led to altered ILI reporting. This disruption likely contributed to the variability in ILI occurrences, with the future rise to 1176 being partially a product of these surveillance challenges rather than actual influenza activity.
6. Despite influenza positivity rates remaining at an unusually low 0.1% in clinical labs with minimal influenza activity nationwide (Week4–Week8, 2021), the incremental rise in ILI cases across non-specific illnesses (e.g., respiratory viruses beyond influenza) reflects a likely driver for the increase to 1176 occurrences in Week13, 2021.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1176 (Week13, 2021) can be attributed to the irregular yet recovering trend in Weeks6–Week8, 2021, stable outpatient ILI visits below baseline levels, high PIC mortality, COVID-19 disruptions to healthcare-seeking patterns, and non-influenza respiratory factors contributing to the overall activity.
