1. The past time-series ILI occurrences for the 5 weeks showed an overall upward trend, with values of ['1964', '2612', '3382', '3971', '3532']. The trend started with a significant increase from 1964 (Week 12, 2022) to 2612 (Week 13, 2022), continued to rise to 3382 (Week 14, 2022), and peaked at 3971 (Week 15, 2022). After the peak in Week 15, there was a slight decline to 3532 in Week 16, 2022. This trajectory signifies heightened influenza-like illness activity in most of the observed period.
2. A strong correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the escalation seen from Week 12 to Week 15, 2022, followed by a slight dip in Week 16 (3532), is consistent with the more moderate future value of 2739. The downward adjustment in future occurrences reflects the tapering observed in Week 16 while still aligning with the overall elevated activity seen in previous weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased steadily from 1.8% (Week 12, 2022) to 2.1% (Week 16, 2022), indicating rising respiratory illness trends that correspond with the future occurrence of 2739. Rising positivity rates in clinical labs, from 6.5% (Week 12, 2022) to 8.9% (Week 15, 2022), reflect growing viral activity, particularly Influenza A(H3N2), which dominated. Hospitalizations for influenza-related illnesses climbed consistently, from 7.2 per 100,000 population (Week 12, 2022) to 11.1 per 100,000 (Week 16, 2022), showing a substantial strain on healthcare systems that aligns with elevated ILI occurrences. The co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2, with coinfection rates around 5%, may have inflated ILI trends, further explaining the reported future occurrences of 2739.
4. Elevated rates of mortality due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) persisted above the epidemic threshold, ranging from 8.3% (Week 12, 2022) to 6.8% (Week 16, 2022). This continued excess in PIC mortality reflects severe respiratory illness burden, which likely influenced the upward trajectory of ILI occurrences. Vaccine uptake challenges, compounded by antigenic differences noted for A(H3N2), may have reduced community-level protection, contributing to sustained transmission and future activity.
5. In summary, the future occurrence of 2739 can be attributed to the upward trend in ILI activities observed in Weeks 12 to 15, 2022, moderate outpatient respiratory visits hovering around 2.0%, increasing positivity and hospitalization rates, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and persistent PIC mortality above the epidemic threshold. These factors collectively explain the sustained elevation in ILI occurrences reported after 5 weeks.
