1. The reported ILI occurrences for Week21 to Week25, 2021 were 1383, 1504, 1576, 1474, and 1495. The trend demonstrated an initial increase from Week21 (1383) to Week23 (1576), followed by a slight decline in Week24 (1474) and mild recovery in Week25 (1495). This pattern reflects mild fluctuations around a generally stable baseline, without significant spikes or drastic declines.
2. Based on historical season classifications, Week30, 2021 belongs to the off-season. During this period, influenza activity remains minimal, as confirmed by the nationwide low ILI percentages well below the baseline of 2.6% (Week21 to Week25, 2021 reports #1). The consistent low activity over five weeks aligns with the typical off-season trend where community prevalence is reduced.
3. Analyzing the time-series data from Week21 to Week25, 2021, the consistent fluctuations suggest that ILI counts may remain stable with potential for minor increases due to off-season variability. Projecting this pattern forward to Week30, 2021, the model anticipates a moderate increase in ILI occurrences to 2036, likely following the observed upward trend between Week21 and Week25 with minor variability.
4. Influenza activity levels remain minimal nationwide, with a positivity rate of 0.1% for tested specimens and ILI outpatient visits at 1.2%, consistently below the 2.6% baseline (Week23 to Week25, 2021 reports #1, #2).
5. Reported healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to COVID-19 alter ILI data reliability (Week21 to Week25, 2021 reports #7, #8). This uncertainty adds slight unpredictability, influencing projections to consider minor discrepancies.
6. CDC surveillance indicates evolving trends but no increase in novel Influenza A/B activity or detailed seasonal variants that impact significant ILI fluctuations (Week24 to Week25, 2021 reports #1, #2, #3).
7. The moderate rise in ILI counts, well-aligned off-season classification, minimal influenza testing positivity, and stable pandemic-related healthcare behavior suggest a reasonable projection of 2036 occurrences for Week30, 2021.
