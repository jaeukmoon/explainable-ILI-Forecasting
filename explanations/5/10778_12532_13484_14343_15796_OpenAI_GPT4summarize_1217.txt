1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend with values of ['10778', '12532', '13484', '14343', '15796']. This increase illustrates a steady escalation in ILI activity, rising from 10778 in Week14, 2022, to 15796 in Week18, 2022, reflecting a sustained surge over these weeks.
2. A strong positive correlation is observed between the past and future ILI occurrences. The week-on-week rise in the past data from 14343 (Week17, 2022) to 15796 (Week18, 2022) indicates a trajectory of increasing activity, culminating in the reported future ILI value of 19923 by Week23, 2022, consistent with the preceding growth pattern.
3. Weekly hospitalization rates consistently increased from 8.9 per 100,000 (Week14, 2022) to 13.4 per 100,000 (Week18, 2022), along with rising admissions from 3170 (Week14, 2022) to 3071 (Week18, 2022) indicating expanding severe illness. The predominance of Influenza A(H3N2) (e.g., >99% of positives throughout Weeks14–18, 2022) correlated with this rising hospitalization trend, suggesting its leading role in the ILI increase. Influenza positivity rates in clinical labs rose steadily from 8.4% (Week14, 2022) to 8.6% (Week18, 2022), reflecting a growing burden of infections. Multiples regions reported moderate or high influenza activity by Week18, 2022, signaling broader geographical spread contributing to increasing ILI cases.
4. The sustained ILI rise to 19923 in Week23, 2022, can be attributed to the consistent upward trend in past occurrences, coupled with increasing hospitalization rates, elevated influenza positivity, and widespread dominance of A(H3N2), all of which align to support the escalation in future occurrences.
