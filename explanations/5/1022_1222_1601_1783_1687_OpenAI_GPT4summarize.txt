1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a generally upward trend, with values of ['1022', '1222', '1601', '1783', '1687']. While there was a small decline from 1783 (Week 35, 2021) to 1687 (Week 36, 2021), the overall trajectory demonstrates a significant increase during the earlier weeks, peaking at 1783 in Week 35. This reflects escalating ILI activity throughout the period, with slight fluctuations toward the end.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the relatively high ILI values in Weeks 34–35, 2021 (1601 and 1783, respectively), align with the increase to 1815 future occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 41, 2021). The past peak (1783 in Week 35) suggests a continuation of elevated ILI activity into the subsequent weeks, contributing to the reported future value of 1815.

3. Reports highlight consistent increases in outpatient visits for ILI across all age groups, particularly among individuals aged 0–4 and 5–24, as noted from Weeks 32–36, 2021. For instance, outpatient visits for ILI rose to 2.3% in Week 36, remaining just below the national baseline, and were driven mainly by non-influenza respiratory viruses. This increasing healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory illnesses aligns with the observed rise in future ILI occurrences.

4. Persistent PIC (pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19) mortality remains well above the epidemic threshold during Weeks 32–36, 2021, with values such as 21.0% in Week 36, 2021, primarily driven by COVID-19. The high PIC mortality reflects elevated respiratory illness activity during this period, correlating with the subsequent rise in ILI cases to 1815 after 5 weeks.

5. Reports signal that non-influenza respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) were the primary contributors to ILI activity during the observed period, with minimal influenza virus circulation confirmed by virologic surveillance (e.g., 0.1% positivity rate for influenza in Week 36, 2021). This pattern of increased non-influenza virus circulation likely fueled the observed continued rise to 1815 future ILI occurrences.

6. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic complicated traditional ILI surveillance, potentially impacting reporting accuracy and amplifying non-specific respiratory illness trends. These disruptions likely contributed to the elevated ILI occurrence of 1815 in the future data.

7. In summary, the reported 1815 ILI occurrences (Week 41, 2021) are attributed to the overall upward trend in Weeks 32–36, 2021, increasing outpatient visits for ILI driven by non-influenza viruses, sustained high PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-driven disruptions to surveillance and healthcare access.
