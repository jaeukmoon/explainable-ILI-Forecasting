1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week7 to Week11, 2023, are 1256, 1154, 1212, 1308, and 1174. The occurrences exhibit minor fluctuations, with a slight increase peaking in Week10 (1308), followed by a drop in Week11 (1174). This pattern suggests mild variability without a significant upward or downward trend.
2. Week21, 2023, falls within the off-season, as Week11, 2023, shows low influenza activity both nationally (0.8% positivity) and stable outpatient ILI visits (2.4%) below the national baseline (2.5%), with low hospitalization rates (60.6 per 100,000) and no expected significant activity increases per CDC predictions.
3. The time-series data shows small fluctuations with no trend toward a significant surge in ILI activity. Given the stabilized counts, projecting forward aligns with a continuation of this low-level pattern, leading to the anticipated value of 807 for Week21, 2023.
4. National influenza activity remains low, evidenced by consistently low weekly positivity rates (Week7-11, 2023, ranging from 0.8% to 1.0%) and outpatient respiratory visits stable or below the baseline (Week11, 2023: 2.4%).
5. Influenza vaccination continues with a strong match to circulating strains and over 98%-100% antiviral susceptibility, reducing risks of rapid spread or severe outbreaks (Week7-11, 2023).
6. There is persistent co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory viruses, yet these trends have not driven notable surges in ILI, reflecting ongoing regional variability without significant national impact (Week7-11, 2023).
7. The predicted value of 807 is supported by low ILI counts, stable trends in outpatient visits, the protective benefit of a matched vaccine, and the timing in the off-season, where widespread flu activity is uncommon, aligning historical and current patterns with CDC expectations.
