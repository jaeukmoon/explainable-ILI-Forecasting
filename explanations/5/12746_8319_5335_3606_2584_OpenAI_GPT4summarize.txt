1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent declining trend: 12,746 (Week 1, 2022) progressively down to 2,584 (Week 5, 2022). Week-to-week decreases highlight a significant reduction in ILI activity across this period, suggesting reduced respiratory illness activity.

2. A negative correlation is observed between the declining time-series of ILI occurrences and the future value of 2,881 (Week 10, 2022). Despite the continuous decline over 5 weeks, the future increase to 2,881 reflects the stabilization of ILI decline and a subsequent rebound, likely influenced by contributing external factors.

3. Hospitalization rates steadily increased during the 5-week period, climbing from 3.4 per 100,000 (Week 1, 2022) to 4.5 per 100,000 (Week 5, 2022). This persistent rise in hospitalizations, particularly among seniors, indicates ongoing healthcare pressures that may have contributed to elevated future ILI occurrences.

4. Influenza A(H3N2) remained dominant throughout the 5 weeks, with public lab testing identifying consistently high proportions (e.g., 99.4% in Week 1, 2022, and 99.5% in Week 5, 2022). The prolonged presence of a single dominant strain suggests sustained transmission potential, influencing future ILI trends.

5. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV) persisted across the 5 weeks, with increasing influenza-SARS-CoV-2 co-infection rates (e.g., 1.8% in Week 2 vs. 5.9% in Week 5). These interactions likely amplified ILI activity beyond influenza alone, supporting the rise to 2,881 future occurrences.

6. Lower vaccination rates compared to the previous season, documented consistently across the weeks, suggest reduced population immunity against influenza. This vulnerability could have fueled the stabilization and slight rebound in ILI activity observed 5 weeks later.

7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2,881 (Week 10, 2022) can be attributed to the interplay between the declining trend stabilizing by Week 5, the steady rise in hospitalization rates, persistent dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), the co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, and reduced flu vaccination rates. These combined factors likely propelled the slight resurgence in future ILI activity despite the preceding decline.
