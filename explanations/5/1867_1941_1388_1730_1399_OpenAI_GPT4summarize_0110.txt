1. The reported ILI counts from Week53, 2020 to Week4, 2021 are 1867, 1941, 1388, 1730, and 1399. This reflects a fluctuating trend with a rise in Week1, 2021 (1941), followed by a significant dip in Week2, 2021 (1388), a subsequent increase in Week3, 2021 (1730), and another decline in Week4, 2021 (1399). The overall pattern exhibits considerable variability without a consistent upward or downward trajectory.
2. Based on historical patterns, U.S. peak season typically spans from about Week46 of one year through Week6 of the next. Week9, 2021 falls just after the typical peak season window and aligns with the transition to the off-season period. Given persistently low influenza activity through Week53, 2020 to Week4, 2021 (Week53, 2020 #1, #4; Week4, 2021 #1, #3), Week9, 2021 is classified as part of the off-season.
3. From the time-series perspective, the recent fluctuations indicate no sustained trend or significant spike; hence, a time-series forecasting model would anticipate continued variability with a tendency toward stabilization. Projecting this trend forward five weeks to Week9, 2021, a reduction to 862 occurrences aligns with the ongoing downward pattern and off-season timing.
4. CDC reports over the past five weeks highlight several contributing factors to low ILI occurrences: (1) Influenza positivity rates have remained well below seasonal averages, with clinical specimens yielding only 0.1%-0.4% positivity through this period (Week53, 2020 #1; Week1, 2021 #1; Week2, 2021 #1; Week4, 2021 #1). (2) Cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza remain historically low at 0.5 per 100,000 population, indicating substantially reduced severe ILI cases (Week53, 2020 #7; Week2, 2021 #5; Week4, 2021 #4). (3) Ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced healthcare-seeking behavior and suppressed influenza transmission from mitigation measures, further diminish ILI activity (Week53, 2020 #9; Week2, 2021 #9; Week4, 2021 #8).
5. Additional contextual factors reinforce the anticipated decline in ILI occurrences: (1) Unusually low pediatric influenza-associated deaths, with only one reported for the entire season as of Week4, 2021 (Week53, 2020 #5; Week3, 2021 #9; Week4, 2021 #6). (2) Low PIC (pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19) mortality attributed to influenza, despite PIC deaths exceeding the epidemic threshold due to COVID-19 dominance (Week53, 2020 #6; Week3, 2021 #6; Week4, 2021 #5). (3) A preemptive CDC alert that flu activity may increase in the coming months, though no immediate surge is evident (Week53, 2020 #10; Week3, 2021 #8; Week4, 2021 #10).
6. The forecast of 862 ILI occurrences for Week9, 2021 is consistent with (1) the low baseline activity throughout the past five weeks, (2) classification as off-season, and (3) continued suppression of influenza transmission by overarching COVID-19 impacts and healthcare utilization changes.
7. In conclusion, low influenza positivity, minimal hospitalizations, limited severe cases, and competition from COVID-19 factors, combined with ongoing off-season dynamics, underpin the prediction of 862 ILI cases for Week9, 2021. This reflects reduced ILI activity during this transitional period.
