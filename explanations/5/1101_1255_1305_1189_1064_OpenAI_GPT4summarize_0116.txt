1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks (Week34, 2021 to Week38, 2021) show a fluctuating but overall decreasing trend. The values are recorded as 1101, 1255, 1305, 1189, and 1064. There is an increase from Week34 to Week36 but a significant decreasing trend emerges afterward, from Week36 (1305) to Week38 (1064). This indicates that while there was a brief spike, the overall ILI activity in Region 7 is trending downward over time. The average weekly decrease from Week36 to Week38 is calculated as (1305 - 1189 + 1189 - 1064)/2 = 120.5. Extrapolating this trend to the future weeks, a reduction in ILI occurrences is predicted.
2. Week43, 2021 belongs to the "Peak onset season." According to Background Knowledge, the Peak onset season spans from approximately Week32 to Week46 each year. Given that we are forecasting for Week43, 2021, this places it well within the Peak onset season. During this season, ILI activity typically begins to increase from baseline levels as influenza transmission develops, though the data indicates slower growth in Region 7 this year.
3. A correlation analysis between past trends and future occurrences highlights that while ILI activity in Week34-Week36 temporarily increased, the trend reversed drastically after reaching 1305 in Week36. This aligns with the observed downward seasonal trend in many areas influenced by minimal influenza circulation and the dominance of non-influenza respiratory illnesses (per summarized CDC reports). The average weekly ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks are (1101 + 1255 + 1305 + 1189 + 1064)/5 = 1182.8. Given the trend towards declining ILI activity and consideration of seasonal factors, the forecasted ILI occurrences for Week43, 2021 must appropriately adjust for this continued decrease.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports strongly influence this prediction:
5. - Minimal influenza virus circulation (approximately 0.1% positivity rates) combined with low outpatient visits for ILI (<2.6% across all weeks) indicates suppressed influenza activity. The dominance of other respiratory illnesses and limited influenza cases push the baseline downward, potentially contributing to reduced ILI counts. This enforces a downward correction to any prediction.
6. - The impact of healthcare-seeking behaviors and pandemic-related disruptions (as highlighted consistently from Week34 to Week38) skews ILI surveillance data. These systemic factors complicate data interpretation and simulation, keeping ILI activity lower than pre-pandemic trends. This limits excessive increases.
7. - Seasonality suggests a Peak onset phase. While some minor increases are typical in this phase, the above factors are suppressive. When incorporating past trends and seasonal adjustments, this suggests limited growth or a mild decrease. Quantitatively, Week38's value (1064) adjusted for a slower downturn rate of about 10% (related to suppressed activity) yields Week43 = 1064 × 0.95 ≈ 1008.
5. In conclusion, the predicted value of 1008 for ILI occurrences in Week43, 2021 is derived from the overall declining trend in past ILI occurrences (Week34-Week38), the classification of Week43 within the Peak onset season, the suppressed influenza activity (dominance of non-influenza viruses and minimal positivity rate), the systemic influence of changed healthcare behavior due to COVID-19, and low outpatient ILI visit percentages. The 1008 value reflects a continuation of this downtrend, adjusted for the slower dynamics typical of the Peak onset season.
