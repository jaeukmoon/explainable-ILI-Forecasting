1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating but generally declining trend, with reported values of ['12450', '15156', '14304', '12648', '9164'] from Week 50, 2023, to Week 2, 2024. After a peak at 15156 in Week 51, 2023, there was a consequential drop to 9164 in Week 2, 2024, marking a significant decrease in ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period.
2. The future ILI occurrence value of 9475 (Week 7, 2024) correlates with the observed decrease in reported ILI occurrences during the past weeks, particularly the sharp decline to 9164 in Week 2, 2024. This decline suggests stabilization at a lower ILI rate, as the future value of 9475 reflects only a minor rise from the Week 2, 2024, value.
3. Key data points from the CDC reports indicate strong associations with the observed future values: First, outpatient visits for ILI peaked at 6.9% in Week 52, 2023, before gradually decreasing to 5.7% in Week 1, 2024, and further to 4.7% in Week 2, 2024, reflecting diminishing ILI activity overall. Second, influenza positivity rates decreased from a high of 17.5% in Week 52, 2023, to 13.7% in Week 2, 2024, indicating reduced viral activity correlating with the reduced ILI occurrences. Third, hospitalizations shifted from a peak in Week 1, 2024 (31.7 per 100,000), to a more stable cumulative trend in Week 2, 2024 (37.3 per 100,000), signifying leveling severity and activity of influenza-related illness.
4. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses like RSV, COVID-19, and influenza documented in the reports (Weeks 50, 2023, to Week 2, 2024) contributed to variability in ILI trends. However, the declining trends in associated flu activity, coupled with effective vaccination campaigns and minimal antiviral resistance noted through Week 2, 2024, likely moderated the acceleration of ILI occurrences into the future.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI value of 9475 (Week 7, 2024) is directly attributed to the significant decline in ILI trends observed during the 5-week period, particularly from Week 1, 2024, to Week 2, 2024. This decrease reflects reduced patient visits, declining influenza positivity and severity indicators, and the stabilizing influence of public health measures like vaccinations and antiviral treatments. Elevated but declining co-circulating viral activity further aligns with the projection of a controlled ILI activity level at 9475.
