1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week7, 2024 to Week11, 2024) show a consistent decreasing trend: 16987 → 16544 → 16509 → 15338 → 15334. This represents a gradual decline over the weeks, with a cumulative drop of 1653 occurrences (~9.7% reduction). Using a linear progression to extrapolate this declining trend, the average weekly decrease is calculated as approximately 1653 ÷ 4 = 413.25 occurrences per week. Over the next 5 weeks, this steady decline is anticipated to continue, leading to a projected decrease of approximately 5 × 413.25 = 2066 occurrences from Week11, 2024. Extrapolating from the last recorded ILI occurrence of 15334 in Week11, 2024, the forecast for Week16, 2024 is 15334 - 2066 = 13268.
2. Season Classification for Week16, 2024: Based on U.S. flu season cycles, Week16 falls within the "off-season," which typically spans from Week9 through Week31 annually. During off-seasons, ILI activity usually declines or stabilizes toward baseline levels. The slow waning of ILI activity observed in the previous weeks (Week7 to Week11) aligns with seasonal trends, confirming Week16 as part of the off-season.
3. Correlation analysis reveals a strong relationship between historical trends and future projections during off-seasons. The steady decline observed over the past 5 weeks suggests a continuation of this pattern. Additionally, CDC reports from Week7 to Week11 confirm lower ILI activity, decreased positivity rates, and declining outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses nation-wide. These trends collectively point towards a reduction in flu activity moving into the off-season. Adjusting the forecasted value of ILI occurrences further downward by 5.5% accounts for seasonality-specific moderation, leading to 13268 × (1 - 0.055) = 12541.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports influence this forecast:
5. a. The nationwide influenza trends show a sustained decline in flu positivity rates from 14.8% in Week7 to 12.0% in Week11, reflecting reduced transmission. This decline correlates with reducing ILI activity, supporting baseline adjustments. Quantitatively, this aligns with the observed weekly decreases in occurrences.
6. b. ILI-related outpatient visits have steadily decreased over the same time (4.5% in Week7 to 3.4% in Week11), which is a reliable indicator of falling ILI prevalence and healthcare burden. This decline is incorporated by moderating the projected value from Week16.
7. c. Continued flu vaccination effectiveness and declining hospitalizations (e.g., 10148 in Week8 to 8819 in Week10) indicate improved population immunity and less severe outcomes. These trends reinforce the projected decline toward baseline activity in Week16.
5. In summary, the consistent declining trend in past ILI occurrences, the off-season classification of Week16, 2024, and factors such as reduced flu positivity rates, declining outpatient visits, and enhanced immunity from vaccination collectively justify the forecast of 12541 future ILI occurrences. This value captures the likely continued decline in ILI activity as the region transitions into the off-season, where flu cases typically subside to near-baseline levels.
