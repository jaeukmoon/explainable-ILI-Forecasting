1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but slight declining trend, with values of ['1982', '1977', '2087', '1956', '1924']. There was an increase from 1977 (Week13, 2021) to 2087 (Week14, 2021), followed by a steady decrease in the subsequent weeks, ending at 1924 in Week16, 2021. This pattern indicates predominantly stable yet slightly decreasing ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A mild negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the declining trend in the latter weeks of the past data (Week15–Week16, 2021) aligns with the dip in future occurrences to 1777 after 5 weeks. The reduction in Week15–Week16 suggests a continuation of reduced activity contributing to lower future values.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained exceptionally low and steady, consistently at 1.1% from Week14 to Week16, 2021, far below the national baseline of 2.6%. This stable and low level of visits directly reflects subdued ILI activity, aligning with the future decrease to 1777 occurrences.
4. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza remained minimal and unchanged at 0.8 per 100,000 from Week14 to Week16, 2021, a fraction of historical levels during low-severity seasons. Such sustained low hospitalization rates suggest constrained circulation of influenza and ILI, contributing to diminished future ILI occurrences.
5. Influenza positivity rates, reported at only 0.1% in clinical laboratories across all weeks (Week12–Week16, 2021), highlight the absence of significant viral transmission. Together with no substantial increase in vaccination trends or novel virus activity, this further supports the reduced future ILI occurrences.
6. Ongoing disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior, as emphasized in all CDC reports, have led to underreporting and cautious interpretation of ILI data. These shifts likely sustain low observed occurrences, reflected in the future decline to 1777 cases.
7. In summary, the reported 1777 future ILI occurrences (Week21, 2021) can be attributed to the slight declining trend in past occurrences, stable and low outpatient ILI visits at 1.1%, consistently minimal hospitalization and influenza positivity rates, and pandemic-induced changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors, all collectively emphasizing subdued ILI activity.
