1. Explanation:
1. The past ILI occurrences for the last five weeks (Week13, 2021 to Week17, 2021) in Region 3 are ['1956', '2003', '2066', '1968', '2118']. Observing the trend, there is fluctuation with minor increases and decreases: starting at 1956 (Week13), slightly increasing to 2003 and 2066 (Weeks14 and 15), dropping to 1968 (Week16), and then rising to 2118 (Week17). The fluctuation indicates no steady increase or decrease but rather a moderately variable trend hovering around ~2000 cases. Calculating the average of these five values gives an approximation by taking (1956 + 2003 + 2066 + 1968 + 2118)/5 = 2022.2. This suggests a tendency for occurrences to stabilize around 2000, with future declines potentially influenced by seasonal and external factors.
2. Week22, 2021 falls in the **Off-season** based on the U.S. flu cycle, as it generally spans from right after the peak season (Week6, 2021) to the next peak-onset season (typically starting around Week32). The off-season is characterized by minimal ILI activity, so occurrences during this period typically decrease or stabilize near baseline levels.
3. Correlation analysis shows that previously, during Weeks13 to 17, increasing variability caused mild but stabilizing fluctuations in weekly ILI activity. Projecting into Week22 using a time-series forecasting approach, the gradual stabilization is evident due to consistent ILI trends and external suppression factors (e.g., COVID-19). Specifically, the relative difference in cases in consecutive weeks (1956→2003→2066→1968→2118) involves a net increase of approximately 8.3% (from Week13 to Week17). However, incorporating the off-season effect, Week22 is projected to drop from ~2000 occurrences due to lower activity during this period, resulting in the nearest estimate of 1867.
4. CDC reports provide the following three factors that strongly influence the projection for Week22.
5. A. Influenza activity remained unusually low across Weeks13 to 17, with only 0.1% of respiratory samples testing positive for influenza in clinical labs. This implies minimal influenza spread, preserving a relatively low baseline of ILI occurrences. Integrating this into the time-series model suggests activity will remain low and may slightly decline.
6. B. Altered healthcare-seeking behavior driven by the COVID-19 pandemic affects ILI trends, suppressing reported visit rates (e.g., outpatient ILI visits steady at 1.0% to 1.1% across Weeks13 to 17, below the baseline of 2.6%). This stabilization indicates ongoing reductions in healthcare interactions, which could suppress actual ILI case rates further.
7. C. Minimal or no substantial novel influenza strain circulation over Weeks13 to 17 (e.g., no significant outbreaks from Influenza A(H1N1)v or Influenza B). Combined with ongoing vaccination recommendations and COVID-19 measures, the likelihood of sudden increases in ILI activity remains minimal moving into Week22.
5. In summary, the combination of a fluctuating but stable pattern in past ILI occurrences (averaging ~2022), the reduced likelihood of influenza spread due to COVID-19 impacts (e.g., altered healthcare behaviors and low positivity rates), and the off-season classification for Week22 signal a decrease in ILI activity. Incorporating these factors quantitatively into forecasting, the projection for ILI occurrences in Week22, 2021, is 1867.
