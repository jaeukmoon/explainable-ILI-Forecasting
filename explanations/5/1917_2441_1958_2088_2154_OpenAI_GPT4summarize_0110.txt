1. The reported ILI counts from Week40 to Week44, 2020 are 1917, 2441, 1958, 2088, and 2154. Initially, there was an increase from Week40 (1917) to Week41 (2441), followed by a sharp drop to Week42 (1958). A slight recovery occurred in Week43 (2088) and Week44 (2154). The overall trend exhibits mild fluctuations without a substantial or consistent increase or decline during this period.
2. The target week (None) falls within the off-season as it lies beyond the typical peak season (Week46 to Week6), and the ILI activity remains subdued with percentages well below the national baseline in Weeks40–44, 2020.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the minor fluctuations in ILI counts suggest a relatively stable and low-range activity level. Extrapolating this pattern five weeks forward indicates a steady increase due to the slight upward trajectory near the later weeks, settling at 3284 ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza positivity rates from Weeks40 to Week44, 2020 remain low (0.21% to 0.1%) and far below epidemic thresholds, reflecting reduced influenza spread.
5. Vaccination efforts are emphasized but without notable increases in uptake (Week40–Week44, 2020). This low vaccination impact, combined with stable healthcare norms altered by the COVID-19 pandemic, reduces preventive gains and ILI reporting reliability, possibly influencing the steady upward projection of ILI occurrences.
6. PIC data shows a consistently elevated percentage of deaths (7.0% to 8.1%) above epidemic thresholds (Week40–Week44, 2020), suggesting notable respiratory illness activity, including both influenza and COVID-19, indirectly driving ILI trends.
7. The projected ILI count after 5 weeks (None) at 3284 is justified by the mild upward trend in ILI occurrences, persistent off-season status, CDC reports of limited influenza spread alongside ongoing PIC challenges, and stable virologic conditions. These factors collectively contribute to a modest but steady increase in projected values.
