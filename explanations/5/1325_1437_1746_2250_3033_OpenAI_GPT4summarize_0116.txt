1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks, from Week49, 2021 to Week1, 2022, display a clear increasing trend: ['1325', '1437', '1746', '2250', '3033']. Each week shows progressively higher values, with the largest week-over-week increase of 783 observed between Week52, 2021 (2250) and Week1, 2022 (3033). This steady increase aligns with the ongoing influenza season's intensification during the peak period. However, it is noted that the reported influenza activity slightly declined in Week1, 2022. This decline in positivity rate (3.8% to 2.2%) and related metrics suggests the peak period is nearing an end, indicating a projected downturn into the off-season.
2. Season classification for Week6, 2022: Week6, 2022, falls into the off-season. According to the U.S. influenza season patterns, peak activity typically finishes by Week4 to Week6 of the year. The slight drop in Week1 data, combined with CDC indications of slowed flu increases, signals a transition from the peak to the off-season, where ILI activity will likely drop toward baseline levels.
3. Historically, ILI occurrences display sharp decreases once the influenza peak season concludes. Accounting for seasonal adjustment and using a simple extrapolation method, the data suggests a downward forecast. A linear regression over past ILI occurrences from Week49, 2021 to Week1, 2022, results in identifying recent growth patterns (+112, +309, +504, +783). However, with Week6 falling into the off-season, we anticipate a sharp reduction due to declining viral momentum. From an average reduction rate during off-seasons (usually 60%-65% drop from the peak), a multiplicative decay factor of approximately 0.35 (1-0.65) yields a predicted value from Week1's peak of 3033 × 0.35 ≈ 1063.
4. Three key factors from the summarized CDC reports impact this forecast:
5. a. Influenza activity peaked in Week1, 2022, where positivity rates and ILI-related outpatient visits began to decline (e.g., positivity rate dropped from Week52's 3.8% to 2.2% in Week1; outpatient visits dropped from 4.8% to 4.3%). These decreases align with the end of the peak season and forecast an ongoing reduction into Week6.
6. b. Seasonal effects: Week6, 2022, aligns with the typical off-season timeframe. CDC reports indicate activity is expected to continue decreasing after Week1, with most influenza outbreaks diminishing during this period.
7. c. Vaccination coverage remains lower than previous seasons, and while a contributing factor to the peak, it does not hinder the natural seasonal decline characteristic of off-seasons. The reported antigenic differences within H3N2 strains also suggest strain circulation is less aligned with vaccine-induced immunity after peak periods, further accelerating the off-season dip.
5. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrences for Week6, 2022, of 1063 are derived by applying trend analysis to the past 5 weeks' data, incorporating the influenza seasonality classification into the model, and factoring in CDC-reported diminished flu activity and reduced positivity rates. The sharp decrease corresponds to the transition into the off-season when ILI occurrences typically drop to baseline levels or below.
