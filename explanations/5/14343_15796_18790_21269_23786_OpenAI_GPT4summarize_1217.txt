1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, displaying values of ['14343', '15796', '18790', '21269', '23786']. This represents a steady and significant increase in ILI activity, with a notable rise from 14343 in Week17, 2022, to 23786 in Week21, 2022, indicative of intensifying respiratory illnesses leading up to the end of the observed period.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 14144 (Week26, 2022) exhibits a decline compared to the peak of 23786 in Week21, 2022. This reduction correlates with the gradual tapering off of positivity rates for influenza in the CDC reports, declining from 8.6% in Week18, 2022, to 5.7% in Week21, 2022. Additionally, stable percentages in outpatient visits for ILI (approximately 2.3%-2.4% in Weeks19-21, 2022) and reduced flu activity in clinical and regional settings suggest a waning trend by Week26, 2022.
3. Decreasing clinical lab positivity for influenza, from 7.0% (Week19, 2022) to 5.7% (Week21, 2022), reflects reduced transmission dynamics, directly impacting future ILI trends. Antigenic differences in H3N2 and its associated vaccine mismatch, as outlined in the CDC reports, may have also influenced the partial resurgence of flu cases in certain regions. Additionally, the stabilization of outpatient ILI visits and the minimal incremental rise in cumulative hospitalizations toward the end of this period align with the moderated future ILI activity level.
4. The co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza persisted but remained relatively low across public health lab results (e.g., co-infection rates at 4.4%-4.5% during Weeks19-21, 2022). This continued presence of SARS-CoV-2 likely suppressed influenza activity indirectly, either through overlapping interventions or reduced susceptibility in the population, thereby limiting the extent of ILI surges by Week26, 2022.
5. In summary, the reported 14144 future ILI occurrences (Week26, 2022) can be attributed to the overall upward trend observed in Weeks17-21, 2022, combined with subsequent declines in influenza positivity rates, stabilization of outpatient respiratory illness activity, and moderating influences from co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors collectively explain the transition from a peak in Week21, 2022, to a reduced but still elevated ILI level in Week26, 2022.
