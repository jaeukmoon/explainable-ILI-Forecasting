1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent declining trend, with values decreasing from '1196' (Week26, 2022) to '785' (Week30, 2022). This steady decline in ILI activity indicates a significant waning of respiratory illness-related cases during the observation period, reflecting subdued influenza activity nationwide.
2. A clear negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed. While the past data showed a consistent decrease from Week26, 2022, to Week30, 2022, the future occurrences after 5 weeks (Week35, 2022) rebounded to 566. This indicates a potential inflection point where suppressed ILI activity begins to rise again due to changing epidemiological or environmental factors.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI displayed stable low levels nationwide, ranging between 1.6% and 1.7% over the observed 5 weeks. Despite the minimal variations, the highest percentages were consistently recorded among children aged 0-4 years (7.4% in Week26, 2022, to 6.4% in Week30, 2022), suggesting a persistent demographic vulnerability that may fuel a future increase in ILI cases.
4. Mortality rates due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) were consistently above epidemic thresholds (e.g., 8.8% in Week26, 2022 to 10.0% in Week30, 2022), with most deaths attributed to COVID-19 rather than influenza. This elevated baseline mortality highlights respiratory illness circulation in general, potentially impacting future ILI trends.
5. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens, including COVID-19, RSV, and influenza, was consistently noted in summarized reports, complicating the interpretation of pure influenza trends. The low influenza positivity rates (ranging from 0.7% to 0.5%) may signify underreporting or overlap with other pathogens that collectively reinforced ILI occurrences in future weeks.
6. In summary, the reported 566 future ILI occurrences (Week35, 2022) can be attributed to the confluence of factors, including the steady decline in past ILI cases indicating a lull before resurgence, sustained elevated PIC mortality levels, persistent high ILI rates among children, and the confounding impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses. These combined elements reflect shifting respiratory illness dynamics contributing to the observed rebound after Week30, 2022.
