1. The ILI occurrences from Week23 to Week27, 2024, show a clear declining trend: 1119, 924, 879, 835, and 727. This represents a continuous decrease, with ILI numbers dropping by approximately 10%-20% per week. The significant and consistent reduction reflects reduced influenza spread or activity over the observed period. No significant spikes or fluctuations are present in the past five weeks.
2. In the context of U.S. influenza patterns, Week32, 2024, falls at the transition from the off-season to the peak onset season. Given that Week31, 2024, generally corresponds to the end of the off-season and Week32 signals the beginning of rising baseline ILI levels, Week32, 2024, is forecasted to belong to the peak onset season.
3. From the time-series perspective, the declining trend from Week23 to Week27, 2024, suggests continued declining or stabilizing ILI activity. However, seasonal characteristics indicate a shift towards gradual increases around Week32, 2024, as it marks the peak onset season. Therefore, while still below peak levels, the projection reflects a modest rebound. Based on time-series forecasting, this translates to 774 occurrences, which aligns with entering the lower range of seasonal growth during the peak onset transition.
4. Influenza positivity remains low, with consistent declines evident over the five-week period, from 1.6% (Week23, 2024) to 0.9% (Week27, 2024). This low positivity directly correlates to the reduced ILI occurrences but sets a foundation for potential increases as the peak onset season begins. (Week23, 2024 #1; Week27, 2024 #1).
5. High vaccine strain similarity to circulating subtypes across Weeks23 to Week27, 2024, indicates well-matched protection and minimal vaccination coverage change, supporting controlled ILI levels but projecting typical seasonal adjustments as population immunity shifts. (Week23, 2024 #5; Week27, 2024 #7).
6. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and RSV along with influenza has remained stable without significant surges (Week23, 2024 #10; Week27, 2024 #9). This stability helps reduce unusual spikes but maintains baseline respiratory activity that contributes to the ILI level expected in Week32, 2024.
7. The prediction of 774 ILI occurrences for Week32, 2024, is supported by the observed declining trajectory over the past weeks, the beginning of the peak onset season, and the interplay of low influenza positivity, vaccine-aligned protection, and stable co-circulation of respiratory viruses. Together, these factors justify a modest rebound consistent with typical early-season activity.
