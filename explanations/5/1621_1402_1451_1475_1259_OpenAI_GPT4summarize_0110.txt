1. The reported ILI counts from Week51, 2020 to Week2, 2021 are 1621, 1402, 1451, 1475, and 1259. The trend primarily demonstrates a consistent decline across the observed weeks, from 1621 in Week51, 2020 to 1259 by Week2, 2021, with minor fluctuations. This denotes a gradual reduction in ILI activity during this period, indicating sustained overall low levels.
2. Based on U.S. influenza patterns, Week7, 2021 falls at the end of the typical peak season window (Week46, 2020 to Week6, 2021). However, given the uncharacteristically low ILI activity and influenza positivity rates as reported in Week51, 2020 through Week2, 2021 (#1, Week51, 2020; #1, Week52, 2020; #1, Week1, 2021), Week7, 2021 is more congruently categorized as the off-season.
3. Time-series correlation suggests ILI occurrences follow a declining pattern as shown in past levels from Week51, 2020 (1621) through Week2, 2021 (1259). Projecting forward five weeks, this trend indicates continued low ILI activity with a stabilization point, leading to the forecast of 559 cases for Week7, 2021. This aligns with the observed steady decline and historical off-season patterns.
4. Influenza positivity rates remain very low (0.1%-0.4%) during these weeks compared to typical seasonal expectations, with suppressed transmission reported due to concurrent COVID-19 pandemic influences and altered healthcare-seeking behaviors (#9, Week51, 2020; #10, Week53, 2020; #9, Week1, 2021; #9, Week2, 2021). These factors indicate minimal ILI activity in the forecast period.
5. The number of reported respiratory outpatient visits attributable to ILI is stable but far below the baseline of 2.6%, decreasing from 1.6% in Week51, 2020 to 1.4% in Week2, 2021 (#3, Week51, 2020; #4, Week2, 2021). This sustained low ILI outpatient activity further supports the low forecast.
6. No significant changes in influenza virulence, novel variants, or strain circulation are noted, with the predominant strain (A(H1N1)pdm09) circulating minimally (#3, Week53, 2020; #3, Week1, 2021). Additionally, national vaccination campaigns remain ongoing, further bolstering protection against widespread flu transmission (#7, Week51, 2020; #8, Week53, 2020).
7. In summary, the low historical ILI trends, off-season classification, reduced outpatient ILI visits, minimal virologic positivity, and suppressed transmission due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic collectively justify a projected value of 559 ILI occurrences in Week7, 2021.
