1. The reported ILI counts from Week34 to Week38, 2024 are 1047, 1328, 1257, 1291, and 1219. The data show an initial sharp increase from Week34 (1047) to Week35 (1328), followed by mild decreases with fluctuations. This pattern indicates a short-term peak around Week35, followed by slight declines but overall stable trends without significant surges or declines.
2. Week43, 2024, belongs to the Peak onset season. Based on U.S. season classifications, the Peak onset season typically occurs from Week32 or 35 to Week46. The ongoing low-to-moderate activity levels and increasing trends seen earlier in the dataset align with this phase.
3. From a time-series perspective, the pattern in past weeks suggests slight fluctuations with no consistent upward or downward trajectory. The occurrence for Week43, 2024, can be projected based on similar stable trends during Peak onset phases in previous years. Therefore, projecting a value of 1378 aligns with this baseline and reflects anticipated marginal increases during this period.
4. Influenza activity levels remain low nationally, with only 0.4% of respiratory specimens testing positive each week (Week34, 2024 #1; Week35, 2024 #1; Week37, 2024 #1). Despite this, co-circulation of several respiratory viruses (Week35, 2024 #10; Week36, 2024 #10; Week37, 2024 #7) could contribute to increased outpatient ILI visits and slight rises in overall cases.
5. Antigenic compatibility between circulating influenza strains and vaccines remains high (>95%) (Week34, 2024 #8; Week36, 2024 #8; Week38, 2024 #8), providing partial protection that may moderate a potential surge in influenza. However, vaccination uptake trends have not shown significant increases, with coverage possibly limited (Week34, 2024 #10; Week37, 2024 #8; Week38, 2024 #9).
6. While no significant spikes in influenza hospitalizations or deaths have occurred, co-circulation of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and RSV (Week36, 2024 #10; Week37, 2024 #7; Week38, 2024 #8) could slightly elevate ILI activity, particularly for younger populations, as seen with increasing outpatient visits in the 0–24 age group (Week34, 2024 #4; Week37, 2024 #3; Week38, 2024 #10).
7. Combining the stable baseline trend, ongoing low positivity rates, vaccine compatibility, and influences of co-circulating respiratory viruses, the forecast of 1378 for Week43, 2024, is reasonable. This value reflects slight increases expected during the Peak onset season, consistent with comparable historical cycles and the current epidemiological context.
