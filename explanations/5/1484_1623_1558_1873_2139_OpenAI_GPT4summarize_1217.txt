1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over 5 weeks showed an overall upward trend, with values of ['1484', '1623', '1558', '1873', '2139']. There was a rise from 1484 (Week42, 2020) to 1623 (Week43, 2020), a slight decrease to 1558 (Week44, 2020), followed by a sharp increase to 1873 (Week45, 2020) and peaking at 2139 (Week46, 2020). This overall escalation indicates increasing ILI activity during this 5-week period.
2. There is a strong positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the significant climb during the last two weeks (Weeks 45–46, 2020) aligns with the subsequent reported rise to 1994 occurrences 5 weeks later. The peak at Week46, 2020, suggests sustained or intensified ILI activity leading into the future period.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased steadily, from 1.2% (Week42, 2020) to 1.5% (Week46, 2020), with one region surpassing its baseline during Week45, 2020. This gradual rise in ILI-related healthcare visits reflects higher respiratory illness prevalence, contributing to the future increase in ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths attributable to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained significantly elevated across the 5-week period, rising from 7.6% (Week42, 2020) to 10.7% (Week46, 2020), surpassing epidemic thresholds every week. This consistent PIC mortality indicates increased respiratory illness activity parallel to the measurable ILI surge.
5. The COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI surveillance disrupted traditional reporting, complicating accurate trends. However, these disruptions, combined with heightened alertness to respiratory symptoms, likely fueled increased recognition and reporting of ILI cases, correlating with the rise to 1994 occurrences.
6. Despite persistently low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.3% in Week42, 2020, declining to 0.2% by Week46, 2020) and limited lab detections, growing ILI trends suggest an effect from non-specific respiratory illnesses or alternate pathogens. Simultaneous monitoring of influenza and COVID-19 likely amplified ILI surveillance metrics leading into the future period.
7. In summary, the reported 1994 future ILI occurrences (5 weeks after Week46, 2020) result from the sustained upward trend in Weeks 45–46, 2020, increasing outpatient visits for ILI, persistent PIC mortality above thresholds, and pandemic-induced healthcare behaviors amplifying recognition and reporting of respiratory illnesses.
