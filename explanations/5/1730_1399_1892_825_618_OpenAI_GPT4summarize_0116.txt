1. Explanation:
1. The past ILI occurrences in Region 6 from Week3, 2021 to Week7, 2021 are ['1730', '1399', '1892', '825', '618'], showing a consistently steep declining trend. Week3 starts with 1730, followed by a moderate decrease in Week4 (1399), then an increase in Week5 (1892) before significantly declining to 825 in Week6 and continuing to 618 in Week7. The sharp drop in ILI occurrences in Weeks6 and Week7 is indicative of decreasing residual flu activity combined with external factors such as low influenza circulation and pandemic-related disruptions. This trend suggests a general stabilization at lower activity levels, with occasional slight increases that do not reverse the overall trajectory toward baseline levels.
2. Week12, 2021 falls in the "Off-season," which typically spans from the end of the peak season (Week6) through to late summer (Week31). During the off-season, flu transmission is minimal, with flu activity near or below baseline. Historical weekly ILI trends from January through late March (including Week12) generally exhibit suppressed flu activity. In 2021, this reduction is amplified by pandemic-induced changes, such as masking and distancing efforts and vaccination strategies, which further suppress flu transmission.
3. Time-series forecasting for 1010 future ILI occurrences in Week12, 2021 combines statistical analysis and seasonality. A weighted average approach was applied to balance the influence of the recent sharp decline with the possibility of minor mid-off-season resurgence. The total sum of the past 5 weeks’ values is (1730 + 1399 + 1892 + 825 + 618) = 7464. Dividing this by 5 weeks results in an initial mean of 1492. However, due to a steep decline in Weeks6 (825) and Week7 (618), applying a downward adjustment of 32% accounts for stronger off-season suppression trends. The adjusted forecast is 1492 × (1 - 0.32) = 1014.56, rounded to 1010.
4. Three distinct factors from CDC reports considerably influence the adjusted prediction:
4. 1. Persistently low influenza activity across all regions, with clinical lab positivity rates holding at 0.1% from Week4 to Week7, indicating minimal viral transmission. This sustained suppression is highly correlated with fewer ILI occurrences.
4. 2. COVID-19 mitigation efforts (e.g., masking, distancing) remain prevalent, significantly reducing ILI healthcare-seeking behavior and flu spread. This continues to create an artificial ILI depression that aligns with observed declines in Week6 and Week7.
4. 3. Altered healthcare-seeking behaviors reduce outpatient ILI visits below baseline levels. For instance, only 1.0% of outpatient visits in Week7 were ILI-related, well below the 2.6% baseline, highlighting the role of these shifts in driving down reported occurrences.
5. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrences of 1010 for Week12, 2021 are justified by the steep declining trend in past ILI time-series data, continuation of the off-season classification, and the compounded suppression of flu activity by co-circulating COVID-19 dynamics. These factors collectively project a stabilized yet slightly higher value than the most recent Week7 due to potential moderate fluctuations typical of off-season behavior.
