1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall upward trend, with values of ['10818', '10927', '11143', '11971', '14072']. Starting from 10818 in Week 30, 2024, the occurrences gradually increased each week, with a sharp rise from 11971 in Week 33, 2024, to 14072 in Week 34, 2024, indicating a marked growth in ILI activity over the observed period.
2. The positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident as the steady increase in Weeks 30–34, 2024, culminates in a significant rise to 13346 occurrences 5 weeks later (Week 39, 2024). The sharp incline in Week 34, 2024, particularly aligns with the elevated future ILI activity.
3. Outpatient ILI visits remained below the national baseline but showed a slight increase from 1.5% in Weeks 30–33, 2024, to 1.8% in Week 34, 2024. This upward shift in outpatient visits reflects rising respiratory illness activity, potentially contributing to the future ILI increase.
4. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and influenza, was reported consistently across Weeks 30–34, 2024, complicating ILI trends and potentially amplifying the increase in future ILI occurrences.
5. Slightly elevated influenza-related metrics, such as increased pediatric deaths from 188 (Week 30, 2024) to 195 (Week 34, 2024), and stable virologic trends with minimal resistance to antivirals, may have influenced the rise in ILI occurrences, though overall flu activity remained low.
6. In summary, the reported 13346 future ILI occurrences (Week 39, 2024) can be attributed to the sustained upward trend in Weeks 30–34, 2024, the subtle increase in outpatient ILI visits, co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens, and the interplay of slight elevations in influenza-related indicators amidst a low influenza season.
