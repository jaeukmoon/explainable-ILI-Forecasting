1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed variability but no clear directional trend, with values of ['1816', '1843', '1831', '2025', '1777']. While there was a notable increase from 1831 (Week19, 2021) to 2025 (Week20, 2021), this was followed by a decline to 1777 in Week21, 2021. This lack of consistent upward or downward movement highlights fluctuating but subdued ILI activity during this period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences exists, as the high peak of 2025 in Week20, 2021, and the subsequent drop to 1777 in Week21, 2021, align with a moderate resurgence to 2237 occurrences after 5 weeks. This suggests delayed effects of fluctuating ILI patterns contributing to future activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI exhibited slight increases, from 1.1% (Week17, 2021) to 1.3% (Week20, 2021), before dipping again to 1.1% (Week21, 2021). This subtle fluctuation in healthcare-seeking behavior for ILI reflects dynamic but relatively stable respiratory illness activity during those weeks, a factor likely impacting the future uptick.
4. Consistently elevated percentages of deaths associated with pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) were observed, remaining above epidemic thresholds in all weeks (e.g., 9.5% in Week20, 2021, and 8.3% in Week21, 2021). Such sustained PIC mortality suggests broader respiratory illness activity that may have contributed to future ILI occurrences.
5. The persisting low influenza virus positivity rates, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive in Weeks17–21, 2021, coupled with minimal lab-detected cases, indicate that future ILI occurrences are likely attributable to other respiratory pathogens or non-specific illnesses rather than influenza.
6. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted throughout the CDC reports, disrupted traditional patterns of ILI reporting and surveillance. These disruptions may have caused concentrated and delayed ILI reporting, aligning with the observed rise to 2237 cases.
7. In summary, the reported 2237 future ILI occurrences (Week26, 2021) mainly stem from the fluctuating ILI activity in Weeks19–20, 2021, slight increases in ILI outpatient visits, sustained PIC mortality peaking above epidemic thresholds, pandemic-related surveillance challenges, and contributions from non-influenza respiratory illnesses.
