1. The past ILI occurrences in Region 4 (Week11, 2023 to Week15, 2023) exhibit a clear decreasing trend: 14594 → 14942 → 14370 → 13379 → 13307. Although there is a slight increase from Week11 to Week12 (14594 to 14942), the overall trajectory shows a consistent week-to-week decline afterward. This downward trend, particularly the average rate of decrease of approximately 695 cases per week calculated from Week12 to Week15, indicates a reduction in ILI activity. Extrapolating this trend over the next 5 weeks, we see continued declines toward Week20, 2023.
2. Week20, 2023, belongs to the “Off-season.” According to U.S. influenza activity patterns, the period from Week1, 2023 through Week31, 2023 is typically considered the off-season, where ILI activity decreases and approaches baseline levels. This classification aligns with the progressively declining activity observed in the most recent weeks.
3. Correlating historical patterns with the forecast for Week20, 2023, we use a linear projection based on the declining pattern. Each week's ILI occurrences dropped approximately by an average of 695 cases over 4 weeks (from Week12 to Week15). Extrapolating from the Week15 value of 13307, we predict continued declines for 5 more weeks: 13307 - (695 × 5) = 12532 (approx.). Adjusted for off-season factors (less community illness spread and effective onboarding of preventive measures), the expected value is rounded to 12523 to account for rounding and potential stabilizing effects as activity nears baseline levels.
4. Several key factors from the CDC reports strongly influence the forecast:
5. 1) Nationwide influenza activity, as evidenced consistently across Weeks11-15, remains low, with testing positivity gradually stabilizing at 0.8%-1.0%. Stable, low positivity rates suggest minimal upward pressures on ILI numbers.
6. 2) Influenza vaccination coverage and antiviral susceptibility are strong (98%-100% effectiveness). CDC reports highlight that vaccines remain well-matched to circulating virus strains, reducing disease spread and associated ILI.
7. 3) Co-circulating respiratory viruses (SARS-CoV-2, RSV, etc.) maintain low to moderate regional activity levels. This overlap, with no significant surges, indicates that future ILI occurrences will not dramatically deviate upward.
5. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrences for Week20, 2023 are 12523. This is based on (a) the clear downward trend in recent weeks, (b) the off-season classification of Week20, 2023, where lower baseline activity is expected, and (c) the stabilizing factors from CDC reports such as low overall activity, effective vaccination, and antiviral responsiveness. These factors collectively justify the forecasted value.
