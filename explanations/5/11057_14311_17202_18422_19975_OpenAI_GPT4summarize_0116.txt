1. Explanation:
1. The past 5 weeks' ILI occurrences in Region 4 (Week28, 2021 to Week32, 2021) were ['11057', '14311', '17202', '18422', '19975'], showing a clear increasing trend week-over-week with a steadily growing rate of change: Week28 to Week29 demonstrates a growth of 29.4% [(14311-11057)/11057*100], Week29 to Week30 a growth of 20.2% [(17202-14311)/14311*100], Week30 to Week31 a growth of 7.1% [(18422-17202)/17202*100], and Week31 to Week32 a growth of 8.4% [(19975-18422)/18422*100]. However, the rate of increase steadily decreases, suggesting a slowing trend potentially indicative of a turning point in ILI activity soon. This flattening of the growth rate aligns with seasonal trends, which will influence the Week37 forecast as the ILI activity transitions into a stabilizing period.
2. The target week, Week37, 2021, falls under the "Peak onset season," based on the defined flu season classifications. In the U.S., the "Peak onset season" generally spans Week32 to Week46, where ILI activity begins increasing from baseline levels. The pattern of increasing ILI activity over the last five weeks further confirms that this period matches the early upward trend typical of the Peak onset season.
3. To predict the Week37 ILI occurrences based on past trends, we apply the historical data's slowing growth rates, given the Peak onset season context. Starting with Week28 to Week32 data, we calculate the average percentage growth over these five weeks [(29.4%+20.2%+7.1%+8.4%)/4 ≈ 16.28%], but given the late onset of declines in growth rates, the trend approaching Week37 suggests negative growth. CDC reports indicate minimal influenza activity, low virologic circulation, and dominant influences from non-influenza respiratory illnesses, pointing towards stabilization or reduction trends. For Week37, we assume a significant negative growth aligned with flu activity stabilization in this Peak onset season, indicating a drop compared to Week32. Applying a conservative reduction rate of approximately -35% (adjustment based on slowing growth and external CDC factors), we calculate: 19975 - (19975 * 0.35) = 12979. This accounts for the decreasing trend and incorporates the general slowing flu activity dynamics described transitionally by CDC.
4. Three factors from the CDC reports strongly influence this forecast for Week37, 2021:
5. 1) Virologic surveillance indicates continued minimal influenza circulation with no clear Influenza A or B dominance through Week32, 2021, implying that flu-driven increases in ILI cases are unlikely to sustain. While ILI rises have been observed recently, they are attributed to non-influenza causes (e.g., COVID-19, other respiratory viruses), reinforcing stabilizing ILI patterns.
6. 2) Outpatient ILI visits across all age groups have increased slightly between Week28 and Week32 (from 1.3% to 2.1%), but the figures remain below the national baseline of 2.6%, denoting an early transition phase dominated by respiratory illnesses not driven by influenza. This promotes slower ILI activity growth moving towards stabilization or decline in cases.
7. 3) Emerging novel influenza cases (e.g., Influenza A(H1N2)v) reported in Week32 indicate potential localized spikes, but limited human-to-human transmission and close monitoring suggest this will have little-to-no major influence on broader trends.
5. In summary, the predicted 12979 ILI occurrences for Week37, 2021, result from an analysis of the decreasing growth rate of ILI occurrences in the prior weeks, the seasonal classification of the target week as a Peak onset season period, and CDC indicators of minimal flu and virologic activity. Despite an initial rise in respiratory illness visits, these are predominantly associated with non-influenza causes, pushing the ILI forecast towards stabilization or modest reduction. A 35% decrease from Week32 levels aligns with these observations, yielding the final prediction of 12979.
