1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week33, 2021 to Week37, 2021) show a pattern of initial increase followed by a slight dip: ['1040', '1101', '1255', '1305', '1189']. The values increased steadily from Week33 to Week36, peaking at 1305 during Week36, before decreasing to 1189 in Week37. This indicates a fluctuating trend, with a potential peak reached around Week36 and a subsequent decline. To forecast Week42, we apply a combination of linear trend analysis and external factors derived from the CDC reports.
2. Season classification for Week42, 2021: Based on Background Knowledge, Week42 falls into the "Peak onset season," which generally spans Weeks 32 to 46 before the actual peak flu season. During the Peak onset season, ILI activity typically begins to increase from baseline levels due to heightened respiratory virus circulation, including influenza. However, this activity remains contingent on contributing factors such as vaccination coverage, virus emergence, and respiratory viral interference.
3. A correlation analysis of the historical time-series trend and seasonality highlights a gradual buildup of ILI activity with fluctuation rather than sustained growth. Analyzing the mean weekly change of the dataset:
4. - Week34 to Week33: (1101 - 1040) = +61
5. - Week35 to Week34: (1255 - 1101) = +154
6. - Week36 to Week35: (1305 - 1255) = +50
7. - Week37 to Week36: (1189 - 1305) = -116
8. The average weekly change is (61 + 154 + 50 - 116)/4 = +37.25. Projecting this to five weeks of gradual deceleration as seen in Peak onset seasons, we adjust the mean growth negatively by 40% due to CDC trends indicating low influenza transmission. Thus, expected weekly change ≈ +37.25 * (1 - 0.4) ≈ +22. Forecasting Week42: 1189 + (22 * 5) = 1299. However, external CDC factors discussed below reduce this value.
4. Three factors from summarized CDC reports supporting the forecast adjustment:
5. 1) Minimal influenza circulation: Reports (e.g., Week37, 2021) confirm that influenza transmission remains low nationwide, with specimens testing positive for influenza at a rate of only 0.1%-0.3%. This reduces the likelihood of a strong upward trend, pushing the forecast down by 25%. New projection: 1299 * (1 - 0.25) = 974.
6. 2) Interference from non-influenza respiratory viruses: CDC reports (Week33-Week37, 2021) consistently highlight increases in ILI attributed to respiratory viruses like COVID-19 rather than influenza. This likely contributed to fluctuations but limits the potential for sustained growth. We decrease the forecast by an additional 0.5%. New projection: 974 * (1 - 0.005) ≈ 969.
7. 3) Changed healthcare-seeking patterns: The pandemic heavily influenced healthcare access and ILI reporting trends, introducing potential underreporting or noise in the system. These adjustments support a stable projection at 969 without further significant uptrends or volatility.
5. Based on observed trends, season classification, historical data correlation, and external CDC factors, the forecast for ILI occurrences after five weeks (Week42, 2021) in Region 7 is **969**. The fluctuating trend, coupled with low influenza activity, high COVID-19 interference, and healthcare disruptions, supports this stable projection.
