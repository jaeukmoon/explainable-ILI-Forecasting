1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1119', '924', '879', '835', '727']. Starting from 1119 (Week23, 2024), there is a steady decline each week, reaching the lowest at 727 in Week27, 2024. This trend indicates a notable reduction in ILI activity over the observed period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the decreasing trend in past data (Week23-Week27, 2024) contrasts with the stabilization of occurrences at 774 after 5 weeks. While the declines in Weeks 23–27 appear significant, the future trend suggests that ILI activity plateaus later due to localized or external factors not captured in the immediate trend.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness remained consistently below the baseline throughout Weeks 23–27, declining from 1.7% (Week23, 2024) to 1.4% (Week27, 2024). This below-baseline outpatient activity aligns with the subdued future occurrences (774).
4. Laboratory reports showed a persistent decrease in influenza positivity rates, from 1.6% (Week23) to 0.9% (Week27), with Influenza A dominating across all weeks. The low positivity points toward diminished ILI activity contributing to the stabilized future occurrences.
5. Hospitalization rates for influenza remained extremely low, ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 per 100,000 population (Weeks23–27, 2024), indicating minimal severe illness. The stability in this metric correlates strongly with the future ILI occurrences, which do not show a resurgence.
6. Deaths due to influenza, reported as 0.1% in mortality throughout Weeks23–27, did not exhibit significant changes or spikes. This stability in mortality further supports the modest level of future ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 774 future ILI occurrences can be attributed to the sustained decline observed in Weeks23–27, 2024, supported by minimal outpatient visits, low influenza positivity, stable hospitalization rates, and unchanged influenza-attributed mortality.
