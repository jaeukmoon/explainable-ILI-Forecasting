1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1887', '1889', '1978', '2037', '2067']. The increase from 1887 (Week37, 2021) to 2067 (Week41, 2021) indicates a steady rise in ILI activity, with the highest recorded value in Week41, 2021. This pattern reflects a gradual escalation in respiratory illness activity, likely influenced by seasonal dynamics or non-influenza respiratory agents.
2. A strong positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the consistent rise during the past 5 weeks (Weeks37–41, 2021) aligns with the reported future increase to 2658 occurrences by Week46, 2021. The upward momentum in the past data suggests a predictive trajectory leading to amplified ILI occurrences in the future period.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed steady percentages below the national baseline, ranging from 2.1% (Week37, 2021) to 1.8% (Week41, 2021). Despite being below the threshold, the sustained proportion of ILI-related visits indicates persistent respiratory illness activity, contributing to the observed future increase.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained significantly high, from 21.1% (Week37, 2021) to 17.5% (Week41, 2021), surpassing epidemic thresholds across all weeks. COVID-19 served as a primary contributor, but this consistently high PIC percentage suggests substantial respiratory illness burdens, potentially fueling future ILI occurrences.
5. Minimal influenza virus detection (e.g., 0.1% lab positivity in Weeks40–41, 2021) and low influenza circulation during this period indicate that increases in ILI are mainly attributable to other respiratory viruses. These parallel non-influenza respiratory pathogen trends likely amplified ILI activity and paved the way for the observed surge to 2658 future occurrences.
6. Additional influences included shifts in healthcare-seeking behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as highlighted weekly. These behavioral changes disrupted traditional ILI surveillance, potentially underestimating early counts and concentrating future ILI reporting.
7. In summary, the future ILI rise to 2658 (Week46, 2021) is explained by the upward trend in Weeks37–41, stable ILI-related outpatient visit percentages, persistently high PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, contributions from non-influenza respiratory viruses, and pandemic-induced alterations in healthcare-seeking patterns affecting surveillance data reliability.
