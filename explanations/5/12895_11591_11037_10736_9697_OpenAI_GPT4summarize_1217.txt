1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, starting at 12895 (Week 6, 2024) and decreasing sequentially to 11591 (Week 7, 2024), 11037 (Week 8, 2024), 10736 (Week 9, 2024), and finally 9697 (Week 10, 2024). This downward trend reflects a steady reduction in ILI activity over this period.
2. A clear negative correlation emerges between past and future ILI occurrences, where the consistent week-by-week decline in ILI activity indicated by Weeks 6–10, 2024, aligns with the sharp drop to 7569 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 15, 2024). The continuation of this downward trajectory emphasizes that the past decreasing trend strongly predicts the reduced future value.
3. The summarized reports highlight multiple factors contributing to this decline: 1) National outpatient visits for ILI steadily decreased from 4.5% (Week 6, 2024) to 3.7% (Week 10, 2024), reflecting reduced clinical illness activity. 2) The cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rate, while predominantly impacting vulnerable populations (e.g., adults aged 65+), showed stabilization and then a slight decline from 67.9 per 100,000 (Week 10, 2024). 3) Regional influenza positivity rates in clinical labs decreased over 5 weeks to 15.4% (Week 10, 2024), further signaling reduced flu circulation.
4. Lower pediatric mortality trends in Week 10, 2024, reflected by the moderate rise in total deaths (116 this season), paired with decreased hospitalizations for Influenza B, indicate improving health outcomes and a reduction in severe cases contributing to ILI counts nationally.
5. In summary, the reduction to 7569 future ILI occurrences by Week 15, 2024, stems from the ongoing week-by-week decline in past ILI occurrences, reduced outpatient visits for ILI, decreased flu positivity and hospitalizations, and improving health indicators such as mitigated pediatric mortality burden. Together, these factors contributed to the sustained contraction in influenza activity nationally.
