1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a clear downward trend, with values decreasing systematically from 1002 (Week 13, 2022) to 868 (Week 17, 2022). This steady decline suggests reduced influenza or ILI activity over the period, possibly indicative of effective mitigation measures or natural declines in transmission.

2. The future ILI occurrence of 689 (Week 22, 2022) aligns with the observed downward trajectory in the past data. The continual drop from Week 13 to Week 17, 2022, implies sustained reduction in ILI activity, with decreasing weekly trends serving as precursors to the low future occurrence recorded 5 weeks later.

3. Influenza positivity rates, although relatively stable, decreased from 8.9% in Week 15 to 8.1% in Week 17, 2022. This decline, alongside stable or declining outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses (2.1% in Weeks 15–16, 2022, and 2.2% in Week 17, 2022), reflects reduced influenza transmission, potentially correlating with the lower future ILI occurrence.

4. Mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) also decreased, dropping from 7.1% in Week 15 to 7.2% in Week 17, 2022, nearing or slightly above the epidemic threshold of 6.9%. This stable or declining trend suggests reduced severity of respiratory illnesses, contributing to the subsequent decline in ILI occurrences.

5. Regional differences in influenza activity and ongoing vaccination efforts were highlighted in CDC reports. Declining hospitalization rates for influenza (e.g., Week 17 hospital admissions of 3,070, down from Week 16’s 3,243) also signify improving conditions that are consistent with reduced cases reflected in future ILI data.

6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 689 (Week 22, 2022) can be attributed to the consistent downward trend in past ILI occurrences (Weeks 13–17, 2022), coupled with decreasing influenza positivity rates, stable or reduced PIC mortality, and declining hospitalization trends, all contributing to reduced ILI activity over time.
