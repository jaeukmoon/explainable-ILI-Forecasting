1. The reported ILI counts from Week33 to Week37, 2023 are 2106, 3088, 4133, 3514, and 3455. The ILI trend increased sharply from Week33 (2106) to Week35 (4133), followed by a slight decline to Week37 (3455). This pattern indicates significant early growth in ILI activity during Week33 to Week35, 2023, potentially signaling the start of seasonal onset, with slight fluctuation afterward.
2. Week42, 2023 falls within the peak onset season (Week35 to Week46), as defined by U.S. influenza seasonality. The gradual rise in ILI trends (Week33 to Week37, 2023 #1-#3) and low positivity rates for influenza align with the typical characteristics of the peak onset period, where activity builds steadily toward the peak season.
3. From the time-series perspective, the sharp increase in ILI reports during Week33 to Week35, 2023 suggests that future ILI occurrences could experience further growth. However, the subsequent stabilization from Week36 (3514) to Week37 (3455), coupled with the typical seasonal dynamics during the peak onset period, supports a projected moderate increase in ILI occurrences, resulting in the forecasted value of 4761 for Week42, 2023.
4. The presence of a novel Influenza A(H1N2)v case reported in Week33, 2023 (Week33, 2023 #3) and Week37, 2023 (Week37, 2023 #3), although isolated, highlights potential risks for sporadic increases in ILI due to emerging variants, despite no evidence of person-to-person spread.
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses such as COVID-19 and RSV, alongside influenza, continues to influence ILI activity and is evident across all weeks (Week33-Week37, 2023 #10). The mixed viral contribution to ILI patterns complicates predictions but leans toward sustained or slightly rising activity levels.
6. Outpatient respiratory illness visits have gradually increased to 2.0% by Week37, 2023, with significant contributions among children aged 0–4 (Week37, 2023 #6). This higher rate of illness visits, particularly in younger populations, reflects a growing spread of respiratory illnesses, correlating with the expected increase in ILI activity.
7. The forecast of 4761 for Week42, 2023 is supported by the early upward trend in ILI reports from Week33 to Week35, 2023, ongoing low influenza positivity with co-circulating respiratory viruses, increased outpatient visits, and alignment with peak onset season dynamics. Together, these factors suggest a moderate continuation of rising trends, leading to the projected value.
