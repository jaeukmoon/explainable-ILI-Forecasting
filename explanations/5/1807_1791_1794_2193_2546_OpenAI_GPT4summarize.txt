1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show a significant upward trend, moving from 1807 (Week 24, 2021) to 2546 (Week 28, 2021), with a notable spike in the final two weeks (Week 27: 2193; Week 28: 2546). This escalating increase suggests a rise in respiratory illness activity as the period progresses.

2. The positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the pronounced increase in the latter weeks of the observed data (Week 27–28, 2021) aligns with the reported sharp rise to 3400 future occurrences (Week 33, 2021). This rising trajectory in the past weeks acts as a precursor for the amplified ILI activity observed after 5 weeks.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI demonstrated slight but consistent increases during the observed weeks, starting at 1.2% (Week 24–26, 2021) and rising to 1.3% (Week 27–28, 2021). While remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%, this growth signifies expanding healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory-related illnesses, contributing to the future rise in ILI occurrences.

4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold during the observed period (6.6% in Week 25 to 7.1% in Week 28, 2021), with COVID-19 as the major contributor. This persistent respiratory disease burden reflects heightened activity and aligns with the future increase in ILI occurrences.

5. The influence of COVID-19-related disruptions to healthcare utilization and monitoring systems, documented throughout the CDC reports, likely contributed to underreported or delayed cases during the observed weeks. These disruptions, coupled with alternative care settings, likely concentrated ILI cases and steered the subsequent future rise.

6. Minimal influenza virus circulation was detected, with positivity rates of ≤0.1% (Week 24–28, 2021), yet the escalation in ILI occurrences points to broader contributions from other respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and non-influenza-related ILI cases. Behavioral dynamics during the pandemic likely increased the future concentration of ILI activity.

7. In summary, the reported 3400 future ILI occurrences (Week 33, 2021) can be attributed to the clear upward trajectory in Weeks 27–28, 2021, increasing ILI-related outpatient visits, sustained PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, and compounding pandemic-induced healthcare and surveillance disruptions, coupled with contributions from non-influenza respiratory illnesses.
