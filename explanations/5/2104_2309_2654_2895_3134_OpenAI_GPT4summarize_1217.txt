1. The past time-series ILI occurrences for the 5 weeks demonstrate a consistent upward trend, evidenced by the values ['2104', '2309', '2654', '2895', '3134']. Starting from 2104 in Week15, 2022, the weekly counts increased steadily, reaching a peak of 3134 in Week19, 2022. This progressive rise indicates a sustained escalation in ILI activity over this period, creating momentum for future increases.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the continuous increase during the past weeks culminates in 3134 (Week19, 2022), directly preceding the future ILI count of 2906 after 5 weeks in Week24, 2022. The proximity of the peak value in the time series reflects a likely tapering effect in ILI counts instead of a sharp decline after the observed maximum.
3. Weekly outpatient visit percentages for respiratory illnesses progressively rose, starting at 2.1% (Week15, 2022) and climbing to 2.4% (Week19, 2022). This steady increase highlights expanding respiratory illness activity during the past weeks, significantly contributing to the sustained ILI numbers reported in Week24, 2022. Rising hospitalizations, increasing from 9.8 per 100,000 population (Week15, 2022) to 14.4 per 100,000 (Week19, 2022), signal heightened severe illness, aligning with the observed future ILI occurrences. PIC-attributed deaths remained persistently above the epidemic threshold, growing from 7.1% (Week15, 2022) to 7.5% (Week19, 2022), reinforcing elevated respiratory illness activity during this surveillance period. The widespread dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) throughout this period (≥98.8% positivity each week) contributed to the rising trends in ILI-related illnesses, sustaining elevated activity in subsequent occurrences.
4. While the cumulative ILI activity peaked during Week19, 2022, the continued effects of persistent influenza transmission, rising respiratory illness percentages, and co-contributing factors such as hospitalization trends explain the elevated future occurrence of 2906 ILI cases. These factors collectively align with the observed trajectories leading up to Week24, 2022.
