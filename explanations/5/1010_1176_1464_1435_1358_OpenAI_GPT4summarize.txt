1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an oscillating trend, peaking in Week 14, 2021, at 1464 before declining to 1358 in Week 16, 2021. The weekly values are as follows: 1010 (Week 12, 2021), 1176 (Week 13, 2021), 1464 (Week 14, 2021), 1435 (Week 15, 2021), and 1358 (Week 16, 2021). While ILI occurrences initially increased steadily over the first three weeks, the subsequent decline in the final weeks suggests variability in illness activity influenced by external factors.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent in the data, as the higher peak seen in Week 14, 2021, at 1464 serves as a key turning point for future trends. Although ILI occurrences decreased slightly in subsequent weeks, the increase during Week 12–14 creates momentum that aligns with the substantial rise to 1789 future occurrences by Week 21, 2021. This suggests that elevated activity in earlier weeks played a crucial role in influencing future trends.

3. Several factors in the summarized CDC reports appear correlated with the rise in future ILI occurrences:
   - The stable but below-baseline outpatient visit rate for ILI, consistently reported at 1.0–1.1% in Weeks 13–16, 2021, reflects ongoing respiratory illness activity that could contribute to the future increase.
   - Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) surpassed epidemic thresholds each week, ranging from 11.2% in Week 14, 2021, to 12.4% in Week 15, 2021, indicating persistent respiratory illness burden likely contributing to elevated future ILI cases.
   - Healthcare-seeking behaviors were continuously impacted by COVID-19, skewing ILI data interpretation and potentially leading to underreported ILI activity during the past weeks, thereby amplifying future recorded occurrences.

4. In summary, the reported 1789 future ILI occurrences (Week 21, 2021) stem from the observed peak in Week 14, 2021, combined with the persistently high PIC mortality, stable outpatient ILI visit activity, and disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the pandemic. The interplay of these factors drove the increase while highlighting the complexity of interpreting ILI trends under pandemic conditions.
