1. The past ILI counts from Week15 to Week19, 2021 are reported as 1435, 1358, 1759, 1626, and 1786. The trend shows an initial slight decrease from Week15 (1435) to Week16 (1358) before experiencing a sharp increase to Week17 (1759). This is followed by a moderate dip in Week18 (1626) and a subsequent rise in Week19 (1786). This pattern reflects fluctuations with a slight upward trend by Week19, although no sustained increase or sharp decline is observed.
2. Based on historical patterns, Week24, 2021 falls within the off-season for ILI activity in the U.S., as it occurs well after the typical peak season (Week46 to Week6) and aligns with the ongoing low influenza activity reflected in Weeks15-19, 2021. Thus, Week24, 2021 belongs to the off-season category.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the fluctuating yet slightly rising trends in Weeks17-19 (i.e., 1759 to 1786) may suggest stability or marginal increases in weekly ILI counts. Extrapolating forward, a modest rise by Week24, 2021 can reasonably predict ILI occurrences at 1807, considering the absence of significant drivers for a surge or sharp reduction.
4. Influenza positivity remains exceptionally low in respiratory specimens, with only 0.1% positivity reported consistently across Weeks15-19, 2021 (Week15 #1; Week16 #1; Week17 #1; Week18 #1; Week19 #1). This low positivity aligns with reduced ILI transmission during this period.
5. Healthcare-seeking behaviors continue to be influenced heavily by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, leading to alternative ILI reporting trends, skewed data interpretation, and overall minimal influenza surveillance reliability (Week15 #8; Week16 #10; Week18 #9; Week19 #10). This could account for some fluctuations while remaining consistent with minimal activity overall.
6. Vaccination campaigns continue to be emphasized by the CDC as a preventive measure, but no significant new trends are noted in vaccination uptake (Week15 #10; Week16 #8; Week17 #8; Week18 #8; Week19 #9). The absence of vaccine-related surges supports the maintenance of a low ILI impact.
7. The projected ILI occurrence of 1807 for Week24, 2021 is justified by the stable yet slightly rising ILI fluctuations in Weeks17-19, sustained minimal ILI activity (off-season), low influenza positivity across specimens, the ongoing influence of COVID-19 on ILI reporting, and the absence of major vaccination-driven changes. This aligns with the off-season pattern and expected continued low ILI transmission.
