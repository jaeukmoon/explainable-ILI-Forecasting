1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1469', '1509', '1504', '1562', '1634']. There was a slight fluctuation between Week30, 2024 (1509) and Week31, 2024 (1504), but the pattern soon resumed an upward trajectory, culminating in 1634 during Week34, 2024—this steady increase reflects a gradual rise in ILI activity.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 2411 strongly correlates with the upward trend observed in the past 5 weeks (Weeks 30–34, 2024). The continuous escalation in ILI cases exhibited in the latter weeks (Week33–34, 2024) lays the groundwork for the sharper rise to 2411 after 5 weeks. This progression suggests a sustained increase in transmission or reporting of ILI.
3. The outpatient visits for ILI steadily remained low but began to uptick slightly by Week34, 2024, at 1.8%, an increase from the stagnant 1.5% baseline over the previous weeks (Week30–33, 2024). This increase, particularly in younger age groups (0–4 and 5–24 years), aligns with the potential upward momentum driving future ILI cases.
4. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2, coupled with novel influenza A variant cases, were reported consistently (Weeks30–34, 2024). These additional pathogens likely contributed to overlapping ILIs, enhancing overall respiratory illness activity leading to the future count.
5. Despite low positivity rates for influenza (e.g., 0.7% in Week30, 2024, dropping to 0.4% by Week34, 2024), the ongoing presence of respiratory illnesses, as indicated by stable hospitalization rates (0.1 per 100,000 in Weeks30–33, 2024), suggests broader drivers of ILI, supported by increased co-pathogen circulation and slight diagnostic overlap.
6. In summary, the upward trend in past ILI occurrences, subtle increases in outpatient visits, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and stable hospitalization rates collectively explain the observed rise to 2411 occurrences after 5 weeks.
