1. The reported ILI counts from Week26 to Week30, 2022 are 1519, 1386, 1170, 1239, and 1301. Initially, there is a consistent decrease from Week26 (1519) to Week28 (1170), followed by a slight increase to Week30 (1301). This pattern shows an overall decline in ILI occurrences but with a mild rebound in later weeks, indicating a fluctuating but low activity trend near a potential baseline.
2. Forecasting the target week (Week35, 2022) as part of the peak onset season aligns with historical patterns. In the U.S., peak onset typically begins around Week32 or Week35. Given past ILI trends and a slight rebound observed in Week29 and Week30, 2022, this period marks a transition from the off-season to the peak onset season.
3. Based on time-series analysis, the overall decline and slight rebound indicate a stabilization at low levels without significant surges. The fluctuations suggest that ILI occurrences will remain relatively subdued but slightly elevated over the coming weeks. Thus, projecting forward five weeks to Week35, 2022, the expected ILI occurrence aligns with a stabilized value of 1190.
4. Influenza activity remains low nationwide, with clinical lab positivity rates dropping consistently from 1.4% in Week26 to 0.5% in Week30 (Week26 #1, Week27 #1, Week28 #1, Week29 #1, Week30 #1). This suggests no immediate spike in influenza activity, influencing the forecast for stable ILI levels.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, persist as a complicating factor (Week27 #10, Week28 #8, Week29 #10, Week30 #10). However, influenza remains a minor contributor to PIC-related hospitalizations and deaths, supporting low ILI trends.
6. Vaccination trends and coverage remain steady, with no notable new updates in the past five weeks (Week26 #7, Week27 #8, Week28 #9, Week29 #9, Week30 #9). This suggests ongoing background protection against influenza without significant vaccination-driven changes.
7. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrences of 1190 in Week35, 2022 are justified by a generally declining and fluctuating time-series trend, the transition to the peak onset season, stable low influenza activity, ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and a steady vaccination landscape. These factors collectively point to a slight elevation in ILI within a subdued overall activity environment.
