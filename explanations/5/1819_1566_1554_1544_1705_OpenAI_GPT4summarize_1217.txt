1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an initial decline followed by an increase, with values of ['1819', '1566', '1554', '1544', '1705']. ILI occurrences consistently decreased from 1819 (Week 40, 2020) to 1544 (Week 43, 2020). However, the trend reversed during Week 44, 2020, where the value rose to 1705, indicating a potential resurgence in ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period.
2. The reported future ILI occurrence of 1822 (Week 49, 2020) reflects a positive correlation with the recent upward trend observed in past occurrences. The resurgence in Week 44, 2020, acts as a precursor to the continuation of heightened activity that contributed to the reported future value.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually increased from 1.1% (Week 40, 2020) to 1.3% (Week 44, 2020), demonstrating a consistent rise in ILI-related healthcare encounters. This steady increase suggests a growing prevalence of respiratory illnesses contributing to future ILI data.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained consistently elevated, rising from 7.0% (Week 40, 2020) to 8.1% (Week 44, 2020), exceeding epidemic thresholds throughout. This persistent trend of respiratory illness mortality aligns with the observed future ILI surge.
5. Behavioral changes induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, as highlighted across all CDC reports, disrupted traditional ILI surveillance and healthcare-seeking patterns. These disruptions likely caused reporting lags and delayed recognition, amplifying future ILI occurrences to the observed value of 1822 (Week 49, 2020).
6. Despite overall low influenza test positivity rates (e.g., 0.21% in Week 40, 2020, and 0.1% in Week 44, 2020), other factors like non-influenza respiratory illnesses or pandemic-related behavioral shifts could have contributed to the rise in ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 1822 future ILI occurrences (Week 49, 2020) stem from a resurgence in past trends during Week 44, increasing healthcare encounters for ILI, persistently high PIC mortality rates exceeding thresholds, and the compounded effects of COVID-19-related behavioral and reporting disruptions.
