1. The reported ILI counts from Week26 to Week30, 2021 are 1794, 2193, 2546, 3182, and 3354. This represents a steady upward trend over five weeks, with notable weekly increases. The trend indicates a consistent rise in ILI occurrences without fluctuations or declines during this period, suggesting growing respiratory illness activity.
2. In the U.S., the target week (Week35, 2021) falls within the peak onset season, which typically begins around Week32 or Week35 and leads up to the peak season. The consistent increase in ILI occurrences (Week26 to Week30, 2021) and CDC indications of rising respiratory illness activity align with this classification.
3. From a time-series perspective, the steady growth in ILI counts reflects a persistent upward trajectory. Projecting this pattern forward to Week35, 2021, the model anticipates further increases in ILI occurrences. The value of 3452 aligns with this trend, as the data from Week26 to Week30, 2021 shows substantial and consistent weekly growth in ILI occurrences, indicating momentum likely to continue over the next five weeks.
4. Rising outpatient respiratory illness visits over the past three weeks across all age groups (Week28, 2021 #3; Week29, 2021 #2; Week30, 2021 #1, #7) suggest increasing transmission of non-influenza respiratory illnesses, supporting the upward trend in ILI counts.
5. The COVID-19 dynamic and shifts in healthcare behaviors are noted as significant influencers complicating the delineation of flu activity (Week26, 2021 #6, #9; Week29, 2021 #9; Week30, 2021 #8). These factors may spur increased reporting or healthcare visits for ILI, contributing to the observed rises.
6. CDC reports indicate heightened uncertainty around future flu activity but note increasing respiratory illness patterns (Week30, 2021 #10). This aligns with the continued upward trend in ILI and supports the projection of higher occurrences in upcoming weeks.
7. In summary, the predicted value of 3452 occurrences for Week35, 2021 can be attributed to the steady rise in ILI counts over five weeks, the progression into the peak onset season, increased outpatient respiratory illness visits across age groups, influences of COVID-19 on healthcare patterns, and the CDC's mention of uncertain but rising respiratory trends. These interrelated factors reinforce the expectation of continued growth in ILI counts.
