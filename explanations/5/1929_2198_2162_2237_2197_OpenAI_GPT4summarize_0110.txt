1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week23 to Week27, 2021 are 1929, 2198, 2162, 2237, and 2197. The trend indicates an initial increase from Week23 (1929) to Week24 (2198), followed by minor fluctuations around 2200, suggesting a stable or slightly fluctuating trajectory. This lack of significant spikes or sharp declines signals a consistent pattern.
2. Forecasting for Week32, 2021 aligns with the off-season classification. Based on U.S. patterns, this week falls within the off-season period, where influenza activity remains minimal, consistent with past trends (Week23, 2021 #9; Week26, 2021 #7). Observed low activity further supports this classification.
3. From a time-series analysis, the relatively stable pattern in ILI counts (fluctuating slightly around 2200 in recent weeks) indicates no significant upward trend. Projecting this forward over five weeks, a slight increase is likely due to the gradual movement towards the peak onset season but still within the limits of off-season trends, supporting the forecast of 3168 ILI occurrences for Week32, 2021.
4. Influenza activity during Weeks23–27 remained minimal, with outpatient visits for ILI consistently below the national baseline of 2.6% (Week23, 2021 #1; Week26, 2021 #3; Week27, 2021 #3). Positivity rates for tested specimens are persistently low, around 0.1% (Week24, 2021 #2; Week27, 2021 #1), indicating minimal flu circulation.
5. Minimal vaccination updates combined with behavioral shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic likely impact healthcare-seeking behavior and subsequently obscure ILI activity trends (Week23, 2021 #8; Week25, 2021 #8; Week27, 2021 #7). These factors reduce the accuracy of short-term surveillance.
6. COVID-19 remains the major driver of respiratory illness and mortality trends, contributing to ongoing challenges in distinguishing influenza-related activity (Week23, 2021 #4; Week26, 2021 #5; Week27, 2021 #5). Despite this, CDC expects influenza activity to remain low through subsequent weeks, barring unexpected changes (Week26, 2021 #10; Week27, 2021 #9).
7. Based on the stable ILI trend observed in Weeks23–27, the predominant off-season classification for Week32, 2021, and the minimal influence of influenza activity countered by COVID-19 dominance, the gradual increase in forecasted ILI occurrences to 3168 is justified, reflecting minor fluctuations within an overall low-activity period.
