1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week44, 2021 to Week48, 2021 are 2107, 2109, 2190, 1855, and 2084. Across these weeks, the trend shows a mild fluctuation. ILI counts rose slightly from Week44 (2107) to Week46 (2190), dipped notably in Week47 (1855), and rebounded to 2084 in Week48. This fluctuating trend, combined with an upward trajectory by Week48, suggests an early rise in flu activity, potentially signaling the onset of increased ILI activity over subsequent weeks.
2. Week1, 2022 belongs to the peak season in the U.S. influenza calendar, as it aligns with the typical peak period (Week46 of one year through Week6 of the next). Increasing ILI visits and rising respiratory virus activity observed through Week48, 2021 further support this classification.
3. Analysis of past trends projects forward ILI occurrences from the Week44-48, 2021 pattern. The fluctuating but increasing trajectory observed in this period, coupled with historical peak season dynamics, suggests a notable rise in ILI counts by Week1, 2022. Consequently, the predicted value of 3203 aligns with an expected amplification of ILI activity during this peak period.
4. Influenza A (H3N2) dominance: Most influenza detections were Influenza A (98.4%-99.1%, Week46-48, 2021) with H3N2 specifically driving infections (Week46-48, 2021 #3, #9). This subtype is linked to greater transmissibility and higher hospitalization rates, contributing to increasing ILI activity into the peak season.
5. Vaccination trends: Although vaccine distribution reached 166.9 million doses by Week48, 2021, early uptake appeared to lag compared to the prior season (Week48, 2021 #7). Reduced vaccination coverage could increase susceptibility, fostering higher ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses: Multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, are simultaneously active (Week44-48, 2021 #10, #7, #13). Their interaction likely exacerbates ILI activity, enhancing the likelihood of rising trends moving into Week1, 2022.
7. In summary, the fluctuating yet upward trend in ILI counts, alignment with the peak influenza season, dominance of a highly transmissible H3N2 subtype, limited vaccine uptake, and combined co-circulation effects predict elevated ILI activity during Week1, 2022. These factors collectively justify the forecasted 3203 ILI occurrences.
