1. The reported ILI counts from Week31 to Week35, 2021 are 1077, 1043, 1040, 1101, and 1255. The trend shows a steady decline from Week31 to Week33 (1077 to 1040), followed by a significant increase from Week34 (1101) to Week35 (1255). This suggests a recent uptick in occurrences, potentially indicating a shift from stability to rising ILI activity.
2. Based on U.S. seasonal patterns, Week40, 2021 aligns with the peak onset season as it falls between Week32 to Week46 when ILI activity starts to climb toward the peak season. Reports from Week31 to Week35, 2021 indicate minimal influenza activity but a continued rise in ILI occurrences, signifying early peak onset behavior.
3. From a time-series perspective, the end-of-period count (Week35, 2021 at 1255) reflects a notable increase compared to earlier weeks. Extrapolating this upward trajectory five weeks forward suggests some moderation in growth but still elevated levels, leading to a forecast of 1124 ILI occurrences. The projection aligns with prior seasonal fluctuations and the slow but steady buildup typical of the peak onset season.
4. COVID-19 continues to dominate respiratory illnesses, influencing the PIC mortality rate, which far exceeds epidemic thresholds during Weeks31–35, 2021 (Week31 #6; Week33 #5), and likely contributing to ILI increases.
5. Low vaccination activity and lack of new vaccination promotion trends during Weeks31–35, 2021 (Week31 #10; Week34 #7) reduce community immunity, amplifying susceptibility to both influenza and non-influenza respiratory viruses.
6. The emergence of novel Influenza A (H1N2)v linked to swine exposure (Week32 #2) highlights potential viral evolution, albeit without evidence of human-to-human transmission. Such events raise concerns about possible future outbreaks affecting ILI trends.
7. These factors collectively explain the projected ILI occurrence of 1124 for Week40, 2021. The recent upward trend in ILI occurrences, typical peak onset season timing, COVID-19’s strong influence, minimal vaccination effects, and the concurrent contribution of other respiratory pathogens support this prediction.
