1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week43 to Week47, 2021 are 11880, 13895, 15312, 16729, and 15058, showing a clear upward trajectory from Week43 to Week46 before experiencing a slight decline in Week47. This indicates a general increasing trend with a minor fluctuation in the final week, reflective of rising ILI activity leading into the typical peak influenza season.
2. Week52, 2021 falls squarely within the U.S. peak season (Week46 to Week6) based on historical seasonality patterns. The gradually increasing ILI activity in the preceding weeks and the timing of Week52 align with this period of the highest intensity of ILI transmission.
3. From a time-series perspective, the observed rising trend from Week43 (11880) to Week46 (16729), followed by a minor dip in Week47 (15058), suggests a likely continuation of increasing ILI occurrences. Projecting forward into Week52, 2021, this pattern aligns with predictions of sustained growth during the peak season. Models accounting for these dynamics estimate a significant rise, reaching 43523.
4. The emergence and dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), as particularly noted in Week47, 2021, where 99.6% of Influenza A detections were H3N2, contribute to heightened ILI occurrences, especially in specific age groups (Week43 #3, Week44 #5, Week47 #4).
5. Despite widespread vaccination efforts, with 166.9 million doses distributed by Week47, below-baseline outpatient ILI visits (Week43 #4, Week44 #4), and co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, complicate control measures and surveillance data interpretation (Week43 #10, Week44 #10, Week47 #10, Week47 #12).
6. Increasing detections of positive influenza specimens by clinical and public health labs in recent weeks (Week43 #1, Week44 #1-#3, Week45 #1-#2, Week46 #1-#3, Week47 #1-#3), combined with age-specific trends, indicate growing influenza activity that supports a projection of elevated ILI occurrences by Week52.
7. In summary, based on the consistently rising ILI trend, alignment with the peak season, dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), co-circulating respiratory viruses, and growing influenza positivity rates, a significant increase in ILI occurrences to 43523 in Week52, 2021 is justified.
