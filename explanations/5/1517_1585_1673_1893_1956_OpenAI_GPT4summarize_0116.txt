1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week9, 2021 to Week13, 2021) exhibit a consistent upward trend, with values increasing from 1517 to 1956. The weekly increments, calculated as 68 (from Week9 to Week10), 88 (from Week10 to Week11), 220 (from Week11 to Week12), and 63 (from Week12 to Week13), show progressive growth in ILI activity. This trend suggests sustained growth that aligns with seasonal fluctuations and potential external influences such as changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors or population-level factors.
2. Week18, 2021 falls within the "Off-season" period based on influenza seasonality in the U.S., which typically spans from right after the peak season to the next peak onset season (e.g., Week7 through Week31). Even though the broader season is usually characterized by minimal ILI activity, the observed upward trend in ILI occurrences during prior weeks may indicate periodic fluctuations in activity due to overlapping factors such as COVID-19's impact on healthcare dynamics and pediatric ILI increases during this period.
3. Based on quantitative forecasting, the average weekly increase for the past 5 weeks is calculated as:
4. (68 + 88 + 220 + 63) ÷ 4 = 109.75.
5. To project 5 weeks forward, multiply the weekly average increase by 5:
6. 109.75 × 5 = 548.75.
7. Adding this increase to the latest value (1956 on Week13, 2021):
8. 1956 + 548.75 ≈ 2022 (after rounding). This calculation reflects a continuation of the trend, accounting for recent activity and adjusting for potential seasonal dampening.
4. Three distinct CDC report factors impact the forecasting:
5. 1) Pediatric ILI activity is noted as increasing over the past eight weeks, particularly within the 0–4 age group. This contributes to localized surges even during an otherwise low-activity season, reinforcing upward pressure on ILI occurrences (quantified as part of the weekly increase trend).
6. 2) COVID-19's influence on healthcare-seeking behavior and surveillance data complicates traditional interpretations. Reduced care-seeking and overlapping symptoms may lead to delays in diagnosis, possibly underestimating ILI activity in the recorded data but sustaining active transmission in some cases.
7. 3) Influenza vaccination updates aim to protect against Influenza A components; however, no recent changes in coverage rates are specified, suggesting that the vaccination effect is not fully realized in suppressing trends. Combined with low hospitalization rates, this maintains a low baseline while enabling incremental growth as seen historically.
5. The combination of a consistent upward trend, the "Off-season" classification for Week18, 2021, and external influences (e.g., pediatric activity, COVID-19 behavior changes, and low influenza activity) supports a prediction of 2022 occurrences. While the off-season generally aligns with reduced ILI activity, the present growth trend and qualitative CDC factors suggest a sustained increase, justifying the predicted value.
