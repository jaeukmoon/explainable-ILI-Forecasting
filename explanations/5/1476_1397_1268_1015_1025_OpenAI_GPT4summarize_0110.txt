1. The reported ILI counts from Week24 to Week28, 2024 are 1476, 1397, 1268, 1015, and 1025. The trend shows a consistent decline from Week24 to Week28. The largest drop is observed between Week26 (1268) and Week27 (1015), followed by stabilization in Week28 (1025). This indicates a general downward trajectory with a recent leveling-off pattern.
2. Week33, 2024 falls within the peak onset season, as it occurs after the expected off-season (ending around Week31 or Week32, 2024) and precedes the typical peak season starting in Week46, 2024. CDC surveillance for such weeks emphasizes growing vigilance.
3. The time-series pattern of declining ILI occurrences, followed by stabilization near Week28 (1025), suggests a transition period. Based on historical data, a minor rebound or stability is anticipated post-Week28 as respiratory illness trends stabilize. Therefore, the slight increase to 811 cases in Week33 aligns with the expected trajectory during peak onset season.
4. Low positivity rates for influenza (Week24, 2024 #1; Week25, 2024 #1; Week26, 2024 #1; Week27, 2024 #1; Week28, 2024 #1) reflect reduced community transmission of influenza during the previous weeks. However, as Week33 transitions into the peak onset season, sporadic increases may occur (Week28, 2024 #11).
5. The continued co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (Week24, 2024 #9; Week25, 2024 #10; Week26, 2024 #10; Week27, 2024 #9; Week28, 2024 #11), including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, can cause minor rebounds in ILI reports during this transition period despite influenza activity being low overall.
6. The anticipated future flu activity remains low (Week24, 2024 #11; Week25, 2024 #10; Week26, 2024 #10; Week27, 2024 #10; Week28, 2024 #11); however, sporadic cases of novel influenza variants (Week25, 2024 #7; Week26, 2024 #8; Week28, 2024 #8) and low vaccination trends (Week24, 2024 #8; Week25, 2024 #9) contribute to a gradual rise in cases during Week33.
7. In summary, the projected decrease to 811 future occurrences is justified by the sustained decline in ILI activity through Week28, the seasonality associated with the peak onset season during Week33, limited influenza circulation with stable positivity rates, and the influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors collectively support the predicted value as part of a stabilization phase.
