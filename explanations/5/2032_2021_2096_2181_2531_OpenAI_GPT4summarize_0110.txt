1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week12 to Week16, 2022 are 2032, 2021, 2096, 2181, and 2531. The data indicates an increasing trend over the five weeks, with gradual growth from Week12 (2032) to Week14 (2181), followed by a notable spike in Week16 (2531). The trend suggests rising ILI activity, with Week16 being the peak of this short-term period.
2. According to U.S. influenza seasonality, Week21, 2022 occurs in the off-season. This aligns with the trend of declining or stabilizing ILI activity typically observed after off-season spikes (e.g., Week19, 2022). No substantial indication exists that Week21, 2022 would fall within the peak or peak onset season. Thus, Week21, 2022 is classified within the off-season.
3. The time-series data shows consistent increases in weekly ILI counts, attributed to the sustained national influenza activity reported by CDC. However, the growth rate began tapering off in Week16, 2022, suggesting imminent stabilization or decline in future weeks. Projecting this pattern forward from Week16 to Week21, 2022, the anticipated value would represent a slight decrease from the Week16 peak, aligning with the forecast of 1983 ILI occurrences.
4. The continued predominance of Influenza A(H3N2) during Week12 to Week16, 2022, strongly influences ILI activity. The persistent rise in hospitalization rates (Week12, 2022 #5; Week13, 2022 #5; Week14, 2022 #5; Week15, 2022 #6; Week16, 2022 #3) and outpatient respiratory visits (Week12, 2022 #4; Week13, 2022 #4; Week14, 2022 #4; Week15, 2022 #4; Week16, 2022 #6) contributed significantly to increasing ILI cases in this time frame.
5. Continued co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV) complicated influenza trend interpretations (Week12, 2022 #9; Week13, 2022 #13; Week14, 2022 #12; Week15, 2022 #11; Week16, 2022 #11). However, their fluctuating patterns did not contribute to any major ILI spikes beyond influenza's seasonal activity.
6. Vaccination against influenza appears stable and widespread, although antigenic mismatch for the A(H3N2) strain has led to reduced effectiveness (Week14, 2022 #8; Week15, 2022 #10; Week16, 2022 #10). This mismatch likely supported modern influenza transmission without causing extraordinary growth.
7. The projected value of 1983 ILI occurrences for Week21, 2022 reflects the recent rising trend's stabilization, as evidenced by Week16’s peak followed by a declining trajectory typical of off-season activity. This is supported by the predominance of Influenza A(H3N2), significant outpatient visits and hospitalization trends leveling off, the role of co-circulating viruses in moderating trends, and the relative consistency of vaccination coverage.
