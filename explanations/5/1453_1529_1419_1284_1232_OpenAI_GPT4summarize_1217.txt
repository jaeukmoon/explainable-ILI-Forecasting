1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values of ['1453', '1529', '1419', '1284', '1232']. Beginning with 1453 (Week11, 2023), there was a marginal rise to 1529 (Week12, 2023), followed by a steady decrease through 1419 (Week13, 2023), 1284 (Week14, 2023), and 1232 (Week15, 2023). This steady downward trajectory reflects declining ILI activity as the weeks progressed.
2. A negative correlation can be observed between the past and future ILI occurrences, with the continuous decline in past weeks leading into a sharp drop to 1056 in Week20, 2023. The persistent decrease in values across Weeks11–15, 2023, anticipated the observed reduction in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
3. ILI outpatient visit percentages consistently stayed below the national baseline of 2.5%, decreasing from 2.4% (Week11, 2023) to 2.0% (Week15, 2023). This successive decline in outpatient visits indicates a reduction in ILI-related healthcare activity, aligning with lower future ILI occurrences. PIC mortality percentages remained slightly above the epidemic threshold but decreased from 8.7% (Week11, 2023) to 7.5% (Week15, 2023), indicating declining severity of respiratory illness activity and contributing to reduced ILI cases. The ongoing low positivity rate for influenza in clinical labs, consistently below 1.0% from Week11 through Week15, 2023, demonstrates limited virologic support for substantial ILI activity, reinforcing the drop in future occurrences. Reports highlighted stable trends with low influenza activity and no significant regional increases (Weeks14–15, 2023), providing no signs of impending surges in ILI occurrences.
4. Other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, moderately co-circulated throughout Weeks11–15, 2023, as indicated by consistent co-infection percentages (e.g., 3.8% of hospitalized cases in Week14, 2023). These contributions remained stable, suggesting no significant shifts in ILI data due to non-influenza sources. Co-infections likely sustained a baseline level of cases but did not overwhelm the declining trend.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1056 (Week20, 2023) are explained by the consistent decline in past ILI occurrences during Weeks11–15, 2023, decreasing outpatient visits for ILI, reductions in PIC mortality percentages, persistently low influenza positivity rates, and stable trends without regional surges. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses further added a moderate effect but did not counteract the overall decline.
