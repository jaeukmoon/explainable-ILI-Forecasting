1. The ILI occurrences from Week25 to Week29, 2021 were 1495, 1376, 1469, 1659, and 1859. The overall trend indicates a steady increase over the five weeks, with the most notable rise occurring between Week27 (1469) and Week29 (1859). This pattern signifies growing ILI activity, likely reflecting gradual changes in respiratory illness dynamics.
2. Based on U.S. seasonality patterns, Week34, 2021 falls within the peak onset season, which typically spans from Week32 to Week46. The rising trend in ILI occurrences aligns with this early phase of increasing ILI activity before the typical peak in late fall or early winter.
3. From a time-series perspective, the progressive upward trend over the past five weeks suggests continuation of growth into Week34, 2021. Accounting for seasonal effects and trajectory modeling, a projection of 3178 ILI occurrences is consistent with doubling patterns seen in similar periods of peak onset seasons.
4. ILI outpatient visits displayed sequential increases from Week27 (1.3%) to Week29 (1.7%), particularly among younger age groups (Week29, 2021 #2). This progression reflects growing community respiratory illness activity, influencing overall ILI reports.
5. Limited influenza-specific virologic surveillance data (Week25–Week29, 2021 #10 in all weeks) underscores difficulty drawing conclusions on direct influenza contributions, further complicating accurate forecasting. Concurrent increases in non-influenza respiratory illnesses, amplified by deviations in healthcare-seeking behaviors and data influences from the COVID-19 pandemic, may contribute to rising ILI occurrences.
6. Minimal vaccination trends or novel intervention data were observed (Week25–Week29, 2021 #9 in all weeks). With vaccination coverage not significantly influencing prevention during this time, ILI susceptibility remains largely unchanged, which could contribute to increasing ILI activity.
7. The combination of a regular upward trend in ILI occurrences, classification of Week34, 2021 within the peak onset season, and rising outpatient visit rates justify the forecast of 3178 occurrences. This aligns with observed patterns of gradual ILI growth despite limited influenza-specific virologic activity and reflects ongoing challenges due to concurrent SARS-CoV-2 influences and altered healthcare use.
