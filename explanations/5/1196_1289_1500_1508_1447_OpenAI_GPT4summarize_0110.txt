1. The past five weeks (Week38 to Week42, 2023) show a sharp growth in ILI activity from 1196 to 1500 between Week38 and Week40, leveling off by Week41 at 1508 and slightly decreasing to 1447 in Week42. This suggests an upward trajectory early on, followed by stabilization and a small dip, indicating increasing activity heading into a potential peak period.
2. Forecasting Week47, 2023 belongs to the Peak season. Historically, the U.S. peak season starts around Week46 and continues through Week6 of the following year. The observed rise in ILI activity in Week38–Week42, along with the CDC’s reported increases in regional ILI activity (Week42, 2023 #9), aligns with the beginning of Peak season trends.
3. The upward momentum demonstrated between Week38 and Week40 signals an increasing trend, supported by recent stabilization. Time-series patterns suggest that ILI activity will likely continue building as Week47 enters the peak period. Using this historical pattern to project forward, Week47 is anticipated to experience significantly higher ILI activity compared to Week42. The value of 1961 reflects this typical seasonal escalation.
4. Influenza positivity rates increased steadily from Week38 (0.9%) to Week42 (1.7%) in clinical specimens (Week38, 2023 #1; Week42, 2023 #1). Regional increases in moderate or high ILI activity were observed in Week42 (Week42, 2023 #9), further indicating growing flu spread.
5. Hospitalization rates rose consistently across Week38 to Week42, with the cumulative rate growing from 0.1 per 100,000 (Week40, 2023 #3) to 0.5 per 100,000 (Week42, 2023 #3), showing increased intensity in severe outcomes and reflecting an upward influenza trend.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (SARS-CoV-2, RSV, etc.) remained steady throughout Week38 to Week42 but increased respiratory illness burden may amplify ILI visits in vulnerable populations (Week38, 2023 #8; Week41, 2023 #9).
7. These factors together—rising ILI trends, the expected transition into Peak season during Week47, increased positivity/hospitalization rates, and viral co-circulation—support the forecasted ILI occurrence of 1961 for Week47, 2023.
