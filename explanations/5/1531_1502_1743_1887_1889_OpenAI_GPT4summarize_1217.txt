1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating upward trend, with values of ['1531', '1502', '1743', '1887', '1889']. A slight decline was observed from 1531 (Week34, 2021) to 1502 (Week35, 2021), but this was followed by a sharp rise to 1743 (Week36, 2021) and subsequent increases to 1887 (Week37, 2021) and 1889 (Week38, 2021). The consistent upward trajectory, particularly in the later weeks, reflects an escalation in ILI activity.
2. A clear positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the rising trend observed from Week36 to Week38, 2021, aligns with the reported future value of 1802. The stabilization at high levels in Weeks37 and 38, 2021, provides a basis for the future persistence of elevated ILI cases.
3. Weekly percentages of outpatient visits for ILI, while below the national baseline of 2.6%, hovered at increasing levels: 2.2% (Week34, 2021), 0.9% (Week35, 2021), 2.3% (Week36, 2021), 2.1% (Week37, 2021), and 1.9% (Week38, 2021). The heightened outpatient activity suggests a growing burden of respiratory illness that overlaps with the rise in ILI cases.
4. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) deaths perpetually exceeded epidemic thresholds throughout these 5 weeks, climbing from 19.4% in Week34, 2021, to peaks of 21.1% in Week37, 2021, and steadying at 20.9% in Week38, 2021. This persistent respiratory mortality burden correlates with increasing ILI levels due to overlapping factors driving respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19.
5. Changing healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported across all weeks, impacted surveillance interpretation. These changes might have concentrated ILI activity recognition, influencing the elevated value of 1802 after 5 weeks. Additionally, the low influenza virus detections (<0.1% positivity rates in Weeks34–38, 2021) suggest contributions from non-influenza respiratory viruses, amplifying ILI cases through non-specific clinical presentations.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 1802 stems primarily from the upward trend in Weeks36–38, 2021, increasing outpatient visits for ILI, persistent PIC mortality exceeding thresholds, and pandemic-related shifts in healthcare behaviors, compounded by non-influenza respiratory virus activity.
