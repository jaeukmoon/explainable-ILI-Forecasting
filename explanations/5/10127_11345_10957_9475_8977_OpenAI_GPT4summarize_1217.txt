1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a notable downward trend, with values of ['10127', '11345', '10957', '9475', '8977']. Following an initial peak at 11345 (Week 4, 2024), a consistent decline was observed, reaching 8977 by Week 8, 2024, the lowest in the observed period. This downward trend reflects a decrease in ILI activity over this timeframe.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the continuous drop over the past 5 weeks culminated in a sharp decline to 5003 after 5 weeks (Week 13, 2024). The persistent decrease in ILI occurrences during Weeks 4–8 serves as an indicator of further reductions in subsequent weeks.
3. Several factors from the CDC reports highlight correlations with the future decline in ILI occurrences. First, influenza positivity rates consistently decreased from 16.2% in Week 4 to 14.2% in Week 8, suggesting a decline in overall influenza activity. Second, outpatient ILI visits plateaued at 4.4–4.5%, indicating stabilization in healthcare-seeking behavior. Third, influenza-associated mortality rates steadily decreased from 0.9% (Week 4) to 0.7% (Week 8), reflecting diminished severity of influenza cases over the season. Fourth, pediatric deaths showed a slowing trend, from eight new cases in Week 4 to only two new cases in Week 8, signaling a reduction in severe outcomes.
4. High levels of co-circulation with non-influenza respiratory viruses (e.g., COVID-19 and RSV) throughout the reporting period may have diverted healthcare visits, contributing to a reduction in reported future ILI occurrences.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence of 5003 (Week 13, 2024) can be attributed to the consistent downward trend in past ILI occurrences, declining positivity rates, decreasing influenza-associated mortality, stabilization in outpatient ILI visits, and the impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses potentially altering healthcare trends.
