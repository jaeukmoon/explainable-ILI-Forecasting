1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week13 to Week17, 2024, show a significant decline each week: 11544 (Week13), 9899 (Week14), 8238 (Week15), 6649 (Week16), and 6169 (Week17). This indicates a steady downward trend, with no significant fluctuations or spikes, suggesting that influenza activity is diminishing consistently.
2. Based on historical patterns, Week22, 2024, belongs to the off-season period. In the U.S., the off-season generally spans from around Week09 to Week31 of each year. Considering the consistent declines in positivity and outpatient ILI visits (Week13 to Week17, 2024 #1, #3), as well as the decreasing hospitalization and death rates, influenza activity is consistent with the off-season during Week22, 2024.
3. The time-series trend from the past five weeks (Week13 to Week17, 2024) shows a pronounced decline, with ILI cases dropping by approximately 46.6% over these weeks. Projecting this downward trajectory forward based on time-series forecasting models, ILI occurrences are expected to further reduce over the next five weeks, leading to a forecast of 3520 for Week22, 2024. The incremental rate of decrease aligns with historical patterns observed during off-season periods.
4. Influenza activity is steadily declining nationally, with positive respiratory specimens decreasing from 9.1% (Week13, 2024 #1) to 3.9% (Week17, 2024 #1). This indicates a reduction in community transmission over recent weeks.
5. Vaccination remains emphasized, and vaccine viruses are well-matched and antigenically similar to circulating strains (Week13, 2024 #9; Week14, 2024 #7; Week15, 2024 #9). These factors, coupled with declining flu activity, suggest lower future ILI occurrences.
6. The co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and RSV (Week13 to Week17, 2024 #11, #8, #8, #10, #7) has contributed to respiratory illness trends but has not caused a significant influenza spike. This overlap likely stabilizes overall ILI trends and further reduces influenza's prominence.
7. Considering the progressive declines in ILI trends, off-season characterization for Week22, 2024, the protective effect of vaccination, and the absence of impact from co-circulating viruses, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 3520 for Week22, 2024, is justified as a continuation of declining activity observed after Week13, 2024.
