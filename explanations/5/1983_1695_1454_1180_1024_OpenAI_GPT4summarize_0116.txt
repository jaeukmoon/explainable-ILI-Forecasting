1. The time-series data of ILI occurrences for Region 8 from Week21, 2022 to Week25, 2022 shows a clear decreasing trend: 1983 → 1695 → 1454 → 1180 → 1024. Over these five weeks, the ILI cases decreased consistently, indicating a gradual return to baseline levels. The average weekly reduction rate is approximately (1983 - 1024) / 4 = 239.75 cases per week. Using this rate of decline, we can project the downward trend for the next 5 weeks (approximately 239.75 × 5 = 1198.75 cases decrease). Subtracting this reduction from Week25's value of 1024 cases, we project that the ILI occurrence will stabilize near 835. This adjusted projection accounts for the lower activity expected in the off-season, as described below.
2. Week30, 2022 falls under the "Off-season" phase according to U.S. ILI seasonal patterns. The off-season typically spans from the end of the peak season (Week6 of a given year) to the onset of the next peak season (around Week32 or Week35). In this phase, ILI activity generally remains low or near baseline levels. The steep decline observed in the time series and the minimal ILI activity summarized in the CDC reports strongly suggest that Week30 will continue this off-season trend.
3. The correlation between historical trends and upcoming ILI activity supports a continued decrease in occurrences. The weekly reductions observed over the past 5 weeks (averaging ~239.75 cases per week) indicate a steady decline without sudden variability, characteristic of a transition toward baseline levels typical of the off-season. By extrapolating this trend further, we anticipate a stabilized, lower ILI occurrence level (specifically 835 cases).
4. At least three critical factors derived from the CDC reports substantiate the forecast for 835 cases:
5. a. Influenza activity continued its downward trajectory toward baseline levels over the past 5 weeks (e.g., respiratory specimens testing positive decreased from 5.7% in Week21 to 1.8% in Week25). This reflects diminishing ILI prevalence as observed in past off-season patterns.
6. b. The dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), coupled with antigenic differences in the vaccine strain, contributed to earlier higher ILI counts. However, as vaccination campaigns continued and influenza activity waned across most regions (e.g., minimal activity in 45 jurisdictions by Week25), lower ILI occurrences became more likely in the following weeks.
7. c. Co-morbidity rates, such as SARS-CoV-2 co-infections, remained stable but low (~4%) throughout the analyzed weeks. Other respiratory viruses, including RSV and COVID-19, showed moderate contributions and declining activity as the flu season progressed toward its closure, reducing their influence on ILI trends by Week30.
5. In summary, the predicted value of 835 cases for Week30, 2022 in Region 8 is derived from the consistent decrease in ILI occurrences observed during the past 5 weeks, the classification of Week30 as an off-season period, and the influence of declining influenza activity, stabilized co-infections, and diminishing ILI-related factors as per the CDC reports. These elements collectively suggest continued low ILI activity characteristic of the off-season.
