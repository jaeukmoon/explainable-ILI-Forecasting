1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week18 to Week22, 2023 are 1083, 1070, 1056, 644, and 1006. The trend shows an initial decrease from Week18 (1083) to Week20 (1056), followed by a significant drop in Week21 (644) and a rebound in Week22 (1006). This pattern represents fluctuating ILI occurrences with a sharp dip and partial recovery toward the end of the period.
2. Week27, 2023 falls within the off-season period as it occurs well after the typical peak season (Week46–Week6) and prior to the peak onset season (Week35–Week46 in the U.S.). The low influenza positivity rates (below baseline) in the CDC reports confirm that this is consistent with off-season characteristics.
3. From the time-series perspective, the earlier fluctuations suggest variable ILI activity during the off-season. While Week21 (644) indicates a low point, the rebound in Week22 (1006) suggests a potential stabilization or slight increase in future weeks. Extrapolating based on these variations, an ILI occurrence of 828 in Week27 aligns with a moderate stabilization trend typical of off-season dynamics.
4. Influenza positivity rates have been minimal (ranging from 0.9% in Week18 to 1.2% in Week21) across recent weeks, and ILI outpatient visit percentages consistently remain below baseline (e.g., 1.9%–2.0%; Week18–Week22 #4; Week20–Week21 #4). This stable and minimal activity lowers the likelihood of a significant surge (Week18–Week22 #1).
5. Vaccination relevance is maintained, as the majority of circulating strains are well-matched to the vaccine, ensuring protections remain effective. No significant shifts in vaccination trends are noted, further supporting ongoing low ILI levels (Week18–Week22 #9; Week21 #9).
6. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV alongside influenza affects patterns but does not drive substantial ILI increases during the observed period. These dynamics, combined with overall low influenza activity, contribute to a moderate and controlled ILI level (Week18–Week22 #8,10).
7. Given the fluctuating yet declining ILI trends, off-season timing of Week27, 2023, protective vaccination alignment, and minimal influenza positivity with consistent antiviral susceptibility, the predicted ILI occurrence of 828 reflects stabilized, low-level activity during the off-season.
