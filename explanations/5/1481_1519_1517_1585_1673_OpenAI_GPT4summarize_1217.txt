1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1481', '1519', '1517', '1585', '1673']. The consistent increase from 1481 (Week7, 2021) to 1673 (Week11, 2021) indicates a steady rise in ILI activity across the 5-week period, with the highest value observed in Week11, 2021. This upward trajectory reflects an intensification in ILI-related occurrences.
2. A positive correlation is evident between the increasing trend in past ILI occurrences and future ILI activity, as the steady rise in Weeks7–11, 2021 correlates with the elevated future value of 1968 reported after 5 weeks (Week16, 2021). The observed increase during the latter weeks (Weeks10–11) serves as a precursor to the anticipated growth in ILI occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained low but stable across the 5 weeks, consistently well below the national baseline (e.g., 0.9% in Weeks8 and 11, 2021). Despite low levels, the stability in healthcare visits indicates a persistent level of respiratory illness activity, providing a foundation for the eventual rise in ILI cases.
4. Reports of increasing ILI trends among children aged 0–4 years over multiple weeks (e.g., noted in Weeks7 and 9, 2021) correlate with the future rise in cases, as the sustained rise in pediatric ILI activity likely contributed to the reported increase in Week16, 2021.
5. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza remained historically low (e.g., 0.7 per 100,000 population in Weeks9–11, 2021), while influenza activity nationwide showed minimal positivity (0.1% of respiratory specimens in all weeks). These factors suggest that the rising ILI occurrences may be influenced by non-specific respiratory illnesses or behavioral patterns unrelated to influenza virus activity.
6. Healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance complexities during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the interpretation of ILI data (documented in Weeks7–11, 2021). These disruptions likely contributed to the observed future rise by delaying case recognition or altering ILI reporting patterns.
7. In summary, the increase to 1968 future ILI occurrences (Week16, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks7–11, 2021, stable outpatient ILI visit percentages, rising pediatric ILI activity, and potential effects of pandemic-driven surveillance challenges, which may have delayed recognition or escalated reporting of non-specific respiratory illnesses.
