1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a notable upward trend, with values of ['13895', '15312', '16729', '15058', '17928']. Despite a dip at Week46, 2021 (15058), the data highlights consistent growth, peaking at 17928 during Week48, 2021. This suggests an intensification of ILI activity toward the observed period's conclusion.
2. A strong correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the upward trajectory from Week45 to Week48, 2021, culminating in 17928, mirrors the subsequent significant rise to 35304 after 5 weeks (Week49, 2021 onward). The increase in ILI activity during the later weeks of the past data foreshadowed the amplified future occurrences.
3. Reports of rising outpatient ILI visits, from 2.1% in Week44 to 2.5% in Week48, 2021, reaching or nearing the baseline, signaled intensifying respiratory illness. This increasing trend correlates strongly with the surge in future ILI occurrences.
4. Hospitalizations due to laboratory-confirmed influenza rose progressively, from 295 cases (Week44, 2021) to 841 cases (Week48, 2021). This consistent increase in severe flu cases reflects the escalating flu activity contributing to the future spike in ILI cases.
5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, as highlighted in all summarized CDC reports, likely compounded respiratory illness burden and amplified ILI cases, driving the sharp future rise.
6. While influenza activity was nationally low across Weeks44-48, 2021, Influenza A(H3N2) showed consistent dominance, particularly in ages 5–24, with its spread intensifying (e.g., 99.1% A cases in Week48). This demographic's high susceptibility potentially catalyzed higher ILI occurrences in the future.
7. In summary, the reported 35304 future ILI occurrences (Week49, 2021 onward) result from the upward trend across Weeks44-48, 2021, rising outpatient ILI visits and hospitalizations, compounded by co-circulating respiratory viruses, and the increasing dominance of Influenza A(H3N2). These factors collectively escalated ILI activity, contributing to the sharp future increase.
