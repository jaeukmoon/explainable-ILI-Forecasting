1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a generally downward trend, with values of ['1519', '1386', '1170', '1239', '1301']. The steep decline from 1519 (Week26, 2022) to 1170 (Week28, 2022) was followed by a modest rebound to 1239 (Week29, 2022) and 1301 (Week30, 2022). This variability suggests an overall declining trend in ILI activity with a partial recovery in the latter weeks.
2. A positive correlation between the most recent rebound in past ILI occurrences and the future ILI activity is evident. The slight increase during Week29 to Week30, 2022 (1239 to 1301), likely serves as a precursor to the lower future value of 1190 (Week35, 2022), reflecting a stabilization of ILI trends at reduced overall levels.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI stabilized at 1.6% during Weeks28-30, 2022 after a slight decline from 1.7% in Weeks26 and 27. Consistently low positivity for influenza (e.g., 0.5%-0.7% across all weeks) and declining hospitalization rates for laboratory-confirmed influenza (964 Week26 to 491 Week30) highlight overall subdued influenza activity, likely contributing to the reduced future occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, rising from 8.8% in Week26, 2022 to 10.0% in Week30, 2022 but driven primarily by COVID-19 rather than influenza. This mismatch between elevated PIC mortality and negligible influenza activity indicates diminished specific flu-related ILI occurrences in subsequent weeks.
5. The presence of co-circulating pathogens (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and RSV) and altered healthcare practices potentially diluted influenza-specific ILI reporting, aligning with the subdued 1190 future occurrences. Low reported influenza activity (Influenza A leading, H3N2 dominant, minimal Influenza B) remained static throughout Weeks26-30 and compounded the reduction in future activity.
6. In summary, the reported 1190 future ILI occurrences (Week35, 2022) can be attributed to a declining trend in past ILI rates with a partial rebound in Weeks29-30, consistently low outpatient ILI visits and positivity rates, minimal influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths, and the impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses and healthcare-seeking behavior shifts.
