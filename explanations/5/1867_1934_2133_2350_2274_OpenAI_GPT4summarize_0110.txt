1. The reported ILI counts from Week22 to Week26, 2021 are 1867, 1934, 2133, 2350, and 2274, respectively. There is an initial increase from Week22 (1867) to Week25 (2350), followed by a slight decline in Week26 (2274). This indicates a generally increasing trend with a slight fluctuation in the final week. The overall trend reflects a gradual rise in ILI activity, although it remains below epidemic levels.
2. Based on the typical U.S. influenza seasons, Week31, 2021 belongs to the off-season period. Historically, peak influenza activity begins in the peak onset season (Week32 to Week46) leading up to the peak season, but Week31, 2021 remains in the period of reduced ILI activity before the climb toward higher levels. The minimal ILI activity reported during Week26, 2021 further supports this classification.
3. A time-series analysis shows that a gradual increase in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks projects forward to a moderate rise in Week31, 2021. The relatively stable increase from Week22 to Week25 indicates that Week31 may follow an upward trajectory similar to past patterns, contributing to an estimated future count of 3987 ILI occurrences. This aligns with historical fluctuations while accounting for the slight increase seen in recent weeks.
4. Minimal influenza activity is reported nationwide throughout Week22 to Week26, 2021, with outpatient visits for ILI consistently below the national baseline of 2.6% (e.g., 1.2%, Week22–Week26, 2021 #1). As a result, there is no evidence of a significant influenza outbreak driving unusual ILI spikes.
5. The ongoing dominance of COVID-19, reflected in PIC mortality rates consistently above epidemic thresholds (Week22, 2021 #3; Week23, 2021 #4; Week24, 2021 #5; Week25, 2021 #5; Week26, 2021 #4), likely influences ILI trends and adds variability due to overlapping respiratory symptoms. Minimal influenza circulation supports the conclusion that any increase in ILI counts is primarily attributable to other respiratory illnesses and evolving healthcare-seeking behaviors (Week23, 2021 #8; Week26, 2021 #6, #9).
6. Syndromic surveillance combining COVID-19 and ILI data (Week22, 2021 #8; Week26, 2021 #9) reflects dynamic interactions between seasonal trends and pandemic challenges. These factors make forecasting uncertain but suggest conditions that could moderately amplify ILI counts from baseline trends in Week31, 2021.
7. Given the recent increasing trend in ILI counts, the off-season classification of Week31, 2021, the dominant influence of COVID-19 over influenza, and evolving healthcare patterns, the predicted future value of 3987 ILI occurrences represents a moderate continuation of the observed pattern, reflecting the gradual rise in respiratory illness activity.
