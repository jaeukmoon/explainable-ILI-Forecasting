1. The past ILI occurrences between Week6, 2024 and Week10, 2024 demonstrate initial growth from 16110 in Week6 to a peak value of 18300 in Week9, followed by a sharp decrease to 16477 in Week10. This pattern indicates a fluctuation with a peak in Week9, after which ILI cases begin to decline but remain elevated above baseline.
2. Forecasting target Week15, 2024 belongs to the off-season based on historical seasonality patterns in the U.S., where typical peak seasons span until Week6. Week10, 2024 marked the transition into the off-season, showing declining ILI occurrences and reduced flu activity, consistent with the expected post-peak seasonal drop-off in Week15.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the observed trajectory of declining ILI counts from Week9 to Week10 suggests a continued downward trend in subsequent weeks. By Week15, 2024, this declining pattern is projected to stabilize around a lower baseline value, reflective of expected off-season conditions. From this, ILI occurrences are predicted to reach 8238, consistent with historical patterns of gradual reduction after peak activity.
4. The national trend of influenza positivity rates declined from 15.7% in Week6 to 13.9% in Week9, stabilizing at 15.4% in Week10. This aligns with the anticipated off-season drop in flu activity, pointing to lower ILI occurrences in subsequent weeks.
5. Vaccination efforts remain active, with vaccines aligned to circulating strains, though specific uptake trends were not reported. Reduced flu transmission due to ongoing vaccination may contribute to stabilizing lower ILI occurrences by Week15, 2024.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 persists, complicating the ILI landscape, but no novel influenza viruses have been detected, nor is there evidence of antiviral resistance driving increased activity. This stability is expected to help maintain declining ILI trends into the off-season (Week6-Week10, 2024).
7. Combining the observed dip in ILI occurrences after Week9, the off-season classification for Week15, declining nationwide flu positivity rates, and the mitigating effects of vaccination and antiviral treatments, a predicted ILI occurrence of 8238 aligns with these indicators.
