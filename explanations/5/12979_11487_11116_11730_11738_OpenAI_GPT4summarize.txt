1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating but overall steady trend, with values of ['12979', '11487', '11116', '11730', '11738']. There was a decline from 12979 (Week 37, 2021) to 11487 (Week 38, 2021), followed by another decrease to 11116 (Week 39, 2021). However, this was succeeded by a gradual rise to 11730 in Week 40, 2021, and 11738 in Week 41, 2021. This pattern indicates stabilization in ILI activity toward the end of the 5-week period.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the stabilization and slight increase in ILI numbers in Weeks 40 and 41, 2021, aligns with the marked increase in future occurrences to 16729 by Week 46, 2021. The upward adjustment observed in Weeks 40–41 acts as a base for the subsequent amplified respiratory illness activity in future weeks.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained relatively stable, with percentages slightly declining or stabilizing in the range of 1.9% to 1.8% from Week 37 to Week 41, 2021. However, subtle increases in Week 41, across age groups, may not have been fully reflected in immediate ILI numbers, suggesting a delayed surge leading to heightened future occurrences.  
   Other factors include:   
   a. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, dropping from 21.1% (Week 37, 2021) to 17.5% (Week 41, 2021) but remaining elevated due to COVID-19. Sustained PIC mortality signals broader respiratory illness activity contributing to the rise in ILI occurrences.
   b. Influenza virus circulation, while limited, showed minute but increasing detection in clinical and public health labs (e.g., 0.1% positivity in Weeks 40–41, 2021), suggesting initial activity that could escalate ILI diagnoses over time.  
   c. Shifts in healthcare-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighted across reports, disrupted traditional ILI surveillance and may have led to underestimations in past weeks, with subsequent delayed reporting amplifying future occurrences.

4. In summary, the reported 16729 future ILI occurrences (Week 46, 2021) can be attributed to the stabilization and early upward trends in Weeks 40–41, 2021, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, slight influenza positivity increases signaling upcoming activity, and the compounding effects of pandemic-driven shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors impacting ILI surveillance systems.
