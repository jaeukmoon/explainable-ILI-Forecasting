1. The reported ILI counts from Week16 to Week20, 2024 are 1755, 1808, 1864, 1881, and 1698. A slight increase is observed from Week16 (1755) to Week19 (1881), followed by a noticeable decline in Week20 (1698). This indicates an overall fluctuating trend with initial growth, peaking in Week19, and then decreasing. The fluctuations suggest transitioning toward a low-activity period.
2. Week25, 2024 occurs in the typical off-season for influenza in the U.S., as the off-season generally extends from Week9 to Week30. The consistently low outpatient ILI visits below baseline across the past five weeks, along with declining flu positivity rates (Week16, 2024 #3; Week17, 2024 #5; Week18, 2024 #3; Week19, 2024 #4; Week20, 2024 #3), aligns with off-season characteristics. Forecasting Week25, 2024 as off-season is consistent with these findings.
3. From a time-series perspective, the initial rise in ILI counts suggests residual flu activity during the early off-season, but the subsequent decline indicates further reduction in flu transmission. Based on the declining trend observed by Week20, 2024 and the typical behavior of ILI occurrences during the off-season, the projected ILI occurrences in Week25, 2024 settle around 1397, reflecting continued decreases with slight fluctuations.
4. Nationwide flu positivity decreased steadily from 4.8% in Week16, 2024 to 2% in Week20, 2024, with outpatient ILI visits remaining below baseline for seven consecutive weeks (Week16, 2024 #3; Week17, 2024 #5; Week18, 2024 #3; Week19, 2024 #4; Week20, 2024 #3). These declining trends in positivity and outpatient visits indicate reduced flu transmission, aligning with the lower projected ILI count.
5. Despite co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, no significant increases in respiratory illness have been reported (Week16, 2024 #10; Week17, 2024 #7; Week18, 2024 #10; Week19, 2024 #9; Week20, 2024 #9). This suggests that non-flu respiratory illnesses are not substantially driving ILI trends.
6. No novel influenza strains, such as H3N2v or B/Yamagata, have been detected, and reported strains remain consistent with the seasonal vaccine (Week16, 2024 #8; Week17, 2024 #7; Week18, 2024 #8; Week19, 2024 #9; Week20, 2024 #7). High levels of antiviral effectiveness further mitigate risks of unexpected flu surges (Week18, 2024 #7).
7. With declining flu positivity, stable co-circulating respiratory virus activity, reduced outpatient ILI visits below baseline, and the off-season classification for Week25, 2024, the prediction of 1397 ILI occurrences reflects a continuation of the downward trend in overall flu activity. These trends collectively support the projection.
