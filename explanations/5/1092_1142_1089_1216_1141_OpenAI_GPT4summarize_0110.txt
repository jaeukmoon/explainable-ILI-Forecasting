1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week29 to Week33, 2023 are 1092, 1142, 1089, 1216, and 1141. The data shows a slight increase between Week29 and Week30 (1092 to 1142), followed by a mild decline in Week31 (1089) and a notable spike in Week32 (1216), which then decreases slightly in Week33 (1141). This suggests a fluctuating but slightly upward trend overall, rather than a steady or consistent trajectory.
2. Week38, 2023 falls within the peak onset season based on flu activity patterns in the U.S. During this period (usually spanning Week35 to Week46), ILI activity typically begins to climb from off-season baseline levels (supported by Week29 to Week33, 2023 observations) toward peak season levels.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the mild increase observed between Week29 and Week33, 2023 hints at a progressive rise in ILI activity typical of transition periods into peak onset. Projecting this forward to Week38, 2023, the upward tendency aligns with the seasonal patterns, estimating a value of approximately 2035 ILI occurrences.
4. Positivity rates for influenza remain low but show regional and weekly fluctuations across Week29 (1.0%), Week30 (1.0%), Week31 (1.0%), Week32 (0.8%), and Week33 (0.5%), alongside continuing significant co-circulation of other respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV. These varied contributions likely influence the rising ILI rates while keeping them below full peak levels.
5. Novel variants were reported sporadically during Week30 and Week33, with cases of H3v and H1N2v linked to animal exposure but without sustained human transmission. Such sporadic, low-transmission variants could contribute marginally to localized increases in ILI cases but do not create widespread spikes in activity.
6. Despite minimal updates on vaccination trends, CDC continues to recommend flu vaccinations, and the post-summer period generally sees vaccination campaigns ramp up. Vaccination efforts could mitigate further surges in ILI despite a gradual seasonal increase in activity.
7. Based on the overall upward-trending ILI occurrences, the transition into the peak onset season (Week38, 2023), and influencing factors such as co-circulating respiratory viruses, stable vaccine recommendations, and sporadic novel variants, the forecasted ILI count of 2035 aligns with historical trends and contributing epidemiological dynamics.
