1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating and overall downward trend, with values of ['1623', '1519', '1386', '1170', '1239']. Starting from 1623 in Week 25, 2022, the values showed a consistent decline, reaching a low of 1170 in Week 28, 2022. However, there was a slight rebound to 1239 in Week 29, 2022. This general decrease, followed by stabilization, indicates subdued influenza-like activity toward the end of the observed period.
2. A positive correlation between the declining trend of past occurrences and the future reduction to 1253 after 5 weeks is apparent. The stabilization around Week 28–29, 2022, aligns with the minimal future increase compared to the significant drops observed in earlier weeks, suggesting that the reported occurrences of 1253 closely reflect the moderate ILI plateau seen toward the end of the interval.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI decreased slightly from 1.8% (Week 25, 2022) to 1.6% (Weeks 28–29, 2022), remaining consistently below the national baseline. This stable decline in healthcare-seeking behaviors for ILI resonates with the low and steady future occurrences of 1253.
4. Hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed influenza showed a sharp decline over the weeks, from 1307 (Week 25, 2022) to 586 (Week 29, 2022). This consistent reduction highlights decreasing severe cases of respiratory illnesses, corresponding to the moderate ILI level observed in the future.
5. Continued low positivity rates for influenza in clinical specimens, ranging from 1.8% (Week 25, 2022) to 0.7% (Weeks 27–29, 2022), point to diminished influenza activity nationwide. Furthermore, minimal activity in long-term care facilities (below 0.3% positivity) reinforces the subdued ILI occurrences observed in both past and future data.
6. The co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, alongside shifting healthcare-seeking behaviors post-COVID-19, compounded difficulties in ILI trend prediction. These disruptions likely contributed to the dynamic but ultimately moderate occurrence of 1253 in the future.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1253 can be attributed to the overall downward trend observed in Weeks 25–29, 2022, declining outpatient ILI visits and hospitalizations, persistently low influenza positivity rates, and the stabilizing effect of changing healthcare-seeking behaviors.
