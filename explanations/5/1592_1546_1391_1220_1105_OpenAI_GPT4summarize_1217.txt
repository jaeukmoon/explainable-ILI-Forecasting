1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks indicate a clear and consistent declining trend, with values of ['1592', '1546', '1391', '1220', '1105']. This steady decrease is evident throughout, with reductions of 46 (Week 23, 2023 to Week 24, 2023), 155 (Week 24, 2023 to Week 25, 2023), 171 (Week 25, 2023 to Week 26, 2023), and 115 (Week 26, 2023 to Week 27, 2023). This suggests a progressive reduction in influenza-like illness activity during these weeks.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 1216 reflects a halt in the downward trend seen in the past data. Specifically, the decrease in Week 27, 2023 (1105), aligns with a subsequent slight resurgence after 5 weeks. This correlation suggests that while the earlier trend showed declines, the upcoming weeks may have experienced stabilizing or increased activity, influenced by specific factors seen in the epidemiological context.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI demonstrated stability throughout the reports, from 1.6% (Week 23, 2023) to 1.3% (Week 27, 2023), yet showing slightly elevated rates among children under 5 years (e.g., 4.5% in Week 26, 2023 and 4.2% in Week 27, 2023). Increased rates among younger age groups, despite broader declines, likely contributed to the future ILI rebound. Hospitalization trends for influenza declined during Weeks 23–27, 2023 (from 850 in Week 23, 2023 to 641 in Week 27, 2023), showing continued illness severity persisting on a lower scale but not fully diminishing. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as COVID-19 and RSV during Weeks 23–27, 2023, as consistently highlighted, likely sustained non-influenza ILI activity contributing to the rebound by Week 32, 2023. Minimal influenza activity (e.g., 1.0%–1.2% positivity rates) alongside low lab-confirmed detections were observed; however, virus spread within susceptible groups, particularly Influenza A (H1N1), suggests the possibility of subsequent contributions to residual ILI cases reported after Week 32, 2023.
4. In summary, the reported 1216 future ILI occurrences (Week 32, 2023) followed a period of sustained declines through Weeks 23–27, 2023, but likely resulted from stabilizing activity influenced by elevated pediatric outpatient rates, continued hospitalization activity, co-circulating viruses like RSV and COVID-19, and limited but persisting Influenza A (H1N1) spread.
