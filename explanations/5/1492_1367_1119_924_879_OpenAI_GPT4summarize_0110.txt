1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week21 to Week25, 2024, show a consistent decrease: 1492 in Week21, 1367 in Week22, 1119 in Week23, 924 in Week24, and 879 in Week25. This indicates a clear declining trend in ILI activity over these weeks without any significant spikes or upward fluctuations, suggesting low transmission levels during this period.
2. Week30, 2024, falls within the off-season based on its timing relative to the U.S. influenza activity calendar. Historical data confirms that the off-season typically spans from Week9 to Week30, 2024, and CDC reports from Week21 to Week25 also indicate no significant changes or rising influenza activity, further verifying that Week30 is part of the off-season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consecutive decreases in ILI reports and the low, stable trends during Week21 to Week25 suggest a continuation of reduced activity. Projecting this trend five weeks forward indicates a further decline, stabilizing at lower numbers, leading to the forecast of 778 ILI occurrences in Week30, 2024.
4. Laboratory positivity for influenza has consistently declined, from 1.7% in Week21 to 1.1% in Week25, with no regions reporting moderate or higher activity (Week21 #1, Week22 #1, Week23 #1, Week24 #1, Week25 #1).
5. Vaccination effectiveness remains high, as genetic characterization studies confirm that circulating influenza strains match vaccine components, minimizing the risk of widespread transmission (Week21 #10, Week22 #13, Week25 #8).
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, continue to contribute variably to respiratory illness activity but have not triggered any upward trends in overall ILI levels (Week21 #12, Week22 #10, Week25 #10).
7. Combining the consistently declining ILI trend with the off-season classification, stable and low clinical positivity rates, high vaccine strain match, and lack of novel or resistant strains, the prediction of 778 ILI occurrences in Week30, 2024, aligns with current observations and expected low influenza activity.
