1. The reported ILI counts from Week28 to Week32, 2024 are 1025, 874, 930, 830, and 790. The trend demonstrates a consistent decline over the five weeks, with ILI occurrences dropping steadily. This reflects a gradual reduction in activity, with no evident spikes or anomalies to suggest increased flu transmission during this period.
2. In the U.S., the peak onset season typically begins around Week32 or 35. Week32, 2024 exhibits low influenza positivity and declining ILI activity (Week32, 2024 #1). Given this, the target week (Week37, 2024) is likely to fall within the peak onset season as it aligns with the historical seasonal pattern of slowly increasing influenza activity toward the peak season.
3. From the time-series perspective, the progressive decline in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks indicates reduced transmission. Yet, based on historical patterns, the onset of the peak season typically brings a gradual rise in ILI counts. Therefore, projecting forward to Week37, 2024, it is reasonable to anticipate increased activity compared to the last observed count (Week32, 2024: 790), aligning with a forecasted value of 1124 ILI occurrences.
4. Multiple factors in the CDC reports contribute to this forecast:
5. While overall flu activity remains low (Week28, 2024 #10; Week32, 2024 #1), the co-circulation of influenza, COVID-19, RSV, and other respiratory viruses continues to influence ILI trends (Week30, 2024 #6; Week32, 2024 #8). These interactions can cause subtle upticks in ILI numbers over time.
6. Vaccination effectiveness remains generally low, and vaccine coverage rates have not shown significant improvement (Week32, 2024 #9). This could allow for increased influenza cases once transmission begins to rise.
7. The transition into the peak onset season, combined with the CDC's emphasis on the potential co-circulation of variant influenza types (Week31, 2024 #8; Week32, 2024 #7), coincides with historical increases in ILI occurrences.
5. Ongoing influenza positivity rates remain below baseline nationwide, with only 0.4% (Week32, 2024 #1) positivity reported. However, this low positivity rate aligns with expectations for the beginning of peak onset season and does not contradict anticipated ILI increases in the coming weeks.
6. Hospitalization and death rates associated with influenza remain minimal (Week32, 2024 #5, #6), suggesting no significant stress on healthcare systems or dramatic surges in activity. This supports a projection of moderate ILI growth rather than an extreme spike.
7. A unified interpretation of these factors—the declining ILI trend, peak onset season timing, co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, low vaccine effectiveness, and the gradual shift from offseason to higher activity—justifies the projection of 1124 ILI occurrences for Week37, 2024.
