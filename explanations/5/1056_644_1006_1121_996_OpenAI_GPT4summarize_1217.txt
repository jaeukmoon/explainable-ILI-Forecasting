1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend without a clear upward or downward trajectory, with values of ['1056', '644', '1006', '1121', '996']. There was a significant drop from 1056 (Week 20, 2023) to 644 (Week 21, 2023), followed by a sharp increase to 1006 (Week 22, 2023) and continued rise to 1121 (Week 23, 2023), before dropping again to 996 (Week 24, 2023). This inconsistency highlights fluctuating respiratory illness activity during the observation period.
2. There appears to be a delayed correlation between the past and future occurrences, as the future ILI occurrence of 646 (Week 29, 2023) aligns with the declining trend noted in Week 24, 2023 (996). This suggests a continuation of the downturn in activity seen toward the end of the past 5 weeks, albeit at a much lower level.
3. Hospitalizations for influenza consistently decreased over the 5 weeks, from 939 (Week 20, 2023) to 779 (Week 24, 2023). This downward trend in severe cases correlates with reduced future ILI occurrences.
4. Virologic testing also showed declining influenza positivity rates across the weeks, moving from 1.2% (Week 21, 2023) to 1.1% by Week 24, 2023, with minimal new virus detections, indicating waning influenza circulation contributing to lower future occurrences.
5. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily declined, from 2.0% (Week 20, 2023) to 1.5% (Week 24, 2023), reflecting reduced healthcare visits for respiratory symptoms and aligning with future ILI activity levels.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 646 (Week 29, 2023) can be attributed to the fluctuating, yet ultimately declining ILI pattern in the past, the consistent decrease in influenza positivity, hospitalization rates, and outpatient ILI visits, which collectively indicate a tapering respiratory illness activity toward the end of the observation period.
