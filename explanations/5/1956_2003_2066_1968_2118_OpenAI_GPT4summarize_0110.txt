1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week13 to Week17, 2021, are 1956, 2003, 2066, 1968, and 2118. This suggests mild fluctuations, with a slight increase observed from Week13 (1956) to Week15 (2066), followed by a marginal dip in Week16 (1968), and then a rise in Week17 (2118). Overall, the trend is relatively stable, showing no significant spikes but minor variations around a fairly consistent range.
2. Week22, 2021, occurs during the off-season for influenza activity in the U.S., as it falls well outside the typical peak season, which typically lasts from Week46 to Week6 of the following year. The exceptionally low influenza positivity rates and minimal ILI activity (Week13, 2021 #1; Week14, 2021 #1; Week15, 2021 #6) also reaffirm the off-season classification during this period.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the pattern of stability with small fluctuations observed from Week13 to Week17, 2021, suggests that future ILI activity will likely remain within a similar range. Based on this historical data, projecting forward five weeks, ILI occurrences are expected to settle at 1867, reflecting the continuation of a stable off-season trend with no major shifts.
4. Influenza activity remained unusually low nationwide, with positivity rates as low as 0.1% throughout Week13 to Week17, 2021, indicating negligible influenza spread (Week13, 2021 #1; Week14, 2021 #1; Week15, 2021 #1; Week16, 2021 #1; Week17, 2021 #1).
5. Pandemic-related healthcare changes and concurrent SARS-CoV-2 circulation significantly altered healthcare-seeking behaviors and data interpretation, reducing observable ILI activity and complicating influenza surveillance (Week13, 2021 #8; Week14, 2021 #6; Week15, 2021 #8; Week16, 2021 #9; Week17, 2021 #9).
6. The persistently low cumulative hospitalization and outpatient ILI visit rates (0.8 per 100,000 and 1.1%, respectively) across all weeks reaffirm minimal community spread of influenza, consistent with the off-season classification (Week13, 2021 #4; Week14, 2021 #7; Week15, 2021 #4; Week16, 2021 #4; Week17, 2021 #4, #7).
7. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrences of 1867 for Week22, 2021, are justified by the stable and low past trends, the off-season timing, and minimal influenza activity due to reduced spread, altered healthcare behaviors, and concurrent SARS-CoV-2 impact. These factors collectively suggest no substantial deviations from the ongoing low prevalence.
