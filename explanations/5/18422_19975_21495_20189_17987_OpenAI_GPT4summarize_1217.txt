1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating trend with values ['18422', '19975', '21495', '20189', '17987']. The series began with an increase from 18422 (Week 31, 2021) to a peak of 21495 (Week 33, 2021), followed by a decline to 20189 (Week 34, 2021) and further to 17987 (Week 35, 2021). This indicates an overall reduction in ILI activity towards the later weeks of the period after an initial rise.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 11730 (Week 40, 2021) correlate with the downward trend seen in Weeks 34–35, 2021. The sharp decline in ILI activity toward the end of the 5-week series aligns with the significant reduction in occurrences after 5 weeks, suggesting continuity in the diminishing trend.
3. CDC reports consistently highlighted minimal influenza virus circulation, with laboratory detections at near-zero levels throughout Weeks 31–35, 2021, leaving most ILI cases attributable to other respiratory viruses. This minimal influenza activity aligns with the observed reduction to 11730 future occurrences.
4. Weekly outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline (2.6%) across all regions during Weeks 31–35, 2021, with visits diminishing from 2.2% (Week 34) to 0.9% (Week 35). This decline in ILI healthcare encounters strongly correlates with the reduction in future ILI occurrences.
5. Persistent changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic—as highlighted in every weekly report—significantly impacted ILI surveillance reliability during Weeks 31–35, 2021, potentially influencing the reduced reporting and contributing to the observed drop in future occurrences.
6. In summary, the decline to 11730 future ILI occurrences (Week 40, 2021) is attributable to the overall downward trend in Weeks 34–35, 2021, minimal influenza activity with low positivity rates, a sharp decline in ILI outpatient visit percentages, and ongoing pandemic-driven changes in healthcare behaviors disrupting traditional ILI surveillance.
