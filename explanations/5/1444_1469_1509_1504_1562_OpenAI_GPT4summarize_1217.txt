1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a general upward trend, with values of ['1444', '1469', '1509', '1504', '1562']. Week29, 2024, started at 1444, progressing to 1469 in Week30, 2024, and steadily increasing to 1509 by Week31, 2024. Although there was a slight dip to 1504 in Week32, 2024, this was followed by a rise to 1562 in Week33, 2024. This pattern demonstrates a consistent increase in ILI activity, particularly in the last week of the 5-week period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the observed increasing trend in past ILI occurrences (Weeks29–33, 2024) and the future value of 2656 after 5 weeks. The persistent rise, especially from 1509 (Week31, 2024) to 1562 (Week33, 2024), suggests progressive escalation in ILI activity, aligning with the reported spike to 2656.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently below baseline but stable at 1.4% (Week29, 2024) to 1.5% (Weeks30–33, 2024), suggesting steady transmission of respiratory illnesses. This gradual stability corresponds with the observed rise in future ILI occurrences. Increased reports of human infections with novel influenza variants, such as H5 (Week29, 2024), H3N2v (Week31, 2024), and H1N1v/H1N2v (Week33, 2024), indicate zoonotic spillover risks that potentially amplify future cases. Continued co-circulation of respiratory pathogens like COVID-19, RSV, and influenza across all weeks could elevate ILI levels due to overlapping seasonal activity.
4. Low but persistent influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.7% in Weeks29–30, 2024; 0.6% in Week31, 2024; 0.4% in Weeks32–33, 2024), coupled with ongoing genetic variants and minimal resistance to antivirals, suggest background influenza transmission that, combined with other respiratory illnesses, might explain the significant rise to 2656.
5. In summary, the reported 2656 future ILI occurrences (5 weeks after Week33, 2024) can be attributed to the consistent upward trend in ILI activity during Weeks29–33, 2024, stable outpatient visit rates for ILI, increased human infections with novel variants, co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, and background influenza transmission. The interplay of these factors plausibly predicts the observed rise in future occurrences.
