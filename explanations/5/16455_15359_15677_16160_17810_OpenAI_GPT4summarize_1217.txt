1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a generally fluctuating yet growing trend, with values of ['16455', '15359', '15677', '16160', '17810']. The initial dip from 16455 (Week36, 2023) to 15359 (Week37, 2023) was followed by varied increases, ultimately reaching 17810 (Week40, 2023), the highest value in this period. This upward trajectory signals a gradual intensification of ILI activity by the end of the recorded weeks.
2. A positive correlation between past and future occurrences is evident as the gradual rise during Weeks39-40, 2023, culminated in the significantly elevated future value of 28832 (5 weeks later). The growth toward Week40 suggests increasing transmission or reporting of ILI, which mirrors the sharp future rise.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistent at or near 2.0%-2.2% but exhibited increases among children aged 0-4 years, rising from 6.5% (Week36, 2023) to 7.1% (Week39, 2023). The steady engagement of pediatric critical demographics with respiratory illness contributes to the amplified increase in future ILI occurrences.
4. Cumulative influenza-related hospitalizations rose significantly during the observation period, from 775 (Week36, 2023) to 1127 (Week40, 2023). This continuing rise in severe respiratory illness correlates with greater future ILI burdens.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, detailed in all weeks, amplified regional ILI trends and likely contributed to the higher future value by complicating diagnosis and reporting patterns. Combined respiratory virus impacts can intensify observed ILI data.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 28832 (Week45, 2023) are attributable to the upward trend in ILI activity across Weeks36-40, increasing outpatient visits and hospitalizations, pediatric-specific vulnerabilities, and compounded impacts of multi-respiratory virus co-circulation.
