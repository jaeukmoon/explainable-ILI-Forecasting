1. The reported ILI counts from Week30 to Week34, 2021 are 1036, 1077, 1043, 1040, and 1101. The trend shows a mild upward trajectory, with a consistent increase between Week30 (1036) and Week31 (1077), followed by near-stability in Weeks32 and 33 (1043, 1040), and another rise in Week34 (1101). Overall, the pattern indicates a slightly increasing trend, suggesting an early shift toward higher respiratory illness activity.
2. Forecasting target Week39, 2021 aligns with the peak onset season, as it falls between Weeks35 and 46 when flu activity begins rising before the peak season. The observed increase in ILI across all age groups (Week33, 2021 #2; Week34, 2021 #2) and signs of respiratory virus transmission support the classification.
3. The slightly increasing trend in past ILI occurrences suggests a gradual rise in respiratory activity. Applying a time-series forecasting perspective, the pattern projects moderate growth over the next five weeks, leading to a prediction of 975 ILI occurrences by Week39, 2021. The projection factors in this gradual rise while noting potential variability.
4. Rising outpatient ILI visits have been noted for several weeks, with activity exceeding regional baselines in specific areas (Week30, 2021 #7; Week34, 2021 #3; Week34, 2021 #8), reflecting growing transmission of respiratory illnesses, even though influenza remains minimal.
5. The co-existence of non-influenza viruses, particularly SARS-CoV-2, drives overall respiratory illness severity (Week30, 2021 #6; Week33, 2021 #3; Week34, 2021 #4), boosting ILI counts despite low influenza circulation.
6. CDC cautions that healthcare-seeking behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic (Week31, 2021 #8; Week33, 2021 #9; Week34, 2021 #8) and rising regional respiratory virus transmission (Week33, 2021 #8) influence higher ILI trends, further supporting the expected increase by Week39, 2021.
7. In summary, the projection of 975 ILI occurrences for Week39, 2021, is supported by a gradually rising trend in recent ILI occurrences, the classification of the week within the peak onset season, and contributing CDC-reported factors, including non-influenza respiratory activity, changing healthcare-seeking behavior, and increasing regional ILI activity. Together, these elements point towards continued moderate growth in ILI counts.
