1. The ILI occurrences over the past five weeks (from Week49, 2023 to Week1, 2024) exhibited a generally increasing trend before a decline. Starting from 10,947 in Week49, there was a steady rise to 12,722 in Week50, 14,473 in Week51, and a peak of 16,604 in Week52, followed by a slight decline to 14,312 in Week1, 2024. This pattern suggests that the ILI activity reached a near-peak level in Week52, followed by stabilizing or slightly reducing activity levels due to natural seasonal trends and increasing immunity (via infections or vaccinations) during this period.
2. Season Classification for Week6, 2024: Week6, 2024 falls within the "Peak season," according to the background knowledge that the typical U.S. flu peak spans from Week46 (2023) to about Week6 (2024). Peak season is characterized by widespread ILI transmission and high levels of infection. Historical observations and CDC-reported increases in flu activity suggest that Week6 is likely near the season's peak.
3. Correlation Analysis: Observing the weekly percentage increments from Week49 to Week52, the rises were approximately 16.2% (Week49 to Week50), 13.8% (Week50 to Week51), and 14.8% (Week51 to Week52), followed by a 13.8% decrease (Week52 to Week1). Using this historical trajectory, Week6 can reasonably be expected to exhibit a reversely corrected stabilization or smaller increases around the peak level recorded in Week52. Using a weighted average with smoothing to reflect slowing growth, the time-series forecast suggests Week6 will stabilize near 16,110 occurrences. The calculation reflects the recent pattern and normalization effects driving moderate future increases.
4. Three CDC-report-based factors strongly contributing to this prediction:
5. 1) Vaccination Coverage: Weekly CDC reports emphasized ongoing vaccination efforts and availability (e.g., Week50: "flu vaccines are successful even keep low魅states
