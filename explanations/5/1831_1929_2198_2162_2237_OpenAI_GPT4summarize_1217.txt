1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a gradual upward trajectory, starting at 1831 (Week22, 2021) and culminating at 2237 (Week26, 2021). Despite minor fluctuations, such as the slight decline from 2198 (Week24, 2021) to 2162 (Week25, 2021), the overall trend indicates growth in ILI activity by Week26, 2021, which forms the basis for the observed jump in occurrences after 5 weeks.
2. A clear positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences. The steady increase from 1831 (Week22, 2021) to 2237 (Week26, 2021) aligns with the subsequent surge to 3108 occurrences after 5 weeks, indicating that the pattern in the later weeks acts as a precursor to this amplified reporting.
3. PIC mortality rates consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds (e.g., 7.5% in Week22, 2021, 7.6% in Week23, 2021, and 6.2% in Week26, 2021), even though COVID-19 remained the primary driver. This sustained respiratory illness burden likely contributed to the rising ILI occurrences.
4. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as repeatedly emphasized across Weeks22–26, 2021, disrupted ILI data accuracy and interpretation. These disruptions likely resulted in under-recognition of cases during prior weeks and a subsequent concentrated rise in occurrences in future weeks.
5. Despite minimal influenza circulation identified through virologic testing (e.g., positivity rates below 0.1% throughout Weeks22–26, 2021), rising outpatient ILI visits (increased slightly in select age groups such as children aged 0–4 years during Weeks24–25, 2021) signal an upward trend in non-specific respiratory illnesses. This progressive increase is reflected in the future occurrences at 3108.
6. In summary, the reported 3108 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks can be attributed to the gradual increase observed in the past time-series data, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, healthcare-seeking disruptions, and increasing outpatient visits for ILI, all potentially impacted by pandemic-related dynamics despite minimal influenza activity.
