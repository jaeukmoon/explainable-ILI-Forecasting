1. The reported ILI counts from Week48 to Week52, 2023 are 11568, 12889, 14970, 17393, and 18744. This demonstrates a clear and steep upward trend in ILI occurrences over the five weeks, with sustained and significant increases each week. This growth aligns with a typical peak season surge and heightened activity during this period.
2. Forecasting target week (Week5, 2024) belongs to the peak season as it falls within the typical peak activity range (Week46, 2023 to Week6, 2024). The current trends of elevated influenza positivity rates, hospitalizations, and outpatient visits at Week52, 2023 strongly suggest continuing intensity into Week5, 2024.
3. The time-series data shows continuous increases in ILI occurrences. Using a time-series forecasting model based on this trend, the projection logically reflects stabilization around the national peak, followed by a slight decline in Week5, 2024 as activity eases from the highest levels. This aligns with historical patterns where peak activity often stabilizes slightly before waning.
4. The increasing influenza positivity rate with 17.5% of respiratory specimens testing positive in Week52, 2023 (compared to 6.8% in Week48, 2023) indicates a growing epidemic curve likely persisting in the near term, with Week5, 2024 experiencing residual high transmission levels.
5. Vaccination rates remain suboptimal amid active viral transmission, as indicated by the CDC's continued encouragement for vaccination in Week52, 2023. Influenza activity is predominantly driven by Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, a well-matched vaccine strain (Week52, 2023 #7, #13). Despite this, the expected late-season vaccination benefits may partially offset severity in subsequent weeks.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, synergistically contributes to increased ILI reports. This trend of elevated respiratory illness is evident as of Week52, 2023 (Week52, 2023 #10, #15) and aligns with historical patterns of respiratory illness peaking or remaining high during concurrent viral spread.
7. Given the steep increase in historical ILI trends, ongoing peak-season activity, elevated influenza positivity rates, and compounding impacts of co-circulating viruses, the forecast projects a slight decline from Week52, 2023 occurrences to 12486 in Week5, 2024. These factors collectively justify the projected value while acknowledging the peak season's gradual tapering effect.
