1. The reported ILI counts from Week45 to Week49, 2023 are 1472, 1860, 1961, 2458, and 2854. The trend shows a consistent week-over-week increase. This upward trajectory suggests the amplification of influenza activity in this period, transitioning toward the annual peak season. The weekly rise became more pronounced from Week47 (2458) to Week49 (2854), reflecting intensification in ILI prevalence.
2. Forecasting target week (Week2, 2024) belongs to the peak season. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans from Week46 to Week6. Week2, 2024 falls within this range, and recent data from Week45 to Week49, 2023, confirm significant increases in ILI activity, bolstered by escalating positivity and hospitalization rates. These dynamics align with and consolidate the peak seasonal trajectory.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the observed linear growth pattern in Weeks45 to Week49, 2023, is projected forward into Week2, 2024. The weekly rise and absence of any stabilizing signals indicate that similar increases can be expected. Analytical extrapolation from Week49 (2854) corroborates the likelihood of continued growth, resulting in the projection of 3059 occurrences for Week2, 2024.
4. Regional influenza activity has progressively heightened (Week45-Week49, 2023), particularly in the southeast, south-central, and west coast areas, as evidenced by test positivity rising from 4.0% (Week45) to 10.2% (Week49). This consistent surge strongly suggests further escalation in cases leading up to Week2, 2024.
5. Hospitalization rates have steadily climbed during Weeks45-Week49, with a notable cumulative increase to 8.0 per 100,000 by Week49, signaling amplified severity and sustained influenza transmission. Elderly populations (65+) exhibit particularly concerning hospitalization trends, indicative of widespread and severe influenza activity.
6. Influenza A(H1N1), which has dominated subtypes (ranging from 74.1%-87.2%) throughout Weeks45-Week49, is associated with more severe outbreaks and is currently driving high viral spread. This predominance underlines anticipated continuity in elevated cases through Week2, 2024.
7. Summarily, the prediction of 3059 ILI occurrences for Week2, 2024, is supported by the consistent upward trajectory in recent occurrences, Week2's classification within the peak season window, and corroborative factors such as climbing test positivity, hospitalization rates, dominance of A(H1N1), and regional increases. These data collectively indicate sustained growth in ILI activity at a steady pace leading to the target week.
