1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a non-linear pattern with an overall increase followed by a decline, represented by values ['1772', '1874', '2104', '2919', '2533']. The increase from 1772 (Week49, 2021) to 2919 (Week51, 2021) signified a sharp rise in ILI activity, peaking in Week51. However, the drop to 2533 (Week52, 2021) indicates a partial decline, suggesting variable but elevated ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period.
2. The sharp increase observed from 1772 (Week49, 2021) to 2919 (Week51, 2021) aligns with declining influenza activity noted after Week52, 2021, based on summarized reports. This trend correlates with the reported drop to 888 future ILI occurrences by Week6, 2022. The decline in Week52's ILI values serves as a precursor to the significant reduction projected after 5 weeks.
3. With outpatient respiratory illness visits elevated persistently above baseline—rising from 2.7% in Week49, 2021, to 4.8% in Week52, 2021—but subsequently dropping to 4.3% in Week1, 2022, the short-term surge in outpatient incidence appears to drive the earlier peak while reflecting in the ultimate reduction in ILI occurrences.
4. Hospitalization rates for influenza increased cumulatively from 1.4 per 100,000 (Week50, 2021) to 3.4 per 100,000 by Week1, 2022, with adults over 65 being particularly affected. However, the slowing of hospitalizations toward Week1, 2022, suggests a subsequent decline in ILI-related burden, reinforced by ongoing vaccination promotion and antiviral use.
5. Despite lower overall flu vaccination uptake, vaccinations targeting Influenza A(H3N2)—the predominant strain—showed some efficacy. By Week1, 2022, reports of lower flu positivity rates (2.2%) and minimal resistance to antiviral treatments further contributed to the sharp decrease in future ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported decline to 888 future ILI occurrences (Week6, 2022) reflects the downward trajectory seen from Week52, 2021, onward, characterized by reductions in outpatient visits and flu positivity rates, stabilized hospitalization rates, and the impact of mitigative measures like vaccines and antivirals.
