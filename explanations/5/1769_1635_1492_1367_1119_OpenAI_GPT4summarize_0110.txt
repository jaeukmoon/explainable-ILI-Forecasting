1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week19 to Week23, 2024 are 1769, 1635, 1492, 1367, and 1119. The trend shows a consistent decline over the 5 weeks, with a decrease of 652 cases from Week19 to Week23. This steady drop aligns with a typical decline in ILI activity during the off-season, as flu prevalence diminishes after the peak season concludes. No significant spikes or unusual deviations were observed during this period.
2. Based on the historical season classification, the target week (Week28, 2024) is within the off-season for influenza activity in the U.S., as it falls well between the peak season (Week46, 2023 to Week6, 2024) and the expected peak onset season (Week32 to Week46, 2024). The consistently low influenza positivity rates and hospitalization data further reinforce its off-season classification.
3. From the time-series perspective, the continuous decline in ILI occurrences from Week19 to Week23, 2024, suggests a decreasing trajectory. Extending this pattern forward over the next 5 weeks, a stabilization at a lower baseline is anticipated. The ILI count of 841 in Week28, 2024, is aligned with the projected off-season trough, reflecting a continued reduction in activity following existing trends.
4. Nationwide influenza positivity has steadily declined (Week19, 2024: 2.4%; Week23, 2024: 1.6%), highlighting minimal transmission during this period and supporting a forecast of low ILI occurrence. Vaccination trends have not shown significant changes, but circulating viruses match vaccine components (Week21, 2024 #10; Week22, 2024 #13), suggesting stable protection against influenza. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and RSV contributes minimally during periods of reduced flu transmission (Week19, 2024 #9; Week22, 2024 #10; Week23, 2024 #9).
5. Pediatric mortality and hospitalization rates remain low and stable across the past 5 weeks (Week19, 2024 #5, #6; Week20, 2024 #5; Week23, 2024 #4), confirming a period of diminished flu burden. With no novel influenza virus detections (Week20, 2024 #7; Week22, 2024 #8; Week23, 2024 #7) and minimal antiviral resistance reported (Week21, 2024 #11; Week22, 2024 #11), further abrupt shifts in ILI activity are unlikely.
6. Outpatient respiratory illness visits remain consistently below baseline over this period (Week19, 2024 #4; Week23, 2024 #6), reflecting low community spread and aligning with expected low ILI occurrences during the off-season.
7. Considering the declining trend in ILI occurrences, the off-season timing of Week28, 2024, low flu positivity rates, effective vaccine match, and stable co-circulating respiratory patterns, the forecast of 841 ILI cases is justified as a continuation of seasonal low influenza activity.
