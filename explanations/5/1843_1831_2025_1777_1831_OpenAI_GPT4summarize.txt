1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed fluctuations within a narrow range, without a clear upward or downward trend. The values are ['1843', '1831', '2025', '1777', '1831'], corresponding to Week 18, 2021, to Week 22, 2021. There was an initial slight decrease from 1843 in Week 18 to 1831 in Week 19, followed by a notable increase to 2025 in Week 20, and then another drop to 1777 in Week 21, stabilizing again at 1831 in Week 22. This irregular pattern indicates variable ILI activity with no definitive directional trend over the observed period.

2. A weak correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the fluctuating pattern during Weeks 18–22, 2021, does not directly align with the prominent increase to 2197 future ILI occurrences in Week 27, 2021. However, the peak observed at Week 20 (2025) and stabilization by Week 22 (1831) may foreshadow the uptick reported in future weeks, suggesting the potential for delayed amplification of ILI activity.

3. Reports from the summarized CDC data highlight several influential factors correlating with the future increase in ILI occurrences:  
   - Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained around 1.2% to 1.3% during Weeks 18–22, 2021. Although below the national baseline, slight increases (e.g., a rise of 0.1% in Week 20) in certain age groups, such as 0–4 years, may reflect early signs of rising respiratory illness activity.
   - Sustained disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have delayed accurate reporting or led to misclassification of other respiratory illnesses as ILI cases. This limitation impacts ILI surveillance trends and likely contributed to the sharp increase in reported future occurrences.
   - Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained above epidemic thresholds during the period, accounting for 10.9% (Week 18) to 7.5% (Week 22). High mortality rates linked to respiratory illnesses suggest persistent transmission of respiratory infections, likely contributing to the elevated future ILI rates.

4. In summary, the future increase to 2197 ILI occurrences (Week 27, 2021) can be attributed to the variable but sustained ILI activity seen in the past weeks, modest increases in outpatient ILI visits among specific subgroups, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and the continued influence of disrupted healthcare-seeking behavior and data accuracy during the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors collectively align with the observed rise in future ILI occurrences.
