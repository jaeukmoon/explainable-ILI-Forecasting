1. The reported past ILI counts from Week8 to Week12, 2021 are 1013, 975, 949, 1099, and 1213. These reflect an overall rising trend, with notable increases particularly in Weeks11 and 12, 2021 (1099 to 1213). This indicates a reversal of the earlier declining trend (Week8 to Week10, 2021), signaling a slight upward trajectory heading into Week17, 2021.
2. Week17, 2021 belongs to the off-season based on U.S. seasonality patterns. Influenza activity during Weeks8–12, 2021 remained significantly low, well below typical peak-season levels. Additionally, CDC reports no indicators of a transition to a peak onset season, reinforcing its classification as off-season.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the shift from declining occurrences (Weeks8–10, 2021) to an upward trend (Weeks11–12, 2021) suggests potential continued growth. Extrapolating this trajectory over five weeks forecasts higher ILI occurrences compared to Week12, 2021, consistent with 1558 cases in Week17, 2021. The fluctuation aligns with a gradual adjustment returning toward baseline for off-season activity.
4. CDC reports of minimal Influenza A and B positivity (Week8, 2021 #1; Week12, 2021 #1, #3) suggest that a sharp resurgence of influenza is unlikely. Positive respiratory specimens remained ≤0.1% over the five weeks, indicating low virus circulation.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior remains altered due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Week8, 2021 #10; Week9, 2021 #10; Week12, 2021 #10). This complicates interpretation of outpatient ILI visits, but such behaviors may have led to underreporting earlier in the season, with trends now adjusting upward.
6. The slight increasing trend in ILI visits among children aged 0-4 years (Week9, 2021 #9; Week12, 2021 #5) may be contributing to the overall rise by Week12, 2021. Pediatric age groups can serve as early indicators of broader population trends, which supports projected increases in Week17, 2021.
7. Although influenza activity remains low, CDC notes a potential for increased flu activity in coming months (Week10, 2021 #9; Week12, 2021 #10). Combined with rising ILI trends and behavioral adjustments, Week17, 2021 likely reflects continued modest growth from Week12, 2021, aligning with 1558 occurrences.
