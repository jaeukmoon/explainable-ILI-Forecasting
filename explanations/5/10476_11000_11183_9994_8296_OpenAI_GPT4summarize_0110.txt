1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week7, 2024 to Week11, 2024 are 10476, 11000, 11183, 9994, and 8296. Initially, there was a consistent increase in ILI counts from Week7 (10476) to Week9 (11183). However, a noticeable decrease followed from Week10 (9994) to Week11 (8296). This trend indicates a peak in Week9 and suggests a pattern of declining ILI activity following that peak.
2. Forecasting that Week16, 2024 belongs to the off-season aligns with the observed national trends. The drop in positivity and hospitalization rates in recent weeks, along with the typical seasonality patterns, confirms that influenza activity is decreasing and transitioning to minimal levels of prevalence.
3. From the time-series perspective, the trend observed during Week7 to Week11 shows a peaked curve followed by a sharp decline. Extrapolating this downward trajectory five weeks forward to Week16, the projected ILI occurrences continue to drop significantly, leading to the forecasted value of 4962.
4. Influenza positivity in clinical labs decreased nationally from 15.4% in Week10 to 12.0% in Week11, with a decreasing trend in ILI-related outpatient visits nationally from 3.7% in Week10 to 3.4% in Week11, showcasing a downward trend in ILI activity.
5. High cumulative vaccination efforts continue to provide protective immunity, with reported alignment of the vaccine against circulating influenza strains, helping mitigate the spread of influenza viruses (Week7-Week11 #7, #8, #10).
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses such as RSV and COVID-19 persist, but their combined impact shows a reduced burden on respiratory illness trends compared to earlier weeks, aligning with the general waning of respiratory activity (Week7-Week11 #9, #11, #13).
7. In summary, the predicted 4962 occurrences for Week16, 2024 result from the consistent decline in ILI activity post-peak in Week9, 2024, coupled with decreasing influenza positivity, well-matched vaccines, and co-circulating respiratory viruses becoming less impactful. This projection aligns with historical patterns and key factors indicating a transition to the off-season.
