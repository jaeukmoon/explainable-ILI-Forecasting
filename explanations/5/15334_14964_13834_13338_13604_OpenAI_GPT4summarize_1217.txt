1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a general downward trend with minor fluctuations, with values of ['15334', '14964', '13834', '13338', '13604']. The data begins at a peak of 15334 (Week 11, 2024), consistently declining to 13338 by Week 14, 2024. A slight increase to 13604 in Week 15, 2024 indicates a marginal resurgence in activity, but the overall decline suggests waning influenza activity during this period.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 13038 (Week 20, 2024) aligns with the declining trend in Weeks 11–15, 2024. The consistent reduction over the observed period coupled with only mild fluctuations supports a continuation of this trend. Additionally, the reported value of 13038 reflects a trajectory consistent with the steady decline observed in the latter weeks, albeit at a slightly slower pace.
3. Declining outpatient visits for ILI from 3.4% (Week 11, 2024) to 2.5% (Week 15, 2024) underscore reduced ILI healthcare encounters, correlating with reduced future ILI occurrences. Reduced percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, dropping from 12.0% (Week 11, 2024) to 5.9% (Week 15, 2024), complements this decline. Nationwide decreases in influenza hospitalizations, demonstrated by a rise in cumulative rates but weekly declines, also reflect the waning influenza season and align with the lower reported future ILI. Additionally, co-circulation of influenza, RSV, and COVID-19 continued but showed indications of diminished overall impact on ILI trends, further supporting a decrease in future occurrences.
4. Nationwide decreases in influenza positivity rates, hospitalizations, and outpatient visits collectively emphasize a waning flu season that corresponds to the lower value of 13038 occurrences. Concurrently, regional variability in ILI trends likely moderates sharper declines, resulting in the observed future count. Stabilization of mortality rates and ongoing vaccination efforts also contribute to the subdued activity in future weeks.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 13038 (Week 20, 2024) reflects the declining trend in past weeks (Weeks 11–15, 2024), reduced outpatient visits, declining positivity rates, and diminishing hospitalizations. Stabilizing mortality rates and persistent regional variability add to the explanation, highlighting the continuous steady decline in ILI activity driven by a waning influenza season and overlapping respiratory illness contributions.
