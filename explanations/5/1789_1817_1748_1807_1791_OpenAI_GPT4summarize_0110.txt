1. The reported ILI counts from Week21 to Week25, 2021, are 1789, 1817, 1748, 1807, and 1791. The trend indicates a stable pattern with minor fluctuations, as values vary slightly around an average of approximately 1790, with no significant increases or decreases observed over this period.
2. Based on epidemiological season definitions, Week30, 2021, falls within the off-season. Influenza activity remains low nationwide (Week21–Week25, 2021 #1, Week24, 2021 #10), and no indications emerge of any significant increase in ILI activity associated with the peak onset or peak seasons.
3. Evaluating the historical time-series trends, the stable nature of the ILI occurrences between Week21–Week25, 2021, suggests that future ILI trends (including Week30, 2021) are unlikely to deviate significantly from this consistency. A time-series forecasting model would extend this stable trend forward, resulting in a projected moderate increase to 3354 occurrences.
4. Low nationwide influenza activity persists, with positivity rates well below the baseline of 2.6% across Weeks21–Week25, 2021 (Week21 #1, Week22 #1, Week25 #3), supported by negligible influenza detections in public health labs (Week22 #2, Week24 #3, Week25 #2). These trends confirm minimal influenza transmission during this time.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior has been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to reduced outpatient respiratory visits and altered ILI data collection (Week21 #7, Week22 #7, Week24 #7, Week25 #8). This ongoing impact prevents sudden surges in influenza data.
6. CDC anticipates minimal influenza activity due to simultaneous tracking of SARS-CoV-2 and reduced flu transmission levels (Week21 #10, Week23 #10, Week25 #9). The lack of updates on influenza-related hospitalization rates (Week21 #6, Week24 #9) and vaccination data (Week22 #6, Week25 #7) further underscore continued suppressed ILI activity levels.
7. Overall, the projected ILI count of 3354 aligns with the stable historical trend from Weeks21–Week25, 2021, the classification of Week30, 2021, as off-season, and key CDC factors such as minimal influenza positivity, altered healthcare behaviors, and steady low-level activity.
