1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1543', '1196', '1122', '898', '845']. A significant decline was observed, starting at 1543 in Week25, 2022, and ending at 845 in Week29, 2022, reflecting an overall decrease in ILI activity during this period.
2. The downward trend in ILI occurrences correlates with the reported low future occurrence of 679 by Week34, 2022. The consistent drop in Week25–Week29, 2022, aligns with this future decline, demonstrating continuity in the reduction of influenza-related activity.
3. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza declined from 1.8% (Week25, 2022) to 0.7% (Week29, 2022), indicating a sustained reduction in influenza activity, which likely influenced the low future ILI occurrences.
4. Weekly influenza hospitalizations steadily decreased from 1307 (Week25, 2022) to 586 (Week29, 2022). This significant drop in hospital admissions for laboratory-confirmed influenza suggests reduced severe cases, contributing to the low future occurrence of 679.
5. Minimal nationwide influenza activity was reported throughout the 5 weeks, with 45 jurisdictions reporting minimal activity in Week25, 2022, and 48 jurisdictions in Week28, 2022. This widespread low activity, coupled with altered healthcare behaviors due to the pandemic, likely suppressed ILI case reporting and impacted future trends.
6. In summary, the future occurrence of 679 (Week34, 2022) resulted from the consistent downward trend in Weeks25–29, 2022, reduced influenza positivity rates, declining hospitalizations, and minimal national influenza activity, all compounded by evolving healthcare-seeking behaviors.
