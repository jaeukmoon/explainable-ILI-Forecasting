1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent downward trend, with values ['14344', '13771', '13570', '13067', '11626']. Starting at 14,344 during Week 27, 2022, the counts steadily declined across all subsequent weeks, ultimately reaching 11,626 during Week 31, 2022. This decline indicates decreasing reported respiratory illness activity during the 5-week period.

2. Despite the declining trend in past ILI occurrences, a positive correlation between past and future ILI activity arises when considering the trend reversal potential. Week 31, 2022, marked the lowest ILI count during these weeks, serving as a baseline for the subsequent resurgence to 15,839 future occurrences (Week 36, 2022). The sharp future increase may reflect an underlying oscillatory pattern in ILI activity typical of respiratory illness seasonality, despite the observed initial decline.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI slightly decreased, dropping from 1.7% (Week 27, 2022) to 1.5% (Week 31, 2022), remaining below the baseline. However, the demographic variation shows consistently higher activity in children aged 0-4 years (e.g., 7.3% in Week 27 and 6.1% in Week 31) compared to other groups, indicating sustained pediatric respiratory illness burden, which could contribute to the future increase in cases.

4. Persistent high mortality due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) was observed, with percentages escalating from 8.8% in Week 27 to 10.0% by Week 31, 2022, exceeding epidemic thresholds each week. Although primarily driven by COVID-19, this elevated respiratory-related mortality suggests a continued burden of respiratory illnesses, potentially fueling future upticks in ILI occurrences.

5. Co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and RSV, documented across all weeks, likely masked specific influenza trends and contributed to the resurgence in ILI activity. Seasonal respiratory virus dynamics, compounded by altered healthcare-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, may have driven the sharp rise in ILI cases by Week 36, 2022.

6. In summary, the reported 15,839 future ILI occurrences (Week 36, 2022) are attributed to seasonal respiratory virus fluctuations, stabilization of the downward trend, higher respiratory-related mortality, pediatric outpatient visit patterns, and the compounding effects of pandemic illness dynamics and healthcare disruptions. This multifactorial interplay resulted in the surge following the observed decline in Weeks 27–31, 2022.
