1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a generally upward progression with fluctuations. Starting at 1064 in Week 43, 2023, the numbers showed a slight dip to 1024 in Week 44, before increasing considerably to 1277 in Week 45 and peaking at 1403 in Week 46, followed by a minor drop to 1331 in Week 47. This trend indicates an escalating trajectory of ILI activity, particularly in the later weeks.
2. There is a clear positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences. The peak in Weeks 45 and 46, 2023, and sustained high levels in Week 47 act as a precursor to the significant rise reported after 5 weeks, culminating in 2402 ILI occurrences by Week 52, 2023.
3. Increasing outpatient visits for ILI from 2.7% in Week 43, 2023, to 3.9% in Week 47, consistently above the baseline of 2.9%, highlights the growing burden of respiratory illnesses. This trend strongly aligns with and contributes to the observed spike in future ILI occurrences.
4. A rise in hospitalization rates from 0.8 per 100,000 in Week 43, 2023, to 3.7 per 100,000 in Week 47, coupled with increasing severity among vulnerable populations, particularly elderly adults (8.9 per 100,000), strongly supports the subsequent sharp increase in ILI activity.
5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, as indicated in all weekly reports, highlights an additive impact on ILI trends. This interplay of pathogens significantly influenced future ILI spikes.
6. Regional variability and intensified activity in specific areas such as the South Central, Southeast, and West Coast regions, consistently characterized by rising positivity rates and reported hospitalizations, underscore the nationwide amplification in Week 52, 2023.
7. In summary, the sharp rise to 2402 ILI occurrences by Week 52, 2023, is attributed to the clear upward trajectory in past data (Weeks 45–47), increasing outpatient ILI visits and hospitalizations, heightened co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and regional intensification in activity. These combined factors compound the overall increasing trend.
