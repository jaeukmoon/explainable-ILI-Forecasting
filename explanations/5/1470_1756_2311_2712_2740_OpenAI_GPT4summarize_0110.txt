1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week3 to Week7, 2024 show a consistent increase: 1470, 1756, 2311, 2712, and 2740. This upward trajectory reflects a significant escalation in ILI activity throughout the five weeks, peaking in Week7, 2024 (2740). The trend suggests a strong upward momentum with no indication of decline or stabilization by Week7.
2. Forecasting target Week12, 2024 belongs to the off-season. The majority of influenza activity in the U.S. typically occurs during the peak season (Week46 to Week6), which concludes well before Week12. CDC projections for ILI activity (Week6, 2024 #10; Week7, 2024 #10) imply a tapering of activity as the system transitions into the off-season.
3. From the time-series correlation, ILI occurrences from Week3 to Week7, 2024 show an increasing trend. However, since Week12, 2024 falls into the off-season, historical patterns indicate that activity is likely to decline or stabilize in the coming weeks. Therefore, projecting forward with tapering momentum, ILI occurrences are predicted to reduce by Week12, 2024, leading to the forecast of 1909.
4. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2, though substantial earlier in the season, showed no significant increase in impact during Weeks5-7, 2024 (Week5, 2024 #10; Week6, 2024 #9; Week7, 2024 #9). This reduced contribution from other viruses supports an expected decline in overall ILI trends.
5. Outpatient respiratory illness visits (Week7, 2024 #4) remained elevated but were steady at 4.5% in the most recent weeks. Vaccination efforts continue (Week6, 2024 #7; Week7, 2024 #7), ensuring some degree of mitigation in transmission and reducing future occurrences.
6. Influenza type B activity increased in Weeks5-7 (Week6, 2024 #10; Week7, 2024 #8), notably in specific regions. However, with the overall influenza positivity rate decreasing slightly (Week5, 2024 #1; Week7, 2024 #1), these localized increases do not appear sufficient to spur national-level surges.
7. The forecasted occurrence of 1909 ILI cases in Week12, 2024 is justified by the consistent upward trend through Week7, 2024 transitioning into the off-season during Week12. Reduced co-circulation of respiratory viruses, vaccination impacts, and stable outpatient visit trends also support this moderated decline, balancing earlier increases observed.
