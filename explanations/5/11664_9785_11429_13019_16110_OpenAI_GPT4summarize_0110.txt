1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week2 to Week6, 2024 show a consistent increase with some fluctuations: Week2 (11664), Week3 (9785), Week4 (11429), Week5 (13019), and Week6 (16110). After an initial dip in Week3, there is a sustained upward trend, peaking in Week6. This indicates increasing influenza-like illness activity, likely leading to elevated levels in subsequent weeks.
2. Forecasting target week (Week11, 2024) belongs to the off-season. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans from Week46 to Week6. Given that Week11, 2024 occurs after this timeframe, and with indications from Week6, 2024 (#10) of continual activity in certain regions but not at peak levels, Week11, 2024 aligns with the off-season period.
3. The time-series analysis reveals a generally increasing ILI trend from Week3 to Week6, 2024, likely driven by post-holiday influenza activity surges accompanied by regional variability. Given this steady upward trajectory and historical patterns, the data projects a further rise in ILI counts by Week11, 2024. The slowing of the growth rate after Week6, based on CDC’s indication of stabilizations in certain areas (Week6, 2024 #10), suggests a moderate leveling off near 14164 occurrences.
4. Three distinct influential factors from the summarized CDC reports:
5. - Post-peak activity trends: Week2, 2024 (#7), Week3, 2024 (#8), and Week6, 2024 (#10) report potential continued influenza transmission despite being outside the peak window, driven by regional increases and co-circulation with other respiratory viruses like RSV and COVID-19 (Week2, 2024 #10; Week6, 2024 #10).
6. - Predominance of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09: Week3, 2024 (#2) and Week5, 2024 (#1) highlight the dominance of this subtype driving most ILI activity and hospitalizations, keeping influenza spread elevated.
7. - Vaccination’s limited impact: Despite vaccine promotion (Week3, 2024 #9; Week4, 2024 #7; Week5, 2024 #7), the reports indicate persistent widespread flu activity and regional fluctuations, partly due to co-circulating strains (Week4, 2024 #9).
5. Vaccination coverage and antiviral effectiveness remain critical, with vaccines generally matched to circulating strains and antivirals maintaining efficacy for most cases (Week2, 2024 #9; Week4, 2024 #7). Resistance remains limited (Week5, 2024 #7; Week6, 2024 #8), ensuring treatment effectiveness and mitigating the severity of cases, but widespread virus circulation sustains moderate outbreak conditions.
6. Co-circulating respiratory pathogens, including RSV and COVID-19, amplify overall ILI activity (Week2, 2024 #10; Week4, 2024 #8; Week5, 2024 #10), potentially driving fluctuations and maintaining elevated levels nationwide. This overlap complicates seasonal ILI patterns and contributes to the continued upward trajectory seen in the data.
7. In conclusion, the projected ILI occurrence of 14164 for Week11, 2024 reflects the combined effects of an increasing historical trend, ongoing regional variation, the dominant spread of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and the extended impact of co-circulating respiratory pathogens. While vaccination and antiviral measures mitigate severity, persistent viral transmission and fluctuating regional trends support sustained elevated ILI rates beyond the peak season.
