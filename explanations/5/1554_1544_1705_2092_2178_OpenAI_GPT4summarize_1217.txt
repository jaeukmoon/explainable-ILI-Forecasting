1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5-week period demonstrated a consistent upward trend, starting at 1554 in Week42, 2020, slightly decreasing to 1544 in Week43, 2020, followed by sharp increases in subsequent weeks, with 1705 in Week44, 2020, 2092 in Week45, 2020, and peaking at 2178 in Week46, 2020. This sustained growth signals an escalating trajectory in ILI activity by the end of the observed weeks.
2. The observed rise in ILI occurrences toward the latter weeks of the past data (Weeks 45–46, 2020) aligns with the future occurrences reported as 1783 five weeks later (Week51, 2020). While the future value slightly decreases compared to Week46, 2020, the sustained upward momentum leading to that peak suggests sustained elevated activity influencing subsequent weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually rose over the 5 weeks, starting at 1.2% in Week42, 2020, and increasing stepwise to 1.5% by Week46, 2020. This consistent increase exceeds regional baselines in some cases, indicating growing ILI-related health concerns that likely contributed to the higher future occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed epidemic thresholds, starting at 7.6% in Week42, 2020, and reaching 10.7% in Week46, 2020. The rising PIC mortality rate underscores an overall elevation in related respiratory illnesses, correlating with the trend in ILI occurrences.
5. The disruptions caused by changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with limited influenza activity and low virologic detection rates (e.g., 0.3% in Week42, 2020, to 0.2% in Week46, 2020), highlight challenges in traditional ILI surveillance. These factors may have led to underreporting during the earlier weeks, with delayed recognition of cases contributing to a sharper visible increase and the subsequent report of 1783 ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the future report of 1783 ILI occurrences in Week51, 2020, reflects the consistent upward trend in Weeks 45–46, 2020, elevated outpatient visits for ILI, persistently high PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the influence of healthcare-seeking behavior changes during the pandemic.
