1. The ILI occurrences from Week20 to Week24, 2022 were 1954, 2058, 1858, 1595, and 1399. The data exhibits a decreasing trend over the five weeks, starting with higher levels in Week20 and Week21 before declining steadily through Week24, indicating a reduction in influenza-like activity during this period. No significant spikes or fluctuations were present, highlighting a generalized downward trajectory.
2. Week29, 2022 falls within the off-season, as it occurs after the decline in seasonal influenza activity (typically ending by Week23-25 based on declining positivity and ILI trends) and well before the peak onset season, which starts around Week32 or later. This aligns with reduced influenza activity and minimal community spread during the off-season period.
3. From a time-series perspective, the steady decline observed through Week24, 2022 suggests a continuation of lower ILI occurrences into subsequent weeks. Projecting forward to Week29, the historical pattern of diminishing activity combined with the off-season classification supports a prediction of persistently low influenza levels. Thus, 845 occurrences align with this downward trend and off-season expectation.
4. Influenza positivity declined across Weeks20-24, from 6.4% to 2.5%, reflecting decreased influenza transmission and supporting the overall lower ILI occurrences (Week20 #1; Week21 #1; Week22 #1; Week23 #1; Week24 #1).
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 persisted during this period but did not contribute to notable spikes in ILI, as influenza remained the dominant driver of cases (Week20 #8; Week21 #8; Week22 #7; Week23 #7; Week24 #7).
6. Vaccination trends remained stable during this phase, with ongoing emphasis on influenza immunization. However, antigenic differences in circulating H3N2 strains may have slightly reduced vaccine effectiveness, although this did not translate into increasing ILI activity (Week20 #7; Week21 #7; Week22 #8; Week23 #8).
7. In summary, the projected value of 845 future ILI occurrences in Week29, 2022 is consistent with the observed decreasing trend in recent activity, the off-season classification, declining influenza positivity, stability in co-circulating respiratory viruses, and moderate vaccine coverage. These factors collectively indicate low expected ILI levels for the target week.
