1. The past time-series ILI occurrences from Week13 to Week17, 2023, exhibited an overall declining trend, with values fluctuating from 14370 in Week13, 2023, to 13026 in Week17, 2023. A sharp drop was noted between Week13, 2023 (14370), and Week14, 2023 (13379). This decline continued to Week15, 2023 (13307), followed by a more gradual decrease, reaching the lowest point of the period at Week17, 2023 (13026). This trend signals a consistent reduction in ILI activity over the five weeks.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 12674 (five weeks later) represents a continuation of this declining pattern. The steady decrease observed from Week13, 2023, to Week17, 2023, correlates strongly with the lower value of ILI cases reported after five weeks. Specifically, the drop in occurrences from 13026 in Week17, 2023, aligns closely with the reduced future value of 12674.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a consistent downward pattern, decreasing from 2.3% in Week13, 2023, to 1.9% in Week16, 2023, and stabilizing at 2.0% by Week17, 2023. This reduction in outpatient visits mirrors the declining ILI case trend, contributing to the future decrease in ILI occurrences. Additionally, deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained elevated, ranging between 7.3% and 7.9% across the five weeks, slightly above epidemic thresholds. This persistent PIC mortality highlights ongoing contributions of severe respiratory illnesses to ILI data, albeit at a diminishing rate. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, documented in all weeks, resulted in a stable but modest contribution to ILI activity, moderating the decline.
4. Antigenic and antiviral responsiveness data revealed 99.9% of circulating influenza viruses matched this season's vaccine strains and were susceptible to antivirals. Effective vaccine coverage and high antiviral efficacy likely aided in mitigating new influenza cases, aligning with the observed decline in ILI activity and culminating in the recorded future occurrences of 12674.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 12674 (five weeks post-Week17, 2023) are explained by the observed steady decline in past ILI occurrences, reductions in outpatient ILI visits, persistent but diminishing PIC-related mortality, and the effective suppression of new cases through vaccination and antiviral efficacy. The combined impact of these factors underscores a predictable continuation of declining ILI activity.
