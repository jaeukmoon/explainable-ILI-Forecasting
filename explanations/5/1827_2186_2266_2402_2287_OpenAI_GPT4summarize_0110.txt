1. The past ILI occurrences from Week49, 2023 to Week1, 2024 show a general upward trend with the following values: 1827, 2186, 2266, 2402, and 2287. The ILI occurrences increased week over week, peaking at 2402 in Week51, 2023, followed by a slight decline to 2287 in Week1, 2024. This indicates a predominantly rising trend with some stabilization toward the end, consistent with peak-level activity near Week1, 2024.
2. Forecasting Week6, 2024 aligns with the peak season since peak season in the U.S. typically spans from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the next year. Week6, 2024, falls within this timeframe, and the elevated ILI positivity and hospitalization rates observed in prior weeks suggest persistent influenza activity consistent with peak season.
3. Based on the observed time-series pattern, the upward trend in ILI occurrences leading into Week1, 2024 and the stabilization suggest a continuation of elevated activity into Week6, 2024. The slight decline from Week51, 2023 to Week1, 2024 might reflect short-term fluctuations rather than a sustained reduction, projecting an ILI occurrence of 2712 as reasonable for Week6, 2024 based on this trajectory.
4. High influenza positivity rates are reported in the CDC data, increasing from 10.2% in Week49, 2023 to 17.5% in Week52, 2023 and stabilizing at elevated levels in Week1, 2024 (80.1% Influenza A and 19.9% Influenza B). This sustained positivity indicates widespread and ongoing influenza transmission, contributing to the projected ILI activity.
5. The increasing cumulative hospitalization rate, which grew from 8.0 per 100,000 in Week49, 2023 to 31.7 per 100,000 in Week1, 2024, signals severe influenza impacts, particularly among high-risk groups (e.g., adults aged 65+ and children). This hospitalization trend supports elevated ILI activity moving into Week6, 2024.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV, noted consistently over the past five weeks, complicates respiratory illness trends but contributes to elevated ILI counts. CDC projections of a potential second rise in flu activity following the winter holidays further support an ILI occurrence near 2712 in Week6, 2024.
7. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrence of 2712 for Week6, 2024, is justified by the past rising trend in occurrences, the alignment of Week6, 2024 with peak season, elevated influenza positivity rates, increasing hospitalization trends, and the compounded effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors collectively suggest ongoing high influenza activity consistent with peak-season patterns.
