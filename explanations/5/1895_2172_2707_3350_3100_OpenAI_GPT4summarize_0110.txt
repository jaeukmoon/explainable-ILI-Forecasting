1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week43 to Week47, 2023 are 1895, 2172, 2707, 3350, and 3100. This trend indicates a steady increase in occurrences from Week43 to Week46, peaking at 3350. However, there is a slight dip in Week47 to 3100. Overall, this demonstrates an increasing trajectory with a minor fluctuation at the end.
2. Forecasting for Week52, 2023, aligns with the peak season based on the timing and signs of sustained influenza activity increases. In the U.S., peak season generally spans from Week46 through Week6 of the following year. Given the rise in positivity rates, hospitalization trends, and intensifying activity in Week47, 2023, Week52 is projected to be within the peak season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the strong upward trend between Weeks43 and Week46 indicates a progressive rise in ILI activity. Although Week47 saw a slight dip, patterns from recent years and the projected epidemic curve suggest continued increases over the next five weeks. The forecast for Week52 extrapolates from this upward trajectory, anticipating increased ILI activity to reach 5760 occurrences driven by peak seasonal dynamics and virus circulation intensity.
4. Influenza positivity in clinical lab tests rose from 1.9% in Week43 to 6.2% in Week47, signaling an intensification of flu transmission (Week43, 2023 #1; Week47, 2023 #1). Anticipated rising positivity aligns with historical peak season data.
5. Cumulative hospitalization rates have steadily increased, reaching 3.7 per 100,000 in Week47, 2023 (Week43, 2023 #4; Week47, 2023 #3). Hospitalization trends reflect rising illness severity, consistent with escalated community transmission during peak periods.
6. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 alongside influenza has compounded respiratory illness trends (Week43, 2023 #7; Week47, 2023 #9). This factor amplifies ILI activity and suggests further increases in coming weeks.
7. A combination of increasing influenza positivity rates, cumulative hospitalizations, and amplified co-circulation of respiratory viruses justifies the forecast of 5760 ILI occurrences for Week52, 2023. This projection fits the time-series trajectory and aligns with the peak season classification.
