1. The reported ILI counts from Week19 to Week23, 2023 are 1933, 1847, 1762, 1753, and 1592. This indicates a consistent decline over the five-week period, with ILI occurrences decreasing by an average of approximately 85 cases per week. The absence of significant fluctuations, spikes, or recoveries signifies a stable downward trend in ILI activity during this period.
2. Forecasting for Week28, 2023 places it well within the off-season. Based on U.S. influenza patterns, the off-season typically spans from Week1 to Week31. This is reinforced by sustained low influenza activity, minimal positivity rates, and overall stability reported in Weeks19-23, 2023. Declining ILI counts also support off-season categorization.
3. The time-series data demonstrates a continual decline over the five weeks preceding Week23, 2023. Projecting forward, the same trend of decreasing ILI occurrences is extended to Week28, 2023. Given the decline's steadiness and no indication of an impending surge in positivity or severity during this period, the ILI count of 1075 reflects the ongoing reduction, aligning with a continuation of the off-season pattern.
4. Influenza activity remains minimal nationwide, with positivity rates for respiratory specimens consistently around 1.0%-1.2% (Week19-23, 2023). No indication of a resurgence or sharp increase in influenza activity is reported during this time.
5. Vaccination coverage remains favorable, with most circulating strains being antigenically similar to current vaccines (Week19, 2023 #7; Week20, 2023 #7; Week21, 2023 #9). This accounts for reduced transmission potential and contributes to declining ILI counts.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV persists, but their contributions are not enough to cause a national increase in ILI-related visits or spread (Week19, 2023 #9; Week21, 2023 #8; Week23, 2023 #10), aligning with off-season expectations.
7. In conclusion, consistently declining ILI occurrences, off-season timing (Week28, 2023), low positivity rates, vaccination effectiveness, and limited co-circulation impact justify the reported ILI occurrence of 1075. These factors collectively point to a continuation of reduced ILI activity during off-season weeks.
