1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week5 to Week9, 2022 are 1125, 1111, 1182, 1261, and 1512. The trend shows a steady increase over the five weeks, with noticeable growth from Week8 (1261) to Week9 (1512). This pattern reflects a rising ILI activity across the period.
2. Forecasting the target week (Week14, 2022) belongs to the off-season. Although Week14 is outside the peak or peak onset season (based on historical U.S. seasonality), the observed increasing trend between Week5 and Week9, 2022 suggests localized but limited activity, consistent with an off-season characterization.
3. From a time-series perspective, the incremental increases in ILI counts signal a rising trajectory. Extrapolating from the past five weeks' data, the anticipated pattern continues upward at a gradual rate before stabilizing around Week14, 2022, leading to a projected occurrence of 2096.
4. Influenza positivity rates increased from 2.0% in Week5, 2022 to 5.8% in Week9, 2022, with dominant circulation of Influenza A(H3N2) (Week5, 2022 #1, Week9, 2022 #2). This sustained growth is a primary driver of ILI increases.
5. Hospitalization rates rose consistently over the five weeks, from a cumulative rate of 4.5 per 100,000 in Week5, 2022 to 5.5 per 100,000 in Week9, 2022 (Week5, 2022 #4, Week9, 2022 #6), pointing to increased severity of cases, which likely correlates with higher ILI reports.
6. Vaccination coverage remained lower than the previous season, coupled with the antigenic differences in circulating A(H3N2) strains (Week5, 2022 #8, #10; Week9, 2022 #5). This mismatch contributes to reduced vaccine effectiveness and may drive increased infections.
7. The predicted value of 2096 for Week14, 2022 reflects the ongoing trend of growing influenza positivity, increased hospitalizations, vaccination challenges, and the dominant A(H3N2) circulation. Together, these factors support a continuation of the upward trend into the off-season, tapering toward stabilization by Week14.
