1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but marked upward trend, with values of ['11730', '11738', '11489', '11880', '13895']. While Weeks 41 (11738) and 42 (11489) saw minor fluctuations, the data evidenced a significant rise in Week 44, 2021 (13895), which signals an increasing trajectory in ILI activity.
2. A strong correlation between the increase in Weeks 43 and 44, 2021 (11880 and 13895, respectively), and the future occurrence of 18608 after 5 weeks (Week 49, 2021) is evident. The rapid escalation in Week 44 likely set the stage for continued growth in ILI occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed steady increases, from 1.9% (Week 40, 2021) to 2.1% (Week 44, 2021), with localized activity in Regions 7 exceeding the baseline, indicating region-specific spikes in ILI cases that contributed to the future rise.
4. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for persistently high weekly deaths, ranging from 18% (Week 40, 2021) to 14.1% (Week 44, 2021), consistently surpassing epidemic thresholds, largely influenced by COVID-19. This sustained respiratory illness burden signals elevated illness trends impacting ILI data.
5. Increasing Influenza A(H3N2) detections, as noted in Weeks 43 and 44, 2021 (91.4% and 97.3%, respectively), coupled with outbreaks in the 5–24 age group and co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, likely accelerated ILI occurrences ahead of Week 49, 2021.
6. Shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to COVID-19 and underreporting of ILI trends, as highlighted in CDC comments across all weeks, disrupted consistency in ILI surveillance. These challenges, combined with growing regional influenza activity, contributed to the steep rise to 18608 after 5 weeks.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 18608 (Week 49, 2021) reflects the sharp upward trend evident toward Week 44, 2021, coupled with increasing outpatient visits, PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, significant regional influenza activity driven by A(H3N2), and pandemic-driven disruptions in healthcare behaviors and ILI tracking.
