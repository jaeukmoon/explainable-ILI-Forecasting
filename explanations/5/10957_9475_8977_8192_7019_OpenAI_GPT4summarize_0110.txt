1. The reported ILI counts from Week6 to Week10, 2024, show a consistent downward trend with values declining each week from 10,957 (Week6) to 7,019 (Week10). This steady reduction highlights decreasing ILI occurrences over this period, without any significant fluctuations or spikes.
2. Week15, 2024, falls well after the typical peak season (Week46 to Week6) and aligns with the off-season period due to decreasing ILI activity and a significant reduction in trends (Week6 to Week10, 2024). Hence, it is classified as part of the off-season.
3. The observed time-series trend from Week6 to Week10, 2024, projects a continuous decline in ILI occurrences leading into the off-season. Extrapolating from this trend, future ILI counts are expected to follow a similar downward trajectory, leading to the forecast of 4,529 occurrences by Week15, 2024. The absence of any upward inflections in the five-week trend reinforces this projection.
4. Influenza activity remains elevated but shows a national decline in outpatient ILI visits over recent weeks, dropping from 4.5% (Week6) to 3.7% (Week10), though still above the baseline (Week6-Week10, 2024 #4). This aligns with the overall decreasing ILI trends during this period.
5. Vaccination continues to be recommended, with vaccines effectively matching circulating strains (Week6-Week10, 2024 #7, Week10 #10). However, the lack of reported increases in vaccine uptake coupled with the already progressing off-season indicates reduced influence on ILI trends.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including RSV and COVID-19, persists nationally (Week6-Week10, 2024 #9, #11). However, no novel influenza viruses have been identified, and antiviral susceptibility remains high (Week6 #8; Week7 #9; Week10 #8), reducing the probability of significant new variants driving increased ILI activity.
7. In summary, the steadily decreasing time-series trend (Week6 to Week10, 2024), off-season classification (Week15, 2024), declining outpatient ILI visits, effective vaccine match, lack of new variants, and ongoing but stable co-circulation of other respiratory viruses justify the prediction of 4,529 occurrences for Week15, 2024.
