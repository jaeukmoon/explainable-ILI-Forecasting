1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week10 to Week14, 2023 are 14829, 14594, 14942, 14370, and 13379. This data shows a decreasing trend, with a peak in Week12 (14942) followed by a steady decline through Week14. The consistent drop in ILI occurrences after Week12 indicates a downward trend leading into the off-season.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically ends by Week06, and the off-season spans from Week07 through Week31. As Week24, 2023 falls within this off-season period and ILI activity is steadily decreasing (e.g., Week14, 2023 #1; Week12, 2023 #1), it is reasonable to forecast Week24, 2023 as belonging to the off-season.
3. The declining trend over the last five weeks strongly correlates to lower ILI occurrences during the off-season. Based on time-series forecasting, the ongoing drop in ILI cases suggests another reduction over the subsequent five weeks, leading to the predicted occurrence of 12870.
4. Influenza activity remains low, with 1.0% or less of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza throughout the period (Week10, 2023 #1; Week12, 2023 #1; Week14, 2023 #1). This pattern directly supports decreasing ILI occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of non-influenza respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, continues to influence ILI trends but has not caused significant variability (Week10, 2023 #12; Week11, 2023 #9; Week12, 2023 #10; Week14, 2023 #10). This stable pattern reinforces the decline in overall ILI activity.
6. Seasonal vaccine effectiveness remains strong, with high antigenic similarity to circulating strains and stable antiviral susceptibility across all tested viruses (Week10, 2023 #15; Week11, 2023 #7; Week13, 2023 #8; Week14, 2023 #8, #10). This reduces the risk of influenza-related surges.
7. Combining the observed downward trend in ILI counts, the designation of Week24, 2023 as off-season, low influenza positivity, stable co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, and robust vaccine protection, the projected ILI occurrence for Week24, 2023 is 12870.
