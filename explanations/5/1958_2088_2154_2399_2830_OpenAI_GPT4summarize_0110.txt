1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week42 to Week46, 2020, are 1958, 2088, 2154, 2399, and 2830. The trend during these weeks indicates a steady increase, with no significant dips or fluctuations. The rise from Week42 (1958) to Week46 (2830) demonstrates a consistent upward trajectory, reflecting a potential progression toward higher flu activity.
2. Based on U.S. seasonality patterns, Week46 marks the beginning of the typical peak season, which usually spans from Week46 to Week6 of the following year. Therefore, WeekNone, positioned five weeks later, aligns with the forecasted peak season period.
3. From a time-series perspective, the observed linear increase in ILI occurrences from Week42 to Week46 suggests the continuation of a similar trend into the following five weeks. Given this trajectory, projecting forward indicates a gradual increase, aligning with the predicted value of 2776 for five weeks later.
4. Several factors contribute to this forecast: (1) nationwide positivity rates remain low but stable, with 0.1–0.2% of specimens testing positive for influenza (Week42, 2020 #1; Week43, 2020 #1; Week46, 2020 #1). The consistent, slight increases align with a gradual seasonal uptick. (2) Outpatient ILI visits, while remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%, exhibit a steady increase over the weeks, from 1.2% in Week42 to 1.5% in Week46 (Week42, 2020 #4; Week43, 2020 #4; Week46, 2020 #3). This points to a rising flu activity coinciding with early peak season trends. (3) Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) remain elevated, exceeding epidemic thresholds each week, notably rising from 7.6% in Week42 to 10.7% in Week46 (Week42, 2020 #6; Week43, 2020 #6; Week46, 2020 #4). Although primarily driven by COVID-19, it implies a potential increase in respiratory illness-related complications.
5. Vaccination uptake, while recommended by the CDC, remains inadequately reported, with minimal observed trends (Week43, 2020 #8; Week44, 2020 #8). This may limit protective effects as flu activity increases through the forecasted peak season.
6. The ongoing influence of the COVID-19 pandemic alters healthcare-seeking behaviors and complicates traditional ILI surveillance and reporting; however, influenza activity remains expected to rise slightly, as indicated by the CDC (Week42, 2020 #10; Week45, 2020 #10; Week46, 2020 #9). Limited virus detection, low positivity, and dual surveillance suggest caution in interpreting trends but support the steady rise.
7. Given the consistent increase in ILI occurrences, alignment with the peak season period (WeekNone), historical time-series trends, and CDC-reported conditions—such as low but rising influenza positivity and increasing respiratory-related deaths—the forecasted value of 2776 aligns with current patterns.
