1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week46 to Week50, 2023 are 1860, 1961, 2458, 2854, and 3151. This establishes a consistent increasing trend over the five weeks, indicating an ongoing intensification of influenza-related activity without notable dips or fluctuations.
2. The target week (Week3, 2024) falls within the U.S. typical peak season, which generally spans Week46 of one year through Week6 of the next. Furthermore, Week50, 2023 reported continuously rising ILI occurrences, elevated hospitalization rates (11.3 per 100,000), and stronger outpatient visit surges (5.1%), reinforcing that Week3, 2024 remains in the peak season of activity.
3. Time-series analysis shows ILI occurrences rising consistently over recent weeks (+101, +497, +396, +297 incrementally). This pattern suggests that while ILI is accelerating, the rate of increase may begin to stabilize as flu season progresses. Projecting forward five weeks to Week3, 2024, this trend aligns with a forecasted moderate decline from Week50’s ILI occurrences of 3151, reaching 2710 as activity begins to plateau near the season's peak.
4. The CDC reports provide insights into at least three influential factors:
5. a. Influenza A remains highly dominant (81.9% in Week50, 2023) with A(H1N1) as the primary subtype (78.2% of subtyped specimens in Week50, 2023). Such dominance in past pandemic seasons corresponds with high transmissibility.
6. b. Co-circulation of RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza contributes to elevated overall respiratory illness activity (noted consistently from Week46 to Week50, 2023), complicating health service strain and contributing to high ILI numbers.
7. c. Vaccination trends, while encouraged nationwide, do not indicate dramatic increases in coverage (Week46 to Week50, 2023). Additionally, CDC’s continued recommendations for vaccination suggest suboptimal vaccination uptake, potentially contributing to wider community transmission.
5. Nationwide outpatient respiratory visits exceeded national baselines consistently for seven weeks by Week50, 2023 (5.1%), with continued hospitalization surges and notable increases in flu positivity rates—correlating closely with ILI severity.
6. Cumulative hospitalizations among vulnerable populations, particularly adults 65+ years (28.1 per 100,000 in Week50, 2023), suggest severe strain and sustained high ILI numbers moving into the early weeks of 2024.
7. The forecast of 2710 ILI occurrences for Week3, 2024 reflects a slight downward adjustment from Week50, 2023 (3151), balancing the ongoing peak season's elevated activity with early signs of stabilization suggested in Week50 data. Limited vaccine impact, widespread transmission of A(H1N1), co-circulating respiratory viruses, and regionally variable activity collectively support this estimate.
