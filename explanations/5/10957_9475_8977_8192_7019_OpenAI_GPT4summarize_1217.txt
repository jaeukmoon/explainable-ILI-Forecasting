1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 1–5, 2024) showed a consistent decline, starting at 10957 in Week 1, 2024, and dropping sequentially to 9475, 8977, 8192, and 7019 in Week 5, 2024. This downward trend reflects a significant reduction in ILI activity across the observed period.
2. The sharp and sustained decline in ILI occurrences over these weeks correlates with the reported future value of 4529 occurrences (Week 10, 2024). This substantial reduction in the past strongly aligns with the continuation of the downward trend in ILI cases seen in subsequent weeks, leading to the noted future low value.
3. Weekly positivity rates for influenza showed a progressive decrease, from 15.7% (Week 6, 2024) to 14.8%, 14.2%, 13.9%, and finally 15.4% (Week 10, 2024). This decline in positivity is critical in explaining the drop in ILI occurrences as fewer cases correspond with reduced viral activity, despite slight regional fluctuations in later weeks.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI trended downward, from 4.5% (Weeks 6–7, 2024) to 4.4% (Week 8, 2024), 4.1% (Week 9, 2024), and eventually 3.7% (Week 10, 2024). Although still above the baseline, this decline is consistent with falling ILI case counts and supports the observed future low value.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including RSV and COVID-19, along with stable vaccination coverage during this period, likely minimized the compounded effects of respiratory illnesses, contributing to the declining trend in ILI occurrences. Coupled with the declining impact of Influenza B and effective antiviral susceptibility, these factors likely facilitated the observed reduction in ILI cases.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 4529 (Week 10, 2024) are attributable to the steady decline in past ILI cases, decreasing influenza positivity rates, reduced outpatient ILI visits, and stabilization of co-circulating respiratory virus activity, as well as the overall effectiveness of preventative measures during this flu season.
