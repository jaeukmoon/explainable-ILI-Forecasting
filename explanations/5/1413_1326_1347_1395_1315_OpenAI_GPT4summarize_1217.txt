1. The past time-series ILI occurrences from Week32 to Week36, 2021 showed a predominantly fluctuating trend, with values of ['1413', '1326', '1347', '1395', '1315']. A decline was observed between Week32 (1413) and Week33 (1326), followed by a slight rise to 1347 in Week34 and nearly reaching 1395 in Week35. However, Week36 concluded with a dip to 1315, indicating overall instability in ILI occurrences.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 1279 in Week41, 2021 align with the declining trend observed in Week36, 2021 (1315). This consistent decrease in the last recorded week acts as an indicator of limited ILI activity continuing into Week41, 2021. The drop from 1395 (Week35, 2021) to 1315 (Week36, 2021) suggests reduced momentum, correlating with the eventual moderation at 1279.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below the national baseline of 2.6%, with fluctuations around 2.1%–2.3% across Weeks32–36, 2021. The negligible change in positivity rates and minimal influenza activity reflect ongoing dominance of non-influenza respiratory viruses, limiting ILI surges.
4. Persistent COVID-19-driven PIC mortalities (14.6% in Week32 to 21.0% in Week36, 2021) overshadowed influenza-related activity, suppressing notable increases in ILI trends. The absence of significant pediatric deaths and minimal virus detection throughout Weeks32–36 further signified constrained flu dynamics.
5. Challenges posed by changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors, influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, hindered traditional ILI tracking accuracy. Limited virologic data and low influenza activity trends in public health reports emphasize an environment with less significant ILI progression, leading to the future value of 1279 in Week41, 2021.
6. In summary, the reported 1279 future ILI occurrences (Week41, 2021) stem from the overall fluctuating yet declining trend during Weeks35–36, the persistently low outpatient ILI percentages below baseline, minimal flu positivity rates, high PIC mortality dominated by COVID-19, and disruptions in ILI surveillance due to pandemic-related behavioral transitions.
