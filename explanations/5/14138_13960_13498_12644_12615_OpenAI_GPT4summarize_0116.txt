1. The ILI occurrences over the last 5 weeks (Week16, 2024 to Week20, 2024) exhibit a consistent downward trend. Starting from 14138 in Week16, there has been a steady decline to 13960, 13498, 12644, and finally 12615 in Week20. The week-to-week percentage declines are approximately 1.26%, 3.31%, 6.31%, and 0.23%, respectively, signaling an overall deceleration in ILI occurrences as the flu season transitions into a typically lower activity period. A linear fit on the last five data points suggests an approximate weekly reduction of ~2.76% on average in ILI occurrence. Projecting this trend forward over five weeks (Week25), we calculate the expected value by compounding the weekly percentage decrease: \(12615 \times (1 - 0.0276)^5 \approx 9946\).
2. Week25, 2024 falls in the "Off-season" based on U.S. flu season cycle knowledge. This is a period marked by low ILI occurrences and minimal disease prevalence, occurring after the peak season (which generally ends by Week6 in most years). Coupled with the declining trend in ILI occurrences in the previous weeks and the CDC's reports of minimal activity across regions, Week25 is expected to remain in the "Off-season."
3. The correlation analysis indicates a predictive relationship between historical trends and future occurrences. The steady decrease in ILI occurrences aligns with CDC reports of declining influenza activity nationwide, lower outpatient visits for respiratory illness (stabilized at 2.0% below baseline), and reduced influenza positivity rates from 4.8% in Week16 to 2% in Week20, suggesting a continued decline in the coming weeks. Including the seasonal classification and decelerating rate of decline, 9946 is a consistent projection based on this trajectory.
4. Three distinct factors from the summarized CDC reports substantiate the forecasted trend. (1) Reduced influenza positivity rates: The percentage of specimens testing positive declined consistently (e.g., from 4.8% in Week16 to 2% in Week20). This translates to lower ILI occurrences as fewer individuals contract the flu. (2) Co-circulation of respiratory viruses: Although SARS-CoV-2 and RSV are present, their contribution to overall respiratory illnesses has not triggered a significant increase in ILI activity. This is reflected in stable outpatient visit percentages (2.3% in Week16, falling to 2.0% by Week20). These patterns compound the downward ILI trajectory. (3) Seasonal phase: Nationally, as low influenza activity dominates in the Off-season, decreased community spread is indicated. The CDC's reports emphasize declining flu trends, consistent with historical expectations for this time in the flu calendar.
5. Combining the factors of a 2.76% average weekly decline in ILI occurrences, the classification of Week25, 2024 as "Off-season," and CDC-supported indicators like reduced positivity rates, stable hospitalization metrics, and co-circulating respiratory viruses without significant outbreaks, a projected value of 9946 for Week25 is justified. This value reflects the continuation of the current downward trend, adjusted for seasonal and surveillance-based insights.
