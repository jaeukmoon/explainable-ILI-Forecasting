1. The ILI occurrences from Week42 to Week46, 2021 were 1800, 1802, 2296, 2297, and 2658. The pattern indicates a clear and steady increase starting from Week44 to Week46, with occasional minimal growth earlier (between Week42 and Week43). This upward trend signifies increasing influenza activity, advancing toward peak-season levels.
2. Forecasting Week51, 2021 aligns with the peak season as per typical U.S. influenza behavior, which spans from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the next. The steady increase in outpatient ILI visits (Week46, 2021 #4), combined with higher laboratory detections (Week46, 2021 #1), suggest that Week51, 2021 falls firmly within an expected peak season window.
3. Based on the time-series trend, the progressive growth observed, specifically between Week44 (2296) and Week46 (2658), shows a trajectory of rising influenza-like illness leading into Week51. This aligns with a time-series projection that further increases over five weeks, scaling upward amid the peak activity season, suggesting a value near 4249 ILI cases as the growth momentum continues.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) dominance and its spread among younger age groups, such as those aged 5-24 years, indicate concentrated, rising transmissions (Week44, 2021 #5; Week46, 2021 #10).
5. Vaccine uptake trends, though substantial (166.9M doses distributed; Week46, 2021 #7), remain insufficient to curtail the forecast due to the typical lag in population-level immunity during rising activity.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including ongoing COVID-19 impacts, disrupts ILI data reporting and further complicates influenza trend monitoring (Week44, 2021 #14; Week46, 2021 #10).
7. In summary, the increasing ILI occurrences, peak-season alignment, Influenza A(H3N2) prevalence, partial vaccine coverage, and continued multi-virus co-circulation collectively justify the forecasted value of 4249 for Week51, 2021.
