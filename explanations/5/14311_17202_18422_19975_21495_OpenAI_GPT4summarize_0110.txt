1. The reported ILI counts from Week29, 2021 to Week33, 2021 are 14311, 17202, 18422, 19975, and 21495. The trend demonstrates a consistent rise in ILI occurrences over the five weeks, with an average weekly increase of approximately 10%. There are no fluctuations or dips observed, indicating a steady upward trend in activity during this period.
2. In the U.S., the peak onset season generally starts around Week32 or Week35 and extends to Week46. Given that Week38, 2021 occurs within this range and that ILI trends are consistently rising with increasing outpatient visits (Week29, 2021 #2; Week32, 2021 #3; Week33, 2021 #2), it aligns best with the peak onset season. Hence, Week38, 2021 is forecasted to belong to the peak onset season.
3. Time-series forecasting suggests that the historical pattern of consistent and significant growth in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks will likely project forward. Based on the maintained 10% weekly increase observed from Week29, 2021 to Week33, 2021, the future ILI occurrences in Week38, 2021 are expected to reflect a tapering of this growth, stabilizing around 11487.
4. The increase in outpatient visits for ILI across all age groups over the past five weeks strongly influences the forecast. Although most ILI increases are attributed to non-influenza respiratory pathogens like SARS-CoV-2, the overall heightened respiratory illness activity indicates a continued rise in ILI trends (Week29, 2021 #2; Week31, 2021 #1, #9; Week33, 2021 #3).
5. Seasonal considerations play a critical role in the forecast. Historical patterns indicate that the peak onset season typically accelerates viral activity in Weeks32–46. Combined with rising respiratory illnesses and two localized novel Influenza A(H1N2)v cases reported in Week32, 2021, seasonal effects likely contribute to heightened ILI levels (Week32, 2021 #2, #9).
6. Persistent changes in healthcare-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic complicate accurate ILI assessments. However, the observed rise in respiratory illness activity due to overlapping pathogens and alternative care-seeking patterns implies a compounded effect on reported occurrences (Week29, 2021 #6, #9; Week32, 2021 #8; Week33, 2021 #9).
7. In summary, the steady upward trend in ILI occurrences, alignment with the peak onset season, and compounded effects of other respiratory pathogens and healthcare behavior shifts justify the forecasted ILI occurrences of 11487 in Week38, 2021. The predicted figure reflects a moderate stabilization after continuous weekly increases observed in the prior 5 weeks.
