1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend with values of ['1435', '1358', '1759', '1626', '1786']. Following an initial drop from 1435 (Week15, 2021) to 1358 (Week16, 2021), there was a sharp increase to 1759 (Week17, 2021), which slightly declined to 1626 (Week18, 2021) before peaking at 1786 (Week19, 2021). This overall variability with a peak at the end indicates potential increases in ILI activity leading up to future occurrences.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The resurgence in Week19, 2021 (1786), aligns with the continued increase to 1807 future occurrences after 5 weeks (Week24, 2021). This trend suggests a continuation of elevated respiratory illness activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI held consistently steady at 1.1% (Week15-Week17, 2021) then slightly rose to 1.2% (Week18-Week19, 2021). While still below the national baseline, the increasing stability signals a gradual rise in healthcare-seeking for ILI, potentially contributing to future ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, albeit driven by COVID-19, dropping slightly from 12.4% (Week15, 2021) to 10.1% (Week19, 2021). This sustained elevated PIC mortality may reflect broader respiratory illness activity, contributing to the future ILI increase.
5. Reporting lags, minimal flu activity, and altered healthcare-seeking behavior due to COVID-19 could skew ILI trends. These disruptions might have suppressed earlier data while amplifying future detections, leading to the reported rise to 1807 after 5 weeks.
6. Minimal influenza activity was consistently reported, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive across all weeks. Despite the low flu activity, other respiratory pathogens or pandemic-related respiratory distress may have amplified ILI occurrences observed in future data.
7. In summary, the future occurrence of 1807 ILI cases in Week24, 2021, is linked to the fluctuating but elevated trend in Weeks18-19, 2021, modest increases in outpatient ILI visits, persistent PIC mortality exceeding thresholds, and the disruptive surveillance dynamics caused by COVID-19, which influenced reporting and contributed to the rise in cases.
