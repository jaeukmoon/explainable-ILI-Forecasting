1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed subtle fluctuations without a distinct trend, with values of ['1924', '1816', '1843', '1831', '2025']. After a decrease from 1924 (Week16, 2021) to 1816 (Week17, 2021), the values oscillated slightly, culminating in an increase to 2025 by Week20, 2021. This closing rise suggests a potential rebound in ILI activity.
2. A slight positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the increase from 1831 (Week19, 2021) to 2025 (Week20, 2021) may signal a recovery trend leading to the observed future increase to 2162 (Week25, 2021). The rising momentum in Weeks19–20 aligns temporally with the subsequent surge.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a gradual uptick from 1.1% (Week16, 2021) to 1.3% (Week20, 2021). Though still below the national 2.6% baseline, this steady rise indicates a growing burden of respiratory illnesses, correlating with the eventual increase to 2162 occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) decreased from 11.8% (Week16, 2021) to 9.5% (Week20, 2021) but remained above the epidemic threshold. The persistent PIC burden points to ongoing respiratory distress in the population, supporting the sustained ILI activity reflected in future data.
5. Altered healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic persisted across the 5 weeks, impacting traditional surveillance methods and possibly delaying or distorting ILI case recognition. These shifts may have contributed to the observed uptick to 2162 occurrences as delayed recognition surfaced in subsequent weeks.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 2162 (Week25, 2021) correlates with the upward trend in Weeks19–20, increasing outpatient ILI visits, sustained PIC burden above epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-related healthcare disruptions affecting data interpretation and reporting.
