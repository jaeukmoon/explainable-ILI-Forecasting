1. The reported ILI counts from Week52, 2020 to Week3, 2021 are 1069, 1060, 1115, 916, and 783. These data indicate a generally decreasing trend in ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks, with a slight rise between Week52, 2020 (1060) and Week1, 2021 (1115) followed by sharp declines through Week2, 2021 (916) and Week3, 2021 (783). The overall trend is a steady decline after a brief increase.
2. In the U.S., Week8, 2021 falls outside the typical peak season period (Week46, 2020 to Week6, 2021). Based on historically low influenza positivity rates and declining trends noted in Weeks52, 2020 to Week3, 2021, Week8, 2021 is consistent with the off-season classification due to minimal ILI activity and lower disease intensity.
3. The time-series trend analysis demonstrates a consistent decline from Week1, 2021 onwards (1115 to 783), and the predictive model projects this continued low activity to taper off further five weeks into the future. Based on this downward momentum and typical off-season behavior, the occurrence projection at Week8, 2021 aligns with the anticipated reduced activity around 522 cases.
4. Influenza activity has remained historically low in recent weeks (Week52, 2020 #1; Week53, 2020 #1; Week3, 2021 #1), with positivity rates well below seasonal baselines. Such continued low positivity strongly influences the off-season trend.
5. Severe disruptions to healthcare-seeking behaviors during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are impacting ILI surveillance, with COVID-19 dominating respiratory activity (Week52, 2020 #9; Week1, 2021 #9; Week2, 2021 #9). These external disruptions highlight the limited contribution of influenza to ILI surveillance data.
6. Future flu activity is flagged as uncertain but remains suppressed due to concurrent COVID-19 trends and lower-than-expected seasonality factors (Week53, 2020 #10; Week1, 2021 #10; Week3, 2021 #10). This reduces the probability of sharp increases in the near term.
7. In conclusion, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 522 for Week8, 2021 reflects the ongoing off-season classification, prevailing declines in ILI occurrences, historically low influenza positivity rates, suppressed influenza circulation driven by COVID-19, and predictive modeling that accounts for recent trends.
