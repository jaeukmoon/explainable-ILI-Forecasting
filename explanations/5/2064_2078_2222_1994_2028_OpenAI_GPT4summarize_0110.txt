1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week48 to Week52, 2020 are 2064, 2078, 2222, 1994, and 2028. The trend shows a slight increase from Week48 (2064) to Week50 (2222) before decreasing in Week51 (1994) and Week52 (2028). This pattern reflects mild fluctuations, with no significant upward or downward momentum, remaining relatively stable across the five weeks.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically runs from around Week46 of one year through Week6 of the next year. Given that Week4, 2021 falls into this timeframe, it corresponds to the peak season. Influenza activity, however, remains unusually low during this period based on virologic surveillance and ILI reporting trends (Week48 to Week52, 2020 #1, #10; Week51, 2020 #9).
3. By analyzing the historical time-series data, the slight fluctuations observed over these weeks suggest relatively stable or mildly declining ILI activity. Projecting forward five weeks, this stability aligns with a forecast near 1805 occurrences. The ongoing low positivity rate (Week48 to Week52, 2020 #1, #9) further influences this downward adjustment.
4. Positivity rates for influenza virus remain exceedingly low, ranging from 0.1% to 0.3% in Week48 to Week52, 2020 (#1), reflecting minimal virus circulation. This sustained low activity supports expectations of lower ILI occurrences in Week4, 2021.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behavior and co-circulation with COVID-19 heavily influence ILI surveillance, reducing reliability and potentially underestimating actual occurrences (Week48, 2020 #8, #10; Week51, 2020 #8). These disruptions likely contribute to muted flu activity and lower ILI reported cases.
6. Reduced influenza-associated hospitalization rates and limited pediatric deaths compared to normal seasons indicate atypically low flu severity (Week49, 2020 #5, #7; Week52, 2020 #7). This observation reinforces expectations of continued subdued ILI activity in Week4, 2021.
7. Given the observed stable ILI activity, off-season-like virologic trends despite being in the peak season, and ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, the predicted ILI occurrence of 1805 reflects a continuation of minimal influenza activity consistent with Week48 to Week52, 2020 patterns.
