1. The reported ILI counts from Week52, 2023 to Week4, 2024 are 18744, 16149, 15014, 12554, and 13044. The data reflect a declining trend from Week52, 2023 to Week3, 2024, followed by a slight rebound in Week4, 2024. This suggests that while ILI occurrences dropped significantly during these weeks, the rebound indicates an elevated baseline rather than a complete resolution of activity. The trend overall depicts stabilization but at a relatively high level of activity compared to the off-season.
2. Week9, 2024 falls into the off-season period, which typically spans from Week7 to Week31. Although influenza activity remains elevated, the historical context and consistent decline from peak levels in Week52, 2023 align with off-season behavior. Therefore, forecasting Week9, 2024 as part of the off-season is appropriate.
3. From the time-series perspective, the declining pattern observed through Week3, 2024, followed by a minor increase in Week4, indicates a stabilization at elevated levels rather than a sharp recovery or further decline. Projecting forward, this suggests a continued modest reduction over the next five weeks, stabilizing around an off-season baseline. Thus, 10736 occurrences forecasted for Week9, 2024 reflect the influence of these stabilization dynamics.
4. CDC reports highlight the significant dominance of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 as contributing to elevated ILI activity. By Week4, 2024, Influenza A accounted for 78.9% of viruses, with A(H1N1)pdm09 making up the majority (Week4, 2024 #2). This variant’s sustained activity contributes to the persistence of moderately high ILI levels even as overall cases decline.
5. Seasonal vaccination rates are moderate. Despite ongoing CDC recommendations, vaccine uptake remains insufficient to curb transmission entirely (Week52, 2023 #9; Week4, 2024 #7). Late-season vaccination benefits are noted but cannot fully mitigate sustained co-circulation of ILI-driving factors.
6. The co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 continues to complicate ILI activity trends (Week52, 2023 #10; Week1, 2024 #9; Week4, 2024 #8). This mixed viral contribution sustains elevated ILI occurrences during the off-season, even as influenza trends stabilize.
7. In conclusion, the ILI forecast of 10736 for Week9, 2024 is justified by declining but stabilized ILI trends, classification as off-season, the persistent dominance of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, moderate vaccine coverage, and ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses. Collectively, these factors maintain moderate ILI activity consistent with the predicted occurrence.
