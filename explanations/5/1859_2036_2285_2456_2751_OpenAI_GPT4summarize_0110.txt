1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week29 to Week33, 2021, are 1859, 2036, 2285, 2456, and 2751. This demonstrates a consistent rising trend over the five weeks, with a steady increase of approximately 8–12% week-over-week. There are no significant dips or fluctuations, indicating a sustained upward trajectory in ILI occurrences, likely signaling the transition into higher respiratory illness activity.
2. Week38, 2021, falls within the Peak onset season based on standard U.S. seasonality patterns. Historically, Week32 to Week46 aligns with this period, when ILI activity begins to rise but typically does not reach peak levels. The continuous growth trend in ILI occurrences in the prior weeks (Week29 to Week33, 2021), along with multiple respiratory viral influences, supports classifying this period as part of the Peak onset season.
3. The historical pattern of steadily increasing ILI counts over five weeks (Week29 to Week33, 2021) strongly correlates with the projected forecast for Week38, 2021. Using a time-series forecasting approach, the consistent trajectory suggests a continuation of moderate growth. Extrapolation of this trend predicts a slight tapering of increase by Week38, 2021, resulting in ILI occurrences of 2736.
4. The influence of respiratory viruses beyond influenza, such as SARS-CoV-2, is significant, as CDC reports (Week30, 2021 #7; Week31, 2021 #3; Week33, 2021 #3) suggest that many of the recent ILI increases were driven by non-influenza pathogens, complicating broader ILI trends during this period.
5. The reports (Week32, 2021 #9; Week33, 2021 #9) highlight healthcare behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic, which have altered ILI surveillance data, potentially underestimating or overemphasizing certain trends.
6. The increase in ILI visits across all age groups (Week29, 2021 #2; Week31, 2021 #3; Week33, 2021 #2) confirms a broad uptick in respiratory illness, indicative of higher ILI transmission heading into Week38, 2021.
5. Influenza-specific activity remains low nationwide as indicated by low virologic detection in clinical and public health labs (Week29, 2021 #3; Week32, 2021 #7; Week33, 2021 #3). Although ILI-related illnesses have increased, they are largely attributable to other respiratory pathogens like SARS-CoV-2.
6. Novel influenza variants (e.g., Influenza A(H1N2)v; Week32, 2021 #2) were detected but without evidence of human-to-human transmission, reducing immediate influenza concerns.
7. Vaccination trends remain relatively stable with no significant updates, but CDC emphasizes maintaining routine annual flu vaccination (Week30, 2021 #9; Week31, 2021 #10; Week32, 2021 #6), which in combination with generally low influenza virus circulation could suppress severe influenza outbreaks.
6. The steady increase in ILI occurrences over five weeks (Week29 to Week33, 2021), timing within the Peak onset season, non-influenza pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 driving transmission, and modest vaccination and virologic surveillance influences contribute to the forecast of 2736 occurrences for Week38, 2021.
7. In summary, the predicted ILI value of 2736 for Week38, 2021, reflects a continuation of the upward but moderate growth trend in reported ILI counts, the typical seasonal timing of the Peak onset season, the significant impact of non-influenza respiratory pathogens, and stable yet low influenza-specific activities. These factors collectively justify the five-week-ahead projection.
