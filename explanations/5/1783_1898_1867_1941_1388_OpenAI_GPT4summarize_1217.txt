1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited significant variability, with values of ['1783', '1898', '1867', '1941', '1388']. There was an initial rise from 1783 (Week 51, 2020) to 1898 (Week 52, 2020), followed by a marginal dip to 1867 (Week 53, 2020). A peak at 1941 (Week 1, 2021) was then observed, before a sharp decline to 1388 in Week 2, 2021. The abrupt drop in the final week disrupts what might have otherwise been a sustained upward trend.
2. The reduction in ILI activity during Week 2, 2021, combined with overall fluctuations, may explain the future decrease to 618 occurrences (Week 7, 2021). Lower ILI occurrences in the last observed week appear indicative of the downward trajectory continuing into subsequent weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed stable or declining trends, with rates consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%. Visits began at 1.6% (Week 51, 2020 to Week 53, 2020) and gradually dropped to 1.4% in Week 2, 2021. This decrease correlates with the future reduction to 618 occurrences.
4. Influenza testing revealed historically low positivity rates across clinical labs, ranging from 0.3% (Weeks 51–52, 2020) to 0.1% (Week 53, 2020, and Week 2, 2021). Limited influenza strain circulation, paired with declining lab confirmations, supports suppressed activity and aligns with diminished future occurrences.
5. Minimal hospitalizations and PIC mortality patterns predominantly driven by COVID-19, with influenza contributing marginally, further reinforce unusually low flu activity. Reported pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC)-related deaths ranged between 13.6%–17.2%, yet most were attributed to COVID-19, limiting the influenza impact on future weeks.
6. Other factors such as suppressed influenza transmission due to overlapping COVID-19 mitigation measures, altered healthcare-seeking behaviors, and reduced vaccination uptake likely contributed to the atypically low ILI occurrence of 618 (Week 7, 2021). These systemic changes hinder traditional surveillance and reporting accuracy.
7. In summary, the future 618 ILI occurrences (Week 7, 2021) reflect the sharp ILI decline by Week 2, 2021, sustained decreases in outpatient ILI visits, limited influenza positivity rates, and the compounded effects of pandemic-induced healthcare disruptions and mitigation strategies suppressing influenza transmission.
