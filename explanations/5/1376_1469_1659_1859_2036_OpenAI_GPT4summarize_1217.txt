1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, starting from 1376 (Week26, 2021) and increasing to 2036 (Week30, 2021). This steady rise week by week indicates a gradual escalation in ILI activity, culminating in a notable peak by the end of the observed period.
2. A strong correlation exists between the rising trajectory of past ILI occurrences and the reported future occurrence of 2964 after 5 weeks. The consistent week-over-week increase from Week26 to Week30, 2021, sets the stage for an amplified rise in ILI activity, with the upward momentum manifesting in the significantly high future ILI number.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed continuous increases, climbing from 1.2% (Week26, 2021) to 1.9% (Week30, 2021), reflecting growing respiratory illness transmission across age groups. This uptick correlates with the future surge in ILI cases.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) rose from 6.2% (Week26, 2021) to 9.0% (Week30, 2021), consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds. This increase suggests heightened respiratory illness activity in communities, contributing to the future rise in ILI numbers.
5. ILI activity levels remained minimal across jurisdictions during the observed period; however, rising respiratory illnesses linked to COVID-19 and other causes might have indirectly amplified ILI reporting. Pandemic-related disruptions to healthcare-seeking behaviors further complicated and potentially delayed case recognition, fueling the sharp rise in future ILI occurrences.
6. Minimal influenza positivity rates and virologic activity were reported throughout the 5 weeks (e.g., 0.1% positivity in Week27, 2021), suggesting non-specific respiratory illnesses or alternative factors driving ILI activity. The observed increases in outpatient ILI visits and PIC mortality were primarily associated with COVID-19 trends, reinforcing the non-flu contributors to the future ILI rise.
7. In summary, the future occurrence of 2964 ILI cases (Week35, 2021) can be attributed to the steady upward trend in past ILI data, increasing outpatient visits for ILI, consistently high PIC mortality rates exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the compounding effects of pandemic-related healthcare-seeking behaviors and non-flu respiratory illness activity.
