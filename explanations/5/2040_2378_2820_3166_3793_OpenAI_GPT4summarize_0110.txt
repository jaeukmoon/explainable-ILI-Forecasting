1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week09 to Week13, 2022 are 2040, 2378, 2820, 3166, and 3793, showing a clear and consistent upward trend in ILI activity. New weekly occurrences increased by 338, 442, 346, and 627, respectively, indicating a pattern of accelerating growth rather than stabilization, reflective of rising flu activity.
2. Based on historical U.S. patterns, the off-season typically spans from Week01 to Week31. However, due to both the steadily increasing trend and CDC projections of continued elevated flu activity (Week13, 2022 #11), the target week (Week18, 2022) aligns with an early "off-season" period showing a localized intensification in flu activity. Thus, Week18, 2022 is best forecasted as an off-season.
3. The observed consistent rise in ILI occurrences across Week09 to Week13, 2022 strongly correlates with the CDC reports of increasing flu activity in central and south-central regions and other areas of the U.S. (Week13, 2022 #1). A time-series forecasting model would base predictions on this continuing growth trend, projecting future values to reflect an uninterrupted increase in flu prevalence, culminating in the estimate of 5433 for Week18, 2022.
4. Dominance of the A(H3N2) strain with antigenic differences, reducing vaccine effectiveness and contributing to expanding flu activity (Week09, 2022 #3, #5; Week13, 2022 #2, #9).
5. - Extensive co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, further complicating the outbreak and raising cumulative case counts (Week09, 2022 #9; Week13, 2022 #13).
6. - High hospitalization rates (8.0 per 100,000 by Week13, 2022), driven by Influenza A, indicating severe impacts and widespread community spread (Week13, 2022 #5).
5. Influenza positivity rates steadily increased from 5.8% in Week09, 2022 to 8.3% in Week13, 2022 (Week09, 2022 #2; Week13, 2022 #2), accompanied by geographic spread (central, south-central, and northeast regions in Week13, 2022 #1). This indicates an expanding outbreak.
6. Although vaccine uptake remains moderate and flu vaccine-strain matches are imperfect, vaccination efforts are ongoing and recommended (Week13, 2022 #9). This provides some dampening effect but does not reverse the upward trajectory. Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 (3.2%-5.9%) and other respiratory viruses (Week09, 2022 #9; Week13, 2022 #13) further exacerbated illness rates.
7. In summary, the forecast of 5433 ILI occurrences for Week18, 2022 reflects the continuation of observed ILI activity increases, driven by the dominance of A(H3N2) with antigenic drifts, widespread regional outbreaks with increases in hospitalization and positivity rates, and high co-circulation of other respiratory viruses. These combined factors, alongside the current off-season classification, justify the projected value.
