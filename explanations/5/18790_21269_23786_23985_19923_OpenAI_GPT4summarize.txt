1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks revealed a fluctuating yet overall elevated trend, with values ['18790', '21269', '23786', '23985', '19923']. The ILI activity rose from 18,790 (Week 19, 2022) to a peak of 23,985 (Week 22, 2022) before declining sharply to 19,923 (Week 23, 2022). While there is variability, this pattern illustrates heightened respiratory illness activity, particularly around Weeks 21 and 22, followed by a downturn toward Week 23.

2. A moderate positive correlation is observed between the past and future ILI occurrences. Although Week 23, 2022, exhibited a decline, the overall elevated levels during the earlier weeks (notably through Weeks 20–22) have likely sustained transmission momentum, leading to the reported 13,771 occurrences in Week 28, 2022. The drop at Week 23 appears to be a short-term fluctuation rather than a reversal of the longer-term pattern.

3. The percentage of outpatient visits for ILI hovered at elevated though steady levels, staying below the national baseline but highlighting concerns in specific regions. These visits ranged from 2.4% in Week 19, 2022, to 2.1% in Week 23, with notable increases in regions 4 and 10. As these trends are indicative of broader respiratory illness activity, they have likely contributed to sustained ILI occurrences in future weeks.

4. Co-infection rates with SARS-CoV-2 remained consistent over the weeks, with 4.5–4.2% of influenza-positive samples testing positive for COVID-19. This co-circulation of respiratory viruses contributed to compounded respiratory illness cases, amplifying the broader ILI patterns observed, including future elevated activity.

5. Antigenic differences in the dominant Influenza A(H3N2) virus compromised vaccine effectiveness, as highlighted repeatedly in Weeks 19 through 23, 2022. These mismatches reduced community immunity, allowing sustained transmission and contributing to elevated ILI occurrences, even as vaccine efforts continued.

6. In summary, the reported 13,771 ILI occurrences in Week 28, 2022, can be attributed to the overall elevated past trend, regional increases in outpatient ILI visits, persistent co-infections with SARS-CoV-2, and reduced vaccine effectiveness against Influenza A(H3N2). These factors collectively sustained respiratory illness activity despite some variability in Week 23, 2022, enabling the observed future occurrence levels.
