1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences over the past five weeks demonstrate a decreasing trend. Starting at 1171 in Week 44, 2020, the values peaked at 1416 in Week 46, 2020, before declining to 1230 in Week 48, 2020. While fluctuations occurred, the overall trend indicates a stabilization at lower levels compared to high ILI activity periods.
2. Based on the outlined seasonality patterns and the data, the target week (None) is forecasted to belong to the Off-season. This aligns with the unusual flu activity being consistently below national baselines, influenced heavily by COVID-19 mitigation measures and reduced viral circulation during this time of year.
3. Correlation analysis reveals that ILI occurrences are expected to stabilize further or drop slightly based on historical patterns. The downward trend between Week 46, 2020 and Week 48, 2020, combined with the summary reports indicating low transmission, corresponds with forecasting a lower ILI value such as 1060 in None.
4. Key factors influencing the forecast:
5. a. Unusually low levels of influenza activity during Weeks 44-48, 2020, with respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza ranging between 0.1%-0.2%, far below historic norms, suggest an extended period of minimal ILI occurrences.
6. b. Extensive COVID-19 mitigation measures like masking, social distancing, and behavioral shifts have contributed to suppressed influenza transmission, as highlighted consistently from Week 44, 2020 to Week 48, 2020.
7. c. Vaccination campaigns emphasized by the CDC are occurring as a preventative measure, though no significant changes in vaccination coverage trends were noted during this period, implying limited immediate impact on ILI occurrences.
5. In summary, the predicted future occurrence of 1060 aligns with the observed decreasing trend in ILI activity, the off-season designation for None, and the influence of persistent COVID-19 mitigation efforts, reduced viral circulation, and ILI rates below the national baseline. These elements collectively justify the projected value.
