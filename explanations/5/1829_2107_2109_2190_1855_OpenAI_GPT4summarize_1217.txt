1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating trend, showing an increase from 1829 (Week43, 2021) to 2107 (Week44, 2021) and 2109 (Week45, 2021), followed by a slight rise to 2190 (Week46, 2021) before decreasing to 1855 (Week47, 2021). This reflects a temporary surge in ILI activity toward the middle of the period, followed by a decline by the end of the observed 5 weeks.
2. There is a positive correlation between the past time-series ILI occurrences and the future rise to 3231, as evidenced by the earlier surge during Weeks 44–46, 2021, which indicates elevated respiratory illness activity. Although the dip in Week 47 suggests some reduction in activity, the broader upward movement over Weeks 43–46 likely anticipated the future increase to 3231 after 5 weeks.
3. The upward trend in outpatient ILI visits from 1.9% (Week43) to 2.4% (Week47) is indicative of increasing respiratory illness activity under or near baseline levels, paving the way for higher future ILI trends. The dominance of A(H3N2) influenza in 5–24-year-olds, consistently growing over Weeks 43–47, points to an age-specific ILI rise contributing to future higher occurrences. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, as noted throughout the period, likely amplified ILI visit rates alongside rising influenza activity. Additionally, changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and the impact of ongoing COVID-19 surveillance distortions, highlighted in all weeks, suggest amplified ILI reporting trends correlating with the expected future surge.
4. Persistent high PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, ranging from 14.1% (Week44) to 15.5% (Week47), indicates significant respiratory illness burden, possibly linked to observed future ILI increases. The steady rise in influenza positivity rates—from 0.2% (Week43) to 1.5% (Week47)—reflects gradually accumulating influenza activity that aligns with the future ILI growth. Increased hospitalizations, from 282 (Week43) to 495 (Week47), alongside dominant A(H3N2) infections, further corroborate rising ILI occurrences during this interval and the subsequent spike to 3231.
5. In summary, the future increase in ILI occurrences to 3231 (Week52, 2021) reflects the general upward trend during Weeks 43–46, rising outpatient ILI visits, consistent dominance of A(H3N2)-driven infection in younger populations, steady growth in influenza positivity rates, and compounded effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses and disrupted healthcare behavior patterns due to COVID-19.
