1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week9, 2024 to Week13, 2024 are 10736, 9697, 9207, 9168, and 9079. The trend shows a consistent decline over these weeks, indicating that ILI activity is diminishing steadily. There is no evidence of abrupt spikes or fluctuations, suggesting a clear downward trajectory during this period.
2. Week18, 2024 belongs to the off-season as it falls well after the typical peak season (which ends around Week6) and before the peak onset season (beginning around Week32 or later). Additionally, the continuous decrease in ILI positivity, hospitalization rates, and outpatient visits supports the classification of this period as an off-season.
3. Based on the time-series pattern, the declining trend in ILI counts indicates a gradual decrease as the season wanes. Using this trajectory, forecasting models project that ILI occurrences will continue to drop at a steady pace over the next five weeks, resulting in a predicted value of 5805 ILI occurrences by Week18, 2024.
4. Nationwide flu activity is decreasing across most regions, with influenza positivity dropping from 13.9% in Week9, 2024 to 9.1% by Week13, 2024 (Week9, 2024 #1; Week13, 2024 #1), reinforcing a waning seasonal pattern.
5. Vaccination trends are consistently encouraged by the CDC, with matched vaccine strains providing effective protection (Week9, 2024 #8; Week12, 2024 #9; Week13, 2024 #9). Low antiviral resistance for all strains further supports reduced transmission (Week9, 2024 #9; Week13, 2024 #10).
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including RSV and COVID-19, have maintained stable impacts without significant deviations in ILI counts or flu-related hospitalizations (Week9, 2024 #10; Week13, 2024 #11).
7. Given the sustained downward ILI trend, off-season timing for Week18, 2024, the positive effects of vaccination and antiviral effectiveness, and declining influenza positivity rates, the forecasted ILI occurrence aligns reasonably at 5805.
