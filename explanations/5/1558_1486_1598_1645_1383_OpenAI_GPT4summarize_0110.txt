1. The reported ILI counts from Week17 to Week21, 2021 are 1558, 1486, 1598, 1645, and 1383. The trend exhibits mild fluctuations with a peak in Week20 (1645) followed by a notable decline in Week21 (1383). The overall pattern suggests a slight rise between Week18 and Week20 before tapering off, indicating fluctuating yet low-level occurrences rather than sustained growth.
2. Week26, 2021 falls within the off-season as per typical U.S. influenza activity trends. Off-season influenza activity generally spans from Week07 through Week31 each year, with minimal transmission and low prevalence. The consistently low influenza positivity rates (Week17-Week21, 2021 #1) and below-baseline outpatient ILI visits (Week17-Week21, 2021 #7, #4) further affirm that Week26, 2021 belongs to the off-season.
3. The historical pattern of relatively stable ILI counts, combined with the observed decline in Week21, suggests no significant uptick in cases in the subsequent weeks. A time-series forecasting model would project a continuation of these low levels, settling approximately at 1376 occurrences by Week26, 2021, aligning with observed patterns of plateaued or reduced activity during the off-season.
4. Influenza positivity rates consistently remain minimal, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive from Week17 to Week21, 2021 (Week17-Week21, 2021 #1). This reflects suppressed viral transmission likely to persist into Week26.
5. Outpatient visits for ILI remain well below the baseline of 2.6% throughout this period (Week17 #7, Week18 #4, Week19 #7, Week20 #4, Week21 #1) and reflect minimal community impact.
6. The overarching influence of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to suppress traditional influenza activity due to altered healthcare-seeking behavior, as reported throughout these weeks (Week17 #9, Week18 #9, Week19 #10, Week20 #10, Week21 #7).
7. Based on the declining ILI trajectory, off-season categorization, lower test positivity, reduced outpatient visits, and minimal flu transmission, the projected ILI occurrences of 1376 for Week26, 2021 align with the observed factors and future outlook.
