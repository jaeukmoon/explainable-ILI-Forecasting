1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week1, 2024 to Week5, 2024) in Region 2 show a consistently declining trend. The values are 16149, 15014, 12554, 13044, and 12486. Following a sharp drop from Week1 (16149) to Week3 (12554), and a minor increase in Week4 (13044), the decrease resumed in Week5 (12486). This overall downward trajectory (approximately a 22.7% drop from Week1 to Week5) indicates a steady decline in ILI occurrences over this period.
2. Week10, 2024 belongs to the "Off-season" as determined by the timeline of U.S. influenza cycles. Specifically, the peak season spans from approximately Week46 of the previous year to Week6 of the current year. Starting from Week7 onward, the influenza activity typically tapers into the off-season, where occurrences decline toward baseline levels. Week10 falls within this off-season period, where minimal ILI activity is expected due to reduced transmission and seasonal factors.
3. A forecasting analysis of ILI occurrences for Week10, 2024 includes averaging past trends and adjusting for off-season effects. Using the 5-week data, the average value of ILI occurrences is calculated as:
4. (16149 + 15014 + 12554 + 13044 + 12486) / 5 = 13849.4 (rounded to 13849).
5. Considering the consistent decline in ILI occurrences and the typical off-season pattern where declines accelerate, further adjustment is applied. From Week1 (16149) to Week5 (12486), the weekly decrease is approximately 9.9% on average. Extending this rate over the next 5 weeks entirely into the off-season, we forecast:
6. 12486 x (1 - 0.099)^5 ≈ 9697. This predictive decline aligns with historical seasonal reductions during the off-season.
4. CDC reports provide several influencing factors:
5. 1) **Seasonal shift into off-season:** Elevated influenza activity seen in prior weeks (driven by Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09) is waning, as observed through decreasing outpatient visits, positivity rates, and mortality (e.g., outpatient visits declined from 5.7% in Week1 to 4.4% in Week5, and deaths dropped from 1.3% to 0.8% during the same period). These are consistent with a shift into the off-season.
6. 2) **Vaccination and immunity trends:** High levels of vaccination coverage and effective antivirals (near-complete susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors by Week5) likely contribute to diminishing transmission, further curbing ILI rates during the off-season.
7. 3) **Absence of novel influenza strains:** No new influenza variants such as SARS-CoV-2 were detected from Week1 to Week5, reducing the chances of unexpected surges in flu activity. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, though complicating hospitalizations, has shown declining trends in recent weeks.
8. Each of these factors corroborates a continuation of the declining trend into Week10, reducing ILI occurrences to near-baseline levels.
5. In summary, the forecast of 9697 for Week10, 2024 is supported by (1) the steady decline in ILI activity over the past 5 weeks, (2) the shift into the off-season, characterized by minimal flu prevalence, (3) effective vaccination and antiviral measures limiting further transmission, and (4) no emergence of novel strains or atypical drivers. These combined factors strongly justify this prediction, reflecting both statistical trends and qualitative CDC insights.
