1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Week35–Week39, 2021) exhibited a general declining trend, with values of ['1395', '1315', '1243', '1309', '1140']. The highest value of 1395 in Week35, 2021, gradually decreased to 1140 in Week39, 2021, aside from a minor increase from Week38, 2021 (1243) to Week39, 2021 (1309). Overall, this indicates a decreasing pattern of ILI activity by the end of the 5-week observation period.
2. A weak negative correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the declining trend in past weeks (Week35–Week39, 2021) does not directly reflect the modest future value of 1228 recorded after 5 weeks (Week44, 2021). This suggests that other external factors, rather than the past trajectory, influenced the slight increase.
3. Week39, 2021, reports indicated a continued low influenza activity nationwide, with outpatient visits due to ILI accounting for only 1.9%, significantly below the national baseline of 2.6%. However, other respiratory viruses likely contributed to ongoing ILI incidents.
4. PIC mortality percentages remained high but gradually decreased from 21.0% in Week36, 2021, to 18.7% in Week39, 2021, largely driven by COVID-19. This level of respiratory-related mortality reflects persistent non-influenza respiratory illnesses, potentially impacting ILI figures.
5. Extensive reports emphasize that healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted traditional systems for tracking ILI accurately. This ongoing disruption may contribute to unpredictable fluctuations in ILI counts observed in the future.
6. Minimal influenza virus circulation was consistently reported across Weeks35–Week39, 2021, with no substantial positivity rates or increases in subtype detections. This highlights that the future ILI occurrences were likely driven by non-specific respiratory viruses rather than influenza itself.
7. In summary, the reported 1228 future ILI occurrences (Week44, 2021) are primarily attributed to the low but persistent non-influenza respiratory illnesses detected during Weeks35–Week39, 2021, alongside high PIC mortality. Pandemic-driven disruptions to healthcare-seeking behavior and reporting systems also contributed to the unexpected deviation from the declining past trend.
