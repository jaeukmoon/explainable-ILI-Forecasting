1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend with values ['1558', '1486', '1598', '1645', '1383']. There was an initial decline from 1558 (Week 17, 2021) to 1486 (Week 18, 2021), followed by an increase peaking at 1645 in Week 19, 2021, before dropping sharply to 1383 in Week 21, 2021. This inconsistency indicates variability in ILI activity with no sustained upward or downward direction.

2. A moderately negative correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences. The sharp decrease to 1383 in Week 21, 2021, suggests reduced ILI-related activity by the end of the 5-week period, aligning with the lowered future ILI activity reported as 1376 (Week 26, 2021). The decline in the final week of the past data appears to set the stage for stable but slightly diminished future ILI levels.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently low and stable throughout the observed period, hovering between 1.1% (Week 17, 2021) and 1.3% (Week 20, 2021), significantly below the national baseline of 2.6%. This sustained minimal ILI activity in healthcare settings supports the low future occurrence of 1376.  
   - Minimal influenza activity was reported nationwide, with only 0.1% respiratory specimens testing positive weekly from Weeks 17 to 21, 2021. This extended low positivity rate likely translated into subdued respiratory illness transmission levels, reflected in future occurrence stability.  
   - Cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza remained at a historically low 0.8 per 100,000 population across all weeks, suggesting reduced severity of flu cases. This consistently low impact likely contributed to the minimal future ILI count.  
   - The dominant influence of changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic altered traditional reporting structures, potentially restricting outpatient visits for minor ILI cases and influencing a reduced overall future ILI observation.

4. In summary, the reported 1376 future ILI occurrences (Week 26, 2021) can be attributed to the fluctuating but declining trend in past data by Week 21, stable and minimal ILI outpatient visits well below baseline levels, sustained historically low influenza activity and hospitalization rates, and the ongoing impact of pandemic-driven healthcare-seeking changes that constrained ILI data collection. These factors collectively indicate subdued ILI transmission and reporting in the future period.
