1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week50, 2023 to Week2, 2024 are 12722, 14473, 16604, 14312, and 11664. The trend initially shows an increasing trajectory from Week50, 2023 (12722) to Week51, 2023 (14473) and Week52, 2023 (16604), reaching a seasonal peak around Week52. However, the ILI counts start to decline by Week1, 2024 (14312) and further in Week2, 2024 (11664). This shift indicates a post-peak reduction in activity, with a downward trend as the season progresses into January 2024.
2. Based on U.S. influenza season patterns, Week7, 2024 aligns with the off-season. The peak season usually ends around Week6, and historical data combined with recent trends suggest declining activity. CDC surveillance in Week2, 2024 (#3, #7, #11) anticipates stabilization or reduction, further implying Week7 belongs to the off-season.
3. Correlation analysis of past data shows that Weeks50, 2023 to Week52, 2023 experienced a significant increase indicative of the peak, but Weeks1 and 2, 2024 marked a steady decline. When projecting forward, the decreasing trend suggests a stabilization near higher off-season levels. The overall trajectory, with similar past-season trends taken into account, supports a gradual decline to an ILI occurrence of 16863 by Week7, 2024.
4. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 is the predominant strain, consistently accounting for over 80% of Influenza A cases (Week50, 2023 #2; Week2, 2024 #2, #6). Despite high infection activity, widespread vaccine coverage and substantial antiviral effectiveness (Week50, 2023 #10; Week2, 2024 #8, #9) have begun to mitigate the ILI peak. A gradual post-peak reduction is evident by Week2, 2024 (#1, #3, #11).
5. Seasonal vaccination remains ongoing, with CDC estimates suggesting benefits persist even late into the flu season (Week50, 2023 #9; Week1, 2024 #8). Vaccination coverage helps reduce severe outcomes and transmission, which correlates with the observed trend decline after Week52, 2023 (#8).
6. Elevated hospitalization rates (Week52, 2023 #4; Week2, 2024 #4) and co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, increase complexity in managing ILI trends (Week50, 2023 #8; Week2, 2024 #11). Co-circulation sustains elevated activity, though declining positivity rates and outpatient visits (Week1, 2024 #6; Week2, 2024 #3) show progression toward stabilization.
7. The projection of 16863 ILI occurrences in Week7, 2024 reflects the observed post-peak decline with a transition toward an off-season baseline. Influencing factors include reduced outpatient visits for ILI, slower hospitalization growth, ongoing vaccination efforts, and sustained but manageable impacts from co-circulating viruses. Together, these factors justify the projected value.
