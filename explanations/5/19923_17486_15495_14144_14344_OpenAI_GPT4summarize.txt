1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a clear downward trend, with values decreasing from 19923 (Week 23, 2022) to 17486 (Week 24, 2022), 15495 (Week 25, 2022), 14144 (Week 26, 2022), and slightly rising to 14344 (Week 27, 2022). The initial decline suggests diminishing ILI activity, complemented by the minor uptick at the end, potentially signaling stabilization in respiratory illness activity. This declining trend is consistent with seasonal influenza waning.

2. The future ILI occurrences (Week 32, 2022) at 11715 align with the diminishing trajectory observed in the past time-series data. The decline in ILI activity from Weeks 23–27, 2022, mirrors the lower ILI occurrence after five weeks, indicating a continuation of seasonal decline in respiratory illnesses.

3. Influenza positivity rates in clinical specimens markedly decreased over the reporting weeks, from 3.4% (Week 23, 2022) to 2.5% (Week 24, 2022), 1.8% (Week 25, 2022), 1.4% (Week 26, 2022), and 0.7% (Week 27, 2022). The consistent decline in influenza positivity, primarily driven by Influenza A (H3N2), reflects reduced virus circulation and correlates strongly with the subsequent reduction in ILI occurrences.  
   Healthcare-seeking behavior for ILI remained subdued throughout the period due to pandemic-related changes, as highlighted in the CDC reports. This behavioral shift likely contributed to lower reported ILI cases, consistent with the reduced future occurrences.  
   Geographic ILI activity also diminished significantly, transitioning from a few regions reporting high activity (Week 23, 2022) to only minimal activity across nearly all jurisdictions by Week 27, 2022. This spatial decline aligns with the observed drop in ILI occurrences.

4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences decline to 11715 in Week 32, 2022, is predominantly driven by the downward trend in past ILI cases (Weeks 23–27, 2022), reduced influenza virus positivity, suppressed healthcare-seeking behaviors post-COVID-19, and diminished geographic activity. The consistency of these downward trends over the 5-week period strongly correlates with the decreased reported occurrences after five weeks.
