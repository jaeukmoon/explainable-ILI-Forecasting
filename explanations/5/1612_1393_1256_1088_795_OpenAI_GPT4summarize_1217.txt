1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent and significant downward trend, with values decreasing from 1612 (Week14, 2024) to 795 (Week18, 2024). This steady decline over time reflects a reduction in respiratory illness activity nationally, as corroborated by a decrease in clinical positivity rates for influenza during the same period.
2. There is a clear correlation between past and future ILI occurrences, as the declining ILI activity in the past weeks aligns with the significantly reduced ILI estimate of 449 occurrences in future weeks (Week23, 2024). The consistent downward trajectory in the past occurrences suggests sustained decreased flu transmission and respiratory illness trends, influencing the low future activity.
3. Several factors from the CDC reports correlate strongly with the observed future reduction. a) The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza declined consistently, from 7.7% in Week14, 2024, to 3.1% in Week18, 2024, illustrating a waning flu season. b) Outpatient visits for ILI decreased from 2.8% (Week14, 2024) to 2.1% (Week18, 2024), staying below the national baseline—indicating declining community ILI activity. c) Cumulative hospitalization rates showed only marginal increases across Weeks 14–18, with fewer hospitalizations each week, reflecting decreased severe illnesses. d) Influenza-attributed deaths remained stable or declined, with 0.4% in Week14 decreasing to 0.2% by Week18, 2024, highlighting reduced mortality associated with flu activity. e) Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, like COVID-19 and RSV, was noted to complicate attribution, but significant declines in influenza positivity suggest these trends favor lower flu cases.
4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 449 (Week23, 2024) are primarily attributed to the clear and steady decline in past ILI occurrences during Weeks 14–18, 2024. This decline is supported by decreasing outpatient ILI visits, influenza positivity rates, and stable-to-lower hospitalization and mortality data—all reflecting reduced respiratory illness activity. Additionally, the waning flu season, coupled with vaccination and public health measures, contributed to this significant reduction.
