1. The reported ILI counts from Week12 to Week16, 2024, are 1909, 1747, 1612, 1393, and 1256. This consistent decline in ILI occurrences over the 5-week period demonstrates a clear downward trend. No significant spikes were observed, indicating a steady reduction in ILI activity as the season progresses.
2. Forecasting Target Week (Week21, 2024) belongs to the off-season. The typical peak season ends by Week6 in the U.S., and Week21 is well beyond that peak. The ongoing reductions in ILI metrics (e.g., positivity rate consistently dropping and ILI visits falling below the national baseline in Week14 and Week15, 2024), as well as continued declines in influenza activity (Week16, 2024 #1, #3), indicate alignment with off-season characteristics.
3. From a time-series perspective, the steady decrease over five weeks suggests a relatively predictable continuation of this trend into the future. Based on historical seasonality and the observed downward trajectory, a continuation of this deceleration is expected, leading to a Week21, 2024, prediction of 625 ILI occurrences. This aligns with the observed stable-to-decreasing trajectory of ILI during off-season periods.
4. Flu positivity rates have steadily declined from 10.5% in Week12, 2024, down to 4.8% in Week16, 2024, indicating a reduction in overall influenza activity (Week12 #1; Week13 #1; Week14 #1; Week15 #1; Week16 #1). Given this consistent decrease, significant future ILI surges seem unlikely in the immediate weeks.
5. Vaccination uptake remains encouraged, with circulating strains genetically and antigenically similar to vaccine components (Week12 #9; Week14 #7; Week15 #9). This continued well-matched vaccination program mitigates additional ILI occurrences, particularly in conjunction with low antiviral resistance (Week13 #10).
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, complicates ILI attribution but shows no evidence of novel or highly transmissible influenza variants (Week12 #6; Week16 #8). The absence of an emergent driver further supports the predicted lowering of ILI counts.
7. In summary, the steady decline in ILI activity, alignment with off-season timing in Week21, 2024, the protective effect of vaccination against circulating virus strains, and the stable co-circulation of respiratory viruses all converge to justify the prediction of 625 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
