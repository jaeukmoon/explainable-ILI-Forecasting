1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but generally declining trend, with values of ['1309', '1140', '1250', '1279', '1218']. There was an initial sharp drop from 1309 (Week 38, 2021) to 1140 (Week 39, 2021), followed by a subsequent rise to 1250 (Week 40, 2021) and 1279 (Week 41, 2021). However, the final value of 1218 (Week 42, 2021) reflects an overall decline when compared to the starting point in Week 38, 2021. This trend reflects fluctuations with no sustained upward momentum.
2. A moderate negative correlation exists between the declining trend in past ILI occurrences and the observed future ILI occurrence of 1170 after 5 weeks (Week 47, 2021). The decrease from 1309 in Week 38 to 1218 in Week 42 does not directly predict the future value of 1170, which continues the general declining pattern but with a smaller drop compared to earlier weeks.
3. Weekly outpatient visits for ILI stagnated at or below 1.9%, maintaining lower-than-baseline activity (2.6% in Week 38, 2.5% in Week 40, and 2.5% in Week 42, 2021). This consistent sub-baseline trend, coupled with limited regional spread and activity stability, aligns with the future value of 1170, reflecting the ongoing minimal ILI activity.
4. The high percentage of deaths associated with Pneumonia, Influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently declined during the 5-week period, dropping from 20.9% (Week 38, 2021) to 16.5% (Week 42, 2021). Although PIC levels were driven primarily by COVID-19, the gradual decline might have contributed to observed stability or slight decreases in respiratory illness activity, reflected in the 1170 cases.
5. Minimal influenza virus circulation, with positivity rates for respiratory specimens remaining at 0.1% across multiple weeks and no significant uptick in lab-confirmed cases, corroborates the low but persistent ILI activity level reflected in the future occurrences of 1170.
6. Despite yearly vaccination efforts recommended by the CDC, no reported vaccination uptake trends across the 5 weeks suggest less robust influenza preventive coverage. However, stagnant trends in flu activity likely prevented substantial ILI increases, sustaining the lower future occurrence count.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1170 (Week 47, 2021) arise from the fluctuating yet declining past ILI trends, persistently low outpatient ILI percentages, declining PIC-related mortality, minimal influenza virus circulation, and unchanged healthcare-seeking behavior patterns influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors collectively contributed to sustained but low levels of ILI activity.
