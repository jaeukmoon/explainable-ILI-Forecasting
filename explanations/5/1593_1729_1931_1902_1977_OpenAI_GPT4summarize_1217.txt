1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated an overall upward trend, with values of ['1593', '1729', '1931', '1902', '1977']. There was an initial increase from 1593 in Week10, 2022, to 1931 in Week12, 2022, followed by a slight dip to 1902 in Week13, 2022, and then a rise to 1977 in Week14, 2022. This pattern highlights a sustained elevation in ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A strong correlation between the past ILI occurrences and future ILI activity is observed, as the consistent increase in occurrences over the five-week span (Weeks10–14, 2022) aligns with the reported jump in future ILI occurrences to 3134 after 5 weeks. The continuation of this upward trajectory, reflected in Week14, 2022, acts as a reliable predictor for the amplified ILI activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily rose from 1.7% in Week10, 2022, to 2.0% in Week14, 2022, reflecting a consistent increase in healthcare utilization due to respiratory illnesses, which aligns with the future rise in ILI occurrences. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and Influenza A(H3N2), were reported each week and likely contributed to the observed increase in respiratory illness cases. Hospital admission rates climbed from 5.9 per 100,000 in Week10, 2022, to 8.9 per 100,000 in Week14, 2022, underscoring growing severity and healthcare burden, reinforcing future increases in ILI counts.
4. The fluid dynamics of Influenza A(H3N2), the dominant strain, characterized by genetic evolution and antigenic differences from vaccines, likely diminished vaccine efficacy, as noted by increased cases among vaccinated individuals. This, along with national increases in influenza activity, supported the rising trend in ILI counts.
5. In summary, the reported 3134 future ILI occurrences (Week19, 2022) are a result of the overall upward trend in the past occurrences from Week10 to Week14, 2022, increased ILI-related outpatient visits, hospitalizations, respiratory virus co-circulations, and the antigenic mismatch in A(H3N2) strains, all contributing to the predicted surge in ILI cases.
