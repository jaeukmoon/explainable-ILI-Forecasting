1. The past ILI occurrences from Week47, 2021 to Week51, 2021 show a consistently increasing trend: 1170 (Week47), 1408 (Week48), 1325 (Week49), 1437 (Week50), and 1746 (Week51). The fluctuations observed in earlier weeks are overshadowed by a sharp rise in Week51, indicating an upward trajectory moving into subsequent weeks.
2. Week4, 2022 falls within the peak season, which typically spans from Week46 to approximately Week6 of the following year. The increasing ILI trends and CDC data suggesting elevated flu activity further validate that Week4, 2022 belongs to the peak season phase.
3. Time-series analysis reveals that the ILI activity is increasing, with a strong upward momentum evident in Week50 and Week51 of 2021. By projecting this growth forward, historical patterns suggest a tapering at slightly elevated levels, with the projected value for Week4, 2022 at 1567 aligning with a possible leveling off or slight reduction from the earlier Week51 peak (1746).
4. Influenza A(H3N2) is the predominant strain and comprises almost all confirmed cases (Week47, 2021 #3; Week50, 2021 #2; Week51, 2021 #3); its rapid rise among older age groups (Week48, 2021 #2; Week51, 2021 #10) has contributed significantly to expanding ILI activity. Lower vaccination uptake (Week48, 2021 #7; Week50, 2021 #7; Week51, 2021 #8) has weakened population immunity, allowing continued virus transmission. Multiple co-circulating viruses (Week47, 2021 #10; Week49, 2021 #10; Week51, 2021 #9), including SARS-CoV-2, exert compounded pressure on healthcare systems and respiratory visits, intensifying ILI activity.
5. The strong upward trends in ILI activity, predominant A(H3N2) circulation, reduced vaccination coverage, and overlapping presence of co-circulating respiratory viruses reinforce the projection that Week4, 2022 will exhibit significant but slightly moderated ILI activity as seen with the forecast value of 1567 occurrences.
