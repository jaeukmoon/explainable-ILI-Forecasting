1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an unmistakable upward trajectory, with values of ['1519', '1517', '1585', '1673', '1893'], consistently increasing toward the latter weeks. After minimal fluctuations in the first two weeks (Week8 and Week9, 2021) at 1519 and 1517 respectively, the weekly counts rose progressively to 1893 by Week12, 2021. This consistent increase reflects a steady intensification in ILI activity over the observed period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the increasing past time-series ILI values (Weeks 10–12, 2021) and the anticipated surge to 2118 after 5 weeks (Week17, 2021). The accelerated rise from 1585 in Week10 to 1893 in Week12 aligns with the projected continuation of this upward trend, contributing to the reported future occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed consistent stability at 0.9% (Week8, Week10, Week12, 2021), but the slight upward trend in pediatric ILI activity reported consistently over multiple weeks, particularly among the 0–4 age group, serves as an early indicator of heightened future occurrences.
4. Elevated percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained a persistent concern, declining from 16.4% (Week8, 2021) to 11.4% (Week12, 2021) but consistently above epidemic thresholds for all weeks. These mortality rates reflect broader respiratory illness activity that may parallel the observed ILI increases.
5. Behavioral changes in healthcare-seeking, influenced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, were consistently documented across all weeks, complicating the interpretation of ILI trends. This could contribute to delayed recognition and reporting of cases, fueling the visible future surge in ILI occurrences to 2118.
6. In summary, the reported 2118 future ILI occurrences (Week17, 2021) can be attributed to the decisive upward trend in ILI counts observed from Week10 to Week12, 2021, the early warning signals from increasing pediatric ILI activity, persistent PIC mortality above endemic thresholds, and the complicating effects of pandemic-driven changes in healthcare behavior and reporting.
