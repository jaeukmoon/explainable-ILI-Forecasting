1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating pattern with values of ['1320', '1416', '1293', '1230', '1340']. There was an initial rise from 1320 (Week 45, 2020) to 1416 (Week 46, 2020), followed by two consecutive decreases to 1293 (Week 47, 2020) and 1230 (Week 48, 2020). However, a notable recovery to 1340 occurred in Week 49, 2020, indicating volatility in ILI activity without a clearly sustained trend.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 1115 (Week 5, 2021) represent a decline compared to the values seen toward the end of the 5-week observational period, such as 1340 in Week 49, 2020. The fluctuating but downward shift evident in the latter half of the time-series data, particularly from Week 46 to Week 48, aligns with the decreased future ILI occurrences observed after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained at low levels across Weeks 45-49, 2020, consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%, including stability at 1.6% from Week 47 onward. This sustained low outpatient ILI activity likely contributed to the reduced future ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) steadily rose from 8.9% (Week 45, 2020) to 14.3% (Week 49, 2020), well above epidemic thresholds. However, the primary driver was COVID-19, with influenza activity described as unusually low. This divergence likely minimized the contribution of influenza-related PIC fatalities to future ILI increases.
5. Other influencing factors include consistently low influenza positivity rates (e.g., <0.2% throughout Weeks 45-49, 2020), ongoing public health measures such as masking and distancing dampening influenza spread, and disruptions in traditional ILI surveillance due to healthcare-seeking behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. These conditions collectively constrained influenza transmission, leading to reduced future ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1115 (Week 5, 2021) reflect the overall volatile but downward shift in past ILI activity, persistently low outpatient ILI visit percentages, minimal influenza virus detection, and the impact of COVID-19 mitigations decelerating influenza spread.
