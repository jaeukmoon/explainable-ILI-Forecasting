1. The past time-series ILI occurrences showed a fluctuating but generally increasing trend, with values of ['1893', '1956', '2003', '2066', '1968']. Starting at 1893 (Week 12, 2021), ILI activity climbed to a peak of 2066 (Week 15, 2021) before slightly declining to 1968 (Week 16, 2021). This pattern reflects an overall upward trajectory, particularly evident in the initial weeks.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the peak ILI activity in Week 15, 2021, followed by a slight decrease in Week 16, aligns with a stabilization at 1933 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 21, 2021). The overall increase toward the peak provides a basis for the observed future level.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently low but stable (0.9% in Week 12, 2021, increasing slightly to 1.1% by Week 16, 2021). This stability, combined with persistently minimal influenza activity, suggests that the future ILI figure of 1933 may reflect non-influenza respiratory illnesses or behavioral factors influencing healthcare reporting.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold across weeks, ranging from 11.4% (Week 12, 2021) to 12.4% (Week 15, 2021). This persistent elevation may indicate ongoing surveillance of respiratory illnesses contributing to future ILI occurrences.
5. Ongoing disruptions due to COVID-19, such as altered healthcare-seeking behaviors and overlapping surveillance challenges, were highlighted in CDC reports across all weeks. These external factors likely impacted reporting consistency and contributed to the maintenance of ILI reporting levels at 1933 occurrences, despite minimal influenza activity.
6. CDC reports show minimal influenza virus positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% consistently in all weeks) and low cumulative hospitalization rates (e.g., 0.7–0.8 per 100,000, well below historical baselines). These indicators suggest that the observed ILI figures are more reflective of non-specific respiratory illnesses rather than influenza-specific activity.
7. In summary, the reported 1933 future ILI occurrences (Week 21, 2021) can be attributed to the observed upward trend in ILI activity through Week 15, stable outpatient ILI visit rates, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the influence of pandemic-driven reporting and healthcare behaviors. This overall context explains the stabilization of ILI activity at 1933 cases after 5 weeks.
