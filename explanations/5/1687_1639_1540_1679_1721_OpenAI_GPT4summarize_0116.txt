1. The ILI occurrences from Week36, 2021 to Week40, 2021 are as follows: 1687, 1639, 1540, 1679, and 1721. The data shows a fluctuating pattern with an initial decline from Week36 to Week38 (1687 → 1639 → 1540), followed by an increase from Week38 to Week40 (1540 → 1679 → 1721). This fluctuation suggests moderate variability in ILI activity, without sustained increases or decreases. The sharp rise in Week39 and Week40 highlights an emergent upward trend, likely influenced by seasonal factors, as the period approaches the peak period of ILI activity in upcoming weeks.
2. Season Classification for Week45, 2021: Based on background knowledge, Week45 falls within the "Peak onset season," the period where ILI activity typically begins rising as it approaches the peak season. This classification aligns with the observed increases in ILI occurrences in recent weeks and historical trends that show an uptick in ILI activity leading up to the official flu season starting in Week46.
3. Using statistical analysis, past ILI occurrences predict future values based on the pattern observed. The average weekly change rate over the past 5 weeks can be calculated:
4. - Week37: (1639-1687)/1687 = -0.0284 (-2.84% decrease).
5. - Week38: (1540-1639)/1639 = -0.0603 (-6.03% decrease).
6. - Week39: (1679-1540)/1540 = +0.0903 (+9.03% increase).
7. - Week40: (1721-1679)/1679 = +0.0250 (+2.50% increase).
8. The average growth rate: (-2.84% - 6.03% + 9.03% + 2.50%) / 4 = +0.01665 (~1.67% growth per week).
9. Applying this growth rate for 5 cumulative weeks starting from Week40, 2021 (1721 × (1 + 0.01665)^5):
10. - 1721 × (1.08544) ≈ 1867.92. Since Week45 falls in "Peak onset season," we expect an amplified rate due to seasonal effects. Accounting for an additional ~13% peak onset amplification, the forecast becomes 1867.92 × 1.13 ≈ 2109 cases.
4. Key factors from the CDC reports influencing this prediction are:
5. 1) **Low baseline influenza activity transitioning to higher seasonal activity:** Week36-Week40 reports repeatedly emphasize minimal influenza circulation with most respiratory illnesses attributed to non-influenza viruses (e.g., 0.1% positivity in clinical labs). However, low current levels suggest potential for sharp increases as ILI progresses into seasonal peaks, aligning with observed late-week upward trends in late Peak onset season.
6. 2) **Limited vaccination impact in historical surveillance:** No significant vaccination uptake data was provided over the weeks. The CDC emphasizes end-of-October as the target for vaccination campaigns. Low early vaccination coverage may allow ILI to rise unhindered in coming weeks, amplifying the transition toward anticipated peak.
7. 3) **Co-circulation of respiratory pathogens and broader PIC trends:** Reports highlight continued influence of other respiratory illnesses and elevated PIC mortality driven by COVID-19 (e.g., 18.0%-21.1% of deaths, Week36-Week40). The overlap of SARS-CoV-2 and ILI activity may delay the full suppression of ILI trends, supporting moderate increases in future weeks.
5. In summary, the prediction of 2109 ILI occurrences for Week45, 2021 reflects the observed rising trend in recent data, the seasonal amplification expected in Peak onset season, and contributing CDC report factors (low baseline flu activity, delayed vaccination effects, and overlapping respiratory pathogens). The statistical growth rate (+1.67% weekly) combined with the seasonal amplification (~13%) aligns with historical trends, justifying the forecasted value.
