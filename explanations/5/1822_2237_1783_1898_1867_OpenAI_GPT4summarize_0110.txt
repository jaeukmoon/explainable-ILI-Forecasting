1. The reported ILI counts from Week49 to Week53, 2020 are 1822, 2237, 1783, 1898, and 1867. The trend shows an initial sharp rise from Week49 (1822) to Week50 (2237), followed by a significant drop in Week51 (1783) and then a stabilization pattern hovering around 1867-1898 in Week52 and Week53. Overall, the pattern appears fluctuating but with signs of stabilization toward the end of this period.
2. Forecasting target Week5, 2021 aligns with the peak season in the U.S., which typically spans from Week46 of the previous year to around Week6 of the current year. Despite low activity levels this season, the time period and conditions still classify Week5, 2021 as likely falling within the peak season.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the fluctuating pattern peaking briefly in Week50 and stabilizing by Week52 and Week53 suggests that ILI occurrences are likely to remain steady in the short term. Projecting this behavior forward by five weeks, ILI occurrences are expected to hover around recent stable counts, justifying the prediction of 1892 for Week5, 2021.
4. Influenza positivity remains historically low during the reported weeks (Week49, 2020 #1; Week50, 2020 #1; Week51, 2020 #1; Week52, 2020 #1; Week53, 2020 #1), with testing data revealing minimal influenza circulation and no significant surges in cases.
5. Although vaccinations are encouraged (Week49, 2020 #8; Week50, 2020 #9; Week51, 2020 #7; Week52, 2020 #8; Week53, 2020 #10), trends on vaccine distribution and uptake remain unclear. However, the limited influenza strain circulation and mild ILI activity suggest that vaccinations are mitigating a potential surge.
6. Overlapping COVID-19 activity and altered healthcare-seeking behavior (Week49, 2020 #9; Week50, 2020 #10; Week51, 2020 #8; Week52, 2020 #9; Week53, 2020 #9) significantly impact traditional ILI surveillance reliability and contribute to the low influenza activity being reported.
7. Combining the stabilization trend in recent weeks (Week52 and Week53, 2020 ILI occurrences), the classification of the target week within the peak season, and external factors such as low test positivity rates, vaccination efforts, and co-circulation with COVID-19, the projection of 1892 ILI occurrences for Week5, 2021 is consistent with anticipated activity during a subdued yet peak influenza season.
