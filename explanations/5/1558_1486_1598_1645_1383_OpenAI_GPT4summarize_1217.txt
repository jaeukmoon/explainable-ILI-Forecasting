1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 observed weeks showed fluctuations with initial stability and a decline toward the later weeks. The values observed were ['1558', '1486', '1598', '1645', '1383'], with a slight rise from 1558 (Week 17, 2021) to 1598 (Week 19, 2021) before peaking at 1645 (Week 20, 2021) and then declining sharply to 1383 (Week 21, 2021). This downward shift in Week 21 suggests a reduction in ILI activity.
2. A weak correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the decline in the final week of past data (Week 21, 2021) aligns with the lower future occurrence of 1376 after 5 weeks (Week 26, 2021). The declining trajectory in Week 21 serves as a precursor to the reduced activity observed in the future occurrence.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently below baseline levels, ranging from 1.1% in Weeks 17 and 21 to 1.3% in Week 20, 2021. This persistent minimal activity aligns with the suppressed future ILI occurrences of 1376.
4. The percentage of deaths from pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds but trended downward, from 11.7% (Week 17, 2021) to 8.3% (Week 21, 2021). This decline in PIC mortality reflects reduced respiratory illness severity and corresponds to the diminished future occurrences.
5. Continued healthcare-seeking changes driven by the COVID-19 pandemic affected ILI reporting accuracy during the observed weeks. These disruptions may have contributed to lower surveillance-based ILI counts in the future, reflecting suppressed activity captured as 1376 occurrences after 5 weeks.
6. Influenza virus activity remained exceptionally low throughout, with positivity rates stagnant at 0.1% across all 5 weeks and hospitalization rates at 0.8 per 100,000. The lack of significant flu circulation substantiates the reduced future ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 1376 future ILI occurrences (Week 26, 2021) can be attributed to the decline in ILI occurrences by Week 21, 2021, persistently minimal ILI outpatient visits below the baseline, reduced severity indicated by falling PIC mortality rates, the continued disruptive impacts of COVID-19 on ILI surveillance and reporting, and historically low influenza activity during this period.
