1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a steady upward trend initially, progressing from 1558 (Week 44, 2020) to 2139 (Week 46, 2020). This was followed by a slight decline, leveling at 2066 (Week 47, 2020) and 2064 (Week 48, 2020). The overall fluctuations suggest persistent high ILI activity, stabilizing towards the end of the observed period.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 2169 aligns closely with the high levels reported in Weeks 46–48, 2020, indicating a strong positive correlation. The minimal drop in ILI occurrences in these weeks acts as a precursor to the slight increase to 2169 over the subsequent five weeks, consistent with the stabilization trend observed.
3. Throughout the CDC reports, outpatient visits for ILI steadily increased from 1.3% (Week 44, 2020), reaching 1.6% by Week 48, 2020, reflecting gradual growth in ILI-related healthcare encounters, which correspond to the higher value of 2169. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) rose from 8.1% (Week 44, 2020) to 12.8% (Week 48, 2020), consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds and indicating underlying respiratory illness activity potentially driving higher ILI occurrences. Additionally, persistent unusually low influenza virus circulation (e.g., 0.1% positivity in Week 44 and 0.1% in Week 48) mirrors a suppressed flu activity environment yet underscores the role of other respiratory illnesses or behavioral factors influencing ILI.
4. The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on healthcare-seeking behavior, as mentioned in each week’s summary, has repeatedly disrupted accurate ILI surveillance and reporting, potentially concentrating unrecognized ILI activity in later weeks. These disruptions align with the observed rise to 2169.
5. In summary, the future occurrence of 2169 ILI cases reflects the stabilization of high ILI levels in Weeks 46–48, 2020, alongside increasing outpatient ILI visits, persistently elevated PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, suppressed influenza activity, and pandemic-driven surveillance disruptions, which collectively contributed to maintaining high ILI activity into future weeks.
