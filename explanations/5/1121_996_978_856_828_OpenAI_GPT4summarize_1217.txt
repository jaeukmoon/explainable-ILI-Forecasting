1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1121', '996', '978', '856', '828']. Week 23, 2023 had the highest value of 1121, which steadily declined every week, reaching the lowest value of 828 in Week 27, 2023. This clear decline highlights a sustained reduction in ILI activity over this period.
2. The decline in the past weeks does not exhibit a direct positive correlation with the future ILI occurrences of 739, as the decreasing trend in Weeks 23–27, 2023 indicates low ILI activity, aligning with the reported low value of 739 after 5 weeks (Week 32, 2023). This suggests a continuation of the overall low ILI activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently declined during the 5-week period, from 1.6% in Week 23, 2023, to 1.3% in Week 27, 2023. This steady reduction in healthcare encounters for ILI indicates waning activity, contributing to the relatively low future value of 739.
4. Hospitalizations for influenza followed a declining trajectory, reported as 850 in Week 23, 779 in Week 24, 768 in Week 25, 807 in Week 26, and 641 in Week 27, 2023. This drop strongly correlates with the reduced future ILI occurrences, reaffirming the low intensity of influenza and ILI trends.
5. The percentage of positive respiratory specimens for influenza remained low throughout the observed weeks, ranging from 1.0% in Week 23, 2023, to 0.8% in Week 27, 2023. The limited presence of influenza further explains the overall reduced ILI activity, sustaining the low future ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 739 (Week 32, 2023) are supported by the consistent downward trend in time-series data, declining outpatient visits and hospitalizations, and persistently low influenza positivity rates, all indicating minimal influence from influenza or heightened respiratory illnesses.
