1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend with values of ['2066', '2064', '2078', '2222', '1994']. There was a stable trend in the first three weeks (Week47–Week49, 2020), followed by a significant peak in Week50, 2020 (2222), and a subsequent decrease to 1994 in Week51, 2020. This pattern suggests alternations in ILI activity with a notable spike in Week50, 2020, before declining.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is reflected, as the spike peaking at 2222 (Week50, 2020) and the slight decline to 1994 (Week51, 2020) anticipate a potential rebound to 2118 after 5 weeks (Week56, 2021). The fluctuating nature of the trend may indicate episodic surges that align with the eventual future increase.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained at 1.6% across all 5 weeks (Week47–Week51, 2020), below the national baseline of 2.6%. While stability is observed, the persistence of ILI visits combined with predicted seasonal upticks and low overall flu activity may contribute to increasing future ILI occurrences.
4. Percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) steadily increased week-by-week, climbing from 11.3% (Week47, 2020) to 13.6% (Week51, 2020), significantly above the epidemic threshold. This persistent and rising PIC mortality, driven largely by COVID-19, illustrates a consistent respiratory illness burden, which aligns with an eventual uptick in ILI reports.
5. The continued influence of COVID-19 pandemic factors, including changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors, overlaps in respiratory symptoms, and disruptions in traditional surveillance data validity, are well-documented in all summarized reports. These disruptions may amplify non-influenza ILI reports, contributing to the eventual rise to 2118 ILI occurrences in Week56, 2021.
6. Summary: The reported 2118 future ILI occurrences (Week56, 2021) are attributed to the mid-period ILI peak in Week50, 2020, the persistent ILI outpatient visit rate at 1.6% across all weeks, rising PIC mortality percentages exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the ongoing impact of COVID-19-related disruptions on healthcare-seeking and surveillance accuracy. These factors collectively highlight a transition from fluctuating past data to a modest increase in future ILI activity.
