1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but overall upward trend, with values of ['1075', '1092', '1142', '1089', '1216']. There was an initial increase from 1075 (Week 28, 2023) to 1142 (Week 30, 2023), followed by a slight dip to 1089 (Week 31, 2023). However, a notable rise to 1216 in Week 32, 2023, marks the highest occurrence in the 5-week period, suggesting a gradual escalation in ILI activity by the end of the observed timeframe.
2. A positive correlation between the past ILI occurrences and the future data is evident, as the upward trend seen in the latter weeks (e.g., Week 32, 2023) aligns with the increase to 1629 occurrences after 5 weeks. The steady rise in activity by Week 32, 2023, acts as an indicator of growing respiratory illness occurrences that culminate in higher ILI numbers 5 weeks later.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI displayed a subtle but noticeable increase over the 5-week period, from 1.2% (Week 28, 2023) to 1.3% (Week 32, 2023), with children aged 0-4 years consistently showing the highest percentages (ranging from 4.0% to 4.4%). This incremental rise in ILI-related outpatient visits reflects intensifying respiratory illness trends, contributing to the reported surge in future ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold throughout the 5-week period, ranging from 5.8% (Week 28, 2023) to 6.1% (Week 32, 2023). Such elevated PIC mortality serves as an indirect indicator of increasing respiratory illness activity driving the future surge in ILI occurrences.
5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including Influenza A (H1N1), Influenza B (Victoria lineage), RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, was noted across all 5 weeks. The presence of these active respiratory pathogens amplifies ILI trends, aligning with the 1629 reported future occurrences.
6. In summary, the sharp rise to 1629 future ILI occurrences can be attributed to the upward trend in ILI numbers during Weeks 28–32, 2023, increasing outpatient visits for ILI, persistently high PIC mortality rates exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the compounded effects of co-circulating respiratory pathogens.
