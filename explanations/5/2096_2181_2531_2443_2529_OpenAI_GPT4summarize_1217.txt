1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a generally fluctuating but elevated pattern, with values of ['2096', '2181', '2531', '2443', '2529']. The series began at 2096 (Week14, 2022), increasing steadily to reach a peak of 2531 (Week16, 2022) before experiencing a slight dip to 2443 (Week17, 2022) and then recovering to 2529 by Week18, 2022. This sustained elevated activity throughout the five weeks implies persistent and widespread respiratory illness activity.
2. A clear positive relationship exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as elevated activity levels near the end of the 5-week period (Week16–Week18, 2022) correspond directly to the observed decrease to 1454 occurrences 5 weeks later. The decline in future ILI numbers aligns with the slight plateau observed in lab positivity rates and clinical reporting in Week17 and Week18, 2022.
3. The persistent dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) (e.g., 99.2%-99.9% of tested samples across Weeks14–18, 2022) alongside increasing outpatient positivity rates (from 7.8% in Week16 to 8.6% in Week18, 2022) indicates ongoing but slowly stabilizing flu activity, contributing to the moderated future ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained stable yet above the epidemic threshold (7.1%-7.2%, Weeks14–18, 2022), particularly driven by non-influenza-related factors such as COVID-19. This suggests that reported future ILI cases may have reduced as COVID-19 deaths remained a primary factor in respiratory illness severity during the period monitored.
5. The co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, rising hospitalization rates (e.g., from 8.9/100,000 in Week14 to 13.4/100,000 in Week18, 2022), and regional variabilities create localized fluctuations, which likely contributed to the eventual easing to 1454 occurrences several weeks later. Late-season trends, including the declining effectiveness of influenza vaccines for A(H3N2), further influenced the observed outcomes.
6. In summary, the future decline to 1454 occurrences after 5 weeks is attributable to the sustained but plateauing trend in ILI occurrences in Weeks17–18, 2022, the dominance of A(H3N2) flu activity with co-circulating viruses, elevated PIC deaths influenced primarily by COVID-19, and region-specific fluctuations in respiratory illness dynamics.
