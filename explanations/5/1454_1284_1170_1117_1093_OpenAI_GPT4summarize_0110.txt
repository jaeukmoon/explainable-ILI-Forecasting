1. The ILI occurrences for Week1–Week5, 2021 decreased steadily: 1454, 1284, 1170, 1117, and 1093. This consistent downward trend suggests declining activity with no significant spikes or fluctuations.
2. Week10, 2021 falls into the off-season. This is after the end of the peak season (Week46, 2020–Week6, 2021) and before the next peak onset season, typically starting around Week32. The reported ILI patterns and low surveillance data for Week1–Week5, 2021 confirm minimal ILI activity characteristic of off-season dynamics.
3. The continued decline in ILI occurrences from Week1–Week5, 2021 projects a similar trend into Week10, 2021. Based on time-series forecasting, this stabilization aligns with lower occurrence levels during the off-season, prompting the projected value of 949.
4. Influenza activity remained historically low throughout Week1–Week5, 2021, with less than 0.4% of specimens testing positive for influenza across clinical labs in all weeks (#1, Week1; #1, Week2; #1, Week3; #1, Week4; #1, Week5), supporting suppressed transmission.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior demonstrates reduced outpatient respiratory ILI visits, consistently below the baseline (2.6%) and declining from 1.7% (Week1) to 1.1% (Week4 and Week5) (#4, Week1; #4, Week2; #4, Week3; #3, Week4; #4, Week5). This reflects the dampening impact of minimal influenza activity influenced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
6. CDC attributes unpredictability to intertwined influenza and COVID-19 trends, low vaccination trend updates, and evolving healthcare behaviors (#9, Week1; #9, Week3; #9, Week5). The suppressed influenza transmission aligns with reduced ILI occurrences.
7. Given the steady decline in ILI trends, off-season classification for Week10, 2021, low nationwide influenza detection, reduced outpatient visits, and significant influence of COVID-19 on behavior and surveillance, the predicted ILI occurrence for Week10, 2021, at 949, aligns with the observed patterns.
