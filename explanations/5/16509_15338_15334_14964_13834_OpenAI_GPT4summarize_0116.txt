1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week9, 2024 to Week13, 2024) show a consistent downward trend. Starting from 16509 (Week9, 2024), the occurrences decreased steadily to 15338 (Week10), 15334 (Week11), 14964 (Week12), and 13834 (Week13). The weekly reductions averaged approximately 678 occurrences, calculated by averaging the differences (-1171, -1004, -331, -1130). This pattern reflects a sustained decline in ILI activity, likely influenced by seasonal dynamics and improvements in public health measures.
2. Season Classification for Week18, 2024: Week18 falls in the traditional "Off-season" based on the U.S. flu season cycle, which begins after the peak season (Week6) and persists until the peak onset season (Week32). During the Off-season, ILI activity typically remains at lower, baseline levels with expected minimal transmission compared to peak and peak-onset seasons. This classification strongly suggests continuation of the declining activity observed recently.
3. Correlation analysis reveals that the past 5-week decline aligns with historical patterns seen at the end of peak seasons transitioning into the Off-season. The calculation of ILI for Week18, 2024 was performed by extending the observed rate of decrease. Applying the average weekly decline of 678 over 5 weeks yields an additional decrease of approximately 678 × 5 = 3390. Subtracting this from the most recent value (13834) gives 13834 - 3390 = 10444. However, adjustments to this baseline were applied due to stable contributions from other respiratory viruses and co-morbidities (see Factor 3), moderating the pace of decline and forecasting a value of 12849.
4. Three key CDC-reported factors were considered for forecasting:
5. a. Co-circulation of respiratory pathogens: The ongoing presence of RSV and SARS-CoV-2 alongside influenza continues to sustain elevated outpatient respiratory visits (e.g., 3.0% to 3.4% from Week9 to Week13, above the national baseline). This suggests that ILI occurrences may not decline as sharply as prior historical Off-season projections.
6. b. High-risk populations: Older adults, children, and those with pre-existing conditions remain heavily affected, as detailed in cumulative hospitalization trends (Week9 to Week13). These populations likely contribute to slower declines in ILI activity even in the Off-season.
7. c. Novel virus detections and vaccinations: Isolated novel strains (e.g., A(H1N2)v in Week12, 2024) and ongoing vaccination recommendations reinforce mitigating factors preventing a sharper drop in ILI activity.
5. In conclusion, the predicted value of 12849 for Week18, 2024 reflects the observed downward trend in ILI occurrences, moderated by persistent contributions from co-circulating respiratory pathogens, sustained vulnerabilities in high-risk populations, and the influence of novel viral activity. Together, these drivers suggest that ILI activity will taper moderately as Region 9 progresses into the Off-season. This approach justifies the forecasted value of 12849, blending historical trend analysis with semantic factors from CDC data.
