1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistently declining trend. Specifically, values decreased significantly from 1730 (Week3, 2021) to 1399 (Week4, 2021), followed by a slight recovery to 1892 (Week5, 2021), and subsequently dropped steeply to 825 (Week6, 2021) and then to 618 (Week7, 2021), marking a substantial overall decrease in reported cases within that timeframe.
2. The future ILI occurrences reaching 1010 after 5 weeks show a moderate rebound from the last observed value of 618 (Week7, 2021). While no sustained upward trajectory is observed in the earlier weeks, the sharp drop in the last week potentially creates room for an eventual adjustment or rise in future weeks, aligning with the reported increase in ILI occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI recorded consistent low values, measured at 1.3% (Week3, 2021) and gradually decreasing to 1.0% by Week7, 2021, all below the national baseline of 2.6%. However, slight increases in ILI activity among children aged 0–4 across six weeks may indicate specific population-driven impacts on the future reported rebound to 1010 ILI cases after 5 weeks.
4. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) mortality remained well above the epidemic threshold across all weeks, peaking at 28.4% (Week4, 2021) and declining to 19.3% (Week7, 2021). Although primarily COVID-19-driven, persistent elevated PIC mortality could signify broader respiratory illness activity, contributing to a rise in future ILI numbers reported after 5 weeks.
5. Ongoing disruptions to surveillance and healthcare-seeking behaviors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have limited the accuracy of earlier ILI data. Additionally, CDC warnings of potential future increases in flu activity (e.g., Week3, 2021) amidst uncertainty in trends suggest that the future adjusted figure of 1010 could stem in part from evolving case detection or delayed reporting.
6. In summary, the reported 1010 future ILI occurrences (relative to Week12, 2021) can be attributed to an observed population-specific rise in ILI activity among children, consistently elevated PIC mortality, potential underreporting due to COVID-19-related disruptions, and warnings from CDC on possible future increases in flu activity, despite the past time-series data reflecting an overall declining trend.
