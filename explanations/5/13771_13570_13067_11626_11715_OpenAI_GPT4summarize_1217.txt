1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall downward trend, with values of ['13771', '13570', '13067', '11626', '11715']. The decline started from 13771 (Week 28, 2022) to 11626 (Week 31, 2022), with a slight rise to 11715 in Week 32, 2022. The general reduction in values reflects decreased ILI activity during this period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. Despite the initial downward trend in the past data, the slight rise in Week 32, 2022, indicates stabilization, aligning with a sharp increase to 15046 future occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 37, 2022). This rebound likely reflects a lag pattern and resurgence in ILI activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a small but consistent nationwide decline over the 5 weeks, dropping from 1.6% (Week 28, 2022) to 1.4% (Week 32, 2022). Nevertheless, variations by age group, especially high activity among children aged 0-4 years (e.g., 6.5% in Week 28, 2022, and 5.9% in Week 32, 2022), suggest an underlying reservoir of ILI activity that could drive future surges.
4. PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19)-associated deaths consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, rising from 9.5% in Week 28, 2022, to 10.0% in Week 31, 2022, before slightly decreasing to 9.9% in Week 32, 2022. While most PIC deaths were driven by COVID-19, the persistently high PIC mortality signals increased respiratory disease burden, correlating with the eventual rise in ILI occurrences.
5. The co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and RSV, alongside influenza, remained a key confounding factor during the observed weeks. This overlapping pathogen activity disrupted interpretation of ILI trends and likely intensified respiratory illness activity, contributing to the increase in future ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 15046 future ILI occurrences (Week 37, 2022) can be attributed to the slight stabilization in Week 32, 2022, age-specific variations in ILI outpatient visits, persistently elevated PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and the amplifying effects of co-circulating respiratory pathogens on ILI reporting.
