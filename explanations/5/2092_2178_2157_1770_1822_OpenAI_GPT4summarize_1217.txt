1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed fluctuations, with values of ['2092', '2178', '2157', '1770', '1822']. The highest value, 2178, was observed in Week 46, 2020, before a notable decline to 1770 in Week 48, 2020, followed by a partial rebound to 1822 in Week 49, 2020. This demonstrates a declining trend in ILI occurrences from Week 46 through Week 49, 2020.
2. The declining trend in ILI occurrences in the last three observed weeks (Weeks 47–49, 2020) correlates with the subdued future ILI occurrence value of 1941 (Week 54, 2020). While there is a partial reversal in Week 49, 2020, the data suggests overall stabilization at lower levels toward the end of the 5-week period, aligning with the moderate future occurrence reported after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed minimal variation, constituting 1.5% (Week 45, 2020), 1.5% (Week 46, 2020), and stabilizing at 1.6% for Weeks 47, 48, and 49, 2020. This low and consistent ILI visit rate reflects subdued influenza or respiratory illness activity during the observed period, corresponding to restrained future occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) showed consistent elevation, increasing from 8.9% (Week 45, 2020) to 14.3% (Week 49, 2020), far exceeding epidemic thresholds. However, most PIC deaths were attributed to COVID-19 rather than influenza, indicating limited specific influenza activity impacting future ILI occurrences.
5. The unusually low influenza activity (e.g., 0.2% or less of respiratory specimens testing positive in Weeks 45–49, 2020) alongside the mitigating effects of COVID-19 measures (e.g., masking, social distancing, healthcare changes) contributed to depressed future ILI levels. Though minor increases in flu activity were anticipated, the reported value of 1941 can largely be ascribed to non-influenza respiratory illnesses and residual variance.
6. In summary, the reported 1941 future ILI occurrences (Week 54, 2020) result from the declining trend observed in Weeks 47–49, 2020, low and stable outpatient ILI visit rates, consistently elevated PIC deaths dominated by COVID-19, and persistent influenza suppression due to pandemic-related protective measures.
