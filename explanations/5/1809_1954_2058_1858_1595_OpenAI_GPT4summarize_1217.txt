1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating overall declining trend, with values of ['1809', '1954', '2058', '1858', '1595']. After peaking in Week20, 2022 (2058), there was a substantial decrease to 1595 in Week23, 2022, indicating diminishing ILI activity toward the latter part of the observed period. This declining trend likely set the stage for the notable reduction in ILI occurrences observed 5 weeks later.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The sharp decline, particularly from Week21 (1858) to Week23 (1595) in 2022, aligns with the reduction to 898 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks. The decreasing trend in the past weeks serves as a precursor to suppressed respiratory illness activity in subsequent weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness showcased a consistent downward trend, moving from 2.4% in Week19, 2022, to 2.1% in Week23, 2022. This reduction in healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory symptoms aligns with the observed decline in ILI counts, reflecting reduced public health burden leading into the future period.
4. Influenza virus positivity rates steadily decreased, starting at 7.0% in Week19, 2022, and falling to 3.4% by Week23, 2022. This reduction in influenza activity, including Influenza A(H3N2), the dominant strain, contributed heavily to the reduced overall ILI burden, aligning with 898 occurrences in the future.
5. Seasonal decline in influenza activity was emphasized in summarized CDC reports for Weeks22 and 23, 2022, with decreasing positivity rates, hospitalization rates, and respiratory illness-related healthcare visits. These factors, coupled with diminished late-season impact from co-circulating respiratory pathogens, provided a clear rationale for the significantly reduced ILI occurrences observed after 5 weeks.
