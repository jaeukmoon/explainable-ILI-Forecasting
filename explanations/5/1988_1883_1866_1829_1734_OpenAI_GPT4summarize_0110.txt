1. The reported ILI counts from Week10 to Week14, 2023 are 2358, 2309, 2296, 2001, and 1960. The data show a clear downward trend in ILI occurrences over the five weeks, with a sharp decline from Week12 (2296) to Week13 (2001) continuing through Week14 (1960). This steady decrease suggests reduced transmission or stabilization of influenza-like illnesses.
2. According to the historical season classifications, Week24, 2023 falls well within the off-season period in the U.S., which spans from the end of the peak season (around Week6) to the next peak onset season (around Week32). Historical and current influenza activity indicators support this off-season designation.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent decline in reported ILI cases from Week10 through Week14, 2023 indicates a broader trend toward stabilization or reduction of ILI activity. Projecting this pattern forward five weeks (to Week24, 2023), the model anticipates a continuation of the decreasing trend, further settling at lower ILI occurrences, consistent with off-season patterns. Therefore, the forecast of 1734 occurrences reflects these dynamics.
4. Influenza positivity in clinical and public health labs remained low across the five weeks, ranging from 0.8% to 1.0% (Week10, 2023 #1; Week11, 2023 #1; Week12, 2023 #1; Week13, 2023 #1; Week14, 2023 #1), suggesting minimal influenza activity.
5. The seasonal vaccine matches well with circulating viruses, and antiviral susceptibility remains high, consistently at 98%-100% effectiveness (Week10, 2023 #15; Week11, 2023 #7; Week12, 2023 #8; Week13, 2023 #8; Week14, 2023 #10). This vaccination coverage and susceptibility decrease the likelihood of significant influenza outbreaks.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, continue to contribute to ILI but remain at stable or low levels (Week10, 2023 #14; Week11, 2023 #9; Week12, 2023 #10; Week13, 2023 #10; Week14, 2023 #9), mitigating the potential for sudden spikes.
7. The continued low influenza positivity, robust vaccine effectiveness, and stabilizing trends in overall respiratory illness align with the off-season classification. These factors, along with the downward trend in reported ILI counts, justify the forecasted value of 1734 occurrences for Week24, 2023.
