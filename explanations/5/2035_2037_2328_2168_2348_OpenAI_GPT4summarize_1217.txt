1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but overall upward trend, with values of ['2035', '2037', '2328', '2168', '2348']. There was a modest rise from 2035 (Week 38, 2023) to 2328 (Week 40, 2023), followed by a slight decline to 2168 in Week 41, 2023, and then an increase to 2348 in Week 42, 2023, the highest value in the observed period. This pattern indicates growing ILI activity toward the latter part of the 5-week period, likely contributing to the future reported surge.
2. A positive correlation between the past time-series ILI occurrences and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the gradually increasing trend in Weeks 40 and 42, 2023, aligns with the reported rise to 3631 future cases by Week 47, 2023. The consistently elevated values in recent weeks act as a precursor to the pronounced increase in ILI activity observed after 5 weeks.
3. ILI outpatient visits displayed continuous increases, moving from 2.0% (Week 38, 2023) to 2.5% (Week 42, 2023), with the highest rates consistently observed among children aged 0–4 years. This steady rise in healthcare-seeking behavior for ILI indicates escalating respiratory illness activity and likely underpins the future spike in occurrences. Hospitalizations due to influenza rose each week, from 880 (Week 38, 2023) to 1,228 (Week 41, 2023), signifying an uptick in severe cases contributing to heightened ILI dynamics. Regional variations in ILI activity, with moderate to high activity reported in specific jurisdictions, reflect uneven increases in influenza and respiratory illness burden, further correlating with the future rise to 3631 cases.
4. The concurrent circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory viruses across all weeks creates a compounding effect on respiratory illness reporting and activity. This co-circulation likely amplified ILI data independently of influenza-specific metrics, leading to higher future occurrences. Nationwide deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, climbing from 7.2% (Week 38, 2023) to 7.3% (Week 39, 2023) and stabilizing at higher-than-baseline levels. This excess mortality reflects sustained respiratory disease activity contributing to future ILI growth.
5. In summary, the reported 3631 future ILI occurrences (Week 47, 2023) can be attributed to the upward trend in ILI occurrences by Week 42, 2023, increasing outpatient visits for ILI, rising hospitalization figures, regional variations in flu activity, the compounding effects of co-circulating respiratory pathogens, and persistently elevated PIC mortality rates. These combined factors collectively explain the significant rise in ILI occurrences observed after 5 weeks.
