1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent and significant upward trend, with values of ['1484', '1623', '1558', '1873', '2139']. Starting from 1484 in Week 42, 2020, there was a sustained increase through the weeks, culminating in 2139 in Week 46, 2020. This steady escalation suggests heightened ILI activity, which could serve as a strong precursor to the future value of 1994.

2. A clear positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The consistent increase in Week 45 and Week 46, 2020 (1873 and 2139, respectively), aligns with the future value of 1994 after 5 weeks. The elevated levels observed in the latter weeks of the past time-series serve as an indicator for the expected high future occurrence.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently rose from 1.2% in Week 42, 2020, to 1.5% by Week 46, 2020. This gradual increase signals growing respiratory illness activity across the population, contributing to elevated ILI counts.  
Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained significantly high, consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds. In Week 42, PIC deaths accounted for 7.6%, rising progressively to 10.7% by Week 46, 2020. This persistent elevation reflects widespread respiratory illness, potentially impacting ILI activity.  
Healthcare-seeking behavior shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic appear to have disrupted traditional surveillance frameworks, complicating data interpretation. Such disruptions may have inflated non-specific ILI occurrences in the past and future, influencing the rise to 1994 occurrences.  
Low influenza test positivity, ranging from 0.3% (Week 42, 2020) to 0.2% (Week 46, 2020), coupled with declining flu-specific activity, suggests a larger contribution of non-influenza respiratory illnesses to ILI counts. This factor aligns with the ILI increase observed.

4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1994 can be attributed to the steady upward trend in past time-series data (Weeks 42–46, 2020), rising outpatient visits for ILI, persistently elevated PIC deaths beyond epidemic thresholds, and disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Together, these factors indicate growing respiratory illness activity and further amplify non-specific ILI trends, leading to the observed future value.
