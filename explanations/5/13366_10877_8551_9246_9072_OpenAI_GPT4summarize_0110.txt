1. The past ILI occurrences from Week1 to Week5, 2024 show a consistent decline from Week1 (13366) to Week3 (8551), followed by a slight rebound in Week4 (9246) and a minor dip in Week5 (9072). This trend reflects a general decrease after the high peak at the start of the year, with modest fluctuation in the final two weeks. Overall, there is no indication of sustained escalation or sharp drops in activity.
2. Forecasting the target week, Week10, 2024, aligns with the off-season classification. Typically, the peak season occurs from Week46 to Week6 of the following year, and Week10 falls after this peak window. Furthermore, CDC observations consistently note stabilized or declining trends (Week2, 2024 #11; Week3, 2024 #8; Week4, 2024 #3). These factors reflect transitioning into the off-season, marked by reduced ILI activity.
3. Time-series analysis of preceding weeks supports an estimate of 9994 ILI occurrences in Week10, 2024. The declining trend from Week1 to Week3, followed by modest fluctuations in Week4 and Week5, suggests that post-peak declines have leveled off without significant resurgence. Projecting forward, Week10 is expected to maintain similar activity levels, consistent with seasonal off-peak patterns.
4. The summarized CDC reports highlight three significant factors influencing the projection: (1) Influenza positivity rates remain elevated yet stable, with Week5 reporting 15.8% of clinical specimens testing positive, down slightly from Week4 (16.2%) (Week4, 2024 #1; Week5, 2024 #1). (2) Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and RSV adds complexity but does not indicate significant influenza surges (Week1, 2024 #9; Week4, 2024 #8; Week5, 2024 #10). (3) Vaccination efforts continue nationally, and the seasonal vaccine remains a strong match for circulating strains, suggesting continued control over severe outcomes (Week2, 2024 #7; Week3, 2024 #9; Week4, 2024 #7).
5. Vaccination rates and the antiviral effectiveness reported throughout the period ensure the mitigation of influenza-related complications. With fewer cases resistant to medication, intervention measures remain effective in controlling the ILI spread (Week2, 2024 #9; Week3, 2024 #10; Week5, 2024 #7).
6. Influenza-related positivity has retained moderate levels nationally, accompanied by decreasing hospitalizations and mortalities since Week1, 2024 (Week3, 2024 #6; Week4, 2024 #3; Week5, 2024 #4). This stabilization supports the expectation of sustained moderate ILI levels into Week10.
7. In conclusion, the forecast of 9994 ILI occurrences in Week10, 2024 is supported by the declining trends observed in Weeks1-5, the transition into the off-season, and the notable influence of stable to slightly decreasing influenza positivity, effective vaccination coverage, and diminishing hospitalizations and mortality rates.
