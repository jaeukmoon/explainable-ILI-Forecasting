1. The reported ILI counts from Week51, 2021 to Week3, 2022 are 2104, 2919, 2533, 2536, and 2084. The trend showed a peak in Week52, 2021 (2919) and then decreased steadily over the next three weeks (2533 in Week1, 2022 to 2084 in Week3, 2022). This pattern highlights initial high activity followed by a gradual decline, indicating a past-peak seasonal reduction in ILI cases.
2. In the U.S., the ILI peak season typically runs from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the next. Since Week8, 2022 occurs shortly after this period, and ILI activity has been declining (Week3, 2022 #1), it is classified as part of the off-season. Forecasting Week8, 2022 to align with the off-season is consistent with this seasonal timing and declining trends.
3. The previous trend shows a declining pattern after Week52, 2021. A time-series forecasting model would suggest that this downward trajectory likely continues into the off-season, leading to lower ILI counts. The historical decrease and ongoing off-season timing align with a projection of further reduction in ILI occurrences, reaching 832 by Week8, 2022.
4. Influenza activity (dominated by A(H3N2)) declined slightly but remained elevated, as positivity rates for Influenza decreased from 6.2% in Week51, 2021 (#2) to 1.9% in Week3, 2022 (#1), a clear sign that the season is waning.
5. Vaccination coverage is lower compared to previous seasons (Week51, 2021 #8; Week1, 2022 #8; Week3, 2022 #5), which likely reduces herd immunity but has not caused a significant resurgence due to ongoing declines in activity and effectiveness of circulating vaccines (Week3, 2022 #9).
6. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, namely SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, may contribute to respiratory illness visits (Week51, 2021 #4; Week2, 2022 #10; Week3, 2022 #9), but their gradual stabilization trends limit a sharp ILI increase.
7. Combining the declining ILI trends, off-season classification for Week8, 2022, minimal vaccination-induced disruptions, and existing virus-level observations (mainly A(H3N2) with no antiviral resistance), the projection of 832 future ILI occurrences aligns with the expected continued decline during the off-season.
