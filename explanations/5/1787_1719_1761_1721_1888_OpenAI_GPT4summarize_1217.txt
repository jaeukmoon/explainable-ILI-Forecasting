1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the observed 5 weeks demonstrated a generally stable yet slightly fluctuating pattern, with values ['1787', '1719', '1761', '1721', '1888']. There was a decrease from 1787 (Week27, 2023) to 1719 (Week28, 2023), followed by a modest increase to 1761 (Week29, 2023) and then a slight decline to 1721 (Week30, 2023). A notable rise occurred by Week31, 2023, with the occurrence of 1888, the highest value in the 5-week period. This indicates a mild upward trend toward the end of the timeline.
2. The increase in future ILI occurrences to 3436 (Week36, 2023) strongly correlates with the upward trend observed in the last week of the past time-series data. The rise from 1721 (Week30, 2023) to 1888 (Week31, 2023) suggests the early phase of a possible surge, which becomes more pronounced in future data.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI, while consistently low, showed slight increases in certain age groups (e.g., children under 5 years, where rates were 4.2% in Week27 and Week30, 2023, and 4.1% in Week31, 2023). These trends highlight specific age populations as drivers of potential increases in future ILI rates.
4. Hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed influenza also fluctuated but remained in significant numbers: from 641 (Week27, 2023) to slightly lower levels like 573 (Week29, 2023) and then 638 (Week31, 2023). Such sustained hospitalization trends parallel the rise in respiratory illnesses, projecting an overall upward disease activity, which aligns with the future surge in ILI occurrences.
5. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) hovered near or slightly exceeded epidemic thresholds, with percentages such as 5.5% (Week27, 2023) and increasing to 5.9% (Week31, 2023). This persistent elevation implies heightened respiratory illness burden, which may partially explain the spike in future ILI occurrences by Week36, 2023.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and different influenza variants) noted throughout the CDC reports contributed to the respiratory illness burden. A particular focus on Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 dominance in Weeks27–31, 2023, combined with variable regional respiratory virus activity, likely compounded and amplified the future rise in ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the observed rise to 3436 future ILI occurrences (Week36, 2023) can be attributed to the emerging upward trend in the past time-series data (notably Weeks30–31, 2023), slight increases in age-specific outpatient ILI visits, consistent hospitalization activity, elevated PIC-related deaths, and the compounded effect of co-circulating respiratory pathogens. These combined factors provide a clear basis for the reported surge in ILI activity.
