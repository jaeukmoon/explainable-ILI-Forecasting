1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the observed 5 weeks exhibited a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1866', '1829', '1734', '1617', '1448']. A steady week-over-week decline was noted from Week17, 2023 (1866 occurrences), to Week21, 2023 (1448 occurrences), suggesting a persistent reduction in ILI activity throughout this period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the continuous decline in ILI activity during the last 5 weeks does not align directly with the reported future occurrence of 748 ILI cases. However, the sharp drop in occurrences over the past weeks likely foreshadowed a further reduction reflected in the future data after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline of 2.5% across all 5 observed weeks, registering declines or stability: 2.0% in Week17, 2.0% in Week18, 1.9% in Week19, 2.0% in Week20, and 1.9% in Week21. This stable but low level of ILI-related healthcare visits reflects suppressed illness transmission, directly contributing to the decreased future ILI activity observed.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exhibited a relatively stable pattern above the epidemic threshold but with slight declines, from 7.3% in Week17 to 7.0% in Week21. This trend of stabilized PIC deaths, despite remaining above thresholds, supports a period of sustained but manageable respiratory disease activity, correlating with a diminished future ILI count.
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, particularly SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, alongside minimal influenza activity (positivity rates of 1.0-1.2% across the weeks), impacted the general trend of ILI occurrences. The suppressed flu prevalence and mild respiratory virus influence likely contributed to the continued drop, leading to the future decrease to 748 occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 748 future ILI occurrences (Week26, 2023) can be attributed to the consistent decline in ILI trends (Weeks17–21, 2023), stable outpatient visit rates below national baselines, minimal flu positivity, and the influence of stabilized PIC deaths. These factors together indicate a reduced respiratory illness burden, translating into significantly lower ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
