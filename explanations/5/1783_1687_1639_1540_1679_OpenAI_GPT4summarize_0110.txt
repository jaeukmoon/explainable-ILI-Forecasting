1. Past ILI occurrences from Week35, 2021 to Week39, 2021 are 1783, 1687, 1639, 1540, and 1679. The trend shows a consistent decline from Week35 (1783) to Week38 (1540), followed by a slight rebound in Week39 (1679). This suggests predominantly decreasing ILI activity with only minor short-term fluctuations.
2. Forecasting Week44, 2021 belongs to the peak onset season. Week44 falls prior to the typical peak season (Week46 onwards), aligning with the earlier phases of increasing activity preceding intensive ILI seasons.
3. From a time-series perspective, the decreasing trend seen in Weeks35–38, 2021, followed by stabilization in Week39, suggests that ILI occurrences may begin to rise near the middle of the peak onset season due to seasonal dynamics. By projecting this pattern forward, a moderate increase is expected, correlating with the 2107 forecast for Week44, 2021.
4. Influenza activity remains minimal nationwide during Weeks35–39, 2021, with outpatient ILI visits consistently below the national baseline and clinical labs reporting no significant increases in positivity rates during this period (Week35, 2021 #1; Week38, 2021 #2; Week39, 2021 #5).
5. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) are substantially above the epidemic threshold during Weeks36–39, 2021, but primarily due to COVID-19 (Week36, 2021 #6; Week38, 2021 #3; Week39, 2021 #4). This impact on respiratory illness trends suggests an interplay of concurrent pathogens influencing ILI data.
6. Infection with a variant Influenza A(H1N2)v virus was reported in Week37, 2021, indicating limited circulation of novel influenza strains (Week37, 2021 #2, #10). However, low human-to-human transmission minimizes the immediate impact on ILI trends through Week39, 2021.
7. Summarizing the trends: the declining ILI reports during Weeks35–38, 2021 and stabilization in Week39 occur alongside minimal influenza activity and continued PIC mortality predominantly driven by COVID-19. Combined with the seasonal onset, these factors support a projected increase towards Week44, 2021, consistent with the anticipated 2107 occurrences.
