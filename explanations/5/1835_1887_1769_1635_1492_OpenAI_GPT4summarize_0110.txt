1. The reported ILI counts for Week17 to Week21, 2024 are 1835, 1887, 1769, 1635, and 1492. This demonstrates a clear declining trend over the past five weeks, with weekly reductions in reported ILI occurrences. The most notable decrease occurred between Week18 (1887) and Week21 (1492). This pattern indicates reduced flu activity as the season progresses.
2. Week26, 2024 is consistent with the off-season period in the U.S., which spans from Week9 to Week31. Given the ongoing declines in ILI activity (outlined in the reports for Week17 to Week21, 2024), flu prevalence remains at minimal levels. Thus, Week26, 2024 is forecasted as part of the off-season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent week-over-week reduction in ILI activity suggests a firmly declining pattern as flu activity wanes during the off-season. Extrapolating this trend five weeks forward from Week21, 2024 through Week26, 2024 suggests the continuation of low ILI occurrences. Therefore, a forecast of 835 reflects the sustained decline toward minimal off-season activity.
4. Influenza positivity rates decreased steadily over Week17 to Week21, 2024, dropping from 3.9% (Week17) to 1.7% (Week21). This mirrors nationwide activity declines, with all regions reporting positivity below baseline levels and no indications of a resurgence.
5. Vaccination coverage and effectiveness remain stable. Circulating viruses match the vaccine components (Week21 #9, #10), and antiviral resistance is minimal. These factors contribute to reduced infection and transmission risks, supporting the low forecasted ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and sporadic avian influenza cases (e.g., avian influenza A(H5N1) in Michigan during Week20 and Week21, 2024), remain minimal contributors to ILI activity without triggering substantial deviations in overall trends.
7. In summary, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 835 for Week26, 2024 is informed by declining trends in ILI cases, seasonality (off-season classification), low influenza positivity, stable vaccination effectiveness, and minimal impacts from co-circulating viruses. These factors collectively justify the projected value.
