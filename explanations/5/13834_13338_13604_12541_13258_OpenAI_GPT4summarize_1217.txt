1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating and slightly declining trend, with values of ['13834', '13338', '13604', '12541', '13258']. There was an initial drop from 13834 (Week13, 2024) to 13338 (Week14, 2024), followed by a minor rebound to 13604 (Week15, 2024), which subsequently declined to a low of 12541 (Week16, 2024) before increasing to 13258 (Week17, 2024). This pattern suggests a decrease in overall ILI activity during the observed period.
2. The correlation is consistent between the past time-series ILI occurrences and the future occurrences, as the decreasing trends in Weeks 13–17, 2024, align with the decline in ILI activity observed nationally according to CDC reports. The future value of 11996 (Week22, 2024) reflects the continuation of this downward trend in subsequent weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI progressively decreased, from 3.0% in Week13, 2024, to 2.2% in Week17, 2024, with all regions falling below their respective baselines by Week17. This systematic decline across healthcare-seeking metrics correlates strongly with the expected reduction leading to 11996 occurrences in Week22, 2024.
4. National influenza positivity rates dropped consistently, from 9.1% in Week13, 2024, to 3.9% in Week17, 2024, indicating a reduction in overall influenza transmission. Additionally, influenza-associated deaths declined (from 0.5% in Week13, 2024, to 0.2% in Week17, 2024), further supporting the observed decrease in ILI occurrences.
5. Reduced hospitalization rates, reflected in the cumulative hospitalization rate stabilizing at 79.8 per 100,000 by Week17, 2024, combined with diminished regional ILI activity and CDC predictions of declining flu activity, align with the continued reduction in ILI cases, reaching 11996 future occurrences in Week22, 2024.
6. In summary, the reported 11996 future ILI occurrences (Week22, 2024) are explained by the decreasing trend in past time-series data (Weeks 13–17, 2024), declining outpatient visits for ILI, reduced influenza lab positivity rates, lower influenza-associated deaths, and stable hospitalization rates. These factors collectively highlight the sustained decline in ILI activity leading to the Week22 value.
