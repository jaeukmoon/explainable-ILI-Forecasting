1. The ILI occurrences from Week48 through Week52, 2023, exhibit a consistently increasing trend: 1703 (Week48), 1827 (Week49), 2186 (Week50), 2266 (Week51), and 2402 (Week52). This sustained growth reflects a steady escalation during the observed period, particularly significant from Week50 to Week52, suggesting expanding transmission and higher community-level spread.
2. Week5, 2024 falls within the peak season in the U.S., which typically spans Week46 of one year to Week6 of the following year. Based on the elevated and rising ILI activity and the continued dominance of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 through Week52, 2023, with no clear signs of stabilization, Week5, 2024 is forecasted to remain within the peak season.
3. The growing ILI occurrences from Week48 to Week52, 2023, demonstrate a strong upward trajectory. Time-series forecasting for Week5, 2024 projects the ILI to continue rising initially before stabilizing as the peak season progresses. Considering growth rates from recent weeks and seasonal expectations, the five-week projection arrives at 2311, slightly lower than Week52 due to the gradual anticipated plateau during peak-season waning.
4. Three key CDC factors influencing the Week5, 2024 projection: (1) Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 dominance (Week48 #2, Week49 #3, Week52 #1) ensures robust transmission trends, especially with this subtype being predominant in all regions. (2) Suboptimal vaccination coverage persists despite availability (Week48 #8, Week49 #8, Week52 #9), leaving a portion of the population unprotected. (3) Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, continues to amplify ILI counts (Week48 #9, Week51 #9, Week52 #10) through compounding factors.
5. The steady increase in ILI counts in recent weeks, alignment with peak season timing, and sustained viral activity align with forecasting an ILI occurrence of 2311 in Week5, 2024. This projection incorporates recent trends, predominant viral strains (A(H1N1)pdm09), vaccination dynamics, and the ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses contributing to elevated ILI activity throughout the period.
