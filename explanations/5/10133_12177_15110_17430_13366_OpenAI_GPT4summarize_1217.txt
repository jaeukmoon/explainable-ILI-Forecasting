1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show notable fluctuations with an overall upward trajectory initially, reaching a peak before declining. The values rose sharply from 10133 (Week48, 2023) to 17430 (Week50, 2023) but then dropped to 13366 (Week51, 2023). This pattern reflects a sustained increase followed by a correction likely driven by dynamic respiratory infection trends during this period.
2. A direct correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observable, where fluctuations in past data, especially the elevated ILI activity peaking in Week50, 2023, and dropping thereafter, anticipate a stabilized future ILI count of 10157 (Week6, 2024). The decline from the Week51, 2023 high could signal a settling trend that aligns with the slightly elevated future level.
3. Weekly outpatient ILI visit rates grew consistently from 4.4% (Week49, 2023) to 6.9% (Week52, 2023), surpassing national baselines. This persistent increase before a subtle decrease (5.7%, Week1, 2024) reflects ongoing respiratory illness spread, coinciding with the projected stabilization. Influenza positivity rates rose from 10.2% (Week49, 2023) to 17.5% (Week52, 2023), driving ILI trends even as activity approached a plateau in subsequent weeks. Nationwide co-circulation of influenza, RSV, and COVID-19 during Weeks49–1, 2024, complicated pathogen-specific trends, reflecting in moderate future levels.
4. Regional variability in flu positivity and A(H1N1)pdm09 predominance, noted consistently in CDC reports, influenced trends. Elevated hospitalization rates, especially in adults aged 65+ (climbing from 20.3 per 100,000 in Week49, 2023, to 85.3 per 100,000 by Week1, 2024), reflect peak ILI-accompanied severe cases likely stabilizing over subsequent weeks.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 10157 (Week6, 2024) stem from the preceding weeks' overall upward trend, peaking mid-period, followed by moderation. This is paralleled by outpatient ILI visit behavior, co-circulation of multiple respiratory illnesses, significant population susceptibility indicators, and eventual stabilization consistent with reported trends in hospitalization and positivity rates.
