1. The ILI occurrences from Week49, 2021 to Week1, 2022 show a consistent and sharp increase from 1325 in Week49, 2021 to 3033 in Week1, 2022. The trend reflects a steep upward trajectory without dips, indicating mounting influenza activity heading into the peak season.
2. Based on historical flu season patterns, Week6, 2022 falls within the tail end of the typical peak season. Elevated ILI levels and rising hospitalization trends further align Week6, 2022 with the peak season phase, which is characterized by widespread transmission and high infection rates.
3. The time-series data illustrates an ongoing surge in ILI counts across the five weeks, forming a strong basis for projection. If this increasing trend moderates due to factors like reduced flu activity (Week1, 2022 #1) and improved immunization practices, a reduction from the recent high of 3033 (Week1, 2022) down to 1063 in Week6, 2022 aligns with typical tapering observed at the end of peak seasons.
4. Influenza nationwide positivity rates decreased from 6.2% (Week51, 2021 #2) to 2.2% (Week1, 2022 #2), signaling a slowing growth of flu circulation, which could reduce ILI occurrences by Week6, 2022.
5. Vaccination coverage remains suboptimal but shows a potential for impact, as CDC continues to stress its effectiveness (Week1, 2022 #8). The antigenic similarity of most circulating A(H3N2) viruses to the vaccine (Week51, 2021 #7) could provide partial protection and contribute to the decline in ILI activity by Week6, 2022.
6. While respiratory illness outpatient visits remain above baseline, they declined from 4.8% (Week52, 2021 #5) to 4.3% (Week1, 2022 #4), suggesting reduced ILI-related healthcare burden, pointing to a gradual reduction in occurrences in coming weeks.
7. The projected value of 1063 ILI occurrences by Week6, 2022 is supported by the observed tapering in positivity rates, vaccination effects, and declining respiratory illness visits. Despite high hospitalization and PIC mortality rates driven primarily by COVID-19, the reduction in influenza-specific activity and vaccine availability explain the significant drop from the peak ILI counts in Week1, 2022.
