1. The reported ILI counts from Week22 to Week26, 2021 are 1817, 1748, 1807, 1791, and 1794. The data exhibits relative stability with slight week-to-week fluctuations. From Week22 (1817) to Week26 (1794), ILI occurrences show no significant upward or downward trajectory, reflecting a stable trend near the baseline.
2. Given that Week31, 2021 occurs well before the typical peak onset season (Week32 to Week46) and aligns more closely with the off-season period based on the low ILI activity indicated in the CDC reports across Week22 to Week26, 2021, Week31, 2021 is classified as belonging to the off-season. This aligns with marginal influenza transmission during this period.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the slight week-to-week fluctuations around the 1800 range in Week22 to Week26, 2021 suggest a stable baseline without dramatic deviations. Using this pattern to project forward five weeks, a significant increase in ILI occurrences is unlikely under the existing conditions. The model anticipates a modest rise due to potential cumulative effects, reflecting the projected count of 3336 in Week31, 2021.
4. Nationwide influenza positivity rates consistently remain minimal over the past five weeks, with values below 0.1% and all ILI metrics well below the baseline of 2.6%, indicative of limited influenza transmission during this period (Week22 #1, #2; Week23 #1, #2; Week25 #1, #2).
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes owing to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to influence influenza-related surveillance and data reliability, complicating trend predictions, particularly during periods of low ILI activity (Week22 #7; Week24 #7, #8; Week26 #6, #9).
6. Ongoing indirect effects of co-circulating respiratory illnesses, especially SARS-CoV-2, and limited vaccination activity for influenza, contribute to the subdued ILI levels reported and play a role in shaping the overall respiratory illness trends (Week22 #3, #8; Week23 #10; Week26 #5, #9).
7. In summary, the stable ILI trend, classification of the period as off-season, and influence of factors like minimal influenza positivity rates, pandemic-related healthcare behavior changes, and concurrent respiratory illness activity justify the forecast of 3336 ILI occurrences in Week31, 2021, reflecting an expected modest rise amidst overall low activity.
