1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent decline, starting at 1259 (Week 2, 2021) and decreasing to 684 (Week 6, 2021). This downward trend reflects diminishing ILI activity, with a steady reduction in weekly occurrences, potentially revealing low respiratory illness prevalence during this period.

2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the consistent decline in ILI occurrences during Weeks 2–6, 2021, contrasts with the higher future occurrence of 607 (5 weeks later). This discrepancy suggests external factors, other than the past decline, influenced the reported future activity.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI decreased from 1.4% (Week 2, 2021) to a stable 1.1% from Week 4 onward, remaining well below the national baseline (2.6%). This stabilization at a low level possibly underpins the relatively low future occurrence of 607, as ILI visits did not indicate significant growth during the observed weeks.

4. Cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza remained extremely low, at 0.5–0.6 per 100,000 throughout the observed period, representing historically low levels for this time of the year. This minimal hospitalization indicates subdued influenza severity, aligning with restrained future ILI occurrence.

5. Disruptions in traditional ILI surveillance due to altered healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted repeatedly in CDC reports over Weeks 2–6, 2021. These disruptions may have led to underreporting or delayed recognition of cases, creating irregular patterns and contributing to the relatively low reported future occurrence of 607.

6. In summary, the reported 607 future ILI occurrences (5 weeks later) can be attributed to the sustained decline in past occurrences, stable and subdued outpatient ILI activity, historically low hospitalization rates, and surveillance challenges influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. These combined factors reflect an atypical influenza season and justify the restrained future ILI count.
