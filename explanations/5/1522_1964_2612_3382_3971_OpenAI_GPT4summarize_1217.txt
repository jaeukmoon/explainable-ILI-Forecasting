1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent upward trend, starting from 1522 (Week11, 2022) and rising steadily each week to reach 3971 (Week15, 2022). The incremental increases in ILI occurrences between consecutive weeks highlight a sustained escalation in respiratory illness activity in this period.
2. A strong positive correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences. The continued rise in ILI cases up to Week15, 2022, peaking at 3971, aligns with the eventual drop to 3551 after 5 weeks, indicating a slight decline but suggesting sustained high levels of ILI activity. The upward trajectory leading into Week15 likely contributed to the elevated baseline for future occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily increased, accounting for 1.8% (Week11, 2022), 1.8% (Week12, 2022), 1.9% (Week13, 2022), 2.0% (Week14, 2022), and 2.1% (Week15, 2022). This gradual rise in healthcare encounters for ILI-shaped respiratory illness trends and paved the way for elevated future case counts.
4. Hospitalization rates for influenza-associated illness consistently increased from 6.5 per 100,000 (Week11, 2022) to 9.8 per 100,000 (Week15, 2022). The sustained rise in severe respiratory illness incidents, predominantly Influenza A(H3N2), underpins the high future ILI occurrences at 3551 post-Week15.
5. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, contributed to overlapping symptoms, complicating distinctions among respiratory illnesses. This co-circulation began impacting trends early (e.g., 3.5% SARS-CoV-2 co-detection in Week11, 2022, and 5.0% by Week15, 2022). These dynamics fueled continued ILI reporting into the future, maintaining elevated levels.
6. Pediatric influenza-associated deaths consistently rose, increasing cumulatively from 13 (Week11, 2022) to 22 (Week15, 2022). The rise in pediatric cases reflects broader community-level disease escalation, further influencing the future weekly total of 3551 after Week15, 2022.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 3551 after Week15, 2022, are primarily attributed to the persistent upward trajectory in ILI occurrences over Weeks11–15, 2022, rising outpatient and hospitalization rates, prolonged co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, and collective community impact highlighted by pediatric mortality increases.
