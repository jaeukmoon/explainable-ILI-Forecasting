1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a clear upward trend, with values of ['1860', '1961', '2458', '2854', '3151']. Beginning at 1860 in Week 46, 2023, there was a steady increase week by week, reaching 3151 in Week 50, 2023, which represents a 69.4% increase over the 5-week period. This consistent rise indicates escalating ILI activity driven by seasonal factors and wider circulation of respiratory illnesses.
2. A strong positive correlation is evident between the past and future ILI occurrences. The consistent upward trend during Weeks 46–50, 2023 (peaking at 3151), matches the eventual decrease reported at 2710 in Week 55, 2024. Such a decline corresponds to the typical seasonal plateauing of ILI activity as peaks ease during later stages of the flu season.
3. Increasing percentages of outpatient visits for ILI (from 3.7% in Week 46, 2023, to 5.1% in Week 50, 2023) highlight intensified healthcare-seeking behavior due to respiratory illnesses, aligning with the observed rise and subsequent decline in ILI activity after 5 weeks.
4. Cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rates doubled from 2.6 per 100,000 in Week 46 to 11.3 per 100,000 in Week 50, with adults aged 65+ contributing the highest burden. This surge in hospitalizations reflects severe cases potentially contributing to elevated past ILI cases and the high future occurrence of 2710.
5. Nationwide increases in influenza positivity rates from 4.9% in Week 46 to 12.8% by Week 50 align with rising ILI cases and serve as predictive indicators of elevated respiratory illness levels in subsequent weeks, affecting the future ILI count.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2) was consistently noted in CDC reports throughout Weeks 46–50, exacerbating respiratory illness trends. This overlap likely intensified ILI occurrences and influenced future activity levels at 2710 in Week 55, 2024.
7. In summary, the future occurrences of 2710 ILI cases after 5 weeks (Week 55, 2024) can be attributed to the strong upward trajectory of past ILI data, increasing outpatient visits and hospitalizations, higher influenza positivity rates, and the combined impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors together explain the observed trends and seasonal dynamics of respiratory illness activity.
