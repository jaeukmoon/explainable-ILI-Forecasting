1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but mostly declining trend, with values ['1154', '1212', '1308', '1174', '1129']. After a peak in Week10, 2023 at 1308, there was a decline to 1174 in Week11, 2023 and a further drop to 1129 in Week12, 2023, indicating a reduction in ILI activity during the observed period.
2. A weak negative correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences, as the declining trend in past weeks (Weeks10-12, 2023) aligns with the lower future ILI occurrence of 902 after Week17, 2023. This suggests that the consistent decline in past weeks contributed to the subdued levels of ILI activity seen in the future period.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently declined from 2.6% in Week8, 2023 to 2.3% in Week12, 2023, which is below the national baseline of 2.5%. The decreasing trend in outpatient visits aligns with the eventual drop in ILI occurrences to 902 after Week17, 2023.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) also showed a reduction, from 9.2% in Week8, 2023 to 8.3% in Week12, 2023. While still above the epidemic threshold, this decline reflects diminished respiratory illness severity, contributing to lower ILI trends.
5. Nationwide influenza activity remained low and stable throughout the 5 weeks, with positivity rates ranging from 1.0% (Week8, 2023) to 0.9% (Week9 and Week12, 2023). Minimal lab-confirmed influenza activity, combined with a well-matched seasonal vaccine, reduced the likelihood of a significant future increase in ILI cases.
6. In summary, the reported 902 future ILI occurrences (Week17, 2023) can be attributed to the overall declining trend in past ILI occurrences, reduced outpatient visits for ILI, decreasing PIC mortality, and consistently low influenza positivity rates, which collectively limited the progression of ILI activity over time.
