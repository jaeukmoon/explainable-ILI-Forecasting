1. The reported ILI counts from Week8 to Week12, 2021, are 1519, 1517, 1585, 1673, and 1893. This shows a consistent upward trend in ILI occurrences, with a gradual increase from Week8 (1519) to Week11 (1673), followed by a sharper rise by Week12 (1893). The steady growth suggests increasing ILI activity, albeit from a historically low baseline.
2. Week17, 2021, occurs well outside the typical peak influenza season, which generally spans Week46 to Week6 of the following year. While the data shows slight increases in activity (Week8 to Week12, 2021), low positivity and other indicators still place Week17 within the off-season period. Thus, Week17, 2021, aligns with the off-season classification.
3. The time-series trend, characterized by week-over-week increases between Week8 and Week12, 2021, implies continued upward momentum in the short term. Projecting this trajectory forward, the ILI occurrences for Week17, 2021, can be expected to further increase but stabilize at a moderately higher level due to the absence of any strong drivers of a surge.
4. Despite the slight upward ILI trend, influenza activity remained exceptionally low nationwide, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive in clinical labs during Week12, 2021 (Week12, 2021 #1). This low positivity constrains the overall magnitude of occurrences and supports a moderate forecast increase.
5. Vaccination coverage updates focused on Influenza A subtype changes, but there were no significant trends in vaccination uptake or effectiveness (Week9, 2021 #8; Week12, 2021 #9). This lack of vaccination surge likely limits the reduction of flu transmission and contributes marginally to the anticipated ILI increases.
6. Behavioral changes due to ongoing COVID-19 disruptions continue to impact healthcare-seeking patterns and the accuracy of ILI data (Week8, 2021 #10; Week9, 2021 #10; Week12, 2021 #10). These influences create variability in reported ILI trends, though the overall increase in ILI numbers suggests genuine growth rather than data anomalies.
7. With an upward ILI trend (Week8–Week12, 2021), off-season conditions (Week17, 2021), low national influenza positivity (Week12, 2021 #1), moderate vaccination impact (Week9, 2021 #8), and disruption from COVID-19 (Week12, 2021 #10), the projected ILI count for Week17, 2021, is forecasted to be 2118, aligning with continued moderate growth.
