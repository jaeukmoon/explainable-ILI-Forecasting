1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week31 to Week35, 2024, are 1509, 1504, 1562, 1634, and 1722. The trend shows a steady rise, with slight increases each week. This indicates a progressive upward trajectory without sharp spikes, consistent with the transition toward higher activity levels in a peak onset season.
2. Week40, 2024, falls within the typical timeline for the peak onset season in the U.S., typically spanning Weeks 32 to 46. Based on past trends and the ongoing increase in ILI activity, Week40, 2024, is classified as part of the peak onset season.
3. The steady weekly increases in ILI occurrences from Week31 to Week35, 2024, demonstrate a growth pattern; projecting forward with this trend implies a continuation of rising activity approaching Week40, 2024. According to time-series forecasting, such patterns typically suggest further gradual growth, leading to the expected ILI occurrence of 2572.
4. Novel variant detections (Week31, 2024 #7; Week32, 2024 #7; Week33, 2024 #7) with potential zoonotic contributions may increase ILI risks, though human-to-human transmission remains limited.
5. The percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza has remained below 0.6% but co-circulation of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (Week31, 2024 #8; Week32, 2024 #8; Week35, 2024 #10) might amplify overall ILI activity indirectly.
6. Outpatient ILI visits, although still below the national baseline, show a slight uptick in Weeks 34-35, 2024 (Week34, 2024 #4; Week35, 2024 #4), especially in younger age groups. This trend is consistent with the beginning of increased transmission seen in peak onset seasons.
7. The rising yet moderate ILI occurrences, falling within the peak onset season and influenced by co-circulating respiratory viruses, indicate a predictable upward trend. Combined with stable yet low vaccination uptake (Week32, 2024 #9; Week34, 2024 #10) and minimal resistance to antivirals (Week31, 2024 #9; Week35, 2024 #9), the forecast for Week40, 2024, is 2572 occurrences.
