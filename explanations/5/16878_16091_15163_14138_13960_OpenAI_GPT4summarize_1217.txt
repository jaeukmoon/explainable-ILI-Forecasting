1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 13–17, 2024) showed a consistent downward trend, with values declining from 16878 (Week 13, 2024) to 13960 (Week 17, 2024). Weekly decreases in ILI occurrences reflect a gradual reduction in influenza activity, aligning with the reported decline in national flu trends. Despite a slight plateau toward the latter weeks, the overall trajectory underscores subsiding respiratory illness activity.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 12014 (Week 22, 2024) align with the observed declining trajectory. The steady reduction in past ILI occurrences mirrors the eventual stabilization at lower levels after 5 weeks. The continued decline indicated in Week 17 serves as a precursor to the lower reported ILI activity in Week 22, suggesting a strong negative correlation between the past and future values.
3. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza declined from 9.1% (Week 13, 2024) to 3.9% (Week 17, 2024), representing a steady decrease in virologic positivity. Additionally, outpatient ILI visit percentages dropped from 3.0% (Week 13, 2024) to 2.2% (Week 17, 2024), falling below the national baseline. These declines likely contributed directly to the reduced future ILI occurrences.
4. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including RSV and COVID-19, were noted consistently in reports, influencing ILI patterns. However, the declining dominance of influenza strains and the relatively low impact of these viruses by Week 17 suggest their diminishing influence on future occurrences.
5. Hospitalization rates for Influenza steadily increased cumulatively (74.2 to 79.8 per 100,000 from Weeks 13–17, 2024), yet weekly new admissions declined during the same period, suggesting further reduction in severe influenza cases. This trend supports the lower activity evidenced by 12014 occurrences reported after 5 weeks.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 12014 (Week 22, 2024) can be explained by the consistent decrease in past ILI occurrences (Weeks 13–17, 2024), a decline in influenza virologic positivity and outpatient visits below baseline, reduced influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses, and the decreasing hospitalization trends during this period. The observed patterns highlight the transition to lower influenza activity across Weeks 13–22, 2024.
