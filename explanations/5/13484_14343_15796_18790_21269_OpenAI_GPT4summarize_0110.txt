1. The reported ILI occurrences during Week16 to Week20, 2022 were 13484, 14343, 15796, 18790, and 21269. This demonstrates a consistent upward trend with accelerating increases, particularly significant between Week18 (15796) and Week20 (21269), signaling elevated activity with sustained growth over the five-week period.
2. In terms of season classification, Week25, 2022 aligns with the off-season, as it falls well outside the typical peak season (Week46 to Week6) and after the secondary peak season in Week19, 2022. Although influenza activity is increasing, Week25 generally marks the beginning of a declining or leveling phase associated with off-season trends.
3. The consistent increase in ILI occurrences observed in the prior five weeks indicates a strong upward trajectory. The average weekly growth rate from Week16 to Week20 is approximately 12.12%. Projecting forward five weeks with a less pronounced rise due to seasonal leveling, a future occurrence of 15495 reflects a tapering upward trend.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) predominance (accounts for 98.8%-99.6% of cases), coupled with its antigenic variation and partial vaccine mismatch, leads to higher susceptibility within the population, sustaining moderate ILI activity (Week19, 2022 #9; Week20, 2022 #7).
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, contributes to regional variations and slightly higher respiratory visits but does not suggest a sharp spike (Week18, 2022 #10; Week19, 2022 #8; Week20, 2022 #8).
6. Although influenza vaccinations are ongoing, late-season antigenic differences in circulating A(H3N2) and lower coverage reduce vaccination effectiveness in mitigating future cases (Week17, 2022 #8; Week18, 2022 #8; Week20, 2022 #7).
7. In summary, based on the escalating trends observed in ILI occurrences from Week16-20, 2022 and the dominance of A(H3N2) with antigenic drift, the projected ILI occurrence in Week25, 2022 at 15495 reflects the continued yet tapering increase in activity during the off-season, moderated by co-circulation factors and region-specific variations.
