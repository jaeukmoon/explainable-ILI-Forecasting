1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week22 to Week26, 2024, reveal a decreasing trend from Week22 (12014) to Week25 (9946), followed by a slight increase in Week26 (10087). This constitutes a general decline with minor fluctuations. The absence of significant spikes or sharp drops indicates a relatively stable off-season activity pattern.
2. Week31, 2024, falls within the off-season period, as per the U.S. influenza calendar, typically spanning from Week9 to Week30 of each year. With influenza activity levels remaining low (as seen in Week22 to Week26, 2024 reports) and positivity rates below baseline, the target week aligns with off-season characteristics.
3. The time-series pattern, featuring a gradual decline and stabilization, reinforces the off-season activity expectation. Extrapolating this trend forward five weeks suggests minimal fluctuations, with a predicted ILI occurrence of 10927 reflecting lower but stable levels in off-season dynamics.
4. Lab data consistently show low influenza positivity nationally (1.8% in Week22 to 1.0% in Week26, 2024), with Influenza A being predominant across all weeks (Week22 #2, Week23 #2, Week25 #2, Week26 #2). This trend aligns with subdued off-season activity.
5. Effective vaccination coverage (Week22, 2024 #13; Week23, 2024 #8; Week25, 2024 #8) and minimal antiviral resistance (Week22, 2024 #12; Week24, 2024 #7; Week26, 2024 #9) contribute significantly to managing influenza transmission, maintaining low occurrence levels.
6. The co-circulation of influenza, COVID-19, and RSV, with no major increases or significant shifts in activity, supports the overall stability in ILI trends (Week22, 2024 #10; Week24, 2024 #9; Week26, 2024 #10).
7. In summary, the declining trend in ILI occurrences, classification of Week31 as off-season, low positivity rates, effective vaccine match, and lack of significant co-circulating virus surges collectively justify the forecast of 10927 ILI occurrences for that week.
