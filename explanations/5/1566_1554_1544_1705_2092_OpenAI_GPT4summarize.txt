1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating yet clear upward trend. The values started at 1566 in Week 41, 2020, decreased to 1544 in Week 43, 2020, but subsequently increased to 2092 in Week 45, 2020, the highest value in the series. This progression indicates increasing ILI activity in the later weeks, despite initial stability.  

2. The future ILI occurrences of 2237 (Week 50, 2020) correlate with the observed upward trend in the latter part of the past data (Weeks 44–45, 2020), where ILI occurrences rose significantly from 1705 to 2092. The increasing trend during this period serves as an indicator of continued growth in ILI activity 5 weeks later.  

3. A slight but persistent increase in outpatient visits for ILI was noted in the CDC reports, rising from 1.2% in Week 41, 2020, to 1.5% in Week 45, 2020. Although these percentages remain below the national baseline of 2.6%, the gradual rise suggests heightened respiratory illness activity, which contributed to the future ILI increase.  

4. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, increasing from 7.2% in Week 41, 2020, to 8.9% in Week 45, 2020. This rise in PIC mortality rates reflects escalating respiratory-related illness burden, consistent with the future increase in ILI occurrences.  

5. The impact of COVID-19 on healthcare-seeking behaviors, mentioned in all CDC reports, disrupted traditional ILI surveillance systems. These disruptions likely undermined real-time aggregation and recognition of mild ILI cases during the observed period, potentially concentrating and amplifying future ILI occurrences to the reported 2237 value.  

6. Low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.3% in Week 41 and 0.2% in Week 45, 2020) and minimal public health lab detections indicate that influenza itself had limited impact during the reported period. The rise in ILI occurrences may instead stem from non-specific respiratory illnesses, seasonal patterns, or secondary effects arising from pandemic-related healthcare behavior shifts.  

7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2237 in Week 50, 2020, can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks 44–45, 2020, a steady increase in ILI outpatient visit percentages, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the effects of disrupted healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance during the pandemic.
