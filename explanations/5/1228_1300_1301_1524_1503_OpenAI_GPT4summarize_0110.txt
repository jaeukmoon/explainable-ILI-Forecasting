1. The reported ILI counts from Week35 to Week39, 2023 are 1228, 1300, 1301, 1524, and 1503. The trend shows a steady increase from Week35 to Week38, followed by a slight decrease in Week39. Overall, this represents a gradual upward trajectory with a minor fluctuation at the end.
2. Forecasting target Week44, 2023 belongs to the Peak onset season since Week44 falls near the end of the Peak onset season (Week35–46). Additionally, the reported ILI activity and indicators remain consistent with the gradual increase typically seen during this period.
3. The upward trend observed over the past five weeks (Week35–39, 2023) suggests rising ILI activity consistent with the transition into the Peak onset season. This trend aligns with time-series forecasting models that project the continuation of increasing cases, culminating in a heightened ILI occurrence as Week44 approaches. Based on this historical trajectory, the model forecasts a higher count of 2172 ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza positivity has steadily risen, from 0.6% in Week35 to 1.0% in Week39, reflecting increasing influenza circulation as the season progresses; 64% of confirmed positives are Influenza A, primarily H1N1, which tends to drive infection increases (Week35, 2023 #1; Week39, 2023 #1, #2).
5. Influenza-related hospitalizations have shown a continuous rise, from 509 in Week35, 2023 to 1,040 in Week39, 2023 (Week35, 2023 #6; Week39, 2023 #4). This indicates a corresponding increase in severe cases, further supporting the likelihood of elevated ILI activity in the coming weeks.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, are contributing to outpatient and hospitalization data, inflating overall ILI visits (Week35, 2023 #10; Week39, 2023 #8).
7. Given the consistently increasing ILI trend, the timing within the Peak onset season (Week44, 2023), and the combined impact of rising influenza positivity, increased hospitalizations, and co-circulating respiratory viruses, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 2172 aligns with the expected trajectory for this period.
