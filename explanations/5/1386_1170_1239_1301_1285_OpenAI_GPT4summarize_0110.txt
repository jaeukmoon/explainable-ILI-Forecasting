1. From Week27, 2022 to Week31, 2022, the reported ILI occurrences were 1386, 1170, 1239, 1301, and 1285. The data shows initial declines from Week27 (1386) to Week28 (1170), followed by a minor increase in Week29 (1239) and Week30 (1301). A slight dip in Week31 (1285) closes the period. Overall, the trend reflects mild fluctuations with no significant growth or sharp decline, rather maintaining a stable baseline range.
2. As Week36, 2022 follows Week31, 2022, and falls in the usual timeline of Peak Onset season (Week32 to Week46), it is reasonable to classify Week36, 2022 as within the Peak Onset season. Activity remains subdued but poised for an eventual increase as the seasonal onset progresses.
3. Correlation analysis indicates that while the occurrences between Week27, 2022 and Week31, 2022 are stable, the slight fluctuations align with typical early onset seasonal patterns. This suggests a marginal increase over five weeks as activity begins to emerge, aligning with historical forecasts for Peak Onset season. The projection estimates 1430 ILI occurrences following previous trends, while incorporating a slight rise as activity begins to prepare for the seasonal peak.
4. Influenza activity remains low nationwide with clinical positivity below 1%, as 0.7% positive tests were recorded in Week27, 0.7% in Week28, 0.7% in Week29, 0.5% in Week30, and 0.4% in Week31. Low positivity indicates ongoing minimal transmission, likely maintaining modest ILI levels.
5. Novel human infections with Influenza A (H3N2)v (two cases in Week31, 2022 and one in Week30, 2022) highlight potential new viral contributions, though no sustained human-to-human transmission was found. Such isolated events may slightly impact ILI occurrences but are not expected to cause a sharp escalation.
6. Outpatient respiratory illness visits account for a stable baseline from Week27 (1.7%), Week28 (1.6%), Week29 (1.6%), Week30 (1.6%), and Week31 (1.5%), predominantly driven by younger age groups (aged 0-4 years). This suggests consistent healthcare-seeking behavior without dramatic shifts.
7. The final forecast of 1430 ILI occurrences in Week36, 2022 is justified by considering the stable past trend (fluctuations within a narrow range), Peak Onset season classification, low influenza positivity, stable outpatient trends, and modest increases as the season progresses. The projection reflects a realistic alignment of historical data and early onset trends.
