1. The ILI counts from Week30 to Week34, 2022 are 1301, 1285, 1243, 1207, and 1253, exhibiting a generally decreasing trend until Week33, followed by a slight uptick in Week34. This overall pattern indicates a mild fluctuation within a declining trajectory, suggesting no significant spike or sharp increase in ILI activity over the observed period.
2. Week39, 2022 is classified as part of the peak onset season. This period typically begins around Week35 and extends to Week46 in the U.S., preceding the more intense peak season when ILI activity substantially rises. Though the observed activity remains low, Week39 aligns with the timeline for increasing activity in this phase.
3. The past five weeks’ declining trends in ILI occurrences, combined with a slight rise in Week34, indicate the possibility of mild increases moving into Week39, consistent with historical patterns during the peak onset season. From a time-series perspective, forecasting future occurrences requires factoring in typical seasonality patterns, which suggest gradual growth beginning in Week35 and extending to Week39. This supports a predicted increase, reaching 2301 ILI cases in Week39.
4. While influenza positivity remains low (0.5% at Week34), key indicators such as an uptick in outpatient visits for ILI (1.8% in Week34, rising from prior weeks) signal potential increases (Week34, #1, #4).
5. The presence of novel influenza variants (H3N2v in Weeks30 and 31 and H1N2v in Weeks32 and 33) and co-circulation with other respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, complicates activity patterns and could explain elevated ILI cases during this transitional period (Week30, #7; Week31, #4; Week32, #4; Week33, #3).
6. The unpredictability due to overlapping respiratory illnesses and changes in healthcare-seeking behavior post-pandemic (reported consistently in all CDC summaries) adds variability that could influence higher-than-usual ILI reporting in Week39 (Week30, #10; Week31, #10; Week32, #11; Week33, #10; Week34, #10).
7. In summary, the projected ILI occurrence of 2301 for Week39, 2022 reflects increasing activity characteristic of the peak onset season, historical patterns suggesting a gradual rise following low activity levels, atypical influences from simultaneous respiratory virus circulation, and upticks in ILI visits and novel influenza cases. These combined factors justify the forecasted value.
