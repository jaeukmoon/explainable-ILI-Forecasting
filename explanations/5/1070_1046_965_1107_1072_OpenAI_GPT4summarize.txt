1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating pattern with no substantial increase or decrease overall. Weekly occurrences were ['1070' (Week 24, 2021), '1046' (Week 25, 2021), '965' (Week 26, 2021), '1107' (Week 27, 2021), '1072' (Week 28, 2021)]. Although Week 26 saw a dip to 965, subsequent weeks noted a rise, peaking at 1107 in Week 27, followed by a slight decline to 1072 in Week 28. This suggests a relatively stable baseline with transient fluctuations.

2. The future ILI occurrences reaching 1543 after 5 weeks (Week 33, 2021) seem correlated with the upward momentum observed in Weeks 27 and 28, where the ILI counts increased compared to prior weeks. The stabilization observed earlier in Weeks 24–25 appears to have laid the foundation for the subsequent increase in activity.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI, while minimal nationwide at 1.2%–1.3% across Weeks 24–28, displayed slight increases in specific demographic groups, including younger age cohorts in Weeks 27 and 28. This trend of localized increases aligns with the rise in future ILI occurrences.

4. The percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds across all weeks, ranging from 6.2% (Week 26, 2021) to 7.1% (Week 28, 2021). Although primarily driven by COVID-19, elevated PIC mortality reflects significant respiratory illness activity that may contribute to future ILI increases.

5. Data from summarized reports indicate challenges in interpreting ILI trends due to pandemic-related changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and alternative care settings. Such disruptions may have delayed recognition or reporting of ILI cases, potentially amplifying reported figures in later weeks.

6. Despite minimal influenza activity documented in weekly reports (e.g., lab positivity rates below 0.1% or negligible detections), the compounded impact of non-specific respiratory illnesses, changes in healthcare utilization, and overlapping respiratory infections could explain the higher future ILI count.

7. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 1543 (Week 33, 2021) can be attributed to the stabilization and subsequent uptick in ILI occurrences in Weeks 27–28 (2021), localized increases in outpatient ILI visits, persistently high PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the influence of pandemic-related factors on data reporting and healthcare behaviors. The future surge likely reflects the cumulative effect of these drivers.
