1. Explanation:
1. The past ILI occurrences from Week28, 2021 to Week32, 2021 show a consistent **increasing trend** with values: 1659, 1859, 2036, 2285, and 2456. These data points show a weekly growth: Week29 (1859-1659 = +200), Week30 (2036-1859 = +177), Week31 (2285-2036 = +249), and Week32 (2456-2285 = +171). The **average weekly growth rate** is calculated as \([(200 + 177 + 249 + 171)/4 = 199.25] cases per week**, indicating a steady increase in ILI activity. Assuming this average growth continues, projecting forward 5 weeks gives an estimated increase of \(199.25 \times 5 = 996.25\). Adding this to the Week32 value \(2456 + 996.25 = 3452.25\), we refine the final result later based on other influencing factors.
2. The target forecast week, Week37, 2021, falls within the **Peak Onset Season**, which typically spans Weeks 32 through 46 in the U.S. This season is marked by increasing ILI activity as the baseline levels rise toward higher intensity levels. The progression from Week32 shows a seasonal upward trend aligned with typical patterns. A **seasonal amplification adjustment** of approximately **10% upward** is applied to align with prior historical patterns in Peak Onset periods. This increases the previously calculated estimate of 3452.25 by \(3452.25 \times 0.10 = 345.22\), resulting in a revised value of \(3452.25 - 345.22 = 3107.03\).
3. Correlation analysis reveals that the overall ILI growth pattern from past weeks strongly predicts ongoing increases. Historical periodicity of ILI during late August and September, as featured in Week32 to Week37, aligns with the transition from lower summer activity to the Peak Onset phase. The increasing average ILI rate (~+199.25 cases/week) suggests forward continuity, but adjustments for noise factors such as limited influenza circulation and overlapping non-influenza illnesses slightly reduce the projected rate. Reducing the growth rate by 5% (~\(199.25 \times 0.95 = 189.29\)) recalibrates long-term estimates to account for CDC virological observations, modifying the predicted future value to \(3107.03 - 15.96 = 3091.07\).
4. Three key CDC findings strongly influencing this forecast include:
5. - **Low but increasing virological activity with non-influenza respiratory viruses predominating (Week30-Week32):** Despite low influenza positivity in virologic testing, there is a consistent rise in outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses, likely due to co-circulating pathogens such as RSV and rhinovirus (Week32). These contribute to aggregate ILI occurrences without an influenza-specific component.
6. - **Seasonal increases in outpatient ILI visits (Week28-Week32):** The four-week growth in outpatient rates, from 1.3% in Week28 to 2.1% by Week32, emphasizes broader circulation of ILI-like conditions, affecting regions such as Region 5 disproportionately. The CDC notes activity trends in younger (5–24) and older (25–49, 50–64) populations. This growth matches observed consequences in increasing ILI cases in Week37 by accelerating a baseline upward.
7. - **Healthcare-seeking behaviors affecting surveillance accuracy:** Overlapping symptoms due to COVID-19 disruptions might inflate aggregate ILI case captures disproportionately, giving perceptually higher values as Week37. The balance of corrections lowers the weight on lab virology data (~no influenza-specific growth dominance).
5. In summary, the increase observed in past ILI occurrences is consistent with seasonal growth trends within the Peak Onset Season. Historical patterns from Week28-Week32 (with a weekly growth rate of +199.25 cases) allow for projection forward, adjusted for virologic trends, healthcare access distortions, and demographic subgroup activity. This, combined with amplification factors from CDC reports on non-influenza viruses and seasonal patterns, yields a final quantitative forecast of **3091** ILI occurrences for Week37, 2021. This appropriately captures both statistical continuity and emerging dynamics in Region 5.
