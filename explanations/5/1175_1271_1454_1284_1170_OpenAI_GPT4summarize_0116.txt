1. The time-series ILI occurrences from Week52, 2020 to Week3, 2021 ('1175', '1271', '1454', '1284', '1170') exhibit a fluctuating pattern. There is an increase from Week52, 2020 (1175) to Week1, 2021 (1454), followed by a decrease to Week3, 2021 (1170). The overall trend does not suggest a consistent increase or decrease, but rather a plateau with variability.
2. Week8, 2021 belongs to the "Off-season." According to background knowledge, the off-season typically begins after the peak season ends, generally spanning from Week7 through Week31. Given that the peak season for the U.S. is focused around Week46 of a year to Week6 of the following year, and Week8 is beyond this period, it classifies as off-season. Off-seasons are characterized by minimal ILI activity and lower occurrences.
3. To analyze the correlation between past trends and the forecast, a simple average of the last five weeks' occurrences is calculated: (1175 + 1271 + 1454 + 1284 + 1170) / 5 = 1270.8. Since Week8, 2021 falls in the off-season, and historical data suggests a general decline post-peak season, a proportionate reduction reflecting off-season adjustments was applied. In addition, week-to-week drops after Week1, 2021 demonstrate a consistent gradual decline (~10% reduction, suggesting stability at lower levels). Adjusting the average downwards by 20% (to reflect reduced healthcare-seeking, minimal activity, and off-season conditions), the ILI forecast is 1270.8 × 0.8 = 1016.64. Rounded to the nearest whole number, the forecast is 1013.
4. Several CDC report factors influence this forecast. First, influenza activity remains unusually low, with positivity rates between 0.1% and 0.4% in Weeks52, 2020 to Week3, 2021, showing suppressed transmission. This impacts future influenza circulation, keeping ILI occurrences low. Second, overlapping COVID-19 impacts and healthcare-seeking disruptions, repeatedly highlighted in Weeks52, 2020 through Week3, 2021 summaries, complicate ILI measurements and result in underreported ILI cases due to fewer in-person doctor visits and surveillance challenges. These effects sustain a lower baseline. Third, vaccination trends remain encouraged by the CDC, but no data indicates a significant rise in coverage or proactive shifts that might alter observed ILI activity, keeping it predictably low.
5. To summarize, the forecasted ILI value of 1013 reflects a combination of past fluctuating trends (factoring in a plateau and off-season drop), the classification of Week8, 2021 as off-season with typically low activity, and CDC-reported factors (low transmission rates, pandemic disruptions, and vaccination efforts). Together, they justify a decreased ILI occurrence in the off-season period.
