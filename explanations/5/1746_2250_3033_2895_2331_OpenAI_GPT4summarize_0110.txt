1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week51, 2021 to Week3, 2022 are 1746, 2250, 3033, 2895, and 2331. The data indicates an increasing trend from Week51, 2021 (1746) through Week52, 2021 (2250) and peaking in Week1, 2022 (3033). Subsequently, ILI occurrences decrease moderately by Week2, 2022 (2895) and Week3, 2022 (2331). Overall, this illustrates a peak-and-decline trend, suggesting a transition past the peak season.
2. Week8, 2022 falls within the typical off-season period, as peak seasons typically end by Week6 (Week6, 2022 #1; Week8, 2022 lies beyond this timeline) while influenza activity shows ongoing declines (Week3, 2022 #1, #9). Thus, Week8, 2022 is categorized within the off-season period, characterized by reduced activity levels.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the declining ILI trend from Weeks1-3, 2022 (3033 to 2331) suggests further reduction as activity returns to baseline levels. Projecting forward five weeks, this consistent decline aligns with a predicted lower value, yielding an ILI occurrence of 773.
4. Influenza activity decreased slightly in recent weeks, particularly Week2 and Week3, 2022, with positivity rates declining from 2.2% (Week1, 2022 #2) to 1.9% (Week3, 2022 #1). This downward trend supports the expectation of lower influenza prevalence and ILI activity in the coming weeks (Week3, 2022 #9).
5. Lower vaccination rates this season compared to prior years (Week1, 2022 #8; Week2, 2022 #7; Week3, 2022 #5) may contribute marginally to sustaining ILI activity but are insufficient to drive significant spikes due to the generally declining trajectory.
6. Influenza A(H3N2) remains the dominant subtype, with limited impact of Influenza B and no antiviral resistance reported (Week1, 2022 #3, #9; Week2, 2022 #2, #10; Week3, 2022 #8). Genetic similarities of Influenza A(H3N2) to vaccine strains (Week2, 2022 #9) also mitigate the risk of sharp rises.
7. The cumulative decline in influenza activity, alignment with off-season timing, reduced positivity rates, and consistent time-series trends justify the prediction of 773 ILI occurrences for Week8, 2022.
