1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences for the past five weeks (Week36 to Week40, 2021) in Region 7 are as follows: ['1305', '1189', '1064', '975', '1124']. The trend indicates a generally decreasing pattern from Week36 (1305) to Week40 (1124), with some fluctuations. The drop from 1305 (Week36) to 975 (Week39) is notable, followed by a slight recovery in Week40 (1124). The overall pattern suggests that ILI activity has remained relatively low but fluctuating as it stabilizes. For forecasting Week45, a plausible assumption is that the ILI occurrences will converge around a stable value near the recent observations.
2. Season Classification for Week45, 2021: Week45, 2021 belongs to the “Peak onset season.” According to background knowledge, the Peak onset season typically spans from Week35 to Week46, marked by the initial rise in influenza activity. While historical data from the past five weeks shows low circulation of influenza, Week45 lies within this period, where ILI activity may modestly increase as it transitions toward the peak season.
3. Correlation and Forecasting Process: Using past occurrences, averaging the most recent 5 weeks provides insight into likely ILI patterns. The mean of ['1305', '1189', '1064', '975', '1124'] is computed as follows:
4. (1305 + 1189 + 1064 + 975 + 1124) ÷ 5 = 1131.4 (approximately 1131).
5. This average can be adjusted for expected seasonal effects. Since Week45 is in the Peak onset season and past trends suggest stabilizing or slightly increasing ILI activity, a moderate increase must be added to reflect seasonal dynamics. Given the increase in Week40 to 1124 (from 975), an adjustment of ~5% aligns the predicted value with expected trends under stable conditions:
6. 1131 × 1.05 = 1187.55 (rounded to 1189).
4. CDC Reports Analysis:
1. Influenza virus circulation remains low across Weeks36-40 according to virologic data, with positivity rates consistently around 0.1%. However, other respiratory viruses (non-influenza) have contributed to ILI activity, particularly in regions including Region 7 (Week36 and Week39). This suggests the ILI trend may remain driven by non-influenza causes, supporting stable rather than significant surges.
2. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance reliability persists. Shifts in data accuracy, indicated in Weeks36-40, imply the need for conservative assumptions about a stable ILI pattern without drastic upward or downward swings.
3. Vaccination efforts highlighted by Week40 reports indicate a push for influenza vaccination by the season’s end (October), potentially dampening a steeper rise in ILI occurrences going into Peak onset season. However, as vaccination rates are yet unclear, only moderate effects are incorporated in the forecast.
5. Summary: The predicted ILI occurrences for Week45, 2021, are 1189, reflecting stabilization in ILI trends following the recent weeks' pattern. Week45 lies in the Peak onset season, where modest increases in activity are expected due to seasonal trends. The influence of low influenza circulation, non-influenza respiratory virus activity, and vaccination efforts were factored into the estimate, alongside adjustments for prior fluctuations.
