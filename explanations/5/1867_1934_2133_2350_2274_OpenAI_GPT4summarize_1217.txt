1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated an overall upward trend in Weeks 22–26, 2021, progressing from 1867 to a peak of 2350 in Week 25, followed by a slight decline to 2274 in Week 26. This general increase highlights rising respiratory illness activity over the observed period.
2. A clear correlation exists between the progressive rise in past ILI occurrences near the end of the observed period (Weeks 24 and 25, 2021) and the reported future occurrence of 3987 following 5 weeks. The steady escalation in Weeks 24 and 25 signals an increase in respiratory illness that likely contributed to the amplified ILI activity in the future week.
3. Continued stability of outpatient visits for ILI at 1.2% across Weeks 22–26, 2021, while below the baseline, reflects persistent respiratory illness activity, which, despite low influenza positivity, signals the potential accumulation of untracked or reported cases influencing the future increase.
4. Elevated percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed the epidemic thresholds, ranging from 7.5% in Week 22 to 6.2% in Week 26, 2021, with COVID-19 as the primary driver. Persistent PIC mortality indicates a heightened burden of respiratory illnesses, aligning with the reported future rise in ILI activity.
5. The complications in healthcare-seeking patterns and alternative care settings due to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighted across all reports, disrupted accurate ILI surveillance. These disruptions likely delayed case detection and aggregated data, compounding the increase in recorded cases reflected in the future occurrence of 3987.
6. Although influenza activity remained minimal, with negligible specimen positivity rates below 0.1% across Weeks 22–26, 2021, the interplay between ongoing COVID-19 circulation and behavioral changes likely masked or indirectly fueled increases in syndromic respiratory illness reporting, influencing future ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence of 3987 (Week 31, 2021) is explained by the upward trend in ILI occurrences in Weeks 24–25, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds throughout, disruptions in healthcare-seeking and data reporting caused by the ongoing pandemic, and the combined effect of low influenza positivity rates with heightened syndromic respiratory illness reporting.
