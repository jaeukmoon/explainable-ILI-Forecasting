1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent downward trend, with values of ['11262', '10723', '10765', '10580', '9823']. There was a sharp drop from 11262 (Week10, 2023) to 10723 (Week11, 2023), followed by a slight increase to 10765 (Week12, 2023), and a continuous decline to 9823 (Week14, 2023). This consistent decrease suggests reduced ILI activity across the observed period.
2. A negative correlation is present between the past and future ILI occurrences since the past time-series data (Week10–14, 2023) exhibited a steady decline, which resonates with the reduced future ILI occurrences of 9362 at Week19, 2023. The decreasing trend in prior weeks appears to forecast the lowering of ILI activity in Week19, 2023.
3. The outpatient visits for ILI consistently declined over the reporting weeks, starting at 2.4% (Week10, 2023), dropping to 2.3% (Week12–13, 2023), and further reducing to 2.1% (Week14, 2023). This decline below the national baseline correlates well with the decreased future ILI occurrences.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) showed a gradual decline, starting from 8.6% (Week10, 2023) and decreasing to 7.6% (Week14, 2023), though staying above threshold levels. This consistent reduction in PIC deaths aligns with the expected decline in future ILI occurrences.
5. The stability of antiviral susceptibility, the absence of significant mutations in circulating strains, and low nationwide influenza positivity rates (ranging from 0.8%-1.0% between Week10–14, 2023) minimized potential unexpected outbreaks, supporting the sustained downward trend in ILI occurrences. Additionally, the co-circulation of other viruses and strong vaccination efficacy contributed to the stalled flu activity.
6. In summary, the reported 9362 future ILI occurrences (Week19, 2023) are consistent with the observed downward trend in past time-series data from Week10–14, 2023, reduced outpatient visits below baseline levels, declining PIC mortality, and low influenza positivity rates with stable antiviral susceptibility, all of which collectively indicate a decrease in respiratory illness activity leading to reduced ILI occurrences in the future weeks.
