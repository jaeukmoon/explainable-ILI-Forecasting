1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1475', '1259', '1042', '883', '812'], steadily decreasing each week. This decline reflects a significant reduction in ILI activity, from 1475 in Week1, 2021, to 812 in Week 5, 2021, suggesting suppressed influenza transmission during this period.
2. The decline in the past 5 weeks shows a negative correlation with the future occurrence of 606 ILI cases in Week10, 2021. The continued downward trajectory from Week1 to Week5 supports the observed lower ILI activity after 5 weeks, reflecting a gradual continuation of reduced influenza-like illness transmission trends.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently declined over the weeks, dropping from 1.7% in Week1, 2021, to 1.1% in Week 5, 2021, and consistently staying below the national baseline of 2.6%. This reduction in ILI-related healthcare encounters aligns with the suppressed future ILI activity, contributing to the lower count of 606 cases.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained significantly elevated, ranging from 17.2% in Week1, 2021, to 25.0% in Week 5, 2021, but driven primarily by COVID-19 rather than influenza. This highlights the minimal contribution of true influenza illnesses to overall respiratory illness activity, consistent with the low future ILI number.
5. Persistently low respiratory specimen positivity rates, such as 0.4% in Week1, 2021, and plateauing at 0.1% in Weeks 2–5, further indicate minimal flu activity. This trend of limited influenza virus detection corresponds with the observed reduction in ILI occurrences over time and the low future count of 606 cases.
6. Continued impacts on ILI surveillance systems from the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted in Week1 to Week5, 2021, possibly disrupted accurate reporting and healthcare-seeking behaviors. These factors may partially mask or underestimate ILI occurrences; however, the steady decline in ILI activity aligns with the suppressed future 606 cases.
7. In summary, the reported 606 future ILI occurrences in Week10, 2021, are consistent with the overall downward trend in ILI occurrences in Weeks 1–5, declining outpatient ILI visits, persistently low respiratory virus positivity, and disruptions in influenza surveillance due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
