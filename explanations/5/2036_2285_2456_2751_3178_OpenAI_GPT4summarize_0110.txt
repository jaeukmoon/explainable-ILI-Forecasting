1. The ILI occurrences from Week30, 2021 to Week34, 2021 show a consistent upward trend: 2036, 2285, 2456, 2751, and 3178. This represents an average increase of approximately 286 cases per week, indicating a steady rise in ILI activity. There is no evidence of fluctuations or dips, signaling sustained growth during this period.
2. Forecasting Week39, 2021 aligns with the peak onset season, as it falls within the expected period of Week32 to Week46, when ILI activity typically starts climbing toward peak levels. Additionally, the consistent week-over-week increases support this classification.
3. From a time-series analysis, the steady upward trend in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks suggests a continuation of this growth. By projecting this increasing pattern forward over five weeks, a moderated case rise leads to a forecast of 2639 ILI occurrences. The slight deceleration relative to the recent increases could account for seasonal effects or intervening factors.
4. The increasing outpatient respiratory illness visits (Week30, 2021 #7; Week33, 2021 #2; Week34, 2021 #2) and rising trends for all age groups over the past few weeks (Week30, 2021 #1; Week33, 2021 #2; Week34, 2021 #2) indicate heightened activity, likely contributing to future growth in ILI cases.
5. Minimal influenza virus positivity (Week30, 2021 #5; Week32, 2021 #7; Week34, 2021 #1) means the increasing ILI cases are primarily driven by other respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) rather than influenza. This limits the potential for a substantial ILI spike but supports gradual increases.
6. Vaccination promotion continues but no noted changes in vaccination rates (Week31, 2021 #10; Week33, 2021 #7; Week34, 2021 #7). This steady vaccination impact may help moderate the increase in ILI occurrences but isn't enough to counter the consistent activity rise.
7. The projected ILI occurrence of 2639 reflects the ongoing rising trend observed in past occurrences, alignment with the peak onset season, and parallel influences of heightened respiratory illness activity driven by non-influenza viruses. These combined factors justify the steady increase toward Week39, 2021.
