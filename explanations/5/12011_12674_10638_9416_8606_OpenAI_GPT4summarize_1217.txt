1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks indicate a consistent downward trend with values of ['12011', '12674', '10638', '9416', '8606']. The decline began after an initial increase from 12011 (Week21, 2023) to 12674 (Week22, 2023), subsequently dropping sharply to 10638 in Week23, 2023, followed by steady decreases in Week24 (9416) and Week25 (8606). This sustained decline reflects diminishing ILI activity through the observed period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the consistently decreasing trend in the last three weeks of historical data (Weeks23–25, 2023) is followed by slightly higher future ILI occurrence (8705 in Week30, 2023). The slow rate of decline in the last week (Week25, 2023) suggests that ILI activity may have begun to stabilize and contributed to the future value reported.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI decreased steadily from 1.9% (Week21, 2023) to 1.4% (Week25, 2023), remaining below the national baseline. The highest rates were consistently observed among children aged 0-4 years, ranging from 6.1% (Week22, 2023) to 4.8% (Week25, 2023). This decline aligns with the downward trend in ILI activity during the historical period.
4. Persistent contributions of co-circulating respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, influenced ILI trends across this period, as these pathogens may have exacerbated total respiratory illness activity. Co-circulation remained a confounding factor in accurately attributing ILI changes solely to influenza.
5. PIC deaths consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, fluctuating from 7.0% (Week21, 2023) to 6.2% (Week25, 2023), indicating sustained respiratory illness mortality beyond influenza-specific impacts. This persistent burden suggests overlapping drivers of respiratory illness that could lead to stable or elevated ILI activity in the following weeks.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 8705 (Week30, 2023) reflect the influence of a sustained downward trend in past ILI occurrences, a stabilization sign in Week25, co-circulation with other respiratory viruses, and persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds. These factors collectively mitigated the rate of decline and contributed to the eventual ILI occurrence value.
