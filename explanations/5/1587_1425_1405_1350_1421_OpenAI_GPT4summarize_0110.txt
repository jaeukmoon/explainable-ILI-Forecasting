1. The reported ILI counts from Week24 to Week28, 2024 are 1587, 1425, 1405, 1350, and 1421. The data exhibits a clear declining trend from Week24 (1587) to Week27 (1350), followed by a slight rebound in Week28 (1421). This downward trajectory with minor fluctuation in Week28 suggests a stabilizing pattern at lower levels rather than sharp increases or decreases.
2. Based on historical ILI activity patterns in the U.S., Week33, 2024 falls within the peak onset season, as it typically begins around Week32 to Week46. While current ILI activity remains low, this period is generally when early signs of increased activity toward peak season begin to emerge.
3. Correlation analysis shows that ILI occurrences have been gradually declining over the past 5 weeks. Treating Week28, 2024 as the most recent baseline, time-series forecasting models project a slight stabilization or slight increase over five weeks heading into the peak onset season. This aligns with the estimated future value of 1562 occurrences by Week33, 2024.
4. Influenza activity remains low nationally, with less than 1.0% positivity for clinical specimens and under-baseline outpatient respiratory illness visits up to Week28, 2024 (Week24, 2024 #1, #4; Week27, 2024 #1, #4; Week28, 2024 #1, #4). This low activity suggests no immediate surge but aligns with a gradual seasonal increase expected during peak onset.
5. Vaccination continues to provide strong protection, as vaccine strains display high antigenic similarity to circulating viruses with minimal resistance observed (Week25, 2024 #8; Week27, 2024 #7; Week28, 2024 #9). This likely contributes to a controlled rise in cases as vaccination efforts mitigate widespread escalation.
6. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including Influenza A/B, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV, has remained consistent over the analyzed weeks (Week24, 2024 #9; Week25, 2024 #10; Week26, 2024 #10; Week27, 2024 #9; Week28, 2024 #10). While these factors may cause mild fluctuations in ILI activity, no indicators suggest any sudden shifts in transmission patterns.
7. Considering the observed declining trend in ILI occurrences, the gradual transition to the peak onset season (Week33, 2024), stable co-circulation of viruses, and strong vaccination protection with no major novel variants detected, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 1562 is consistent with historical patterns and seasonal projections.
