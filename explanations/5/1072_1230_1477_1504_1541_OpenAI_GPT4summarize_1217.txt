1. The past time-series ILI occurrences showed an overall upward trend over the 5 weeks, with values transitioning from 1072 (Week 28, 2021) to 1541 (Week 32, 2021). The data demonstrates a steady increase, with significant jumps such as from 1230 (Week 29, 2021) to 1477 (Week 30, 2021) and smaller increments thereafter. This continuous rise highlights growing respiratory illness activity over the observed period.
2. The upward trend in past ILI occurrences from Week 28 to Week 32, 2021, is positively correlated with the future ILI occurrences of 1887 after 5 weeks (Week 37, 2021). The consistent rise in weeks leading up to Week 32 acts as a precursor to the elevated activity observed in Week 37, 2021.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily increased over the 5 weeks, climbing from 1.3% in Week 28, 2021, to 2.1% in Week 32, 2021. This rise in healthcare encounters strongly correlates with the future increase to 1887 ILI occurrences.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) rose consistently across the 5 weeks, from 7.1% in Week 28, 2021, to 14.6% in Week 32, 2021, far above epidemic thresholds. Although COVID-19 dominated these figures, the persistence of high PIC levels aligns with the future heightened ILI activity.
5. The impact of alternative healthcare-seeking behaviors, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, complicated traditional surveillance and reporting. This disruption likely contributed to delayed recognition or clustering of ILI cases, amplifying the future increase to 1887 occurrences.
6. Despite minimal virologic influenza activity reported, the increase in ILI visits and respiratory illness trends suggest a rise in non-specific respiratory illnesses or other pathogens like COVID-19 driving the increase. Behavioral changes and overlapping symptoms further compounded future ILI reporting.
7. In summary, the future 1887 ILI occurrences (Week 37, 2021) are attributed to the sustained upward trend in past ILI occurrences, rising outpatient visits for ILI, persistently high PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-induced shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance limitations.
