1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent decline from '12014' (Week22, 2024) to '9910' (Week24, 2024) but then experienced a slight increase through '9946' (Week25, 2024) and '10087' (Week26, 2024). This trajectory indicates an initial decrease in ILI activity, followed by a stabilization and modest uptrend in the latter weeks of the period.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 10927 show a positive correlation with the slight upward trend observed in the last two weeks of past data. The increase from '9946' (Week25, 2024) to '10087' (Week26, 2024) suggests a gradual revival of ILI activity, which aligns with the reported future rise.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily declined from 1.9% (Week22, 2024) to 1.4% (Week26, 2024), remaining below baseline and indicating low overall activity. However, the co-circulation of respiratory viruses (influenza, COVID-19, RSV) and low influenza positivity in lab tests (e.g., 1.0% in Week26, 2024) suggest non-influenza ILI drivers contributed to the future increase.
4. Minimal influenza-attributed deaths (stable at 0.1% through Weeks22–25, 2024) and low hospitalization rates (e.g., 0.1–0.2 per 100,000) persisted across the observed weeks. Despite this, sporadic reports of novel strains (e.g., H5N1 in Week26, 2024) and regional variations in virus circulation, combined with co-circulating respiratory viruses, likely underpinned non-influenza ILI trends contributing to the reported spike.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 10927 (Week31, 2024) can be attributed to the slight rebound in past ILI trends during Weeks25–26, 2024, the influence of co-circulating non-influenza respiratory viruses, sporadic detections of novel influenza strains, and the observed stabilization of outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses below baseline activity.
