1. The ILI occurrences from Week10 to Week14, 2022, show a steady increase: 1701, 1940, 2032, 2021, and 2096. Although there is a slight decline in Week13 (2021), the overall pattern is upward, reflecting a consistent growth trend in reported cases. This suggests increasing ILI activity leading up to the target Week19, 2022.
2. Week19, 2022 is part of the off-season as it falls well outside the typical peak season (Week46 to Week6). However, Week19 of certain years (including 2022) is recognized as an atypical secondary peak during the usual off-season, which aligns with the higher-than-expected activity indicated by the forecast occurrence.
3. Historical ILI trends along with CDC reports show consistent weekly increases in ILI occurrences over the last five weeks, with no indication of significant stabilization or decline. Projecting forward, this upward trajectory suggests further growth in Week19, 2022 to reach the forecast 2360, reflecting the sustained seasonal anomaly at this time of the year.
4. Influenza positivity rates increased consistently, from 6.8% in Week10, 2022 to 8.4% in Week14, 2022, predominantly Influenza A (Week10, 2022 #2; Week11, 2022 #1; Week14, 2022 #2), indicating ongoing transmission and contributing to rising ILI activity.
5. Vaccination uptake remains recommended but shows limited effect in curbing A(H3N2) activity due to antigenic mismatches (Week10, 2022 #9; Week14, 2022 #8). This partial mismatch with the vaccine further supports the rising ILI cases despite vaccination promotion.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, adds complexity to interpreting ILI trends but likely contributes to the upward ILI trajectory (Week10, 2022 #12; Week12, 2022 #9; Week14, 2022 #12).
7. The steady rise in ILI cases, peak-like activity during Week19, 2022 in an off-season context, increased positivity rates, and contributing factors like vaccine mismatch and co-circulating respiratory viruses justify the projected 2360 occurrences for Week19, 2022.
