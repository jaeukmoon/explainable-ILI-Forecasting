1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week47 to Week51, 2020 are 2066, 2064, 2078, 2222, and 1994. The trend indicates a slight increase from Week47 (2066) to Week49 (2078) followed by a sharp rise in Week50 (2222), then a notable decline in Week51 (1994). Overall, this reveals mild fluctuations with a brief peak in Week50 before the decline in Week51. This irregular pattern suggests that ILI occurrences could remain slightly variable.
2. Week3, 2021 falls within the peak season since the typical peak season in the U.S. spans from Week46 through about Week6. The previous weeks, such as Week47 to Week51, 2020, fall within the early and progressing phases of the peak season, supporting the classification of Week3, 2021 as part of the peak season.
3. The time-series trends indicate mild fluctuations around a consistent range of values. The spike in Week50 combined with the reduction in Week51 indicates irregularity. Projecting forward from Week51, 2020 while considering the peak season, the ILI occurrences for Week3, 2021 could stabilize at a level slightly lower than the Week50 peak but above the Week51 dip, resulting in the predicted occurrence of 2118.
4. Unusually low influenza activity has persisted nationwide for Weeks47 to Week51, 2020, with positivity rates remaining below 0.3% throughout this period (Week47, 2020 #1, Week48, 2020 #1, Week49, 2020 #1, Week50, 2020 #1, Week51, 2020 #1). This suggests no strong surge in ILI or influenza outbreaks.
5. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to influence healthcare-seeking behavior and overall ILI data reliability (Week47, 2020 #6, Week48, 2020 #8, Week50, 2020 #10, Week51, 2020 #8). This overlap potentially skews patterns in ILI activity, making true increases in influenza difficult to ascertain.
6. CDC's expectations emphasize potential increases in influenza activity during upcoming months despite the currently low levels (Week47, 2020 #10, Week48, 2020 #9, Week50, 2020 #11). This aligns with the continued vigilance needed during the peak season.
7. Considering the slightly fluctuating ILI trend, classifications as part of the peak season, ongoing low flu activity with potential upward adjustments, and pandemic-related behavior shifts, the projected ILI occurrence of 2118 for Week3, 2021 reflects a stabilization within a slightly elevated range typical for peak-season weeks.
