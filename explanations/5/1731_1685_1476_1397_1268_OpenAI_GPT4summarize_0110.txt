1. The ILI occurrences from Week22 to Week26, 2024 show a consistent downward trend: 1731, 1685, 1476, 1397, and 1268. This data reflects a steady decline in activity, with no significant spikes or anomalies. Based on these figures, there is a clear reduction in ILI activity over the five-week period.
2. Week31, 2024 falls within the off-season. Historically, off-season spans from Week9 through Week30 or Week31 in the U.S. (Background Knowledge). With ongoing low ILI activity, the off-season classification aligns with observations in Weeks22 through 26, 2024.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the consistent decrease in ILI counts over the past five weeks suggests a continued downward trend with lower activity expected over the next five weeks. This steady decline projects a value of 830 occurrences for Week31, 2024, consistent with the historical off-season pattern.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses like influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV continues but with minimal activity nationally. In Week26, 2024, outpatient respiratory illness visits were at 1.4%, below baseline, indicating limited ILI contributions from viral co-circulation.
5. Vaccination trends are not extensively detailed in the past CDC reports (Week22 to Week26, 2024), but vaccine matching remains high. Most circulating viruses show strong genetic similarity to vaccine components with low resistance, enhancing the vaccine's protective efficacy through Week31, 2024.
6. Surveillance data shows influenza positivity is decreasing nationwide: 1.8% in Week22, 1.6% in Week23, 1.4% in Week24, 1.1% in Week25, and 1.0% in Week26, 2024. Minimal flu positivity suggests continued off-season activity and aligns with the projected low ILI occurrences in Week31, 2024.
7. The forecast of 830 occurrences for Week31, 2024 reflects the off-season timing, declining ILI trends, the vaccine's strong match with circulating strains, and the consistently low co-circulation of respiratory viruses. Together, these factors support a further decline in ILI activity.
