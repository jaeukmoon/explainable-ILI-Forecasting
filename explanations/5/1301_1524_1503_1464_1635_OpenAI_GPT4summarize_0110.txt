1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week37 to Week41, 2023 were 1301, 1524, 1503, 1464, and 1635. This data indicates a moderate but steady rise in ILI occurrences overall, with a minor dip in Week40 (1464) followed by another rise in Week41 (1635). Such patterns suggest a gradual approach toward increasing flu activity as the season progresses, aligning with seasonal expectations.
2. Forecasting Week46, 2023 aligns with the peak onset season. According to health data trends and historical contexts in U.S. influenza tracking, Week46 typically falls within the window when influenza activity begins to sharply rise, preceding the peak season.
3. From a time series perspective, the increasing trend toward Week41, 2023, coupled with knowledge of peak onset season occurring in this timeline, indicates an upward trajectory in ILI counts toward Week46. Historical influenza patterns project that future weeks could see a steeper increase based on compounding seasonal effects and respiratory illness co-movements, leading to the forecasted ILI occurrence of 3350.
4. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, remains a significant contributor to overall ILI numbers. While these pathogens vary geographically, their presence exerts additional strain on populations during this period (Week37–Week41, 2023 #9; Week38, 2023 #8; Week39, 2023 #7).
5. Flu vaccination levels, while emphasized in CDC communications, have not shown notable increases (Week37–Week41, 2023 #8). This potential lag in uptake may result in less widespread immunity as the influenza season intensifies, contributing to higher ILI cases.
6. Outpatient ILI visit rates have consistently hovered just below the national baseline (Week37–Week41, 2023 #6, #3, #4). However, the incremental rises in rates (2.0% in Week37 to 2.3% in Week41) suggest an early seasonal increase, mirroring the anticipated start of more widespread flu transmission.
7. In summary, the projected ILI occurrence of 3350 for Week46, 2023 can be attributed to the rising trend in ILI occurrences leading up to Week41, the classification of Week46 within the peak onset season, and key CDC-reported factors such as co-circulation of viruses, moderate vaccination activity, and outpatient visit increments. These factors collectively indicate an anticipated significant increase in flu activity.
