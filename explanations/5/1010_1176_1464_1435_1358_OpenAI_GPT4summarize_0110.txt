1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week12 to Week16, 2021, are 1010, 1176, 1464, 1435, and 1358. The trend demonstrates a steady increase from Week12 (1010) to Week14 (1464), indicating a rise in ILI activity. However, there is a slight decline from Week14 to Week16, dropping to 1358. Overall, this pattern suggests a general increase early in the period, followed by a mild reduction, reflecting minor fluctuations in ILI levels.
2. Considering the seasonal classification for Week21, 2021, it falls well outside the typical peak season. The off-season, running from weeks after the peak through the peak onset period, aligns with the ongoing low influenza activity described in Weeks12–16, 2021. Hence, Week21, 2021, is classified as part of the off-season.
3. From the time-series perspective, the initial increase in ILI occurrences between Week12 and Week14 reflects a growing trend, but the subsequent decrease in Week15 and Week16 suggests a stabilization or mild drop. Projecting forward to Week21, 2021, the trajectory indicates a moderate rebound aligning with seasonal norms during the off-season, leading to a forecast of 1789 occurrences.
4. Influenza positivity remains below 0.1% in clinical testing during Weeks12–16, 2021 (Week12, 2021 #1; Week15, 2021 #1; Week16, 2021 #1), with all jurisdictions reporting minimal ILI activity and no significant rises (Week12, 2021 #5; Week16, 2021 #9).
5. Vaccination trends were stable across Weeks12–16, 2021. The CDC emphasizes flu vaccination as a preventive measure, but no significant increase in coverage was reported (Week12, 2021 #9; Week14, 2021 #10; Week15, 2021 #10). This stable protective factor likely contributes to the absence of a sharp rise in ILI data.
6. COVID-19's continued impact remains significant, influencing ILI patterns through overlaps in respiratory illness behaviors, and healthcare-seeking changes (Week13, 2021 #8; Week14, 2021 #11; Week16, 2021 #9). However, this further supports consistent low ILI activity rather than significant spikes during this time.
7. Based on a combination of stabilized vaccination coverage, persistently low influenza positivity, and the pattern of minimal ILI activity influenced by ongoing COVID-19 trends, the forecasted ILI occurrences of 1789 for Week21, 2021, reflect a plausible continuation of this low-level fluctuation during the off-season.
