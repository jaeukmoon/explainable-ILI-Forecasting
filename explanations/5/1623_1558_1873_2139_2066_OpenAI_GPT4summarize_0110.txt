1. The reported ILI counts from Week43 to Week47, 2020 are 1623, 1558, 1873, 2139, and 2066. The data shows an increasing trend from Week43 (1623) to Week46 (2139), with a minor dip in Week47 (2066). This indicates a slight upward trajectory with some fluctuations toward the latter weeks.
2. Based on historical U.S. patterns, Week52 (target week for None) falls within the peak season. The slight increase in ILI trends in recent weeks and CDC observations of potential flu activity increases (Week46, 2020 #9; Week47, 2020 #10) support the classification of the target week in the peak season.
3. The ongoing upwards trend observed up to Week46, 2020 aligns with typical seasonal influenza surges heading into peak season. The moderate fluctuations at Week47, 2020 do not suggest a significant deviation, indicating continuity in the trend. Projecting this historical pattern forward, we estimate ILI occurrences to stabilize slightly higher over the next five weeks, reaching 2028 by None.
4. Influenza activity remains low overall, with positivity rates of 0.2% to 0.7% in respiratory specimens (Week43, 2020 #1; Week46, 2020 #1; Week47, 2020 #1).
5. Vaccination uptake is emphasized to mitigate severe flu outcomes, but no specific increase in coverage has been reported over the past five weeks (Week43, 2020 #8; Week44, 2020 #8; Week47, 2020 #8). This may limit further suppression of ILI activity.
6. COVID-19's ongoing impact on healthcare-seeking behaviors complicates ILI surveillance accuracy. However, the CDC anticipates potential flu activity to rise as the season progresses (Week46, 2020 #9; Week47, 2020 #10).
7. The projected ILI occurrence of 2028 for None reflects the slight rising trend in data, seasonality classified as peak season, and CDC-anticipated activity increases. Minimal influenza positivity and vaccine uptake indicate moderate growth rather than a sharp spike nearing the season's peak.
