1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating downward trend overall, with values of ['1362', '1453', '1529', '1419', '1284']. After an initial increase from 1362 (Week10, 2023) to the peak of 1529 (Week12, 2023), there was a notable decline to 1284 by Week14, 2023. This overall decrease indicates a reduction in reported respiratory illness activity by the end of the 5-week observation period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the declining trend observed toward the latter weeks of the past data (Weeks13–14, 2023) aligns with the reported drop to 1070 future occurrences by Week19, 2023. The consistent decrease in ILI occurrences in Weeks13 and 14 serves as a precursor to the diminished activity observed 5 weeks later.
3. During Week12–14, outpatient visits for ILI averaged around 2.3%-2.1%, remaining below the national baseline of 2.5%. This sustained stability and gradual decline in outpatient visits suggest a diminishing trend in overall respiratory illness, correlating with future ILI occurrences of 1070.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) steadily declined from 8.3% in Week12, 2023, to 7.6% in Week14, 2023, though remaining slightly above epidemic thresholds. This downward trend reflects reduced severe respiratory illness activity, contributing to lower future ILI occurrences.
5. Minimal lab positivity for influenza, consistently below 1.0% across Weeks10-14, 2023, along with ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens (e.g., SARS-CoV-2), suggests limited influenza contributions to ILI cases. This low virologic activity likely contributed to the reduction in ILI occurrences to 1070 in the future.
6. In summary, the reported 1070 future ILI occurrences (Week19, 2023) are aligned with the declining trend observed in Weeks13-14, 2023, decreasing outpatient visits and PIC-related deaths, and persistently low influenza positivity rates. These converging factors explain the reduction in respiratory illness activity observed after 5 weeks.
