1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an upward trend with values of ['1551', '1757', '1933', '1816', '2040']. From Week5, 2022 (1551) to Week6, 2022 (1757), there was a sharp rise, followed by an increase to 1933 in Week7, 2022. While Week8, 2022 saw a slight drop to 1816, the occurrences rebounded to 2040 in Week9, 2022, the highest in this period. This overall rising pattern indicates escalating ILI activity, particularly toward the latter weeks.
2. A strong positive correlation is evident between the upward trajectory in past occurrences and the future ILI count (4751) after 5 weeks. The significant rise from Week8, 2022 (1816) to Week9, 2022 (2040) likely serves as a precursor to the amplified activity observed after 5 weeks, reflecting a continuation of increasing trends in ILI occurrences.
3. The percentage of clinical specimens testing positive for influenza gradually increased from 2.0% (Week5, 2022) to 5.8% (Week9, 2022), reflecting rising influenza activity nationwide. Additionally, hospitalization rates steadily climbed from 4.5 per 100,000 (Week5, 2022) to 5.5 per 100,000 (Week9, 2022), consistently indicating heightened severity in respiratory illnesses. The antigenic differences in dominant Influenza A(H3N2) viruses compared to vaccine strains likely reduced vaccine effectiveness, further contributing to increased ILI activity culminating in the reported future value.
4. Elevated PIC mortality remained above the epidemic threshold during all 5 weeks, starting at 26.3% (Week5, 2022) and progressively declining to 13.1% (Week9, 2022). While COVID-19 drove most PIC deaths, the consistently high PIC percentages highlight ongoing respiratory illness challenges that align with the rising ILI trends observed.
5. Lower flu vaccination coverage compared to previous seasons, reported consistently across the 5 weeks, may have compounded susceptibility to influenza A(H3N2) and contributed to increased transmission. The co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory viruses, documented in all weeks, potentially exacerbated healthcare burdens and respiratory illness trends.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 4751 (Week14, 2022) are attributable to the observed upward trend in ILI activity during Weeks 5–9, 2022, rising influenza positivity rates, increased hospitalization rates, high PIC mortality, low vaccine coverage, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and ongoing antigenic mismatches in H3N2 viruses. These factors collectively drive the sharp escalation in ILI occurrences.
