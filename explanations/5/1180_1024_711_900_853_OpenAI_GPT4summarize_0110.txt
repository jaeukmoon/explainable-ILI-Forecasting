1. The reported ILI occurrences during Week24 to Week28, 2022 are 1180, 1024, 711, 900, and 853. The trend shows a significant decline from Week24 (1180) to Week26 (711), followed by a slight recovery in Week27 (900) and stabilization in Week28 (853). This overall decline with mild stabilization suggests a decreasing pattern transitioning toward baseline activity.
2. Forecasting for Week33, 2022 categorizes it within the peak onset season. Typically, Week33 falls during the initial phase of increasing ILI activity, as it follows the U.S. off-season and approaches the buildup to the peak season starting around Week46.
3. The time-series data indicates a declining trend from Week24 to Week26, followed by stabilization during Week27 and Week28. Projecting forward, the stabilization hints at a gradual increase in ILI activity as the season transitions toward peak onset. Based on this historical trend, a moderate rise is anticipated over the following five weeks, culminating in 845 occurrences by Week33, 2022.
4. Influenza activity remained low and consistent across Week25 to Week28, with positive clinical specimen percentages dropping from 1.8% in Week25 to 0.7% in Week28. Although low, a slight increase in activity is expected as the season progresses toward the peak onset phase (Week25, 2022 #1; Week28, 2022 #1).
5. Co-circulation of respiratory pathogens like RSV and SARS-CoV-2, combined with altered healthcare behaviors post-COVID-19 pandemic, confounds influenza trends but does not currently signal a significant driver of influenza-related increases (Week26, 2022 #10; Week27, 2022 #10; Week28, 2022 #8).
6. Vaccination updates are absent in these reports, and minimal influenza activity has persisted nationwide. However, with the typical seasonal cycle in mind, influenza-related hospitalizations and ILI percentages are likely to rise modestly (Week24, 2022 #9; Week26, 2022 #10; Week28, 2022 #7).
7. The combination of a declining yet stabilizing trend, an expected transition to peak onset, low positivity rates with co-circulating respiratory pathogens, and historical seasonal patterns supports the projection of 845 ILI occurrences for Week33, 2022.
