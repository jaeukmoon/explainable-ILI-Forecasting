1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited fluctuations with an overall trend of slight irregularity. The values progressed as ['1222', '1601', '1783', '1687', '1639'], showing a peak at 1783 in Week35, 2021, occurring alongside noticeable increases particularly in Weeks34-35. A decline followed in Weeks36-37, dipping to 1639. This volatility in ILI activity suggests the influence of multiple factors steering the weekly variances.
2. The decline in ILI cases during Weeks36-37, 2021, after reaching a peak in Week35, 2021, aligns with the reported future occurrences of 1785. This figure surpasses the Week37 count (1639) yet closely echoes Week35 values (1783), suggesting a potential rebound influenced by temporary decreases in interim weeks. Correlation between preceding outbreaks and subsequent levels remains moderate as fluctuations stabilize toward values near peak activity.
3. Outpatient ILI visits reported as 2.3% in Week36 and 2.1% in Week37, consistently remained below the national 2.6% baseline throughout the 5-week period while reflecting ongoing modest increases in non-influenza respiratory illnesses. This stabilization serves as an indicator for the 5-week-ahead projection of 1785 occurrences.
4. Persistently high percentages of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) from 17.2% (Week33, 2021) to 21.1% (Week37, 2021), well above the epidemic threshold (approx. 5.4%), indirectly parallel the elevated respiratory burden. Meanwhile, COVID-19 remains the driver, complicating ILI estimation yet reflecting heightened activity that potentially contributed to the reported ILI figures.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and disrupted reporting due to the COVID-19 pandemic, explicitly noted in all CDC summaries, introduce inherent volatility and underestimation in traditional ILI surveillance. These disruptions compounded by increased circulation of non-influenza viruses have likely skewed and delayed the accurate scaling of ILI cases contributing to the eventual future surge to 1785.
6. Despite influenza virus circulation remaining consistently low, with positivity rates around 0.1% across clinical lab settings and minimal hospitalizations reported, the increasing contribution of non-specific respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 has been repeatedly emphasized. This interplay of factors helps explain the resurgence to 1785 after 5 weeks.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences reaching 1785 (Week42, 2021) are attributed to fluctuations observed in Week35, 2021, stabilizing ILI outpatient trends below baselines, persistent respiratory burdens reflected in PIC mortality far exceeding thresholds, and compounded impacts of pandemic-disrupted reporting fuelling non-influenza respiratory illness trends.
