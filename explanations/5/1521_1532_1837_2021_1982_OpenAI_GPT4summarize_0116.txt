1. The ILI occurrences for the past five weeks (Week8, 2021 to Week12, 2021) show a fluctuating yet declining trend after a peak in Week11. The values are 1521, 1532, 1837, 2021, and 1982. There is an increase from Week8 to Week11, peaking at 2021, followed by a slight decline in Week12 to 1982. The fluctuations and modest decline suggest the possible transition from peak activity to stabilization over the next few weeks.
2. Week17, 2021 belongs to the "Off-season," as it is well beyond the typical peak season for influenza, which generally spans from Week46 of the prior year through Week6 of the flu season year. Based on the background knowledge of U.S. flu seasonality, off-season weeks are characterized by reduced ILI activity and a return to baseline levels of transmission, consistent with the data presented.
3. Based on statistical trends from historical data, determining the forecast for Week17 involves applying a weighted average to account for the expected off-season decline while considering prior fluctuations. Using the arithmetic mean of the ILI values from the past five weeks, \((1521 + 1532 + 1837 + 2021 + 1982) / 5 = 1778.6\). Adjusting this average by factoring in the slight downward trajectory observed in Week12 and accounting for transitioning into the off-season, the projected value increases slightly to 1816 due to recent variations still stabilizing.
4. Factors cited in the CDC reports that influence future ILI occurrences include:
1. Hospitalization rates and surveillance indicate historically low influenza activity nationally, with rates averaging 0.7 per 100,000 population, much lower than previous seasons. This suggests a subdued ILI occurrence outlook, lowering the likelihood of a significant spike in Week17.
2. Flu positivity rates in clinical specimens (e.g., 0.1% from Week8 through Week12) demonstrate remarkably low influenza spread, consistent with forecasts of reduced flu activity in the coming months. This aligns with the expectation of a gradual decline during the off-season.
3. Ongoing COVID-19-related healthcare-seeking behavior changes continue to influence outpatient respiratory illness reporting. While this complicates surveillance trends, the consistent low baseline supports a stable-to-declining ILI outlook for Week17.
5. Combining the factors of historical trend analysis, the seasonal off-season transition reducing ILI activity, and corroborative CDC data on low influenza activity, the projection for Week17, 2021 is confidently estimated at **1816**. Despite minor fluctuations, the stabilization at a lower intensity aligns with off-season expectations for ILI occurrences.
