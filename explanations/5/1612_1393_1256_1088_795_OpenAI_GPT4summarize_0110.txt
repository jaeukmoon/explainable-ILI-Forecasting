1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week14 to Week18, 2024 are 1612, 1393, 1256, 1088, and 795. The data indicates a steady decline over these weeks, demonstrating a consistently decreasing trend without fluctuations or spikes, suggesting a downward trajectory in ILI activity.
2. Week23, 2024 falls well within the off-season, as the typical peak season ends by Week6, and Week9 to Week30 represents the off-season in the U.S. Furthermore, all key indicators such as influenza positivity, hospitalization rates, and outpatient visits are in pronounced decline (Week14, 2024 #1; Week15, 2024 #1-#3; Week18, 2024 #1, #3), further confirming the off-season classification for Week23, 2024.
3. Time-series analysis of past trends shows a consistent decline in ILI occurrences weekly, dropping from 1612 (Week14, 2024) to 795 (Week18, 2024). This pattern suggests that by Week23, 2024, the decline would likely stabilize at a minimal level characteristic of the off-season. The projected occurrence of 449 aligns with the continuation of this decay trend.
4. Influenza activity has decreased substantially nationwide. Influenza positivity dropped from 7.7% in Week14, 2024 to 3.1% in Week18, 2024, with all U.S. regions reporting activity below baseline (Week14, 2024 #10; Week18, 2024 #1, #9).
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 persists but has not spurred an increase in ILI cases. This emphasizes that the overall ILI burden remains low (Week14, 2024 #8; Week17, 2024 #7; Week18, 2024 #10).
6. Vaccines remain well-matched to circulating strains with no significant vaccine effectiveness issues noted across the surveillance reports during this period (Week14, 2024 #7; Week15, 2024 #9; Week18, 2024 #7-#8). This, combined with declining flu activity and high vaccine effectiveness, supports the prediction of reduced ILI occurrences.
7. Based on a consistently declining trend in ILI activity, the off-season timing of Week23, 2024, the protective effects of vaccination, and reduced positivity rates, the predicted ILI occurrence of 449 is justified as reflective of continued minimal community influenza transmission.
