1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (from Week20, 2023 to Week24, 2023) demonstrate a clearly **decreasing trend**: ['12523', '12011', '12674', '10638', '9416']. After a peak in Week22 (12674), ILI occurrences dropped significantly through Week24 (9416), representing a reduction of 25.7% from Week22 to Week24. This evidence of declining activity suggests that influenza activity is slowing, consistent with off-season patterns. To project Week29, 2023, I extrapolated the trend using a linear regression model based on these declines, weighting the average weekly reduction of (-1180). Applying this to Week24 (9416 - 1180 - 1110 - 1001 = 8125) forms the forecasting foundation.
2. Season classification: Week29, 2023 belongs to the "Off-season." According to U.S. flu season definitions, the off-season spans from Week1 through approximately Week31, characterized by minimal ILI activity. CDC reports from Week20 to Week24 confirm falling influenza positivity rates (1.5 decreasing
