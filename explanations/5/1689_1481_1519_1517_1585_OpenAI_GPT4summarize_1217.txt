1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating pattern with a slight upward tendency, evidenced by values of ['1689', '1481', '1519', '1517', '1585']. After an initial decline from 1689 (Week6, 2021) to 1481 (Week7, 2021), the occurrences displayed minor variability but gradually increased toward 1585 (Week10, 2021), indicating the potential for more pronounced growth in the subsequent weeks.
2. A notable correlation exists between the observed past ILI occurrences and the future count of 2066. The slight upward adjustment in occurrences in Weeks 9 and 10, 2021, foreshadows a larger increase, with the future spike likely being a delayed consequence of the trends noted in the latter weeks of the past series.
3. Weekly reports reveal stable outpatient ILI visit rates, averaging 0.8%-1.1%, with slight increases in children aged 0-4 years across Weeks 6-10, 2021. These incremental changes signal underlying conditions that could drive future ILI increases. Elevated deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), consistently above the epidemic threshold (e.g., 22.3% in Week6 decreasing to 13.3% in Week10, 2021), reflect heightened respiratory illness, indirectly signaling the potential for rising ILI cases. Lastly, disruptions to ILI surveillance and care-seeking behaviors due to COVID-19 during this period contribute to unpredictable reporting, possibly intensifying ILI detection in future data.
4. In summary, the reported future 2066 ILI occurrences (Week15, 2021) correspond to the slight upward trend in the past ILI data, evidenced by Weeks 9-10, 2021, the increasing ILI-related outpatient visits among young children, the sustained elevated PIC mortality as an indicator of respiratory illnesses, and the compounded effects of pandemic-related influences on reporting and healthcare behaviors.
