1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an initial rise, followed by a gradual decline towards stabilization, with values of ['1170', '1239', '1301', '1285', '1243']. From Week 28, 2022, to Week 30, 2022, there was a clear upward trend reaching the peak at 1301 (Week 30, 2022). However, a subsequent decline to 1243 in Week 32, 2022, suggests a temporary tapering off. This overall pattern reflects oscillating but elevated ILI activity.

2. The stabilization around high ILI occurrences in Weeks 30–32, 2022, aligns with future ILI occurrences of 1946, indicating a positive correlation. The consistently elevated values near the end of the 5-week period (Weeks 31–32, 2022) likely played a role in setting the stage for the reported future rise.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained at 1.6% for Weeks 28–30, 2022, before declining slightly to 1.5% (Week 31, 2022) and 1.4% (Week 32, 2022). However, notably high rates among children aged 0–4 (e.g., 6.5% in Week 28 and 5.9% in Week 32) suggest significant pediatric contributions to ILI activity that may have reinforced future occurrences.

4. Elevated percentages of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) persisted above the epidemic threshold throughout the 5-week period, ranging from 9.5% in Week 28, 2022, to 10.0% in Weeks 30–31, 2022. This reflects high concurrent respiratory disease burden, which is linked to amplified ILI case reporting and aligns with the increase to 1946.

5. The co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens, particularly SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, which is explicitly emphasized in every weekly report, may have exacerbated overall respiratory illness trends. These interactions likely created a conducive environment for increased ILI occurrences.

6. In summary, the reported 1946 future ILI occurrences can be attributed to the sustained high plateau of ILI occurrences toward Weeks 31–32, 2022, the significant pediatric outpatient visit contributions, elevated PIC mortality consistently above epidemic thresholds, and the compounding impacts of co-circulating respiratory viruses.
