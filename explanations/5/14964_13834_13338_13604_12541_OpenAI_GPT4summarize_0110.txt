1. The observed ILI counts from Week12 to Week16, 2024, show a steadily decreasing trend: 14964, 13834, 13338, 13604, and 12541. Despite a slight uptick in Week15 (13604), the trend primarily indicates a consistent decline, signaling reduced influenza activity as flu season winds down.
2. The target week (Week21, 2024) falls well after the typical peak season (Week46 of 2023 through Week6 of 2024) and lies within the off-season. Indicators such as decreasing positivity rates, declining outpatient visits, and a stable or reduced ILI burden align with forecasts of minimal ILI activity typical of the off-season.
3. Time-series analysis suggests a continuation of the declining trend from Week12 to Week16, 2024. By Week16, the ILI activity has fallen significantly (12541), correlating with tapering flu activity. Projecting five weeks ahead, the consistent downtrend indicates a moderate additional reduction, aligning with the forecast of 12688 ILI occurrences by Week21.
4. Nationwide influenza activity displays a clear downward trajectory, with respiratory specimens testing positive declining from 10.5% in Week12 to 4.8% in Week16 (Week12 #1; Week16 #1), reflecting waning flu prevalence, consistent with forecasted reductions in ILI occurrences.
5. Vaccination efforts remain robust, with current vaccines showing excellent alignment with circulating strains (Week14 #7; Week15 #9). Antiviral resistance remains low (Week13 #10), further contributing to reduced ILI occurrences as treatment and prevention strategies mitigate influenza severity.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as COVID-19, RSV, and others persists but has not spurred significant surges in ILI counts (Week12 #8; Week13 #11; Week14 #8). Combined with declining flu-specific positivity and hospitalization declines, this co-circulation appears to exert minimal additive impact on overall ILI activity moving into Week21.
7. Based on declining ILI trends (Week12 to Week16), the off-season timing (Week21), effective vaccination coverage, and minimal significant external drivers, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 12688 for Week21, 2024, is consistent with observed patterns of diminishing flu activity.
