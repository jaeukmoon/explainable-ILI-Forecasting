1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a slightly oscillating but overall downward trend, with values of ['13307', '12757', '13026', '13095', '12870']. There was an initial decrease from 13307 (Week15, 2023) to 12757 (Week16, 2023), followed by a rebound in Week17 (2023) at 13026, then another slight increase to 13095 (Week18, 2023), and finally a small decline to 12870 (Week19, 2023). This fluctuation suggests a period of relative stabilization with mild downward pressure by the end of the observed period.
2. A clear negative correlation is present between past and future ILI occurrences, as the stabilization and slight decrease in Weeks 18 and 19, 2023, precede the more pronounced decline observed after 5 weeks at 9416 occurrences in Week24, 2023. This marked reduction aligns with a tapering ILI trend, reflecting diminished respiratory illness activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below the national baseline of 2.5%, with values at 2.0% (Weeks15, 17, and 18, 2023) and 1.9% (Weeks16 and 19, 2023). This stable and low outpatient ILI consultation rate aligns with the downward trend in future occurrences.
4. Reduced influenza positivity rates in clinical labs, from 1.0% (Week15, 2023) to 0.9% and 1.0% (Weeks18 and 19, 2023), reflect declining influenza activity, which correlates with the fall in ILI occurrences over time. This is corroborated by decreasing respiratory hospitalization rates, from 61.8 per 100,000 in Week16 to 62.6 per 100,000 in Week19, 2023, indicating improved control over severe cases.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, alongside ILI activity assessments with stable vaccination effectiveness (near 100% antigenic similarity noted across weeks), signal effective mitigation. Combined with the CDC's consistent predictions of low flu activity (Weeks15–19, 2023), these factors contribute to the significant drop to 9416 occurrences by Week24, 2023.
6. In summary, the drop to 9416 future occurrences in Week24, 2023, can be attributed to the mild decline in past ILI occurrences during Weeks18–19, 2023, concurrent low outpatient ILI rates below the baseline, declining influenza positivity and hospitalization rates, and the efficacy of vaccination coupled with controlled co-circulating respiratory viruses.
