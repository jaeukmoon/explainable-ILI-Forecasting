1. The past time-series ILI occurrences displayed a consistent downward trend over the 5 weeks, with values decreasing from 1122 (Week 27, 2022) to 719 (Week 31, 2022). This sharp decline across the period indicates a reduction in ILI activity, with a steady decrease week by week: 1122 → 898 → 845 → 785 → 719. This pattern demonstrates suppressed respiratory illness activity during these weeks.
2. The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks reaching 768 (Week 36, 2022), despite the continuous downward trend in past weeks, suggest that the decline plateaued as the latter weeks approached Week 31, 2022. The slight difference between Week 31 (719) and the future occurrence reinforces the possibility of stabilization or minor shifts influenced by external factors, rather than a strict continuation of decline.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained nearly stable, with minor variations from 1.7% (Week 27, 2022) to 1.5% (Week 31, 2022). This steadiness, particularly among higher-risk populations like children aged 0-4 years (6.1%-7.3%), may have mitigated the decrease, aligning with the reported slight increase to 768 after 5 weeks.
4. High percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) were reported consistently, rising slightly from 8.8% (Week 27, 2022) to 10.0% (Week 31, 2022), well above epidemic thresholds each week. Persistent PIC mortality could reflect ongoing respiratory illness burdens influencing consistent ILI activity rather than further drops.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, across Weeks 27–31, 2022, combined with behavioral changes in healthcare-seeking, likely impacted ILI report dynamics, softening the observed decline trend and contributing to the relatively stable future occurrence of 768 in Week 36, 2022.
6. Influenza activity remained low, as reflected in minimal positivity rates (from 0.7% in Week 27 to 0.4% in Week 31, 2022). The dominance of Influenza A (H3N2) and reduced Influenza B contributions suggest other non-influenza respiratory pathogens may have retained baseline ILI activity, supporting future occurrence stability instead of decline.
7. In summary, the reported 768 future ILI occurrences (Week 36, 2022) stem from a steadily declining trend in past weeks that plateaued near Week 31, 2022. Outpatient ILI visit stability, persistent PIC mortality rates, co-circulating respiratory pathogens, and low influenza activity combined to stabilize ILI occurrences, preventing further decline and leading to the described future value.
