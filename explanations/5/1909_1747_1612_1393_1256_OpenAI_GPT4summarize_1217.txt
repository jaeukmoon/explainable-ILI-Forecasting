1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1909', '1747', '1612', '1393', '1256']. Each consecutive week saw a steady reduction in activity, with a decline of 163 cases from Week11, 2024 (1909) to Week12, 2024 (1747), followed by a similar pattern culminating in a drop to 1256 in Week16, 2024. This decreasing trend signifies a national reduction in ILI activity over time.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the decreasing pattern of past time-series ILI occurrences and the future number of 625 reported for Week21, 2024. A similar rate of weekly decline during Weeks11–16, 2024, mirrors the drop in ILI occurrences leading up to Week21, 2024, explaining the steady reduction and eventual decline to 625.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a continued decline from 3.1% in Week12, 2024, to 2.3% in Week16, 2024, falling below the national baseline by Week14, 2024. This sustained decrease in outpatient visits aligns with the observed decreasing trend in ILI occurrences. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza increased only marginally across Weeks12–16, reflecting stabilization and lower flu complications, further contributing to reduced ILI activity in Week21, 2024. The declining impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses, including RSV and COVID-19, as indicated in CDC reports during Weeks15–16, 2024, likely supported the continuous reduction in overall ILI cases. Regional variations showing notable decreases in influenza activity and positivity by Week16, 2024, further explain lower occurrences in Week21, 2024.
4. The decreasing national positivity rate for influenza, from 10.5% in Week12, 2024, down to 4.8% in Week16, 2024, illustrates an overall contraction in flu activity, contributing to lower ILI occurrences in the future. Stable or decreasing mortality associated with influenza during Weeks12–16, 2024, along with fewer new cases of severe complications, underscores reduced illness intensity leading up to Week21, 2024.
5. In summary, the reported 625 future ILI occurrences for Week21, 2024, can be attributed to a consistent decline in past ILI trends, falling outpatient ILI visits, decreased co-circulating viral impact, lower positivity rates for influenza, stable hospitalization metrics, and regionally declining activity reflected in CDC surveillance data from Weeks11–16, 2024.
