1. The ILI occurrences show a fluctuating trend over the past 5 weeks, rising from Week38 (2035) to Week39 (2037) and significantly increasing to Week40 (2328). A slight decrease was observed at Week41 (2168), followed by another increase in Week42 (2348). Overall, this trend indicates variability, with modest increases over time but no consistent upward or downward momentum.
2. Week47, 2023 falls within the peak onset season, as it directly precedes the typical peak season starting from Week46 in the U.S. The gradual increase in influenza positivity noted in Week42 and other indicators align with the characteristics of peak onset activity.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the fluctuating pattern with a moderately increasing trend in Week42 suggests a continuation of this variability over the next five weeks. Assuming seasonality and previous growth patterns, the projected occurrences for Week47, 2023 are aligned with a forecast of higher ILI counts (3631) as the peak season approaches.
4. Regional increases in ILI activity have been observed in Week42, 2023, with moderate or high activity reported in six jurisdictions (Week42, 2023 #9, #11). This signals the geographic spread and escalating ILI burdens, contributing to higher future national activity.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (Week38, 2023 #8; Week42, 2023 #8), continue to intersect with influenza, complicating attribution but contributing overall to rising respiratory illness levels.
6. Vaccination trends have not shown marked increases, and coverage remains stable without substantial uptake, which could potentially limit the mitigation of influenza spread (Week38, 2023 #9; Week41, 2023 #8; Week42, 2023 #7).
7. The projected ILI count of 3631 for Week47, 2023 reflects the gradually rising positivity rate, regional increases in activity, and co-circulating viral impacts, while stable vaccination trends and ongoing peak onset dynamics further justify this upper-tier level of occurrences.
