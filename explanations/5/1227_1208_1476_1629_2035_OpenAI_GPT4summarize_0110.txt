1. The reported ILI counts from Week34 to Week38, 2023 are 1227, 1208, 1476, 1629, and 2035, respectively. The data demonstrate a clear upward trend, with ILI occurrences rising significantly from Week35 (1208) to Week38 (2035). This steady increase indicates a transition towards higher ILI activity over the observed period.
2. In the U.S., the typical peak onset season spans from Week32 to Week46. Given the observed increase in ILI occurrences (Week34 to Week38, 2023) and the forecast of Week43, 2023 falling within this window, the target week is categorized as part of the peak onset season.
3. The time-series data suggest a sustained growth pattern without any reversal or leveling off in ILI occurrences. This upward trend, indicating consistent growth, projects forward into Week43, 2023. Based on this progression, the forecast predicts ILI occurrences to continue increasing but slowing slightly as the peak onset stabilizes around 2464 ILI cases in Week43, 2023.
4. ILI positivity rates have consistently remained below 1% in Weeks34 (0.8%), Week35 (0.6%), and Week36 (0.7%) but rose slightly in Week37 (0.8%) and Week38 (0.9%) (Week34-Week38, 2023 #1 #2 #3). This subtle increase suggests the potential beginnings of wider viral spread, contributing to the rising ILI occurrences in Week43, 2023.
5. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, is influencing the ILI landscape, albeit with influenza A dominance (Week34-Week38, 2023 #9, #8). This multi-virus impact has likely contributed to the increased ILI outpatient visits observed (2.0% by Week38, 2023) and is anticipated to continue influencing ILI activity into Week43, 2023.
6. Pediatric ILI outpatient visits are significantly high relative to other age groups, remaining above 5.8% (Week34) and peaking at 6.8% (Week38), contributing disproportionately to total ILI occurrences (Week34-Week38, 2023 #5, #4, #6, #3). Continued elevated pediatric rates are likely to sustain higher overall ILI levels heading into Week43.
7. With steadily rising ILI occurrences, the peak onset season alignment (Week43, 2023), increasing positivity rates, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and elevated pediatric ILI contributions, the forecast of 2464 ILI cases in Week43, 2023 reflects a logical progression of trends and influencing factors.
