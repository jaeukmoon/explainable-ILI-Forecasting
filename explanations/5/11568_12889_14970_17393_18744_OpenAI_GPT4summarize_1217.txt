1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent upward trend, with values of ['11568', '12889', '14970', '17393', '18744']. This rise began with a steady increase from 11568 (Week48, 2023) to 14970 (Week50, 2023), followed by a sharp surge to 17393 (Week51, 2023) and further reaching 18744 (Week52, 2023), the peak of the observed period. This ongoing ascent indicates intensifying influenza-like activity across these weeks.
2. There is a strong correlation between the increasing trend in past ILI occurrences and the future value of 12486 (Week5, 2024). The peaks observed in the final weeks (Weeks51–52, 2023) suggest heightened flu activity that could naturally taper off after peak flu season, leading to the lower but still elevated value recorded in Week5, 2024, compared to earlier data.
3. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza consistently increased over five weeks, from 6.8% (Week48, 2023) to 17.5% (Week52, 2023). This steady rise highlights the widespread and escalating flu transmission, supporting elevated ILI activity and projecting residual effects leading to the future ILI value. Additionally, outpatient visits for ILI surged from 4.0% (Week48, 2023) to 6.9% (Week52, 2023), indicating growing healthcare engagements related to ILI cases. Cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza significantly climbed from 5.5 per 100,000 (Week48, 2023) to 22.3 per 100,000 (Week52, 2023), reflecting severe illness progression, which aligns with the future data. Lastly, co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as COVID-19, RSV, and influenza amplified overall respiratory illness activity across Weeks48–52, 2023, further contributing to sustained high ILI numbers.
4. The cumulative effect of increasing past ILI activity, coupled with progressively higher positivity rates, surging outpatient visits, rising hospitalization rates, and the concurrent spread of multiple respiratory viruses, explains the projected future figure of 12486 (Week5, 2024). This value represents a likely decline following peak flu activity in Week52, 2023, while remaining consistent with elevated seasonal trends.
