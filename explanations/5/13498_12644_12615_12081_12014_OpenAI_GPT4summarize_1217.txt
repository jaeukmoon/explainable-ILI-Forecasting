1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent decline, with values ['13498' (Week 17, 2024), '12644' (Week 18, 2024), '12615' (Week 19, 2024), '12081' (Week 20, 2024), '12014' (Week 21, 2024)]. This downward trend reflects a gradual reduction in reported ILI cases throughout this period, reaching the lowest value in Week 21, 2024.
2. A negative correlation is observed between the decreasing past ILI occurrences and the future occurrences of 9782 by Week 26, 2024. This reflects a continuation of the declining trend from Week 17 through Week 21, suggesting that the reported decrease in past weeks is predictive of lower future ILI cases.
3. Nationwide influenza positivity rates consistently declined from 3.1% (Week 18, 2024) to 1.8% (Week 22, 2024), accompanied by decreased outpatient ILI visits from 2.1% in Week 17, 2024, to 1.9% in Week 22, 2024, both remaining below the national baseline. Minimal to no rise in pediatric mortality rates throughout Week 22, 2024, signaled reduced severity or spread of influenza-related ILI cases.
4. Co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., COVID-19 and RSV) featured prominently in all CDC reports (Weeks 18–22, 2024), suggesting that non-influenza respiratory pathogens contributed variably but were insufficient to sustain or trigger high ILI occurrences.
5. Stability in antiviral resistance, positive alignment between circulating influenza strains and vaccine effectiveness, and lack of significant changes in vaccination updates were continuously highlighted throughout the 5 weeks. These factors collectively reduced the likelihood of increased influenza-related activity, further contributing to the observed future decline in ILI cases.
6. In summary, the decline in past ILI data (Weeks 17–21, 2024), low influenza positivity rates and ILI outpatient visits, persistent co-circulating respiratory infections with no major outbreaks, and effective antiviral susceptibility and vaccine coverage align to explain the reported 9782 ILI occurrences by Week 26, 2024.
