1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a notable upward trend initially, with values of ['13107', '17363', '17147', '16455', '15359']. From Week 33, 2023, there was a sharp increase from 13107 to 17363, followed by a slight fluctuation with peaks at 17147 and 16455 (Weeks 34 and 35, 2023) before declining to 15359 in Week 37, 2023. Despite the final decline, the sustained high levels of ILI activity up to Week 37 reflect ongoing elevated respiratory illness dynamics.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the peak ILI activity observed in Weeks 33–35, 2023, correlates with the reported increase to 19370 by Week 42, 2023. Although there was a decline in the final weeks of the observed past data, the overall higher baseline toward Weeks 34–35 acts as a precursor to the elevated future ILI occurrences.
3. Outpatient ILI visits gradually rose from 1.5% (Week 33, 2023) to 2.0% (Week 36–37, 2023). Notably, the highest percentages of outpatient visits were consistently recorded among children aged 0–4 years, with figures as high as 7.2% (Week 35, 2023). This ongoing increase in outpatient ILI contributions, particularly from pediatric cases, reflects incremental respiratory illness trends linked to the future ILI rise.
4. PIC deaths consistently surpassed epidemic thresholds across all 5 weeks, with percentages such as 10.0% (Week 33), 9.6% (Week 35), and peaking at 7.6% by Week 37. While influenza contributed to a smaller proportion of deaths, the high mortality from respiratory causes (including COVID-19) underscores widespread respiratory activity during this period, aligning with the anticipated surge in ILI.
5. Increased co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including Influenza (A and B), SARS-CoV-2, and RSV, was reported over the 5 weeks, alongside challenges in healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance caused by the pandemic’s ongoing impacts. These factors likely compounded ILI rates by introducing complexities in detecting, reporting, and classifying respiratory illnesses, contributing to the future rise to 19370 occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 19370 future ILI occurrences (Week 42, 2023) can be attributed to the initial upward trend in Weeks 34–35, 2023, increased pediatric outpatient ILI visits, elevated PIC deaths exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the compounding effects of viral co-circulation and healthcare-seeking shifts, despite a minor decline observed in the final weeks of the observed period.
