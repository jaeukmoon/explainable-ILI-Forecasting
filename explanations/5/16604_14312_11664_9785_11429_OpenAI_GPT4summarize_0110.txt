1. The reported ILI counts from Week52, 2023 to Week4, 2024 are 16604, 14312, 11664, 9785, and 11429. The data shows a declining trend from Week52, 2023 to Week3, 2024, with a reduction of 41% over the first four weeks. However, a slight rebound in Week4, 2024 (11429) suggests potential stabilization or moderation of the decline. This overall trend reflects a general decrease in ILI activity post-peak, with minor fluctuations.
2. Forecasting target week (Week9, 2024) belongs to the off-season. The peak season generally concludes by Week6, and influenza activity typically decreases to lower levels afterward. The decline in ILI counts post-Week52, 2023 and ongoing trends into Week4, 2024 align with the off-season classification, when ILI activity stabilizes or decreases further.
3. The correlation analysis suggests continuity in the declining trend observed through Week4, 2024, albeit with potential minor fluctuations or stabilization. Historically, ILI activity decreases after peak season and plateaus during the off-season. The rebound in Week4, 2024 is consistent with occasional fluctuations during the transition to the off-season. Assuming a similar trajectory, the forecast anticipates ILI occurrences to stabilize around 18300 by Week9, 2024.
4. Influenza positivity rates remain elevated yet show fluctuation (Week52, 2023: 17.5%; Week2, 2024: 13.7%; Week4, 2024: 16.2%), reflecting co-circulation of multiple viruses (Week52, 2023 #10; Week2, 2024 #10; Week4, 2024 #8). A second wave of flu activity could occur (Week1, 2024 #10; Week2, 2024 #7), slightly increasing ILI occurrences post-holiday before tapering. Moderate vaccination uptake and well-matched vaccine effectiveness against Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 could limit future surges (Week52, 2023 #13, #14; Week4, 2024 #7, #9). Hospitalization trends have declined steadily (Week3, 2024 #6; Week4, 2024 #6) with reduced mortality rates (Week3, 2024 #7; Week4, 2024 #5), supporting an overall stabilization of ILI occurrences.
5. Despite declining ILI reports, respiratory illnesses like COVID-19 and RSV co-circulate (Week52, 2023 #10; Week4, 2024 #8), driving elevated ILI contributions. This adds complexity to predictions, although such activity does not appear to overwhelm declining flu activity.
6. Antiviral effectiveness remains high, with only isolated resistance (Week2, 2024 #9; Week3, 2024 #10; Week4, 2024 #10). This ensures effective treatment options, limiting severe outcomes and stabilizing ILI trends during the off-season.
7. Based on the downward trend in ILI occurrences (Week52, 2023–Week4, 2024), off-season designation for Week9, 2024, protection from a well-matched vaccine, moderated co-circulation of respiratory illnesses, and declining hospitalizations, the predicted ILI occurrences are 18300. The value reflects the expected stabilization during the off-season following the typical post-peak decline.
