1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating pattern, with values of ['1170', '1239', '1301', '1285', '1243']. There was an initial rise from 1170 (Week28, 2022) to 1301 (Week30, 2022), followed by a slight decline to 1243 in Week32, 2022. Despite minor fluctuations, overall values remained relatively consistent, indicating stable ILI activity during this period.
2. A positive correlation is evident between past and future ILI occurrences, as the stable ILI activity observed during Weeks 28–32, 2022, set the baseline for potential increases. The reported future increase to 1946 occurrences (Week37, 2022) aligns with trends suggesting incremental growth in ILI activity over time, possibly due to compounding seasonal or other external factors.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a gradual decline, from 1.6% (Weeks 28, 29, and 30, 2022) to 1.5% in Week31, 2022, and further to 1.4% in Week32, 2022. However, the highest rates consistently occurred in children aged 0–4 years (e.g., 6.5% in Week28, 6.4% in Week30), indicating elevated activity in a sensitive demographic, likely contributing to the future surge.
4. PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) mortality consistently remained above the epidemic threshold, rising from 9.5% (Week28, 2022) to 10% in both Weeks 30 and 31, 2022, and 9.9% in Week32, 2022. This ongoing elevated mortality associated with respiratory illnesses suggests sustained transmission of respiratory pathogens, correlating with increased ILI occurrences.
5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, alongside Influenza A dominance (e.g., 90.9% in Week28, 92.6% in Week32, 2022), likely exacerbated ILI activity unpredictably. Disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior reported across all weeks contributed to delayed detection and amplified reporting patterns, influencing the sharp rise to 1946 future occurrences.
6. Summary: The reported 1946 ILI occurrences (Week37, 2022) can be attributed to the past stable ILI trends, coupled with elevated PIC mortality consistently above epidemic thresholds. Specific ILI spikes among children aged 0–4 and the overlapping effects of multiple respiratory viruses further align with the observed increase. Disruptions in healthcare systems and behavioral patterns also played a significant role in amplifying future ILI data.
