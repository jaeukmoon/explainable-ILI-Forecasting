1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a noticeable upward trend, starting at 1008 in Week 43, 2021, and rising consistently to reach 1240 in Week 46, 2021, before a slight drop to 1216 in Week 47, 2021. This consistent increase until Week 46, followed by a marginal decline in Week 47, illustrates a gradual escalation in ILI activity across the observation period. 

2. There is a clear positive correlation between the upward trend in the past time-series ILI occurrences and the reported future occurrence of 2919 in Week 52, 2021. The steady rise through Weeks 43–46, 2021, combined with only a minor decrease in Week 47, indicates sustained momentum in ILI activity, acting as a precursor to the significantly higher future ILI count.

3. The increasing percentage of outpatient visits for ILI over the weeks provides strong supporting evidence, rising from 1.9% in Week 43, 2021, to 2.4% in Week 47, 2021, near the national baseline of 2.5%. This steady growth in ILI-related healthcare encounters indicates escalating respiratory illness activity likely contributing to the elevated future numbers.  
   Furthermore, the dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) infections (e.g., 99.6% positivity in Week 47) with most cases in the 5–24 age group, coincides with increased ILI numbers and suggests age-specific vulnerabilities driving activity.  
   Additionally, the continued circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens such as Influenza A, Influenza B, and other viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) complicates complete ILI assessments and may inflate overall illness numbers in the future.

4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2919 (Week 52, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trend in past ILI data through Weeks 43–46, 2021, an increase in ILI-related outpatient visits nearing baseline levels, the dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) among younger populations, and the co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens affecting total respiratory illness trends. This aligns with the amplified activity projected after 5 weeks.
