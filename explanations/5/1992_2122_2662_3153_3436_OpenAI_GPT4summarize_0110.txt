1. The reported ILI counts from Week32 to Week36, 2023 are 1992, 2122, 2662, 3153, and 3436. A clear upward trend is observed, with ILI occurrences increasing steadily each week. This trend indicates growing influenza activity, with no dips or plateaus during this period, suggesting an early stage of seasonal increase.
2. Based on historical influenza patterns in the U.S., the Peak onset season typically spans from Week32 to Week46. Given that Week41, 2023 falls within this window and aligns with the visible increase in ILI occurrences, it is reasonable to classify Week41, 2023 as part of the Peak onset season.
3. The time-series analysis reveals a continuous increase in ILI occurrences from Week32 to Week36, 2023, with no sign of stabilization or decline. Projecting this trend forward using a time-series forecasting model, it is expected that the ILI counts will continue to rise at a comparable rate over the subsequent weeks, culminating in a forecast value of 5340 for Week41, 2023.
4. Influenza activity remains low but steadily rising, with clinical lab positivity increasing from 0.6% in Week35, 2023 to 0.7% in Week36, 2023. While absolute values remain low, the upward progression corresponds with increasing ILI visits (Week36, 2023 #1, #4).
5. The rise in outpatient visits for ILI (% of overall visits increased from 1.9% in Week35, 2023 to 2.0% in Week36, 2023) demonstrates elevated influenza transmission and its contribution to steadily rising weekly figures (Week35, 2023 #3; Week36, 2023 #4).
