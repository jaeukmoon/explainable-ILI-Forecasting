1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week31, 2021 to Week35, 2021) in Region 9 exhibit an upward trend. The values ['1910', '1936', '2164', '2131', '2388'] show a consistent increase except for a minor dip from Week33 (2164) to Week34 (2131). This minor fluctuation reflects short-term variability, but overall, there is a noticeable growth, with an average weekly increase of approximately 119 cases. By Week35, the ILI occurrences reached 2388, indicating accelerated growth likely influenced by seasonal factors and non-influenza respiratory viruses.
2. Season Classification for Week40, 2021: Week40 falls within the "Peak onset season," as per the U.S. flu season cycle. The Peak onset season generally spans from Week32 to Week46, characterized by increasing ILI activity as the baseline trends upward toward higher transmission rates. The ongoing increase in ILI occurrences from late Week31 to Week35 supports this classification for Week40.
3. Historical trends and their correlation with future occurrences suggest continued upward movement. Week31 to Week35 recorded a cumulative increase of 478 cases over 5 weeks (from 1910 to 2388), or an average growth rate of approximately 119 cases per week. Applying this rate across the next 5 weeks (Week36 to Week40), while accounting for the onset of the peak season and higher transmission rates typical of this period, contributes significantly to the projection of 2438. This prediction reflects modest additional growth beyond linear trends to account for typical peak onset effects.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports strongly influence forecasting. First, the overall influenza activity remains low, but increases in ILI across all age groups (notably 25–49 and 50–64 in Week31; 5–24 in Week32; and 0–4 and 5–24 in Week34) indicate seasonal respiratory virus circulation rather than pure influenza (Week34). This supports steady, if not heightened, ILI occurrences into Week40. Second, non-influenza respiratory viruses, particularly SARS-CoV-2, substantially contribute to elevated ILI activity (Week33), suggesting the continued concurrent influence of respiratory illnesses. Third, healthcare-seeking behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic complicate surveillance (Week35), but steady increases in outpatient ILI visits and localized higher activity in certain regions (e.g., CBSAs in Week33) confirm the trend's reliability.
5. To summarize, the prediction of 2438 for ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week40, 2021) in Region 9 is based on upward trends in historical data, classification of Week40 as part of the peak onset season, and external factors such as seasonality, non-influenza virus circulation, and pandemic-influenced healthcare behavior. Quantitative adjustments, guided by a weekly increase of 119 cases and slight seasonal amplification for peak onset, align with the predicted value.
