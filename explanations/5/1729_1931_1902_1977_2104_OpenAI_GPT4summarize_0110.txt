1. The ILI counts from Week11 to Week15, 2022 are 1729, 1931, 1902, 1977, and 2104. These numbers show a consistent upward trend over the five weeks, with an increase of 375 (from 1729 to 2104) across the period. This growth suggests a gradual increase in ILI activity without any abrupt spikes or dips, supporting a rising trend in cases.
2. Week20, 2022 falls within the off-season. This period is indicative of relatively low influenza activity outside the peak or peak onset phases. The consistent yet moderate increase in ILI numbers as of Week15, 2022, points towards maintaining steady activity without transitioning to a peak period.
3. Time-series analysis indicates a notable upward trend in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks. Extrapolating this rising pattern and factoring in a moderate growth rate suggests a potential continuation of this trajectory into Week20, 2022. The historically observed increase aligns with periodic off-season fluctuations, projecting the occurrence to stabilize at 3625.
4. The national influenza positivity rate rose to 8.9% in Week15, 2022 from 7.7% in Week11, 2022, predominantly driven by Influenza A (Week11, 2022 #1; Week15, 2022 #1, #2). This consistent growth in positivity rates across weeks suggests an anticipated increase in ILI activity in the near term.
5. The presence of A(H3N2), which is predominant and displays antigenic differences from vaccine strains, can partially reduce vaccine effectiveness while contributing to steady ILI occurrences (Week11, 2022 #7; Week14, 2022 #10; Week15, 2022 #10). This antigenic mismatch may sustain elevated case levels beyond natural seasonal baselines.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, with 5-6% of co-infected hospitalized cases (Week11, 2022 #8; Week12, 2022 #9; Week15, 2022 #11), adds to the overall respiratory illness burden. Although flu activity is influenced, the compounding impact likely pushes respiratory visits higher.
7. The increase in cumulative hospitalization rates, with consistent weekly rises over 11 weeks up to Week15, 2022 (Week11, 2022 #10; Week15, 2022 #7), reflects steady illness transmission and severity. Combined with regional variability in influenza activity trends, this supports the projection of 3625 ILI occurrences, aligning with the observed pattern and co-circulating respiratory factors.
