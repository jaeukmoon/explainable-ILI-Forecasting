1. The reported ILI counts from Week52, 2021 to Week4, 2022 are 12215, 7536, 4016, 2615, and 1998, showing a steep decline over the five weeks. This trend indicates a sharp decrease in reported ILI occurrences, resulting in the lowest value by Week4, 2022. The pattern reflects a consistent downward trajectory without fluctuations or signs of resurgence.
2. Week9, 2022 falls into the off-season, as the peak season (Weeks46-6) has ended, and influenza activity trends, as well as positivity rates, are significantly decreasing. This timing aligns with minimal ILI activity, reduced disease prevalence, and declining community transmission observed in the data for Week3 and Week4 of 2022.
3. From a time-series forecasting model perspective, the rapid decline in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks (a reduction by approximately 2000-4000 cases weekly) suggests the future ILI levels will stabilize at a lower baseline. Extrapolating this pattern five weeks forward leads to the forecasted occurrence of 2040 for Week9, 2022, consistent with the ongoing reduction trajectory.
4. Influenza activity is declining nationally, as confirmed by positivity rates dropping from 3.8% in Week52, 2021 (Week52, 2021 #1) to 1.7% in Week4, 2022 (Week4, 2022 #1). The consistently minimal proportion of Influenza B cases suggests lower likelihood of resurgence (Week52, 2021 #2; Week4, 2022 #2).
5. Vaccination rates remain lower for this season compared to past years (Week52, 2021 #6; Week1, 2022 #8; Week4, 2022 #6), but most circulating Influenza A(H3N2) viruses genetically match the vaccine strains (Week52, 2021 #7; Week3, 2022 #9), reducing the likelihood of significant increases in ILI occurrences.
6. The concurrent circulation of SARS-CoV-2 with asymmetrical burdens across regions (Week52, 2021 #8; Week3, 2022 #9; Week4, 2022 #11) and the continuing co-infections (Week3, 2022 #4; Week4, 2022 #8) contribute to uneven ILI trends but do not suggest a significant influenza surge.
7. The forecast of 2040 ILI occurrences for Week9, 2022 is justified by the observed steady decline in ILI cases, the timing within the off-season, the low influenza positivity rates, reduced flu-associated activity nationwide, and the mitigating efficacy of vaccines. These factors align with continued stabilization of influenza activity at minimal levels.
