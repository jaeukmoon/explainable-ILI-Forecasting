1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall fluctuating trend with values of ['1326', '1362', '1453', '1529', '1419']. There was an increase from 1326 (Week9, 2023) to 1529 (Week12, 2023), peaking in Week12 before slightly decreasing to 1419 (Week13, 2023). This variation indicates an active but stabilizing trend toward the end of the 5-week period.
2. A negative correlation between past ILI trends and future occurrences is observed, as the peak during Week12, 2023, followed by a decline in Week13, 2023, aligns with the significant drop to 1083 future occurrences by Week18, 2023. This suggests that the diminishing trend in the final week acts as a precursor to lower future ILI activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline across all weeks, declining slightly from 2.4% (Week9, 2023) to 2.3% (Week13, 2023). This steady decline indicates reduced healthcare visits for respiratory illnesses, contributing to the decrease in future ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently remained above the epidemic threshold but gradually decreased from 8.9% (Week9, 2023) to 7.9% (Week13, 2023). This decline in PIC-related mortality aligns with the observed reduction in ILI activity after 5 weeks.
5. Nationwide influenza positivity rates were persistently low, ranging from 0.9% (Week9, 2023) to 0.9% (Week13, 2023), indicating minimal flu activity and a lack of significant flu-driven surges. This low influenza activity, combined with effective vaccination and stable antiviral susceptibility, supports the drop in future ILI occurrences to 1083.
6. In summary, the reported 1083 future ILI occurrences (Week18, 2023) can be attributed to the fluctuating yet declining trend in past weeks, reduced ILI-related outpatient visits, gradually decreasing PIC mortality rates, and consistently low influenza positivity rates coupled with stable vaccination effectiveness. These factors collectively signal diminished influenza-like illness activity over time.
