1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 4–8, 2022) displayed a noticeable decreasing trend. Starting at 13,413 in Week 4, 2022, cases declined sharply to 10,333 in Week 5, 2022, and further to 9,072 in Weeks 6 and 7, 2022. A further marginal decrease to 9,028 occurred by Week 8, 2022. This consistent decline reflects overall reduced influenza-like illness activity during this period.

2. Despite the downward trajectory in the past ILI occurrences, a significant increase to 10,080 after five weeks suggests a rebound in ILI activity. This increase likely correlates with trends observed during prior outbreaks, where sporadic but increasing activity in certain areas, as reported in Weeks 6–8, 2022, may act as early signals for a broader resurgence.

3. Several summarized CDC report factors align closely with the future ILI surge:  
   - Hospitalizations for respiratory illness steadily increased for four consecutive weeks, rising from 4.4 per 100,000 in Week 4, 2022, to 5.2 per 100,000 in Week 8, 2022. This upward trend reflects escalating severe cases, which could presage increased ILI occurrences.  
   - SARS-CoV-2 co-infections, present in 5.7% to 6.1% of influenza-positive specimens during this period, reflect the compounding impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses, likely fueling the uptick in ILI activity.  
   - Influenza A(H3N2)’s antigenic differences from the vaccine strain, coupled with low flu vaccination coverage compared to previous seasons, contributed to decreased immunity in the population, enabling a rise in ILI cases.  

4. In summary, the reported increase to 10,080 future ILI occurrences after five weeks (Week 13, 2022) can be attributed to a rebound from the declining trend evident in Weeks 4–8, 2022. Key contributing factors include increasing hospitalization rates, the persistent co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, and waning immunity due to low vaccination coverage and antigenic mismatches in circulating Influenza A(H3N2) viruses. These elements collectively shaped the observed rise in ILI activity.
