1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week12, 2021 to Week16, 2021 are 1213, 1209, 1496, 1482, and 1490. A noticeable increase was seen in Week14 (1496) and Week15 (1482), followed by a stabilization in Week16 (1490). Overall, the trend indicates a rise in ILI activity from Week12 to Week14, followed by stable yet elevated levels in Week15 and Week16, deviating from the earlier lower-level counts.
2. Week21, 2021 occurs beyond the typical peak season (Week46–Week6) and aligns with the off-season phase, characterized by reduced ILI activity. Influenza indicators in recent weeks confirm minimal levels of transmission, consistent with off-season expectations.
3. Historical ILI data from Week12 to Week16, 2021 show an upward trend peaking in Week14, followed by stabilization at slightly higher levels. By projecting this pattern forward into Week21, 2021, the ILI occurrences are forecasted to remain moderate and align with the recent steady levels, leading to the anticipated value of 1383.
4. Nationwide influenza activity remains exceptionally low, with clinical laboratories reporting only 0.1% positivity for influenza across Weeks12–16, 2021, indicating limited viral circulation (Week12, 2021 #1; Week13, 2021 #1; Week14, 2021 #1; Week15, 2021 #1; Week16, 2021 #1).
5. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza is historically low at 0.8 per 100,000 (Week16, 2021 #4) and continues to be significantly lower compared to previous low-severity seasons (Week15, 2021 #4; Week14, 2021 #7). This low disease severity dampens the likelihood of sharp increases in ILI activity.
6. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to overlapping COVID-19 trends and pandemic-induced monitoring challenges (Week12, 2021 #10; Week13, 2021 #9; Week15, 2021 #8; Week16, 2021 #9) have suppressed reported ILI occurrences compared to historical norms, contributing to the low predicted ILI count.
7. Considering the stable yet low influenza positivity rates, minimal hospitalization rates, behavioral influences from COVID-19, and the off-season time frame, the projected ILI count of 1383 for Week21, 2021 reflects the continuation of stabilized ILI activity observed in recent weeks while accounting for the persistent low flu activity trend.
