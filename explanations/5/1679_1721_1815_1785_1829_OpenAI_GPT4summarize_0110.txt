1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week39 to Week43, 2021 are 1679, 1721, 1815, 1785, and 1829. The trend shows a general increase from Week39 (1679) to Week43 (1829), with slight fluctuations between Week41 (1815) and Week42 (1785). This overall growth, although moderate and not sharply accelerating, indicates a gradual upward trend in ILI activity.
2. Week48, 2021 corresponds to the peak season, given that it falls within the typical peak window of Week46 to Week6 in the U.S. Influenza activity tends to increase significantly during this period. Gradual increases in influenza cases (Week43, 2021 #10) combined with the season's proximity strongly suggest it aligns with the peak season.
3. Historical trends from Week39 to Week43, 2021 indicate a consistent, gradual increase in ILI cases (from 1679 to 1829). Extrapolating this pattern mathematically using time series forecasting, we anticipate continued growth toward Week48, 2021, resulting in 2084 occurrences.
4. The positivity rate for influenza has begun to grow slightly. Clinical influenza positivity increased from 0.1% in Week41 to 0.2% in Week43 (Week41, 2021 #1; Week43, 2021 #1), reflecting early signs of increasing flu circulation leading to the peak season.
5. The emergence of Influenza A, particularly H3N2, as the dominant strain (Week43, 2021 #3), signals heightened transmissibility compared to prior weeks. H3N2 often correlates with higher ILI rates and severe outcomes.
6. While vaccination remains emphasized (Week43, 2021 #8), the lack of significant uptake trends reported (Weeks39-43, 2021 multiple weeks #8) could limit community immunity, allowing influenza cases to rise as peak season approaches.
7. A combination of steady growth in ILI counts over the past five weeks, increasing influenza positivity, the dominance of H3N2, low community immunity, and seasonal timing supports the forecast of 2084 ILI occurrences for Week48, 2021.
