1. The ILI occurrences from Week7, 2024 to Week11, 2024 in Region 2 show a consistent decreasing trend. The values are 11591, 11037, 10736, 9697, and 9207. The decrease from Week7 to Week11 is significant, suggesting that flu activity in Region 2 is steadily declining week by week. The average weekly decrease rate across this period is calculated as:
2. - (11037 - 11591 = -554), (10736 - 11037 = -301), (9697 - 10736 = -1039), (9207 - 9697 = -490)
3. - Total decrease = -554 - 301 - 1039 - 490 = -2384
4. - Average weekly decrease = -2384 / 4 = -596 occurrences per week.
5. Assuming a consistent decline, the predicted ILI occurrences 5 weeks after Week11 can be estimated as:
6. - 9207 + (5 × -596) = 9207 - 2980 = 6227 occurrences.
7. However, adjustments must be made for factors from the CDC reports and seasonal classifications.
2. Week16, 2024 falls within the "Off-season" for ILI activity based on U.S. flu season patterns. The "Off-season" generally spans from right after the Peak season (Week9 in this case) through approximately Week30. During this time, ILI activity is typically at its lowest or near baseline. Decreasing trends in ILI are consistent with this seasonal classification.
3. Correlation analysis shows that the historical decline in ILI occurrences during past weeks is consistent with declining ILI levels typically observed in the "Off-season." Using time-series analysis and the observed seasonal pattern of steady declines, we account for a further adjustment that moderates the steep decline observed in the immediate weeks prior (to reflect the eventual slowing of decline toward baseline levels). Instead of continuing the weekly decrease at -596 occurrences, we adjust the rate by 75%, dampening the weekly decline due to anticipated reduced burden over time. This yields an adjusted weekly decrease of:
4. - 596 × 0.75 = 447 occurrences per week.
5. - Adjusted forecast using this rate: 9207 - (5 × 447) = 9207 - 2235 = 6972 occurrences.
6. Finally, considering external CDC factors, the forecast is further refined.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports strongly influencing the prediction:
5. - **Vaccination trends and effectiveness**: Vaccination levels remain substantial, and vaccines are well-matched to circulating strains (Week10, 2024). This will likely reduce the overall number of cases, particularly affecting moderate declines in future weeks. This impact likely reduces occurrences by 2-3%. Applying a 2.5% reduction to the adjusted forecast: 6972 × 0.975 = 6798 occurrences.
6. - **Decreasing flu positivity and outpatient ILI visits**: Flu positivity rates and outpatient visits for ILI have consistently declined since Week9, 2024, and are falling below prior weeks' levels (Week11, 2024). These decreases align with overall seasonal trends. This trend suggests a further reduction of another 3% to capture diminishing trends in positivity. Adjusting further: 6798 × 0.97 = 6594 occurrences.
7. - **Co-circulating respiratory viruses and demographic burden**: Despite the declining trend, co-circulating viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 (Week11, 2024) and localized high-risk populations (e.g., older adults, populations with lower immunity) are likely to sustain some level of activity. Thus, an upward adjustment of 7.5% is applied (reflecting continued but diminishing occurrence pressures): 6594 × 1.075 = 7093 occurrences.
5. The final prediction of 7093 ILI occurrences in Week16, 2024 is justified by combining the baseline projection from time-series analysis, seasonal classification adjustments for the "Off-season," and incremental adjustments from CDC factors. The downward trend reflects diminishing flu activity, while adjustments consider vaccination rates, continued co-circulating viruses, and slowing decline dynamics characteristic of the "Off-season."
