1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks revealed an overall upward trend, with values of ['1022', '1222', '1601', '1783', '1687']. The data initially increased significantly from 1022 (Week 32, 2021) to 1783 (Week 35, 2021), followed by a slight decline to 1687 in Week 36, 2021. This pattern indicates a heightened ILI activity peaking around Week 35, 2021, before a minor reduction.
2. The higher ILI occurrences observed in Weeks 34 and 35 (1601 and 1783, respectively) correlate closely with the future value of 1815, indicating that the consistent increase through the period anticipates the elevated sustained levels observed after 5 weeks (Week 41, 2021). The marginal decline between Weeks 35–36 followed by the future increase suggests a continuation of baseline respiratory illness activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI reflecting rising activity, from 2.1% (Week 32, 2021) to 2.3% (Week 36, 2021), while remaining below the national baseline, suggest gradual intensification of respiratory illnesses, paralleling the increase in ILI trends.
4. Persistent high percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), increasing from 14.6% (Week 32, 2021) to 21.0% (Week 36, 2021), mirrored ongoing respiratory illness severity, reinforcing the supporting conditions for elevated future ILI occurrences.
5. COVID-19-dominated respiratory trends during Weeks 32–36, 2021, alongside disruptions to healthcare-seeking behavior, influenced ILI surveillance interpretations, potentially amplifying subsequent reporting of respiratory illness activity, including the rise to 1815 occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 1815 future ILI occurrences (Week 41, 2021) can be attributed to the observed upward trend in Weeks 34 and 35, increasing ILI-related outpatient visits, persistently high PIC mortality rates, and pandemic-driven reporting influences that underscore the elevated respiratory illness activity in subsequent weeks.
