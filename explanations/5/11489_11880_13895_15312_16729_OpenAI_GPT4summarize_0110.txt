1. The reported ILI occurrences for Week42 through Week46, 2021, are 11489, 11880, 13895, 15312, and 16729. The data indicates a steady upward trend with consistent weekly increases, showcasing progression from Week42 (11489) to Week46 (16729). No fluctuations or declines are observed, pointing to a consistent growth trend in ILI activity. This upward movement aligns with typical seasonal influenza growth as the peak season approaches.
2. Based on U.S. epidemiological patterns, Week51 typically falls within the peak season (Week46–Week6 in most years). The steady increase in ILI activity from Week42 to Week46, 2021, further confirms that Week51, 2021, likely belongs to the peak season, where ILI activity is at its highest prevalence.
3. A correlation analysis of the past ILI occurrences highlights a consistent weekly increase over five weeks. From Week46, 2021 (16729 ILI cases), and projecting this steady growth trajectory forward—with higher transmission expected during peak season—predicting 28956 ILI occurrences for Week51 is consistent. Time-series models naturally extrapolate from such steady increases, guided by known seasonal patterns.
4. Increasing positivity rates for influenza were noted in clinical lab testing, rising from 0.1% in Week42, 2021, to 1.0% by Week46, 2021. This trend suggests a broader community spread, primarily driven by the increasing dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) (Week42 #3; Week46 #3).
5. Significant co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, persists. This co-circulation has contributed to ILI visits rising from 1.8% in Week42, 2021, to 2.2% in Week46, despite staying below the national baseline (Week42 #4; Week46 #4). The combined effect of multiple viruses during peak season is expected to amplify ILI activity further.
6. Vaccination coverage shows modest improvements but remains insufficient to fully curb rates. By Week46, 2021, 166.9M doses had been distributed, with CDC recommendations continuing (Week42 #8; Week46 #7), while age-specific influenza outbreaks, especially in ages 5–24, drive higher ILI dynamics (Week44 #10; Week46 #10).
7. With the observed upward trend in ILI cases over the past five weeks, the alignment of Week51, 2021, within the peak season, increasing flu positivity rates, concurrent co-circulating respiratory viruses, and only moderate vaccination uptake, the prediction of 28956 ILI occurrences is well-supported. These factors collectively justify the significant increase to nearly double the Week46 count during peak influenza activity.
