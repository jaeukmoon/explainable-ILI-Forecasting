1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a clear and gradual decline, with values of ['10736', '9697', '9207', '9168', '9079']. Starting with 10736 (Week9, 2024) and progressively decreasing each week, reaching 9079 in Week13, 2024, the data demonstrates a consistent downward trend in ILI activity through this period, indicative of a tapering influenza season.
2. A negative correlation is observed between the past and future ILI occurrences. The continuous decline over the 5-week period (Weeks9–13, 2024) is mirrored in the future data where the ILI occurrences further drop to 5805 by Week18, 2024. This downward trend suggests a continuation of decreasing influenza activity, consistent with waning seasonal dynamics.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily decreased from 4.1% (Week9, 2024) to 3.0% (Week13, 2024), remaining slightly above the national baseline but showing a clear decline over the monitored weeks. This reduction in healthcare encounters aligns with the downward trend in ILI occurrences, contributing to the future drop.
4. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza dropped from 13.9% (Week9, 2024) to 9.1% (Week13, 2024), further emphasizing diminishing viral activity. Correspondingly, decreasing positivity for Influenza A and B, along with declining hospitalization rates, signals a subsiding influenza season, impacting the future ILI occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of influenza with RSV and COVID-19 influenced the ILI trends, as elevated activity from Week9, 2024, onward gradually decreased. Increased vaccination efforts, stable antiviral resistance, and effective treatment options contributed to mitigating the spread, thereby reducing the future ILI occurrences to 5805 by Week18, 2024.
6. In summary, the reported 5805 future ILI occurrences (Week18, 2024) can be attributed to the consistent decline in past occurrences, aligned reductions in outpatient ILI visits, decreased percentage positivity for flu, declining hospitalization and mortality rates, and the overall waning of co-circulating respiratory illnesses during Weeks9–13, 2024.
