1. The ILI occurrences from Week46 to Week50, 2020 show a general decreasing trend: 1416 (Week46, 2020), 1293 (Week47, 2020), 1230 (Week48, 2020), and 1263 (Week50, 2020). Week49, 2020 experienced a slight increase to 1340, indicating a minor fluctuation. Overall, the trend appears slightly decreasing and stable, with no sharp spikes or consistent upward trajectory.
2. Week2, 2021 falls within the peak season for ILI activity (Week46 of one year through Week6 of the next year). However, influenza activity remains unusually low and suppressed for this peak season, likely influenced by pandemic-related factors and control measures outlined in Weeks46-50, 2020 reports.
3. The time-series analysis indicates that ILI occurrences followed a gradually declining trend with periodic fluctuations through Week50, 2020. Given this pattern and ongoing low positivity rates, forward projection to Week2, 2021 suggests ILI remains subdued but slightly reduced relative to Week50, 2020, aligning with the reported 916 occurrences.
4. Influenza activity is extraordinarily low across Weeks46-50, 2020 (e.g., only 0.1% to 0.3% of respiratory specimens tested positive). Low virus circulation (Week46, 2020 #1; Week47, 2020 #1; Week50, 2020 #1), combined with pandemic-related public health measures, continues to suppress influenza transmission.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior continues to shift due to COVID-19, with ILI outpatient visits accounting for only 1.5%-1.6% of consultations (Week46, 2020 #3; Week48, 2020 #2; Week49, 2020 #4; Week50, 2020 #4). This remains well below the pre-pandemic baseline of 2.6%, hindering accurate representation of influenza activity.
6. Other key factors identified include extensive vaccination recommendations (Week46, 2020 #7; Week47, 2020 #8), strict public health interventions like masking and distancing, and continued monitoring due to the co-circulation of COVID-19 (Week48, 2020 #10; Week49, 2020 #9; Week50, 2020 #10). These dynamics reduce typical flu spread and activity even during the peak season.
7. The forecasted ILI occurrences (916) for Week2, 2021 align with the observed downward trend in ILI activity (Weeks46-50, 2020), abnormal suppression during the peak season, lower influenza virus circulation, suppressed outpatient visits, and influencing factors like public health measures and vaccination efforts. These combined factors predict reduced ILI activity compared to prior years.
