1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a declining trend, with values of ['16863', '18059', '18300', '16477', '14164']. After peaking at 18300 in Week 4, 2024, a steady decrease followed, with the lowest occurrence of 14164 recorded in Week 7, 2024. This decline signifies waning ILI activity over the observed period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the consistent decline beginning in Week 4, 2024, through Week 7, 2024, aligns with the drastic reduction to 6649 future occurrences by Week 12, 2024. The decreasing trend over the 5-week period effectively anticipates the subsequent drop in ILI activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily decreased from 4.5% (Week 7, 2024) to 3.4% (Week 11, 2024), indicating reduced healthcare visits for respiratory illnesses, which aligns with the decrease in ILI occurrences. A similar diminishing trend in laboratory positivity rates from 14.8% (Week 7, 2024) to 12.0% (Week 11, 2024) supports this observation.
4. Influenza activity transitioned from elevated levels to decreasing trends nationally, with stable or declining hospitalization and mortality rates. For example, the cumulative hospitalization rate increased marginally from 67.9 per 100,000 during Week 10, 2024, to 70.2 per 100,000 during Week 11, 2024, but overall weekly hospitalizations declined significantly as the season waned.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (RSV, COVID-19) and continued influenza vaccination efforts influenced the decreasing trend. Regional positivity trends also reflected localized decreases, evident in the nationwide reduction in ILI activity near Week 11, 2024, further linking these multifactorial influences to the substantial drop to 6649 occurrences by Week 12, 2024.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 6649 (Week 12, 2024) can be explained by the consistent decline in ILI occurrences from Week 4 to Week 7, 2024, decreasing outpatient visit percentages and laboratory positivity rates, waning influenza activity nationally, and the compounded effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses and vaccination efforts.
