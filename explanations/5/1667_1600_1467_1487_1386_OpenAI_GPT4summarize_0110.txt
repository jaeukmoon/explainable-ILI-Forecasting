1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week23 to Week27, 2023 are 1667, 1600, 1467, 1487, and 1386. This indicates a nearly consistent decreasing trend in ILI cases, with a slight increase observed in Week27 (1487 to 1386). This drop reflects a low influenza activity period typical of the off-season, characterized by minimal community transmission and reduced ILI visits nationwide across multiple jurisdictions.
2. Given that the target Week32, 2023 falls just at the transition point from the off-season to the peak onset season based on U.S. historical epidemiological trends, the forecast aligns with the expected start of gradual rises from baseline activity without significant surges. Therefore, Week32, 2023 belongs to the peak onset season.
3. From the time-series trend, the consistent decline in ILI occurrences over five weeks, followed by general stabilization toward Week27, 2023, suggests a leveling-off of ILI activity. Using this pattern to project five weeks forward, ILI counts are estimated to slightly rise as activity begins to transition toward the peak onset season, with the anticipated value increasing to 1817 occurrences in Week32, 2023.
4. Influenza positivity in lab specimens has remained below 2% throughout recent weeks and reflects low viral transmission (Week23, 2023 #1; Week24, 2023 #1; Week27, 2023 #1). This low positivity thus indicates limited ILI impact, supporting a stable forecast for Week32, 2023.
5. Other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, continue to co-circulate nationally (Week23, 2023 #10; Week25, 2023 #10; Week26, 2023 #9). While their contribution complicates ILI attribution, these co-infections are present at low levels with no identified novel flu strains, reducing the likelihood of a spike in Week32, 2023.
6. Vaccination data remain underreported, with no significant trends in uptake influencing public immunity (Week23, 2023 #9; Week25, 2023 #9; Week26, 2023 #10). However, as public health interventions remain constant, their protective effect likely persists, holding ILI counts stable.
7. This forecast integrates a recent declining trend in ILI cases, the confirmed classification of Week32, 2023 as the peak onset season, and corroborating CDC findings indicating low influenza transmission and vaccine effectiveness trends. Accordingly, the forecast of 1817 cases in Week32, 2023 reflects the gradual seasonal emergence of influenza while considering consistent epidemiological patterns witnessed thus far.
