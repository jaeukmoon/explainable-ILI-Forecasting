1. The past ILI occurrence data for Region 8 from Week48, 2021 to Week52, 2021 shows a clear increasing trend. The values are as follows: 2084, 2117, 2313, 2550, and 3231. The total increase from Week48 to Week52 is 1147, reflecting a strong upward trajectory in the peak season, but Week5, 2022 is far beyond this peak.
2. Week5, 2022 belongs to the "Off-season" as defined in the background knowledge, which typically sees minimal activity near or below baseline. This is because the peak period (Weeks 46 to Week 6) for ILI occurrences will have passed, and respiratory illness activity is expected to decrease significantly after the peak season ends.
3. Historical data indicates a sharp decline in ILI activity after the peak period. Using the time-series data for calculation: the entire peak increase over the 5 weeks averages around \( (3231-2084) / 4 = 286.75 \) weekly. However, based on known seasonal trends and declines in ILI during the off-season, the drops have historically been steep. Assuming about a 65% reduction from the highest value due to the seasonal transition, the projection drops significantly to something like \(3231 \times 0.35 = 1131\), approximating the expected value.
4. There are three key CDC factors that strongly influence the forecast:
5. 1. Flu vaccination uptake is reported as lower compared to previous seasons across Week48 to Week52, 2021. This could slightly elevate baseline occurrences but will not sustain peak levels.
6. 2. Co-circulating multiple respiratory viruses, like SARS-CoV-2, complicated ILI assessments. However, as the CDC data reports indicate, most ILI-driven positivity rates relate to seasonal influenza, suggesting COVID-19 will not primarily inflate these numbers but will stabilize at off-season levels.
7. 3. Virus evolution shows most A(H3N2) cases still align with existing vaccine strains, which indicates partial antigenic drift but not enough to prolong intense transmission. Thus, typical off-season declines are expected.
5. The final prediction of 1125 reflects an expected off-season figure after the end of the high transmission period. Combining the historical decrease trend, peak-to-off-season seasonal shift, lower vaccination coverage, and alignment with previous viral patterns, the forecast value tempers the preceding growth trajectory and accounts for an anticipated return to baseline levels typical of off-season weeks.
