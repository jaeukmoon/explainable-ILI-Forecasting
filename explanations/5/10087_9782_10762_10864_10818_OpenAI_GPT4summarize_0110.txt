1. The reported ILI counts from Week26 to Week30, 2024, are 10087, 9782, 10762, 10864, and 10818. The trend shows an initial decrease from Week26 (10087) to Week27 (9782), followed by a noticeable increase in Week28 (10762), Week29 (10864), and Week30 (10818). Overall, the pattern suggests a slight upward trend in ILI occurrences over the last three weeks, indicating rising respiratory illness activity.
2. Forecasting target week (Week35, 2024) belongs to the peak onset season because Week35 typically marks the beginning of the period when ILI activity transitions from the off-season baseline to a gradual increase toward peak intensity.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the slight upward trend observed in recent weeks supports expectations for continued growth in ILI occurrences over five weeks. Historical patterns indicate that seasonal increases typically begin after Week30, driven by overlapping respiratory virus activity and early increases in influenza transmission during the peak onset season. This aligns with the projection of 15539 ILI occurrences in Week35, 2024.
4. Influenza activity remains low but stable with minimal positivity rates (Week26, 2024 #1; Week27, 2024 #1; Week28, 2024 #1). However, co-circulating respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, can contribute to rising respiratory illness visits in the near term (Week26, 2024 #10; Week28, 2024 #10; Week30, 2024 #6).
5. Current influenza strains exhibit strong antigenic similarity to the vaccine, with minimal antiviral resistance detected, suggesting that vaccination offers effective protection against complications (Week27, 2024 #7; Week28, 2024 #9; Week30, 2024 #7). However, vaccination trends and uptake remain unclear, potentially limiting population-level immunity benefits (Week27, 2024 #8; Week30, 2024 #9).
6. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness remain below baseline (Week26, 2024 #5; Week27, 2024 #4; Week30, 2024 #3), but the gradual increase in ILI activity and the onset of seasonal transitions indicate a potential rise in visits during the forecasted time frame. CDC's expectation of low current flu activity aligns with the typical early phase dynamics of the peak onset season (Week26, 2024 #10; Week29, 2024 #10; Week30, 2024 #10).
7. In summary, the projected value of 15539 for Week35, 2024, reflects the interplay of a mild upward trend in ILI occurrences, the anticipated start of the peak onset season, and the co-circulation of various respiratory pathogens driving increased activity. Other influencing factors include stable influenza activity, effective vaccines with unclear uptake, and increased outpatient respiratory visits indicative of rising illness levels. This projection aligns with expected early seasonal growth patterns.
