1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week16 to Week20, 2023 are 1264, 1205, 1083, 1070, and 1056. This indicates a steady decline in ILI activity over the past five weeks, with no significant spikes or rebounds observed. The trend shows consistent and gradual reduction, implying a tapering off of activity.
2. Week25, 2023 falls within the typical off-season in the U.S., spanning from Week1 through Week31 each year. The summarized CDC reports confirm ongoing low activity (Week16 to Week20, 2023 #1); therefore, the target week is classified as part of the off-season.
3. Based on the declining trend observed in the past weeks, with weekly decreases of ILI counts, a time-series forecasting model would project further reductions in activity over the subsequent five weeks. This aligns with the gradual decline in ILI occurrences, contributing to a forecast of 978 ILI occurrences in Week25, 2023.
4. Influenza activity remains low nationwide, with only 0.8–1.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza throughout the prior five weeks (Week16, 2023 #1; Week20, 2023 #1). This suggests a stable and minimal spread of influenza.
5. Vaccination efforts remain effective, with current vaccine strains highly similar to circulating viruses. Nearly 99–100% of tested influenza viruses are susceptible to recommended antivirals, reducing potential for severe outbreaks (Week16, 2023 #7; Week20, 2023 #8).
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV is evident but not showing significant surges in influenza-like trends (Week19, 2023 #9; Week20, 2023 #10). These overlapping respiratory illnesses complicate interpretation but have not contributed to increased influenza-driven ILI activity.
7. Considering the sustained decline in ILI reports, off-season classification, vaccine and antiviral effectiveness, and absence of significant contributors to a major surge, the projected ILI occurrence for Week25, 2023 is consistent with 978. This forecast reflects stable, low influenza activity during the off-season.
