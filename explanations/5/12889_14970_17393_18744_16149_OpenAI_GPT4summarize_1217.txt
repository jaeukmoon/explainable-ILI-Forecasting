1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating yet rising trajectory, with values of ['12889', '14970', '17393', '18744', '16149']. There was a sharp increase from 12889 (Week 49, 2023) to 18744 (Week 51, 2023), followed by a decline to 16149 (Week 52, 2023). Despite this dip, the overall trend remained elevated, reflecting persistent influenza activity during the observed period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the elevated ILI levels in Weeks 50 to 52, 2023, lay the foundation for the reported future ILI occurrence of 12895 (Week 6, 2024). While a decrease is seen from the peak in Week 51, the sustained high values indicate a lagged effect that would contribute to moderate ILI activity levels in upcoming weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily increased during Weeks 49 to 52, 2023, rising from 4.4% (Week 49, 2023) to 6.9% (Week 52, 2023), indicating an ongoing rise in healthcare encounters for respiratory illnesses. This upward trajectory aligns with the observed ILI trends and supports continued but slightly moderated activity levels five weeks later.
4. Influenza positivity rates climbed significantly, from 10.2% (Week 49, 2023) to 17.5% (Week 52, 2023), correlating with a corresponding rise in ILI activity. This gradual increase indicates sustained influenza spread, though the slight stabilization in Week 1, 2024, aligns with the subsequent reduction in total ILI activity by Week 6, 2024.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, alongside the dominance of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, reported across Weeks 49 to 1, 2024, contributed to dynamic ILI activity. These external drivers likely sustained ILI levels while balancing decreases in influenza-specific indicators.
6. In summary, the reported 12895 future ILI occurrences (Week 6, 2024) are explained by the elevated past occurrences during Weeks 49 to 52, 2023, rising outpatient ILI visits and influenza positivity rates over the same time, and the concurrent effects of co-circulating respiratory illnesses maintaining activity at moderate levels.
