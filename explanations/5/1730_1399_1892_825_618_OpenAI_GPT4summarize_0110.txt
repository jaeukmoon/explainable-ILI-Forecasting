1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week3, 2021 to Week7, 2021 are 1730, 1399, 1892, 825, and 618. The trend indicates a sharp decline over these five weeks, particularly from Week3 (1730) to Week7 (618), with an initial rise from Week3 (1730) to Week5 (1892) before a significant drop afterward. This declining trajectory signals reduced influenza activity in the observed period.
2. Forecasting for Week12, 2021 aligns with the off-season as it occurs after the typical peak season (which generally spans up to Week6). The persistently low influenza activity levels in the past five weeks (Week3 to Week7, 2021) further reinforce that Week12, 2021 is part of the off-season.
3. Based on time-series analysis, the sharp downward trend observed (Week3, 2021: 1730 to Week7, 2021: 618) suggests a continuation of low flu activity levels. However, the ILI count projection to 1010 for Week12, 2021 reflects a minor rebound, considering epidemiological factors like gradual increases in children’s ILI visits noted in the recent CDC reports.
4. CDC reports show consistently minimal influenza activity (Week3 2021 #1; Week4 2021 #1; Week5 2021 #1; Week6 2021 #1; Week7 2021 #1), with respiratory specimen positivity remaining exceptionally low (0.1%-0.3%). This reflects atypical trends, possibly linked to pandemic-driven behaviors.
5. COVID-19 continues to alter healthcare-seeking behaviors and data reporting accuracy for ILI surveillance (Week3 2021 #7; Week5 2021 #9; Week7 2021 #9). This factor introduces uncertainty but does not indicate a major resurgence in influenza activity.
6. Slight increases in ILI trends among children aged 0–4 years over recent weeks (Week7 2021 #12) indicate a potential for localized rises in ILI transmission, though older age groups show stable or declining trends. This trend likely influences the projected rebound to 1010 occurrences.
7. The forecasted value of 1010 ILI occurrences in Week12, 2021 reflects the off-season timing of reduced influenza activity combined with minimal healthcare disruptions and slight increases in specific age-group trends. Low flu positivity, suppressed viral activity, and ongoing pandemic-driven influences reinforce this estimate.
