1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a sharp upward trend with values of ['1408', '1325', '1437', '1746', '2250']. After an initial decline from 1408 in Week48, 2021, to 1325 in Week49, 2021, there was a recovery and consistent increase, peaking at 2250 in Week52, 2021, the highest in this period. This pattern reflects a steady escalation in ILI activity toward the end of the 5-week period.
2. A strong correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is present, as the continued increase in ILI values, especially the significant rise in Week51–52, 2021, aligns with the reported future value of 1057 after 5 weeks. This consistent upward trajectory toward Week52, 2021, provides a foundation for the elevated future occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI rose over the 5 weeks, exceeding the baseline and reaching 4.8% by Week52, 2021, compared to just 2.5% in Week48, 2021. This consistent growth in outpatient respiratory illness indicates increasing flu activity contributing to the elevated future ILI occurrences.
4. Hospitalization rates due to influenza consistently rose, with 1,825 new admissions reported in Week51, 2021, and a cumulative rate of 2.6 per 100,000 by Week52, 2021, indicating worsening severity of respiratory illnesses, fueling the future ILI occurrences.
5. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded the epidemic threshold throughout the 5 weeks, climbing from 17.5% in Week48, 2021, to 19.9% in Week52, 2021. This persistent PIC mortality rate reflects heightened respiratory illness activity consistent with increased ILI occurrences.
6. Despite a lower vaccination uptake compared to the previous season, flu activity was dominated by Influenza A(H3N2), accounting for over 98% of cases each week and intensifying by Week52, 2021. This indicates reduced immunity, partially responsible for the future surge to 1057 ILI cases.
7. In summary, the future occurrence of 1057 is explained by the significant upward trend in ILI activity through Week52, 2021, rising outpatient ILI visits, escalating hospitalization and PIC mortality rates, and reduced vaccination effectiveness amid intensified influenza circulation driven by A(H3N2).
