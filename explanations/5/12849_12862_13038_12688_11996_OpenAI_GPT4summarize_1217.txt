1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks indicated a fluctuating but largely declining trend: 12849 (Week 18, 2024) to 12862 (Week 19, 2024), followed by 13038 (Week 20, 2024), then decreasing to 12688 (Week 21, 2024) and further down to 11996 (Week 22, 2024). The highest activity was observed in Week 20, 2024, before progressively tapering in subsequent weeks, signaling a continuous drop in ILI activity by the end of the observed period.
2. The declining trend in the past ILI occurrences correlates with the lower future ILI occurrences of 7806 (Week 27, 2024). The steady reduction in Weeks 21–22, 2024, set a precedent for a continued decrease, reflecting lower respiratory illness activity after 5 weeks. The consistent stabilization of ILI activity below baseline thresholds supports this descending trend.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable but below baseline, shifting only marginally from 2.1% (Week 18, 2024) to 1.9% (Weeks 21 and 22, 2024); this continuous decline indicates diminished healthcare encounters for respiratory symptoms, contributing to the lower future ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to influenza consistently accounted for just 0.1–0.2% of all deaths during this period (Weeks 18–22, 2024), showcasing stable mortality trends with no significant uptick linked to influenza. This absence of excess mortality indicates limited severe ILI activity to fuel future increases.
5. Nationwide influenza activity consistently decreased, with positivity rates falling from 3.1% (Week 18, 2024) to 1.8% (Week 22, 2024). Dominance of Influenza A, stable vaccination coverage, robust antiviral effectiveness, and low hospitalization rates all contributed to keeping influenza and ILI activity low, aligning with the reduced future occurrences of 7806 (Week 27, 2024).
6. In summary, the reported 7806 future ILI occurrences (Week 27, 2024) are attributable to the declining trend in past occurrences (Weeks 18–22, 2024), steady reductions in ILI-related outpatient visits below baseline levels, stable influenza mortality and hospitalization rates, high antiviral efficacy, and reduced positivity rates, all pointing towards an overall drop in respiratory illness activity.
