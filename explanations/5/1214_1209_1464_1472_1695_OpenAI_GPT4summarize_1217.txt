1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited an upward trend overall, with values of ['1214', '1209', '1464', '1472', '1695']. After minimal variation between Week45, 2020 (1214) and Week46, 2020 (1209), there was a sharp increase starting Week47, 2020 (1464), culminating in a peak at Week49, 2020 (1695). This steady escalation suggests heightened ILI activity leading into the future period.
2. The future ILI occurrences (1475 at Week54, 2020) correlate with the past trend, as the progressive rise in Weeks47-49, 2020 foreshadowed sustained ILI activity. The value of 1475 aligns well with the elevated ILI levels observed in Week49 (1695), indicating a continuation of the established trend with some normalization.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI rose slightly from 1.5% in Week45, 2020 to 1.6% in Week47-49, 2020. Though below the national baseline of 2.6%, this stability at a relatively heightened level can support an ongoing elevated ILI activity post Week49, 2020.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) increased from 8.9% in Week45, 2020 to 14.3% in Week49, 2020, consistently well above epidemic thresholds. This persistent respiratory-associated mortality aligns with the continued elevated respiratory illness and contributes to the reported future ILI occurrences.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behavior and ILI surveillance, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and documented weekly, introduced inconsistencies in capturing true influenza activity. These disruptions likely obscured data but may have amplified future ILI cases as healthcare and surveillance patterns adjusted.
6. Despite unusually low influenza activity across Weeks45-49, 2020 (e.g., positivity rates as low as 0.1%), the escalated ILI trends suggest contributions from non-influenza respiratory pathogens or residual pandemic impacts, influencing the recorded future ILI cases.
7. In summary, the reported 1475 future ILI occurrences (Week54, 2020) can be attributed to the upward trends in Weeks47-49, 2020, stable outpatient ILI visit percentages, heightened PIC mortality, and the influence of pandemic-driven healthcare-seeking and surveillance adaptations.
