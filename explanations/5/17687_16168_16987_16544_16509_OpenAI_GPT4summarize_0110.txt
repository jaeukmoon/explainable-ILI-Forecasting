1. The reported ILI occurrences for Week5 to Week9, 2024 are 17687, 16168, 16987, 16544, and 16509. These show a declining trend from Week5 to Week6, a slight rebound in Week7, and a gradual stabilization in Week8 and Week9. This pattern indicates an initial decrease followed by mild fluctuations, with no sharp surges or drastic drops, suggesting that ILI occurrences are moving toward stabilization as influenza activity reduces.
2. Week14, 2024, as the target week, falls beyond the peak influenza season, which typically ends by Week6 in most years in the U.S. The ongoing decrease and relative stabilization of indicators by Week9, 2024 suggest that Week14, 2024 belongs to the off-season when ILI activity generally remains at reduced levels with limited community spread.
3. From the time-series perspective, the gradual decline followed by stabilization in ILI occurrences indicates that influenza activity has passed its peak for the season. Projecting forward based on this historically consistent behavior and the absence of any significant upward drivers, the forecast aligns with a progressive decline in occurrences, leading to the prediction of 13338 for Week14, 2024.
4. Several factors from the CDC reports influence this forecast:
5. - Positivity rates for respiratory specimens have decreased slightly, from 15.8% in Week5, 2024 to 13.9% in Week9, 2024, indicating a gradual reduction in influenza transmission.
6. - Hospitalization rates show stabilization, with only minor week-over-week increases, and the cumulative rate (64.8 per 100,000 in Week9) remains elevated but not surging. This supports reduced flu-related severity trends.
7. - No novel influenza strains or significant antiviral resistance were observed during this period. With vaccination coverage providing continued protection and alignment with circulating strains, the risk of an uncontrolled spike in ILI activity is minimized.
5. Similarly, influenza-related outpatient visits have been persistently above baseline (4.4–4.1% for Week5 to Week9), but the slight decline in Week9 (4.1%) supports waning activity. Co-circulating viruses (RSV, COVID-19) contribute marginally to ILI trends but show no indication of triggering any significant increases.
6. Regional variations continue, and certain areas still experience elevated flu activity (e.g., Influenza B presence in specific jurisdictions), but these have largely localized impacts. Influenza predominance remains relatively unchanged (A(H1N1) pdm09 predominant, some increase in Influenza B/Victoria), containing the overall scale of spread.
7. The forecast of 13338 captures the stabilization of ILI activity transitioning into the off-season. The projected value reflects the confluence of a stabilized trend, seasonality (off-season positioning), and mitigating effects such as sustained vaccination and the absence of new influenza strains or resistance.
