1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a clear upward trend, with values of ['1476', '1629', '2035', '2037', '2328']. Starting at 1476 (Week 36, 2023), there was a steady increase over the first three weeks, reaching 2037 (Week 38, 2023). This was followed by a further rise to 2328, the highest in the period, during Week 40, 2023. This consistent increase indicates escalating ILI activity leading up to Week 40, 2023.
2. A positive correlation is observed between the increasing past ILI occurrences and the future ILI report of 3085. The upward trend seen during Weeks 38–40, 2023, particularly the sustained growth in Weeks 39–40, 2023, aligns with and suggests a continuation of rising ILI occurrences, culminating in the reported future value.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed notable increases across the weeks, rising incrementally from 2.0% (Week 36, 2023) to 2.2% (Week 40, 2023). A significant proportion of these visits involved children aged 0-4 years, with rates increasing consistently from 6.5% (Week 36, 2023) to 7.1% (Week 39, 2023). This demographic’s high ILI rates likely contributed significantly to the future increase in occurrences.
4. Hospitalizations due to laboratory-confirmed influenza rose steadily, with weekly totals increasing from 775 (Week 36, 2023) to 1,127 (Week 40, 2023). This continuous surge in flu-related hospital admissions reflects intensifying respiratory illness burdens, directly influencing the cumulative rise in ILI occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV, was reported consistently across all weeks, contributing to overall ILI activity. This persistent overlap of multiple pathogens likely amplified ILI rates, leading to the recorded rise to 3085 after 5 weeks.
6. In summary, the reported 3085 future ILI occurrences (Week 45, 2023) can be attributed to the upward trend in past ILI data (Weeks 36–40, 2023), increasing outpatient ILI visits, escalating influenza-related hospitalizations, and the amplification of ILI cases caused by concurrent circulation of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV.
