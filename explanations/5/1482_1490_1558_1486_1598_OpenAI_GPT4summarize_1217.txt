1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend, with values of ['1482', '1490', '1558', '1486', '1598']. There was a slight initial increase from 1482 (Week15, 2021) to 1490 (Week16, 2021), followed by a sharp increase to 1558 (Week17, 2021). This was immediately followed by a decrease to 1486 (Week18, 2021) and an eventual rise to the peak value of 1598 (Week19, 2021), suggesting variable but generally consistent ILI activity throughout the period.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 1474 in Week24, 2021, aligns with the fluctuations seen during Weeks15–19, 2021, where peak values (1598 in Week19, 2021) slightly decreased and closely match earlier lower levels, such as 1482 (Week15, 2021). This demonstrates a moderately stable correlation between the heightened activity in later weeks of the past time series and the subsequent mild reduction observed in the future weeks.
3. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained consistently above epidemic thresholds across every week, decreasing slightly from 12.4% (Week15, 2021) to 10.1% (Week19, 2021). These persistently elevated proportions largely driven by COVID-19 reflect ongoing respiratory illnesses that influence ILI trends.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI stabilized at 1.1% during Week15–17, 2021, slightly rising to 1.2% by Week18–19, 2021, though still below the 2.6% national baseline. This stability and small rise in ILI visits reflect the continued presence of ILI activity despite low influenza and hospitalization rates.
5. The dominance of COVID-19 in PIC data and the unusually low influenza positivity rates (0.1% across all weeks) indicate that non-influenza illnesses contributed disproportionately to ILI activity. This is consistent with fluctuations in ILI occurrences that reflect non-influenza respiratory factors impacting both the observed past and future data.
4. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 1474 in Week24, 2021, can be explained by the fluctuating trend in Weeks15–19, 2021, a persistent high proportion of deaths attributed to PIC, stable outpatient visits for ILI, and the continued dominance of COVID-19 over traditional influenza activity. These factors, coupled with reduced but ongoing low-severity influenza transmission during this period, collectively shaped the reported future ILI occurrences.
