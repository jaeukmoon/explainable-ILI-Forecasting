1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 44–48, 2021) showed a fluctuating pattern with values ['2107', '2109', '2190', '1855', '2084']. After a slight increase between Week 44 (2107) and Week 45 (2109), the numbers peaked in Week 46 (2190), followed by a sharp drop in Week 47 (1855). Then there was a slight recovery to 2084 in Week 48. This oscillation indicates variability in ILI activity during the observed period but with no clear sustained upward or downward trend.
2. The increase from 2084 (Week 48, 2021) to 3203 after five weeks (Week 1, 2022) reflects a strong positive rise in future ILI occurrences. While the initially erratic patterns in past occurrences didn’t consistently climb, the uptick toward the national ILI baseline (reached in Week 48) and co-circulating illnesses signaled an impending amplification, corresponding to the subsequent surge.
3. ILI outpatient visits showed consistent increases over the period, rising from 2.1% in Week 44 to reaching the national baseline of 2.5% in Week 48. Regions 1, 2, 3, and 7 surpassing their baselines further demonstrated increasing respiratory illness activity, contributing directly to the elevated future ILI counts.
4. Hospitalization trends linked to confirmed influenza steadily rose each week, starting with 295 in Week 44 and reaching 841 in Week 48. This steady rise in severe cases, especially from dominant A(H3N2) influenza activity, signals aggravating flu conditions fueling subsequent future ILI occurrences.
5. The substantial percentage of PIC deaths above the epidemic threshold (e.g., 14.1% in Week 44 and peaking at 17.5% in Week 48), primarily driven by COVID-19, reflects wider respiratory illness co-occurrence, amplifying ILI trends. Combined with altered healthcare-seeking behaviors and co-circulating non-influenza viruses, these dynamics likely underpinned the sharp jump to 3203 after five weeks.
6. In summary, the surge to 3203 future ILI occurrences (Week 1, 2022) stems from increased ILI outpatient visits reaching baseline, climbing influenza-related hospitalizations, persistent excess PIC mortality, and the impact of co-circulating respiratory illnesses during the observed period.
