1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a general upward trend, with values of ['1013', '975', '949', '1099', '1213']. After an initial decrease from 1013 (Week8, 2021) to 949 (Week10, 2021), there was a sharp increase to 1099 (Week11, 2021) and then to 1213 in Week12, 2021. This sharp rise in Weeks11 and 12 indicates heightened ILI activity toward the end of the reporting period.
2. A positive correlation is evident between the observed increase in ILI occurrences in Week11 and Week12, 2021, and the future report of 1558 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week17, 2021). The upward trend during the latter part of the time-series serves as an indicator for the further amplified rise in future ILI cases.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at 0.9% from Week8 to Week12, 2021, but the sustained low baseline alongside slight increasing trends in pediatric ILI cases (Week9 and Week12, 2021) suggests potential underreporting or delayed recognition, which likely contributed to the sharp rise in future occurrences.
4. Elevated percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic thresholds, decreasing from 16.4% (Week8) to 11.4% (Week12, 2021) while remaining far above the 7% threshold. The persistent high PIC mortality indicates heightened respiratory illness activity, aligning with the observed future ILI surge.
5. Ongoing disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance interpretations due to the COVID-19 pandemic were repeatedly highlighted throughout the CDC reports (Week8–Week12, 2021). These disruptions likely caused lagging case detection and concentrated reporting in future weeks, contributing to the sharp increase in ILI occurrences to 1558 in Week17, 2021.
6. Despite low influenza positivity rates (0.1% consistently across Week8–Week12, 2021) and minimal lab detections, the reported rise in ILI occurrences signals contributions from non-specific respiratory illnesses or unidentified pathogens. Pandemic-related influences likely amplified reported ILI activity, contributing to the sudden future surge.
7. In summary, the reported 1558 future ILI occurrences (Week17, 2021) can be attributed to the sharp upward trend in Weeks11 and 12, 2021, slight increases in pediatric ILI cases, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, disruptions in surveillance and reporting due to COVID-19 influences, and possible contributions from non-specific respiratory illnesses.
