1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent declining trend, with values of ['1475' (Week 1, 2021), '1259' (Week 2, 2021), '1042' (Week 3, 2021), '883' (Week 4, 2021), '812' (Week 5, 2021)]. There was a steady weekly reduction, demonstrating decreasing ILI activity throughout this period. This pattern reflects suppressed transmission of influenza and limited ILI cases.

2. The distinct reduction in ILI activity observed in the past weeks (Weeks 1–5, 2021) corresponds inversely to the reported future occurrences of 606 after 5 weeks (Week 10, 2021). The continued decline to Week 5 likely contributed to an eventual stabilization or minimal residual activity, as reflected in the lower future ILI count.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI dropped from 1.7% (Week 1, 2021) to 1.1% (Week 5, 2021), remaining consistently below the national baseline of 2.6% and aligned with declining ILI occurrences. This lack of significant outpatient activity indicates subdued influenza transmission leading to lower future occurrences.

4. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) deaths stayed elevated, ranging from 17.2% (Week 1, 2021) to 25.0% (Week 5, 2021), heavily driven by COVID-19 rather than influenza. This indirectly implies that severe respiratory illnesses were largely unrelated to influenza, correlating with the lower future ILI count.

5. Influenza positivity rates were notably low throughout (e.g., 0.4% in Week 1, 2021, and 0.1% in Weeks 4–5, 2021), reflecting historically mild influenza activity. The negligible lab-confirmed influenza rates strongly align with low ILI levels reported in both past and future weeks.

6. The ongoing influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare-seeking behavior and ILI surveillance likely contributed to the reduced reporting of non-COVID-related respiratory illnesses, resulting in declining ILI trends and the low future count of 606.

7. In summary, the reported 606 future ILI occurrences (Week 10, 2021) are attributable to the consistent decline in ILI trends from Weeks 1–5, 2021, persistently low outpatient ILI visits, negligible influenza positivity rates, PIC mortality driven by non-influenza factors, and pandemic-induced changes in healthcare utilization and reporting. These factors collectively support the subdued ILI activity observed in both the past and future time frames.
