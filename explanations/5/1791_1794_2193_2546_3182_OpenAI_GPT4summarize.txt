1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a clear upward trend, with values increasing from 1791 (Week 25, 2021) to 3182 (Week 29, 2021). The rise was gradual at first, with only modest increases during Weeks 25–27, followed by a more pronounced escalation from Week 27 to Week 29, where the sharpest increase (636 cases) occurred. This upward trajectory indicates a consistent growth in ILI activity throughout the observed 5-week period.  

2. The future ILI occurrence of 3784 (Week 34, 2021) aligns with the observed upward momentum in the past data. The continuous increase toward the end of the 5 weeks (Week 29, 2021) correlates with the future rise. The stronger increment during the final weeks acts as a precursor to the post-5-week spike, suggesting a causal link between the strengthening trend and the observed future count.  

3. Slight increases in outpatient visits for ILI over Weeks 25–29, from 1.2% to 1.7%, particularly among younger age groups (e.g., ages 0–4, 5–24, and 25–49), correlate with the rise in ILI occurrences. The parallel growth in these visit percentages signals increasing care-seeking behavior tied to respiratory illnesses, contributing to higher future reported ILI cases.  
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) climbed steadily during Weeks 25–29 (6.6% in Week 25 to 7.4% in Week 29), consistently exceeding the epidemic thresholds. These higher percentages, linked primarily to COVID-19, mirror an upward trend in respiratory illnesses, reinforcing the observed increase in ILI numbers.  
5. Persistent disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior and surveillance accuracy due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic were detailed in all reports. These disruptions likely resulted in delayed case recognitions or underreporting in prior weeks, with the accumulated effects eventually reflected in the spike to 3784 occurrences 5 weeks later.  

4. In summary, the reported 3784 ILI occurrences (Week 34, 2021) are driven by the pronounced upward trend during Weeks 25–29, 2021, the increasing ILI-related outpatient visits, consistently elevated PIC mortality percentages exceeding epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-related challenges in healthcare-seeking and surveillance systems that amplified subsequent reporting.
