1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating but stable pattern, with values of ['11487', '11116', '11730', '11738', '11489']. While there was a slight dip from 11487 (Week 38, 2021) to 11116 (Week 39, 2021), the subsequent weeks (Week 40, 2021, to Week 42, 2021) showed a subtle rebound and similarity in values, indicating no drastic changes in ILI levels but maintaining a consistent baseline.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is noted, as the stability in ILI activity during the past 5 weeks reflects ongoing respiratory illness patterns, potentially leading to the reported surge to 15058 in Week 47, 2021. The consistent baseline of around 11489–11738 occurrences (Weeks 40–42, 2021) suggests a groundwork for increasing activity in subsequent weeks.
3. Healthcare disruptions due to COVID-19 significantly influenced ILI data interpretation across all 5 weeks. For instance, shifts in care-seeking behaviors and concurrent respiratory pathogens repeatedly complicated surveillance, likely contributing to a delayed buildup in observed ILI occurrences.
4. The percentage of outpatient visits due to ILI remained below the national baseline, stable at 1.9% (Weeks 38–40, 2021) before decreasing to 1.8% (Weeks 41–42, 2021). This steady yet subtle activity hints at the potential for underreported or suppressed cases that could eventually surface as higher future ILI counts.
5. The persistent high PIC-related mortality rates, ranging from 20.9% (Week 38, 2021) to 16.5% (Week 42, 2021), far above epidemic thresholds, reflect heightened respiratory disease activity, primarily driven by COVID-19 but likely correlating to increases in overall respiratory illness, including future ILI occurrences.
6. Low influenza circulation was consistently reported, with laboratory positivity rates as low as 0.1% (Weeks 40–42, 2021). While influenza cases were minimal, other respiratory viruses and overlapping SARS-CoV-2 trends were recognized as contributing factors to ILI increases, underlining the role of non-influenza pathogens in driving future ILI counts.
7. In summary, the increase to 15058 ILI occurrences by Week 47, 2021, can be attributed to consistent past ILI activity, surveillance complexity driven by COVID-19, underreported outpatient ILI trends, persistently high PIC mortality, and contributions from non-influenza respiratory pathogens alongside behavioral shifts in healthcare-seeking patterns.
