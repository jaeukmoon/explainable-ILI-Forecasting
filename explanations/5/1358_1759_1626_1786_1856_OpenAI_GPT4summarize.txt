1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating yet overall increasing trend, with values of ['1358', '1759', '1626', '1786', '1856']. After an initial surge from 1358 (Week 16, 2021) to 1759 (Week 17, 2021), there was a slight dip to 1626 in Week 18, 2021, followed by a rise to 1786 in Week 19, 2021, and 1856 in Week 20, 2021. This pattern indicates an upward progression of ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period.

2. A positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the increasing trend observed in the latter weeks of past data (Weeks 19–20, 2021) aligns with the future ILI value of 1791 after 5 additional weeks (Week 25, 2021). The steady increases in Weeks 19 and 20 act as an indicator of the persistent and slightly elevated ILI activity reflected in the future data.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained low but showed a gradual and persistent increase, from 1.1% (Week 16, 2021) to 1.3% (Week 20, 2021). Although this remains below the national baseline of 2.6%, the consistent rise in healthcare encounters for influenza-like illnesses suggests continued ILI activity into the future period.

4. Persistent PIC mortality percentages above epidemic thresholds were observed, decreasing slightly from 11.8% in Week 16, 2021, to 9.5% in Week 20, 2021, as COVID-19 remained the dominating factor. While influenza positivity remained low (0.1% across all weeks), the elevated PIC mortality indicates a background level of ongoing respiratory illnesses, which correlates with the sustained ILI occurrences.

5. The concurrent impact of COVID-19 on healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI surveillance was emphasized in all reports, leading to data disruptions and altered reporting patterns. These changes likely masked immediate declines while concentrating activity, contributing to the reported future value of 1791 occurrences.

6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 1791 in Week 25, 2021, can be explained by the overall upward trend in past occurrences during Weeks 19–20, 2021, the steady rise in outpatient visits for ILI, sustained PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the compounding impacts of pandemic-related healthcare-seeking and surveillance challenges.
