1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a significant upward trend, with values of ['1125', '1111', '1182', '1261', '1512']. Activity decreased slightly from 1125 (Week 5, 2022) to 1111 (Week 6, 2022), but rose continuously from 1182 (Week 7, 2022) to 1512 (Week 9, 2022), marking a steady escalation in ILI activity by the end of the observed period.
2. A positive correlation exists between the increasing trend in past ILI occurrences and the reported future occurrence of 2096 (Week 14, 2022). The sustained rise seen in Weeks 7–9, 2022, acts as a precursor to the substantial growth in ILI counts after 5 weeks.
3. Hospitalization rates steadily climbed over the weeks, increasing from 4.5 per 100,000 (Week 5, 2022) to 5.5 per 100,000 (Week 9, 2022). This consistent rise indicated severe respiratory illness activity, influencing the subsequent surge in ILI cases.
4. Positive influenza test rates increased from 2.0% (Week 5, 2022) to 5.8% (Week 9, 2022). This growing positivity rate highlights the expanding spread of influenza, primarily driven by the dominant A(H3N2) strain, contributing to elevated future ILI occurrences.
5. The co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory illnesses, observed in 5.9%-6.1% of influenza-positive specimens during Weeks 7-9, 2022, likely exacerbated respiratory infections, further driving future ILI levels.
6. In summary, the rise to 2096 occurrences (Week 14, 2022) can be attributed to the clear upward trajectory in past ILI data, increasing hospitalization rates, rising influenza test positivity, and the impact of co-circulating respiratory pathogens, especially A(H3N2) and SARS-CoV-2.
