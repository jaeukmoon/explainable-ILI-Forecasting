1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a steady upward trend, starting from 1761 (Week 29, 2023) and ascending through 1721, 1888, 1992, and reaching 2122 by Week 33, 2023. This consistent increase demonstrates a gradual rise in respiratory illness activity over this period, with a noticeable acceleration in later weeks.
2. A strong positive correlation is observed between the past time-series data and the future occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 38, 2023). The continuous rise in ILI cases, from 1992 (Week 32, 2023) to 2122 (Week 33, 2023), may serve as an indicator of the subsequent sharp increase to 4104 after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient respiratory illness visits rose steadily from 1.1% in Week 29, 2023, to 1.5% by Week 33, 2023, coinciding with increasing ILI activity in children under 5 years, peaking at 6.3% in Week 33. This age-group-specific rise likely contributes significantly to the jump in ILI cases after 5 weeks. Hospitalization trends also support this, with admissions fluctuating between 573 and 677 from Week 29 to Week 32 but dropping to 477 in Week 33, indicative of possible data lag or a shift toward outpatient care.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, rising sharply from 5.6% in Week 29, 2023, to 10.0% in Week 33, 2023. Although influenza-specific mortality remained low, the persistent PIC mortality aligns with the observed increase in ILI activity and suggests heightened respiratory illness burden.
5. Increasing co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, substantially contributed to the growth in ILI cases, as reported across Weeks 29-33, 2023. The unpredictable interactions between these pathogens likely amplified ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
7. In summary, the reported 4104 future ILI occurrences (Week 38, 2023) can be explained by the upward trajectory in past ILI trends, rising outpatient respiratory illness visits, persistently high PIC mortality, and the dynamic influence of co-circulating viruses, which collectively fueled the surge.
