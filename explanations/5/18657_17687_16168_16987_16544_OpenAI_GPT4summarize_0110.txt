1. The ILI counts in Week4, 2024 through Week8, 2024 are 18657, 17687, 16168, 16987, and 16544. These data show a consistent decreasing trend from Week4 (18657) to Week6 (16168), followed by a slight rebound in Week7 (16987) and a minor decline in Week8 (16544). This reflects an overall decline with fluctuations but no significant resurgence during these weeks.
2. Week13, 2024 corresponds to the off-season period because it occurs after the typical peak season (Week46 to about Week6 in the following year). The moderate decrease in influenza positivity and stable activity show diminishing intensity, consistent with off-season classification.
3. The observed pattern reflects a diminishing trend in ILI activities, supported by reduced positivity rates (Week8, 2024 #1), stable hospitalization rates (Week8, 2024 #4), and reduced mortality (Week8, 2024 #6). A time-series projection aligned with these trends justifies a further decline toward 13834 ILI occurrences by Week13, 2024, indicative of a settling toward the off-season baseline.
4. From Week4 to Week8, influenza positivity steadily declined (Week4, 2024 #1; Week5, 2024 #1; Week6, 2024 #1; Week7, 2024 #1; Week8, 2024 #1), and outpatient respiratory illness visits have remained stable, albeit elevated (Week8, 2024 #7). The lower proportion of Influenza B (tied to late-season patterns) relative to Influenza A (Week8, 2024 #2) signals a decelerating trend that corresponds with off-season characteristics.
5. Vaccination emphasis continues but with no significant increase reported from Week4 to Week8, 2024 (Week4, 2024 #7; Week5, 2024 #7; Week6, 2024 #7; Week7, 2024 #7; Week8, 2024 #8). Strong vaccine matches to circulating strains (Week8, 2024 #8) reinforce prevention among populations, contributing to the declining trajectory.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and RSV) are persistent but do not dominate as primary drivers of ILI surges (Week4, 2024 #8; Week5, 2024 #10; Week6, 2024 #9; Week7, 2024 #9; Week8, 2024 #10). Their consistent presence aligns with the season's stabilization of overall respiratory trends.
7. Combining these factors—the declining positivity and ILI trends, off-season timing, stable vaccination and hospitalization rates, and minimal influence of co-infections—the projected 13834 ILI occurrences for Week13, 2024 reflect a continuous step-down from Week8 to the off-season baseline activity.
