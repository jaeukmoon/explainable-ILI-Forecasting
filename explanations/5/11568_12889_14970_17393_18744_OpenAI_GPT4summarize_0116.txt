1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from the past five weeks (Week48, 2023 to Week52, 2023) in Region 2 show a consistent increasing trend: 11568, 12889, 14970, 17393, and 18744. The week-over-week percentage increases are approximately 11.4%, 16.2%, 16.2%, and 7.8%, indicating the rate of increase slowed toward the last recorded week (Week52, 2023). This signals that while ILI occurrences are still rising, the acceleration in growth appears to be tapering, suggesting a potential peak or stabilization soon.
2. Week5, 2024 falls within the peak season for influenza in the U.S., which generally extends from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the following year. Given the increasing influenza activity reported in the CDC summaries and the continuation of high positivity rates for influenza across the U.S., Week5, 2024 is expected to exhibit significant ILI activity characteristic of the peak season.
3. The correlation analysis between past trends and future ILI occurrences involves projecting forward based on the observed week-over-week percentage increases. From Week48, 2023 to Week52, 2023, the average week-over-week growth rate was approximately 12.9%. However, considering the tapering observed in the past two weeks, a progressively diminishing growth rate—around 5-7% weekly—is applied to estimate the future trajectory. Starting with Week52, 2023 (18744 ILI occurrences) and applying an adjusted decreasing week-over-week growth rate for five weeks, the occurrences decline as the peak season progresses toward stabilization. The exact calculation follows:
4. Week1, 2024 = 18744 × (1 + 0.07) ≈ 20036
5. Week2, 2024 = 20036 × (1 + 0.06) ≈ 21238
6. Week3, 2024 = 21238 × (1 + 0.05) ≈ 22299
7. Week4, 2024 = 22299 × (1 + 0.04) ≈ 23191
8. Week5, 2024 = 23191 × (1 - 0.05) ≈ 12486, accounting for a projected peak stabilization and slight drop typical of the phase following the influenza peak season.
4. Three key factors from the summarized CDC reports strongly influencing the forecast are:
5. a. Nationwide influenza activity is significantly elevated with increasing influenza positivity rates, jumping from 6.8% in Week48, 2023 to 17.5% in Week52, 2023. This reflects ongoing high transmission rates, which support continued elevated ILI occurrences through Week5, 2024.
6. b. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 remains the predominant circulating strain, with high genetic match to vaccines and low antiviral resistance. This suggests a reduction in severe cases and hospitalizations might begin to temper ILI trends over the next five weeks as vaccination efforts continue.
7. c. Cumulative hospitalization rates and outpatient visits for ILI are rising sharply, suggesting high healthcare-seeking rates during this period, which aligns with the peak season trajectory. For example, ILI outpatient visit rates rose from 4.0% in Week48 to 6.9% in Week52, 2023, reinforcing that ILI activity should remain elevated.
5. The projected ILI occurrences of 12486 for Week5, 2024 result from an integration of statistical time-series analysis and external factors. Historical growth trends are tempered by a deceleration in week-over-week increases, CDC surveillance data showing elevated activity typical of peak season, and vaccine effectiveness counterbalancing the spread. Together, these indicate that Week5, 2024 will mark the peak season's conclusion, with ILI occurrences stabilizing and beginning to decline.
