1. The past time-series ILI occurrences show a significant decline over the 5 weeks, starting from 1230 (Week 48, 2020) and steadily dropping to 1069 (Week 52, 2020). This downward trend is consistent, with values decreasing from 1340 (Week 49, 2020) to 1263 (Week 50, 2020), 1077 (Week 51, 2020), and 1069 (Week 52, 2020), reflecting a clear reduction in reported ILI cases over the observed period.

2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the sharp decline in past weekly ILI occurrences does not directly predict the abrupt drop to 757 future ILI occurrences by Week 5, 2021. However, the steady downward trend in the last weeks (Weeks 51 and 52, 2020) aligns with the markedly lower ILI activity reported after five weeks, indicating a possible extension of the same trend.

3. Several factors from the summarized reports are likely linked to the decline in future ILI occurrences:
   - **Extremely low influenza activity**: Influenza positivity rates remained exceptionally low, between 0.1% (Week 48, 2020) and 0.3% (Weeks 50–52, 2020), suggesting limited circulation of influenza viruses and contributing to lower ILI counts.
   - **Impact of COVID-19-related public health measures**: Extensive public health interventions such as masking, social distancing, and reduced interpersonal contact were noted as key contributors to minimizing traditional influenza transmission, keeping both past and future ILI activity suppressed.
   - **Altered healthcare-seeking behaviors**: Ongoing disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic influenced care-seeking trends and underreporting of ILI cases, as highlighted in all reports. These changes likely resulted in suppressed ILI reporting and a reduction in apparent case numbers.
   - **Dominance of non-influenza pathogens**: Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold (12.8%–13.6%), primarily driven by COVID-19-related cases, further overshadowing traditional ILI cases tied to seasonal flu.

4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences dropping to 757 (Week 5, 2021) can be attributed to the consistent decline in past occurrences (Weeks 48–52, 2020), exceptionally low influenza circulation, the impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures, and changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors, all of which collectively limited respiratory illness activity and contributed to the atypically low ILI figures observed.
