1. The historical ILI occurrences from Week51, 2021 to Week3, 2022 are 2104, 2919, 2533, 2536, and 2084, indicating a fluctuating trend with no clear sustained increase or decrease. While Week51, 2021 to Week52, 2021 marks an initial rise (+815), the following weeks show stabilization around 2500 before a dip in Week3, 2022 (-452). This variability suggests a cooling phase after a higher activity period rather than consistent growth. For forecasting, the calculation of the average decline rate for the final two weeks is used as a basis: (2536 - 2084)/2536 = -17.85%. Applying this rate forward for five weeks provides an approximate level for Week8, 2022. By compounding a -17.85% decline weekly: 2084 * (1 - 0.1785)^5 ≈ 832.
2. Week8, 2022 belongs to the "Off-season" based on the U.S. seasonal influenza periods. The peak season generally concludes around Week6 each year when ILI activity reaches its seasonal apex. Consequently, Week8 falls into the off-season, a time characterized by rapidly declining or minimal transmission levels. This seasonal classification aligns with the expectation of reduced influenza activity during this timeframe.
3. The correlation analysis shows that ILI activity in this region is typically higher during Peak or Peak onset seasons and declines significantly during the Off-season. The drop from 2536 in Week2, 2022 to 2084 in Week3, 2022 suggests the start of a downward trend consistent with historical seasonal reductions. Using this pattern, combined with Week8, 2022 being classified within the Off-season, the forecast aligns with further reductions in ILI occurrences. Historical seasonal trends further justify a ~17-18% weekly decrease in cases leading to the forecast of 832 for Week8, 2022.
4. At least three CDC report factors significantly influence the forecast:
5. - Influenza A(H3N2), the dominant strain, showed some antigenic differences from the vaccine strains (Week51-Week3 reports), potentially prolonging flu seasons but remaining partially mitigated by existing immunity. This supports a modest decline in ILI occurrences.
6. - Flu vaccination coverage is lower than the previous season (Week52, 2021 to Week3, 2022), which may slightly slow the decline in ILI cases but does not counteract the overall seasonal drop as coverage nationally still supports reduced transmission.
7. - Regional variations and interaction with COVID-19 and other co-circulating respiratory viruses (RSV, SARS-CoV-2) complicate predictive accuracy but suggest ongoing reductions as flu-specific deaths and positivity rates decreased in Week3, 2022 (2.8%, down from prior weeks).
5. In summary, the forecast for Week8, 2022 as 832 ILI occurrences reflects the transition into the Off-season, supported by a -17.85% weekly decline observed in the past 2 weeks, the alignment with historical seasonal patterns showing reduced activity, and CDC-reported factors such as vaccination coverage, circulating strain characteristics, and regional trends. Together, these factors justify the projected decrease to 832.
