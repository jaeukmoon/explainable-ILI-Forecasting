1. The past ILI occurrences from Week38, 2021 to Week42, 2021 demonstrate a fluctuating pattern: 1309 (Week38), 1140 (Week39), 1250 (Week40), 1279 (Week41), and 1218 (Week42). While the counts do not show consistent directional growth or decline, the fluctuations occur within a moderate range, without any extreme spikes or drops across these weeks. This indicates a relatively steady trend in ILI activity with minor variability.
2. Forecasting for Week47, 2021 aligns with the peak season, as it falls within the typical peak ILI activity window in the U.S., which generally spans from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the following year. Despite recent low overall influenza activity, Week47, 2021 marks the anticipated seasonal increase as part of the peak period.
3. From a time-series perspective, the fluctuations in the ILI counts over the past five weeks suggest stabilization around a central range, albeit with minor variations. Projecting forward five weeks, the model assumes this consistent pattern will persist within a similar range, culminating in the forecasted value of 1170, representing stable yet moderate activity as the peak season begins.
4. Low influenza virus circulation has been consistent, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza across Weeks40–42, 2021 (#1 Week40–42). This reflects limited flu-specific activity and suggests modest ILI occurrences from an overall low baseline.
5. Vaccination efforts are ongoing, with strong CDC recommendations for seasonal flu vaccination by the end of October, which could dampen potential spikes in influenza transmission (#6 Week38; #8 Week40; #8 Week41). However, vaccination uptake trends remain unreported, leaving uncertainties about its influence on future ILI incidence.
6. Co-circulation of COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens continues to drive healthcare utilization rates, with COVID-19 being the primary contributor to elevated rates of pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19-related deaths (Weeks38–42, #3, #4, #6). This complex overlap of respiratory illnesses may sustain mild to moderate ILI levels, even in the absence of heightened influenza activity.
7. In summary, the forecasted value of 1170 ILI occurrences for Week47, 2021 reflects the balance between steady past trends, the peak season timing, and low but ongoing influenza virus circulation. Vaccination efforts and the influence of non-influenza respiratory pathogens further support this moderate projection during the initial weeks of the peak season.
