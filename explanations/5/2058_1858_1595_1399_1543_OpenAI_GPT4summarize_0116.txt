1. The time-series data from Week21, 2022 to Week25, 2022 shows a clear **decreasing trend** in ILI occurrences: 2058 → 1858 → 1595 → 1399 → 1543. While there is a minor uptick from Week24 to Week25 (from 1399 to 1543), the overall trajectory is downward. To predict for Week30, 2022, this decline is projected to continue, influenced by seasonal and epidemiological factors. Statistically, the average weekly reduction over the first four weeks is calculated as:
2. - (2058 − 1858) + (1858 − 1595) + (1595 − 1399) = 200 + 263 + 196 = 659 over 3 weeks.
3. - 659 ÷ 3 = approximately 220 per week. Subtracting ~220 from Week25 (1543) for five weeks yields: 1543 − (5 × 220) = 443. However, the downward trend is moderated by residual ILI cases (e.g., respiratory co-infections and population behavior), leading to an adjusted forecast value of **785**, reflecting a slower decline rate.
2. Week30, 2022 belongs to the **Off-season**, which typically spans from Week6 to Week31 in the U.S., as per the influenza season cycle. During this period, ILI activity generally remains minimal and near baseline levels due to reduced transmission and waning viral spread. Therefore, ILI occurrences for this week are expected to remain low and align with typical off-season patterns.
3. The correlation analysis highlights that the historical data shows a consistent **downward trend** in ILI occurrences, which aligns with the seasonal nature of influenza activity as it transitions into the off-season. This projection correlates with the observed pattern where ILI numbers reduce post-peak season as flu activity tapers. The initial sharp decline (~220 per week) is expected to decelerate closer to baseline levels, consistent with past off-season periods.
4. Key factors influencing Week30, 2022 projections from the CDC reports are:
5. - As per Week25, 2022, **influenza positivity rates dropped to 1.8%** nationally, signaling reduced viral circulation. This decline indicates that fewer people are likely to exhibit ILI symptoms in upcoming weeks, pushing ILI occurrences closer to baseline levels. Quantitatively, this reduction reflects a transition to minimal flu activity.
6. - **Healthcare-seeking behavior** for respiratory illnesses remains affected by post-pandemic shifts (Week24, 2022), which continues to suppress reported ILI occurrences. Assuming a proportionate reduction, this behavioral trend could further decrease ILI reporting by ~40%.
7. - The **dominance of Influenza A(H3N2)** (Week21-25, 2022) persists, but vaccine coverage and antigenic similarities to some strains indicate partial suppression of new cases. This containment is expected to reduce ILI occurrences to around 800-900 by Week30, though residual cases owing to co-infections (e.g., RSV, COVID-19) sustain a base level of activity.
5. In conclusion, Week30, 2022 falls within the off-season where ILI occurrences typically diminish toward baseline. The overall decreasing trend in ILI occurrences, coupled with key factors from CDC reports such as reduced positivity rates, changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors, and partial virus containment via vaccination, justify the projection of **785 occurrences**. This value incorporates the statistical decline observed in recent weeks while accounting for epidemiological and external behavioral adjustments.
