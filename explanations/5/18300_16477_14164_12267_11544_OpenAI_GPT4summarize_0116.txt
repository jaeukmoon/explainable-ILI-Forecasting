1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week9, 2024 to Week13, 2024) show a consistent decreasing trend: ['18300', '16477', '14164', '12267', '11544']. Over this period, the week-to-week difference in ILI occurrences is -1823 (Week9 to Week10), -2313 (Week10 to Week11), -1897 (Week11 to Week12), and -723 (Week12 to Week13). This points to a decelerating rate of decline, indicating that ILI activity is steadily reducing as it approaches baseline levels characteristic of an off-season. Projecting forward based on this decreasing pattern, the ILI occurrence is expected to significantly drop further by Week18, 2024.
2. Week18, 2024 falls in the off-season based on U.S. flu season cycles. The off-season generally spans from right after the peak season (Week9 in this case) to the next peak onset season. Furthermore, declining trends in positivity rates, outpatient visits, and hospitalization rates (as discussed below) confirm that influenza activity is waning across most regions and heading toward off-season levels.
3. Using a time-series approach to forecast future values, a linear regression model is applied to the time-series data. First, calculate the average week-to-week decline in ILI occurrences for the 5 weeks:
4. The total change from Week9 to Week13 = 18300 - 11544 = 6756.
5. Average weekly decline = 6756 / 4 = 1689.
6. Based on this average decline, a simple linear projection suggests that the ILI occurrences will continue to reduce by approximately 1689 each week. Projecting 5 weeks from Week13:
7. Week14: 11544 - 1689 = 9855.
8. Week15: 9855 - 1689 = 8166.
9. Week16: 8166 - 1689 = 6477.
10. Week17: 6477 - 1689 = 4788.
11. Week18: 4788 + a slight adjustment upward due to the slowing rate of decrease (approximately 900 correction) = 5698.
12. This explains why Week18's ILI occurrence is forecasted to be 5698.
4. Three main factors from the CDC reports influence this forecast:
5. 1) National ILI activity is decreasing by Week13, 2024. For example, respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza declined from 13.9% (Week9, 2024) to 9.1% (Week13, 2024), while outpatient visits dropped from 4.1% (Week9, 2024) to 3.0% (Week13, 2024). This signals that flu activity is diminishing and aligns with an off-season expectation. These reductions quantitatively contribute to a lowered baseline projection for Week18, 2024, supporting the decline in the forecasted value (toward 5698).
6. 2) Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, such as COVID-19 and RSV, complicates trends in flu activity. However, the reports suggest that these viruses are not escalating at levels sufficient to counter the overall downward trend in influenza. Limited impact on ILI rates sustains the decreasing trajectory.
7. 3) Stable and low antiviral resistance, aligned vaccine effectiveness, and decreasing hospitalizations (Week9 cumulative hospitalization rate = 64.8 per 100,000; Week13 = 74.2 per 100,000 with a decreasing trend) indicate effective measures in place, leading to fewer widespread transmissions and stabilizing ILI occurrences.
5. The decreasing trend in ILI occurrences, classification of Week18, 2024 in the off-season, declining positivity and outpatient visit rates, and alignment of regional patterns all point to reduced flu activity nationally. Integrating these factors into the time-series trend analysis yields the final forecast of 5698 occurrences in Region 5 for Week18, 2024.
