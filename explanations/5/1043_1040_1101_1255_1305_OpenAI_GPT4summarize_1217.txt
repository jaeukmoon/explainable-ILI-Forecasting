1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated an overall upward trend, starting at 1043 (Week 32, 2021) and rising steadily to 1305 (Week 36, 2021). Notable increases occurred from 1101 in Week 34 to 1255 in Week 35 and subsequently to 1305 in Week 36, reflecting escalating ILI activity during this period.
2. The upward trend in past ILI occurrences correlates with the reported future occurrence of 1063 in Week 41, 2021. While the immediate future shows a slight decrease from the peak value of 1305, the elevated levels in Weeks 35–36 contribute to the sustained ILI activity detectable after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently below baseline but rose slightly from 2.1% in Week 32 to 2.3% in Week 36. Critical rise patterns appeared among individuals aged 0–4 and 5–24, indicating increasing ILI activity in younger populations, aligning with the future observed data.
4. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for significant percentages, surging from 14.6% in Week 32 to 21.0% in Week 36, predominantly driven by COVID-19. This reflects an increase in respiratory illnesses that may have contributed to heightened ILI surveillance counts in future weeks.
5. Continued changes in healthcare-seeking behavior throughout Weeks 32–36, as noted by the CDC, disrupted traditional ILI reporting. These changes, alongside increased circulation of non-influenza respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2, likely influenced the apparent ILI occurrences, sustaining elevated levels in the following weeks.
6. Minimal influenza virus circulation, with positivity rates consistently near 0.1% during Weeks 32–36, coupled with the surge in non-influenza respiratory illnesses, suggests that most ILI cases were attributed to other pathogens. Pandemic-induced surveillance disruptions further amplified ILI reports.
7. In summary, the reported 1063 future ILI occurrences in Week 41, 2021, stemmed from the escalating trend in past ILI activity, increasing outpatient visits among certain age groups, heightened PIC mortality levels, and pandemic-driven surveillance and healthcare-seeking changes. Non-influenza pathogens likely played a dominating role.
