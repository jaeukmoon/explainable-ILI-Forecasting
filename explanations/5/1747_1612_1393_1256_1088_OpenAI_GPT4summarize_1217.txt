1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent and significant declining trend, with values of ['1747', '1612', '1393', '1256', '1088']. Starting from 1747 in Week 13, 2024, there was a steady decrease week-over-week to 1088 by Week 17, 2024, reflecting a continuous reduction in reported cases throughout this period. This indicates diminishing influenza activity nationally as reported in the CDC summaries.
2. A strong correlation between the declining past time-series ILI occurrences and the reported future value of 549 (Week 22, 2024) is evident. The consistent downward trajectory in Weeks 13–17, 2024, aligns with the continued reduction to 549 occurrences, projecting the ongoing decline in influenza activity as confirmed in CDC predictions.
3. The summarized CDC reports highlight multiple factors contributing to this trend. Outpatient visits for ILI decreased from 3.0% (Week 13, 2024) to 2.2% (Week 17, 2024), consistently falling below the national baseline, indicating reduced influenza-like illness activity nationally. Hospitalization rates, while among the highest for the season, decreased weekly, with a cumulative rate of 79.8 per 100,000 by Week 17, 2024, suggesting diminishing severe influenza cases. Positivity rates for respiratory specimens also consistently dropped, from 9.1% in Week 13, 2024, to 3.9% in Week 17, 2024, reflecting reduced viral incidence. Influenza-associated deaths remained stable or declined over this period, with mortality attributed to influenza decreasing from 0.5% (Week 13, 2024) to 0.2% (Week 17, 2024), collectively reinforcing the waning flu activity.
4. Vaccination efforts and ongoing antiviral recommendations throughout Weeks 13–17, 2024, likely supported the steady decline in cases and hospitalizations, with vaccination campaigns emphasizing coverage among high-risk groups. Additionally, co-circulating respiratory viruses like RSV and COVID-19 were prominently noted but seemed less impactful on overall ILI trends given their stable or decreasing levels as influenza activity dominated but subsided.
5. In summary, the reported decrease to 549 future ILI occurrences (Week 22, 2024) is consistent with the past trend of declining ILI activity from 1747 to 1088 (Weeks 13–17, 2024). This decline was supported by reductions in outpatient visits for ILI, hospitalization and positivity rates, and mortality, alongside the impact of vaccination efforts, antiviral use, and overall reduced influenza activity nationally.
