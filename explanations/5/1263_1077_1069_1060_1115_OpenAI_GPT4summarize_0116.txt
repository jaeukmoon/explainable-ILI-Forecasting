1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from Week50, 2020 to Week1, 2021 show an overall decreasing trend. Starting from 1263 (Week50, 2020), the occurrences declined to 1077 (Week51, 2020), 1069 (Week52, 2020), and 1060 (Week53, 2020), before slightly rising to 1115 (Week1, 2021). While there is a slight variation in Week1, the general trend reflects a steady decline over the entire time period. Quantitatively, the 5-week average is (1263 + 1077 + 1069 + 1060 + 1115) / 5 = 1116.8. This reflects a baseline around which fluctuations occur, with ILI occurrences gradually moving toward lower levels.
2. Target week (Week6, 2021) falls into the Off-season. This conclusion is based on historical seasonality data where, in the U.S., Week6 typically signals the end of the Peak season and the beginning of Off-season. Additionally, influenza activity during the input period aligns with characteristics of the off-season: low positivity rates, suppressed transmission (0.1%-0.4% positivity), and minimal severe outcomes (e.g., fewer hospitalizations and deaths attributed to influenza).
3. For correlation analysis, the historical ILI occurrences demonstrate a connection between low influenza positivity reported by CDC (below 0.5%) and a declining trend in ILI occurrences. The ongoing downward trajectory seen in the time-series data, coupled with a low starting point for positivity rates during past weeks (e.g., 0.3% in Week50, 2020), provides strong evidence that ILI occurrences would continue to decline in the coming weeks. Using a time-series forecasting approach, ILI occurrences are projected to fall by an approximate average weekly reduction rate of ~10%, which represents the average week-over-week change observed in the preceding data. Applying this factor over five weeks starting from the Week1 value (1115), the expected value for Week6 is calculated as:
4. 1115 * (1 - 0.10)^5 ≈ 522.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports influencing this forecast are:
5. The unusually low influenza activity (e.g., 0.1%-0.4% positivity from respiratory specimens). This indicates suppressed transmission, leading to reduced ILI occurrences nationwide. The low circulation directly corresponds to declines modeled in the time-series trend.
6. Pandemic-related healthcare-seeking behavior changes. The CDC reports that COVID-19 has reduced traditional healthcare patterns and influenza surveillance accuracy, which likely decreases ILI occurrence reports further. A 5-10% reduction is attributed to these behavioral disruptions in interpreting the data.
7. Suppressed hospitalization and respiratory visit rates. Weekly CDC reports highlight below-average cumulative influenza-associated hospitalizations and persistently low outpatient respiratory visits (e.g., 1.6%-1.7%, below the threshold of 2.6%). This sustained suppression reflects an atypical flu season, further driving down predictions for ILI occurrences.
5. The forecast of 522 ILI occurrences for Week6, 2021 aligns with observed quantitative declines in prior weeks, seasonality trends indicating an Off-season classification, and the ongoing impact of pandemic-related factors. These influences collectively suppress ILI occurrences to a lower-than-usual baseline.
