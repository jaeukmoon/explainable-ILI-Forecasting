1. The reported ILI counts from Week23 to Week27, 2024 are 1636, 1587, 1425, 1405, and 1350. The trend shows a consistent decline over these weeks, with no significant spikes or reversals. This downward trajectory indicates a tapering of influenza activity, typical of the transition between seasonal peaks and the off-season.
2. Week32, 2024 falls into the peak onset season, as it aligns with the beginning of the transition from the off-season to increasing influenza activity, as commonly seen in the U.S. during Weeks32 to 46.
3. From a time-series perspective, the steady decline from Week23 to Week27, 2024 suggests a diminishing ILI occurrence baseline. Projecting forward five weeks to Week32, 2024 within the broader epidemiological trend, future predictions indicate stabilization around a moderate ILI count of 1504 during the early phase of activity increase in the peak onset season.
4. Influenza activity has remained low nationwide (Week23, 2024 #1; Week24, 2024 #1; Week26, 2024 #1; Week27, 2024 #1), with outpatient respiratory illness visits consistently below baseline levels (Week23, 2024 #6; Week24, 2024 #4; Week25, 2024 #4; Week27, 2024 #4). This ongoing stability underpins the gradual taper observed.
5. Vaccination trends were not significantly detailed in recent CDC reports, but the consistent recommendation for annual influenza vaccination for all eligible populations contributes to controlling influenza spread (Week23, 2024 #8; Week24, 2024 #8; Week25, 2024 #9). This may suppress sharp spikes in activity during this period, supporting predictions of moderate increases.
6. Seasonal flu positivity rates have decreased continuously across weeks, hitting a low of 0.9% in Week27, 2024 (Week23, 2024 #1; Week24, 2024 #1; Week25, 2024 #1; Week27, 2024 #1). This aligns with the off-season's anticipated mild activity and reduced community transmission, which is consistent with the projected ILI occurrences for Week32, 2024.
7. Given the downward trend in ILI occurrences, the placement of Week32, 2024 within the peak onset season, stable vaccination efforts, and continuing low levels of positivity and outpatient visits, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 1504 reflects the expected incremental rise in influenza activity as it transitions out of the off-season.
