1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week20 to Week24, 2023 are 12523, 12011, 12674, 10638, and 9416. The trend shows a steady decline, with a major drop observed from Week23 to Week24 (10638 to 9416), suggesting ILI occurrences are reducing gradually during this period, aligning with the off-season trajectory.
2. Target Week29, 2023 belongs to the off-season. The low influenza-like activity observed in the previous weeks supports this classification, combined with baseline measures placing Week29 well outside the Peak or Peak Onset seasons.
3. The observed declining trend from Week20 to Week24, with transitioning lower ILI activity, suggests continuation of this trajectory into Week29. Using time-series analysis, the consistent downward decline projects toward a stabilization at lower levels of ILI counts, converging toward 8125 occurrences by Week29.
4. Influenza positivity remains minimal across Weeks20-24, with consistently low virologic detections, hovering between 1.0%-1.2% (Week20, 2023 #1; Week22, 2023 #1; Week24, 2023 #1). This consistent minimal positivity influences future predictions, maintaining reduced ILI burden.
5. Vaccination status shows no significant new trends (Week20, 2023 #9; Week21, 2023 #9; Week24, 2023 #10). Continuation of flu vaccinations targeting antigenically similar strains may contribute to diminished ILI spread at this stage of the off-season.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, RSV) remain stable without drastically influencing ILI trends (Week20, 2023 #10; Week21, 2023 #8; Week24, 2023 #9). This co-circulation, alongside minor variations across subpopulations, supports a steadier dynamic toward Week29.
7. The projection of 8125 occurrences for Week29, 2023 incorporates the observed gradual decline in ILI counts, alignment with off-season trends, minor virologic activity, stable vaccination factors, and stabilization in co-circulating respiratory patterns. Together, these suggest sustained low-level ILI activity without significant surges.
