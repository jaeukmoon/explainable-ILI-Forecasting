1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating but generally increasing trajectory, with values of ['16408', '18067', '15980', '21189', '22735']. Although Week 46, 2023, showed a slight decline to 15980 from the preceding week, a sharp and consistent rise followed, peaking at 22735 in Week 49, 2023. This defines an upward trend, indicative of escalating activity as the weeks progress.
2. A positive correlation is evident between past and future ILI occurrences. The strong upward trajectory in Weeks 48–49, 2023 (21189 and 22735), both above earlier values, aligns with the rise to 22407 after 5 weeks (Week 54, 2023). This steady elevation in occurrences toward the latter period serves as a precursor to the heightened future values.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI rose steadily above the national baseline, increasing week-over-week from 3.5% (Week 45, 2023) to 4.4% (Week 49, 2023). This persistent elevation in ILI-associated healthcare visits correlates directly with the future increase in occurrences. The cumulative hospitalization rate climbed sharply from 1.7 (Week 45, 2023) to 8.0 per 100,000 (Week 49, 2023), highlighting an acceleration in severe cases and contributing to the future surge. The co-circulation of influenza, RSV, and COVID-19 in all weeks, combined with rises in regional influenza B detection (up to 37% in regions 4 and 6, Week 48, 2023), suggests complex drivers of illness amplifying overall respiratory activity. Additionally, regional influenza activity intensified in the South Central, Southeast, and West Coast areas, which have reported consistently high positivity rates and regional variation across corresponding weeks.
4. In summary, the reported 22407 future ILI occurrences (Week 54, 2023) can be attributed to the escalating trend observed in the past weeks, as seen in consecutive increasing ILI values in Weeks 48 and 49, 2023; the persistent growth in ILI-related outpatient visits and hospitalizations; co-circulating respiratory viruses compounding illness severity; and regional variability amplifying transmission dynamics.
