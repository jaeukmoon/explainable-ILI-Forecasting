1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks (Week40, 2021 to Week44, 2021) show an upward trend. The values ['11730', '11738', '11489', '11880', '13895'] indicate gradual fluctuations in the first four weeks but a significant spike in Week44 (13895), representing a marked increase. From Week40 to Week43, fluctuations are within a narrow range, followed by a sharp rise of 16.96% between Week43 and Week44. This suggests entering a period of intensifying ILI activity.
2. Week49, 2021 belongs to the "Peak season." According to Background Knowledge #2, the peak season in the U.S. typically spans from Week46 to Week6 of the following year. Week49, 2021 falls within this range, aligning with elevated flu transmission activity, intensified ILI trends, and sustained community spread expected during the peak season.
3. A time-series projection using the historical ILI data is applied. The increase from Week40 to Week44 provides a compounded weekly growth rate of approximately 4.29%. This growth rate is calculated as follows:
4. - Week40–Week44 progression ratio: 13895 / 11730 ≈ 1.1845 (an increase of 18.45% over the 4 weeks).
5. - Average weekly growth rate: (1.1845)^(1/4) - 1 ≈ 4.29%.
6. Assuming this growth rate persists due to peak season effects, projecting for 5 additional weeks (Week44 to Week49) involves compounding:
7. - Week44 value × (1 + growth rate)^5 ≈ 13895 × (1.0429)^5 ≈ 18608.
4. Several CDC report factors strongly influence the forecasting result of 18608:
5. 1) Rising Influenza A(H3N2) circulation: Reports progressively indicate an increase in influenza detections from Week43 (91.4% Influenza A, notably H3N2) to Week44 (97.3% Influenza A), signaling expanding viral transmission. This aligns with the observed sharp increase in ILI occurrences and suggests continued intensification into Week49 due to H3N2's known transmissibility and regional outbreaks.
6. 2) Localized outbreaks and age-specific trends: Week44 data highlights significant flu activity among younger populations (e.g., 90% of Influenza A(H3N2) infections in ages 5–24). This group's higher interaction rates and mobility likely contribute to broader transmission, helping sustain the observed growth rate into peak season.
7. 3) Regional trends and delayed vaccination impact: By Week44, over 158.7M vaccine doses had been distributed; however, vaccination coverage effects typically lag transmission spikes, particularly during high transmission periods such as the peak season (Week49). Coupled with co-circulating respiratory viruses, incomplete vaccine protection might further elevate ILI activity during this window.
5. In summary, the forecast of 18608 for Week49, 2021 is justified by (1) the upward trend in past ILI occurrences, (2) progression into the peak season when flu activity typically intensifies, (3) increasing circulation of Influenza A(H3N2) and regional outbreaks, and (4) the compounded weekly growth rate derived from historical data. These factors combine to predict sustained ILI growth, leading to the final value.
