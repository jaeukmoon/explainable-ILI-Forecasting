1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over 5 weeks showed an overall decreasing trend, with values of ['1601', '1783', '1687', '1639', '1540']. There was an increase from 1601 (Week34, 2021) to 1783 (Week35, 2021), followed by a consistent decline to 1540 in Week38, 2021, the lowest value recorded during this period. This downward pattern signifies decreasing respiratory illness activity by the end of the observed period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is notable, as the declining trend in past data (Weeks 36–38, 2021) contrasts with the increase to 1829 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week43, 2021). The reversal in ILI activity after this observed decline suggests the influence of external factors not directly visible in the past trend data.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline (2.6%) across all weeks and fluctuated slightly, reducing from 2.2% (Week34, 2021) to 1.9% (Week38, 2021). This sustained low rate reflects minimal influenza activity but does not preclude the contribution of non-influenza respiratory viruses, which may account for the future increase.
4. Persistently high percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), driven mainly by COVID-19, exceeded epidemic thresholds throughout this period, climbing from 19.4% in Week34, 2021 to 20.9% in Week38, 2021. This indicates significant respiratory illness burden, which aligns with the future spike in ILI activity.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors affected data interpretation across all weeks, as noted in multiple CDC summaries. These shifts could have delayed or obscured the detection of cases, resulting in accumulated or unrecognized ILI cases contributing to the sharp rise to 1829 after five weeks.
6. Minimal influenza virus circulation was reported, with positivity rates consistently at 0.1% or below in clinical labs (e.g., Week34 and Week36, 2021). This indicates that other respiratory viruses or non-specific respiratory illnesses likely influenced ILI activity and subsequent increases.
7. In summary, the reported 1829 future ILI occurrences (Week43, 2021) can be attributed to the contrast between the declining past trends and the persistence of PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, the influence of non-influenza respiratory viruses, disruptions in surveillance due to pandemic-driven behavior changes, and rising respiratory illness activity beyond influenza during the transition to late 2021.
