1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the observed 5 weeks showed a fluctuating trend, beginning with 1024 (Week 25, 2022) and decreasing sharply to 711 (Week 26, 2022), followed by a rise to 900 (Week 27, 2022). The final two weeks (Weeks 28–29, 2022) showed a slight decline to 853 and 846, respectively. Though the fluctuations indicate a lack of consistent direction, the relatively stable range suggests a persistently moderate level of ILI activity.

2. A moderate positive correlation between past time-series and future ILI occurrences is discernible. Although the weekly fluctuations (Weeks 25–29, 2022) do not show a clear upward or downward trend, the relatively stable ILI values in the past align with the reported future occurrence of 1299. This suggests that the future increase could reflect a lagged multiplication of the consistent baseline activity observed over the past five weeks.

3. Despite low influenza positivity rates (ranging from 1.8% in Week 25 to 0.7% in Week 29, 2022), the cumulative impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses is a major factor. Regularly elevated percentages of pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) mortality, surpassing epidemic thresholds (e.g., 8.8% in Week 26 and 9.8% in Week 29, 2022), suggest broader respiratory illness activity aligning with future ILI increases.
   
4. The consistent yet modest ILI-related outpatient visits (hovering between 1.6%–1.8%, Weeks 25–29, 2022) indicate a steady baseline of healthcare utilization for respiratory illnesses. Pediatric populations aged 0-4 years consistently showed higher healthcare engagement, with rates peaking at 7.4% (Week 26) and 6.4% (Week 29). This steady outpatient visit trend likely contributes to sustaining ILI activity into the 5-week future period.
   
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes, influenced by COVID-19, appear to have disrupted traditional surveillance systems across the observed weeks (Weeks 25–29, 2022). These disruptions may underreport current cases while compounding a delayed increase, explaining the observed spike to 1299 in future ILI occurrences.
    
6. In summary, the reported 1299 future ILI occurrences (Week 34, 2022) can be attributed to the stable ILI trends in Weeks 25–29, 2022, steady outpatient ILI-related visits, widespread PIC-related mortality significantly exceeding thresholds, and the influence of pandemic-driven reporting challenges. These factors collectively produced a lagged amplification leading to the future rise.
