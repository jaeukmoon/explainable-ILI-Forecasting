1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1711', '1731', '1685', '1476', '1397']. Starting from 1711 in Week21, 2024, the occurrences peaked slightly at 1731 in Week22, 2024, before decreasing each week, with the lowest value, 1397, recorded in Week25, 2024. This consistent decline in ILI occurrences reflects an overall reduction in ILI activity during the observed period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the continued decline over Weeks 21–25, 2024, contrasts with the reported decrease to 930 occurrences after 5 weeks in Week30, 2024. The decreased trend in past weeks sets the foundation for the much lower ILI occurrences observed in future weeks.
3. The consistently low influenza positivity rates, decreasing from 1.7% (Week21, 2024) to 1.1% (Week25, 2024), indicate diminishing influenza contribution to overall ILI counts. Similarly, outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses followed a declining trend, dropping from 1.9% in Week21, 2024, to 1.5% in Week25, 2024, reflecting reduced respiratory illness activity. Furthermore, hospitalizations remained extremely low throughout, with weekly rates not exceeding 0.2 per 100,000 population, which aligns with declining ILI trends. Lastly, the absence of notable antiviral resistance or novel influenza viruses ensured no sharp spikes in cases due to evolving pathogens.
4. The absence of significant changes in vaccination uptake or co-circulating virus dynamics reported by the CDC suggests no external spikes in illness transmission. Co-circulating respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 remain manageable, with no notable increase in contribution to ILI trends across the observed period.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 930 (Week30, 2024) are primarily due to the consistent decline in past ILI activity, including lower influenza positivity rates, reduced outpatient visits, and stable hospitalizations. Additional factors such as low antiviral resistance and absence of emergent influenza subtypes further maintained the downward trajectory in ILI activity.
