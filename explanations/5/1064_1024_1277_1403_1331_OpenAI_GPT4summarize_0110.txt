1. The ILI counts from Week43 to Week47, 2023 are 1064, 1024, 1277, 1403, and 1331. The trend indicates a steady increase from Week43 (1064) to Week46 (1403), except for a slight dip in Week47 (1331). This pattern showcases an overall rising trajectory, signaling increasing influenza activity despite minor fluctuations.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans from about Week46 of one year through Week6 of the next year. Since Week52, 2023 falls within this timeframe and aligns with increasing trends in flu positivity, hospitalizations, and outpatient ILI visits as observed in Weeks45 to Week47, it is classified as part of the peak season.
3. Based on the past trends, the rising activity suggests heightened transmission. Projections from Week43 to Week47 indicate that the upward momentum, combined with minor fluctuations, will sustain into the forecasted Week52, 2023. The time-series forecasting model expects seasonal intensification, contributing to the higher projected value of 2402.
4. The summarized CDC reports indicate that outpatient visits for ILI have consistently risen, exceeding the national baseline (Week45, 2023 #3; Week46, 2023 #3; Week47, 2023 #5). This reflects an expanding community spread. This, coupled with increasing hospitalization rates (Week44, 2023 #3; Week46, 2023 #4; Week47, 2023 #3), suggests high disease burden driving ILI reports higher. Continued circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (Week45, 2023 #10; Week46, 2023 #9; Week47, 2023 #9), contributes to rising respiratory illness. Influenza positivity in lab testing also climbed sharply, from 1.9% in Week43 to 6.2% in Week47 (Week43 #1, Week47 #1), consistently reflecting peak season dynamics.
5. In summary, the projection of 2402 ILI occurrences for Week52, 2023 is supported by a combination of past rising ILI trends, classification of Week52 as peak season, and key CDC insights showing rising outpatient illness visits, increasing hospitalization rates, and elevated influenza positivity. These factors align with a peak season forecast with ongoing influenza spread.
