1. The past time-series ILI occurrences during the 5 weeks from Week27 to Week31, 2023, exhibited a consistent and slight upward trend, with the values ['1386', '1478', '1424', '1468', '1532']. There was an initial rise from 1386 (Week27, 2023) to 1478 (Week28, 2023), followed by a minor dip to 1424 (Week29, 2023), and then successive increases in Week30 (1468) and Week31 (1532), indicating a progressive rise in ILI activities by the end of the analyzed period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is supported by the observed upward trend during Weeks30–31, 2023. The value of 3514 future ILI occurrences (after Week36, 2023) aligns with this indication of a building ILI trajectory, suggesting that increased activity in the latter weeks of the observed data foreshadowed the significant rise reported in the future period.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed consistent weekly patterns, ranging from 1.1% in Week27 to 1.2% in Week30, and returning to 1.1% in Week31. Higher consultation percentages among children under 5 years (4.2% in Week30 and 4.1% in Week31) indicated age-specific vulnerabilities, which could have amplified overall ILI counts.
4. Hospitalization rates for influenza steadily increased from 641 in Week27 to 689 in Week28, dipped to 573 in Week29, and then climbed again to 649 in Week30 and 638 in Week31. Hospitalization trends highlight a consistent burden of moderate respiratory illnesses, mirroring the escalated ILI levels.
5. Continued co-circulation of multiple viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV was documented in all weeks (Week27–Week31). These co-infections contribute to mixed etiology and overlapping symptoms, likely driving the future surge in ILI occurrences to 3514.
6. In summary, the future surge to 3514 ILI occurrences can be attributed to the slight but consistent upward trend in ILI during the past 5 weeks, amplified outpatient visits (especially in younger children), rising hospitalizations, and compounding effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors collectively contributed to the observed spike in ILI cases after Week36, 2023.
