1. The reported ILI counts from Week11 to Week15, 2024, are 14164, 12267, 11544, 9899, and 8238. A clear declining trend is observed with sharp reductions every week. This indicates decreasing influenza-like illness activity, with no evidence of sudden spikes or reversals within the reviewed weeks.
2. Based on seasonal classification, Week20, 2024, aligns with the off-season. Influenza positivity rates and ILI percentages have been declining consistently, moving below the national baseline (Week14, 2024 #3; Week15, 2024 #3). Historical trends also place Week20 beyond the typical peak and peak onset seasons, suggesting reduced activity levels consistent with the off-season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the steep and continuous drop in ILI counts during the past five weeks signals further expected reductions. Extrapolating this decline into the off-season period, ILI occurrences at Week20, 2024, are projected to continue trending down, reaching 4153 as a stabilized count indicative of reduced community transmission and disease activity.
4. Weekly influenza positivity rates dropped from 12.0% (Week11) to 5.9% (Week15), a trend mirrored by outpatient ILI visits that fell from 3.4% to 2.5% (Week11, 2024 #6; Week15, 2024 #3). These metrics align with a forecasted low ILI count for Week20, 2024.
5. Vaccination coverage remains steady, with circulating virus strains well-matched to the current vaccine (Week14, 2024 #7; Week15, 2024 #9). This has likely contributed to the ongoing decline in cases and reduced severe outcomes.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 remain factors in respiratory trends but appear to add only a minimal, consistent burden without reversing the downward ILI trajectory (Week11, 2024 #10; Week14, 2024 #8; Week15, 2024 #8).
7. The projection of 4153 ILI occurrences for Week20, 2024, is supported by the rapid decline in case trends, the off-season timing, effective vaccination coverage, and the reduced viral activity observed across regions. These factors collectively justify the anticipated low level of ILI activity.
