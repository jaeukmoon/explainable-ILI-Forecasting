1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed relatively stable and slightly fluctuating trends, with values of ['1968', '2118', '2022', '2012', '2114']. There was an initial increase from 1968 (Week 16, 2021) to 2118 (Week 17, 2021), followed by a minor decrease to 2022 (Week 18, 2021). Subsequent weeks observed marginal fluctuations, with 2012 (Week 19, 2021) increasing to 2114 (Week 20, 2021). This steady pattern without dramatic changes suggests low variability in ILI activity during the observed period.
2. A weak positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the slight increase observed in Week 20, 2021, mirrors the modest rise in future ILI occurrences to 2350 after 5 weeks. The relatively stable trends during the past weeks indicate that the ILI activity remains low but contributes to a gradual increase.
3. Specific factors in the CDC reports corroborate the future rise in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks. Weekly outpatient visits for ILI increased from 1.1% (Week 16, 2021) to 1.3% (Week 20, 2021), signifying a slow yet ongoing rise in respiratory illness activity. Furthermore, deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, declining gradually from 11.8% (Week 16, 2021) to 9.5% (Week 20, 2021), indicating sustained respiratory illness-related activity with COVID-19 as a dominant influence. Historical data on cumulative hospitalization rates remained exceptionally low at 0.8 per 100,000 during the period but may underestimate the severity of circulating non-influenza respiratory illnesses contributing to ILI activity.
4. Minimal positivity rates for influenza, such as 0.1% across all weeks, and low hospitalization rates continue to suggest that non-specific respiratory illnesses or pandemic-driven factors (e.g., COVID-19 and altered healthcare behaviors) were primary contributors to ILI occurrences. Data collection biases arising from changes in healthcare-seeking behavior during the pandemic (e.g., delayed or reduced outpatient visits) likely masked ILI trends, leading to underestimated severity during earlier weeks and a subsequent rise in future reports.
5. In summary, the reported 2350 future ILI cases after 5 weeks can be explained by the minimal yet slightly increasing trends in past time-series occurrences, gradual rises in outpatient visits, consistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and the influence of pandemic-related disruptions on ILI data reporting and interpretation. Low influenza activity and ongoing COVID-19 dynamics emphasize non-specific respiratory factors driving the observed rise in ILI occurrences.
