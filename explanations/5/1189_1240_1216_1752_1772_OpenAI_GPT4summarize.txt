1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall upward trend, transitioning from 1189 in Week 45, 2021, to 1772 in Week 49, 2021. There was a steady rise after Week 47, 2021, increasing from 1216 to 1752 and then to 1772. This indicates a growing intensity in ILI activity during the observed period.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the upward progression observed in Weeks 47–49, 2021, mirrors the sustained increase in ILI activity culminating in 2536 future occurrences by Week 5, 2022. The heightened activity in the final weeks serves as a precursor to the spike in future ILI data.

3. Several factors in the CDC reports underscore the rise in ILI occurrences:
   - **Outpatient visits for ILI** nearly reached or surpassed the national baseline, escalating from 2.1% (Week 45, 2021) to 2.7% (Week 49, 2021). This consistent rise reflects increasing respiratory illness trends likely influencing future ILI occurrences.
   - **Hospitalizations** attributed to influenza grew considerably, from 332 in Week 45, 2021, to 1,057 in Week 49, 2021. This sharp increase indicates a parallel rise in respiratory complications, contributing to higher subsequent ILI figures.
   - **Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) mortality rates** remained significantly above epidemic thresholds, rising from 14.4% in Week 45, 2021, to 17.4% in Week 49, 2021. This consistent elevation reflects the widespread impact of respiratory illnesses during this period.
   - Co-circulation of **multiple respiratory viruses**, including influenza A(H3N2) and SARS-CoV-2, compounded ILI surveillance complexities and contributed to a broad rise in ILI-related activity.

4. In summary, the recorded 2536 future ILI occurrences by Week 5, 2022, can be attributed to the observed upward trajectory in Weeks 47–49, 2021, increasing outpatient visits for ILI, significant growth in hospitalizations, persistently elevated PIC mortality, and the influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors collectively explain the marked increase in ILI activity after 5 weeks.
