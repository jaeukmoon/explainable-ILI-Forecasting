1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['13038', '12688', '11996', '11270', '10231']. The decline was gradual but steady, dropping from 13038 in Week20, 2024, to 10231 by Week24, 2024. This decreasing trend reflects a reduction in ILI activity during this period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the consistent decline observed in past data over Weeks20–24, 2024, does not fully align with the reported future ILI occurrence of 7586 by Week29, 2024. While the past trend suggests diminishing ILI activity, the future value remains relatively elevated, possibly reflecting lingering or multifactorial influences sustaining ILI levels.
3. Weekly hospitalization rates for influenza remained consistently low at 0.2–0.1 per 100,000 population throughout the past 5 weeks (Week20–24, 2024), indicating stable but residual clinical impact, which may correlate with sustained future ILI activity. Concurrent co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, as highlighted in all weekly reports, contributed to multifactorial respiratory illness trends that could influence future ILI levels. Furthermore, the presence of minimal but detectable antiviral resistance, particularly in Influenza A and B cases reported in Week24, 2024, suggests sustained virus activity that may slightly impact future occurrences despite low overall flu activity.
4. The sustained co-circulation of influenza and multiple respiratory viruses, stable hospitalization rates, and low but persisting ILI positivity, even during declining trends by Week24, 2024, provide sufficient grounds to explain the future ILI occurrences of 7586 in Week29, 2024.
5. In summary, the reported 7586 future ILI occurrences (Week29, 2024) can be attributed to a combination of stable hospitalization rates, co-circulating respiratory viruses influencing overall trends, minimal resistance among influenza viruses, and the lingering broader impacts of respiratory infections, aligning with the observed science and national surveillance insights.
