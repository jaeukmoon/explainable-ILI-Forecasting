1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed fluctuating yet consistently high values, ranging from 1209 (Week13, 2021) to 1558 (Week17, 2021). After an initial rise from 1209 in Week13 to 1496 in Week14, there was a slight dip to 1482 in Week15, followed by a steady increase to 1490 in Week16 and peaking at 1558 in Week17. This trend indicates sustained elevated ILI activity, with an upward momentum toward the end of the observed period.
2. A positive correlation can be observed between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the upward trajectory noted, especially from Week15 to Week17, aligns with the increase in ILI occurrences to 1504, 5 weeks later. The peak value in Week17 (1558) closely predicts the future level, supporting the link between sustained activity and future occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at 1.1% across Weeks13 through Week17, 2021, consistently below the national baseline but still reflective of steady respiratory illness activity that likely contributed to the persistence of ILI levels in the future. Persistent PIC mortality percentages surpassed epidemic thresholds in all weeks, ranging between 11.4% (Week13) and 11.7% (Week17), with COVID-19 accounting for the majority of cases. This high PIC mortality reflects respiratory activity that may parallel the future persistence of ILI. The extraordinarily low influenza positivity rate at 0.1% (Weeks13–17) highlights non-influenza respiratory illnesses as a plausible driver of ILI trends, further supporting sustained occurrences in the future period.
4. Healthcare-seeking behavior shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic consistently complicated ILI data interpretation across Weeks13–17, 2021. These altered behaviors may have resulted in under- or delayed reporting during earlier weeks, potentially concentrating cases into future counts.
5. In summary, the reported 1504 future ILI occurrences 5 weeks after Week17, 2021, are attributed to the sustained elevated levels of ILI throughout Weeks13–17, a clear upward trajectory toward peak value in Week17, persistently high PIC mortality percentages, low influenza-specific activity indicating other respiratory factors, and ongoing pandemic-related reporting disruptions.
