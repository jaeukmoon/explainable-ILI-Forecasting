1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a stable but slightly fluctuating pattern, with values of ['1978', '2037', '2067', '1800', '1802']. After an initial increase from 1978 (Week 39, 2021) to 2067 (Week 41, 2021), there was a notable drop to 1800 (Week 42) and minimal change to 1802 (Week 43). This pattern reflects a decline in ILI trends by the end of the 5-week period, indicating lower immediate ILI activity.

2. Despite the brief decline in Weeks 42 and 43, the future 3646 ILI occurrences likely reflect a delayed response to the earlier peak during Week 41 (maximum observed value of 2067). Furthermore, the near-doubling of the future value suggests an external driver, such as increasing healthcare visits or changes in reporting systems, correlating with the overall trend.

3. Minimal influenza positivity was documented across Weeks 39–43, 2021, ranging from 0.1% (Week 39) to 0.2% (Week 43), while ILI-related outpatient visits remained below baseline, between 1.8% and 1.9%. Despite low specific influenza levels, increases in respiratory illness due to non-influenza pathogens were frequently noted, with Week 43 emphasizing a rise in detected respiratory cases. This rise in respiratory illnesses likely contributed to the sharp future jump in ILI numbers.

4. Persistent high percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), ranging from 18.7% (Week 39, 2021) to 15.6% (Week 43, 2021), well above epidemic thresholds, signal the burden of respiratory illnesses during this period. The sustained elevated PIC mortality indicates ongoing widespread respiratory activity, aligning with the future ILI surge.

5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as consistently noted in all reports, disrupted traditional ILI dynamics. These shifts likely delayed or altered reporting structures, compounding underrepresented cases in past data and contributing to the eventual sharp increase in ILI cases 5 weeks later.

6. In summary, the reported 3646 ILI occurrences (5 weeks later) can be attributed to residual effects of the earlier peak in Week 41, contributions from rising non-influenza respiratory illness, sustained elevated PIC mortality rates, and pandemic-driven changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors causing reporting and surveillance complexities. These cumulative factors explain the significant future increase.
