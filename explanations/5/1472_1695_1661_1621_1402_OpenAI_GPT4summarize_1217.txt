1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall declining trend, with values of ['1472', '1695', '1661', '1621', '1402']. There was an initial increase from 1472 (Week 48, 2020) to 1695 (Week 49, 2020), followed by a fluctuating decrease, reaching the lowest point of 1402 in Week 52, 2020. This indicates a reduction in ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A weak negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the decreasing trend in ILI activity in Weeks 48–52, 2020, does not directly align with the further decline to 883 future occurrences by Week 57, 2021. The continuous decrease in the past weeks likely contributed to the significantly lower future value.
3. ILI outpatient visits remained stable at 1.6% across all 5 weeks, consistently below the 2.6% national baseline. This stagnation highlights ongoing minimal activity levels and reduced healthcare-seeking for flu-like symptoms, corroborating the subsequent drop in future ILI occurrences to 883.
4. Elevated percentages of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), such as 12.8% in Week 48, 2020, and 13.6% in Week 52, 2020, were consistently above epidemic thresholds but primarily driven by COVID-19 rather than influenza. This suggests limited impact from influenza, aligning with the low future ILI occurrences.
5. Pandemic-related factors, including reduced influenza virus circulation, stable yet minimal virologic detection (e.g., 0.1%–0.3% positive respiratory specimens), and changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors, profoundly suppressed ILI activity. These factors, as reported across all weeks, solidified the sharp decrease in influenza cases and contributed to the low future value of 883.
6. In summary, the reported 883 future ILI occurrences (Week 57, 2021) can be attributed to the overall declining trend in Weeks 48–52, 2020; stable yet reduced ILI outpatient visits; minimal influenza virus positivity rates; and the pronounced influence of COVID-19 on healthcare patterns, limiting influenza spread and subsequent ILI occurrences.
