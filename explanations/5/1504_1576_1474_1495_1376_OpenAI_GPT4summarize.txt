1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but slightly declining trend, with values of ['1504' (Week 22, 2021), '1576' (Week 23, 2021), '1474' (Week 24, 2021), '1495' (Week 25, 2021), '1376' (Week 26, 2021)]. While there was a modest increase from Week 22 to Week 23, the data demonstrates an overall reduction by Week 26. This trend reflects suppressed influenza transmission amidst the dominance of COVID-19.

2. While the past ILI occurrences exhibit an overall decline, the future occurrence of 2285 (Week 31, 2021) marks a significant increase. This divergence suggests a potential delayed rebound effect or a spike in non-specific respiratory illnesses or ILI activity after the initial decline. Pandemic-related healthcare disruptions and alternate care-seeking behaviors likely obscured the true trajectory, making correlations less direct but highlighting the impact of external factors.

3. Minimal influenza activity reported across Weeks 22–26, 2021, with ILI comprising only 1.2% of outpatient visits each week, below the national baseline of 2.6%, aligns with the low reported ILI cases in the observed 5-week period. This strongly indicates an unchanging surveillance environment, setting the stage for potential variability in subsequent weeks.

4. Persistent elevated PIC mortality across the 5 weeks, ranging from 7.5% (Week 22, 2021) to 6.6% (Week 25, 2021) and stabilizing at 6.2% (Week 26, 2021), suggests an ongoing burden of respiratory illness dominated by COVID-19. Such elevated PIC percentages, exceeding epidemic thresholds, could signify heightened respiratory activity, contributing to the future surge.

5. The CDC’s acknowledgment of significantly disrupted healthcare-seeking behaviors and alternative care systems during Weeks 22–26, 2021, likely led to underreporting of cases during this period. As healthcare patterns stabilized and reporting systems adjusted, this pent-up or untracked ILI activity may have been reflected in the spike to 2285 occurrences.

6. Despite minimal influenza virus positivity rates and negligible lab detections, the combination of non-influenza respiratory illnesses, pandemic-induced healthcare disruptions, and interactions with COVID-19 trends likely contributed to the sharp rise in ILI occurrences. Behavioral and surveillance challenges amplified the observed increase.

7. In summary, the reported increase to 2285 future ILI occurrences (Week 31, 2021) is attributed to the minimally declining ILI trend during Weeks 22–26, elevated PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, COVID-19-driven disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors, and the likely return or late recognition of non-influenza respiratory illnesses. These factors collectively explain the surge in ILI activity despite minimal influenza transmission.
