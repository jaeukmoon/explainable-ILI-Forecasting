1. The past time-series ILI occurrences in the recent 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating trend without a clear directional pattern, with values ['2021', '1982', '1977', '2087', '1956']. Week11, 2021, began at 2021, slightly dipped across Weeks12–13, 2021, to 1977, then increased in Week14, 2021, to 2087, followed by a decline to 1956 in Week15, 2021. This variability reflects inconsistent influenza-like activity during the observed weeks.
2. Despite the absence of a consistent trend in past occurrences, the average values of past ILI data approximate the future value of 2025. The minor oscillations within the data suggest that the reported future occurrences align with a stabilized, aggregated weekly average indicative of ongoing minimal ILI activity expected under current circumstances.
3. The persistently low outpatient ILI visits across Weeks11–15, 2021, remaining around 0.9%–1.1% (well below the baseline of 2.6%), correlate closely with the continued modest future ILI occurrences. Low activity levels during past observations support the projection of similar low values 5 weeks later. The cumulative hospitalization rates of 0.7–0.8 per 100,000 during Weeks11–15, 2021, also indicate minimal severe flu-associated disease, consistent with stable future ILI reports of 2025. Increased PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) deaths, consistently applying pressure, may contribute marginally to the ongoing burden reflected in the 2025 values. COVID-19-induced healthcare behavior shifts, reported throughout this period, complicate true ILI data interpretation, further aligning past and future stabilization to 2025.
4. Minimal novel virus transmission is evident, with only isolated cases of influenza A(H1N1)v or A(H3N2)v observed during Weeks11–15, 2021. Meanwhile, influenza vaccination trends or updates remained low or unreported during this period, likely dampening any substantial resurgence of influenza activity. This novel virus containment reinforced continuation at baseline-like future occurrences, coinciding with 2025.
5. In summary, the reported 2025 future ILI occurrences in Week20, 2021, can be explained by the fluctuating yet stable past ILI trends, consistently minimal outpatient visits for ILI, scant hospitalization rates, increased PIC mortality with COVID-19 dominance, unchanged novel virus activity, and healthcare disruptions affecting reliable surveillance. These combined factors support a stable outlook leading to the reported future occurrences.
