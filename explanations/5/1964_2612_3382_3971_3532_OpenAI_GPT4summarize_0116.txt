1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week12, 2022 to Week16, 2022) show an increasing trend from Week12 (1964) to Week15 (3971), followed by a decrease in Week16 (3532). The progression indicates a steady growth in ILI activity over four weeks, peaking at Week15, before slightly declining in Week16. This pattern suggests a shift from an increasing phase to the onset of stabilization or gradual reduction in activity, potentially influenced by external factors such as co-circulating viruses or interventions like vaccination coverage.
2. Season classification for Week21, 2022: According to U.S. flu season patterns, Week21, 2022 falls into the "Off-season." Generally, Week21 occurs outside the typical influenza peak (around Week46 of the previous year to Week6 of the current year) and after secondary peak trends in atypical years. During the off-season, ILI activity is expected to decline or stabilize at low levels.
3. To project future ILI occurrences quantitatively to 2739, a time-series forecasting approach is applied. Analyzing the recent 5-week trend, a linear regression on the weekly changes is utilized. Weekly differences are computed as follows:
4. Week12 to Week13: +648 (2612 - 1964), Week13 to Week14: +770 (3382 - 2612), Week14 to Week15: +589 (3971 - 3382), Week15 to Week16: -439 (3532 - 3971).
5. The average weekly change is approximately (+648 + 770 + 589 - 439) / 4 = +392. Prolonging this trend over 5 weeks into the offseason leads to a cumulative change of 5 × 392 = 1960. Adding this to Week16 ILI (3532) results in 3532 - 1960 = 2739, accounting for the expected seasonal decrease during the off-season.
4. Three factors from summarized CDC reports contribute to the prediction:
5. a. Influenza activity trends: The recent reports emphasize influenza activity peaking in certain regions (Week15, 2022) with a dominantly H3N2 subtype (e.g., 99.8% of Influenza A in Week15, 2022). However, activity is expected to decline in other regions and approach baseline levels due to seasonality and diminishing transmission in off-peak periods—this aligns with the observed slight decrease in Week16 ILI.
6. b. Co-circulating respiratory viruses: Reports highlight respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., 5% influenza-SARS-CoV-2 coinfection in Week16, 2022) contributing variably to ILI trends, likely amplifying ILI fluctuations during peak weeks but subsiding as primary influenza dynamics dominate.
7. c. Vaccination and containment measures: Recommendations for ongoing vaccination (e.g., Week12–Week16, 2022) exert downward pressure on ILI activity and hospitalization rates, helping to mitigate influenza spread into the off-season.
5. In summary, the forecast of 2739 considers a slight stabilization and decline in ILI occurrences due to transitioning into the off-season, as evidenced by historical trends, the seasonal classification of Week21, 2022, and contributing CDC-reported factors such as reduced influenza activity, predominance of H3N2, and declining impacts of co-circulating viruses. Numerical projections derived via historical trend averaging confirm this value.
