1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a steady upward trajectory from Week32, 2024, to Week34, 2024, with values ['11143', '11971', '14072', '15539', '14753']. While there was a decrease from 15539 (Week34) to 14753 (Week36), the total trend reflects significant growth over the period, indicating a rise in ILI activity despite minor fluctuations.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 13127 align with the overall higher mid-period values of the 5-week data trajectory, particularly Weeks34–35, 2024, which experienced maximum occurrences. Though the trend dipped slightly toward Week36, the elevated values imply sustained robustness in ILI activity feeding into persistent future levels.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased slightly from 1.5% (Week32, 2024) to 1.8% (Week34–36, 2024), showing stable elevated healthcare encounters consistent with increased occurrences.
4. Seasonal co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including influenza and RSV, reported consistently in Weeks32–36, 2024, likely contributed to notable non-influenza respiratory illness surges, maintaining ILI at elevated levels.
5. CDC mentions minimal antiviral resistance and good vaccine matching during Weeks32–36, 2024, yet low vaccination uptake and sporadic novel strain cases (e.g., H1N1v/variant spillovers in Week33) suggest latent transmission risks contributing to future cases.
6. In summary, the future 13127 ILI occurrences can be attributed to the upward ILI trends in Weeks32–35, minor rises in outpatient ILI visits, co-circulating respiratory viruses, low vaccination rates, and the stable but sustained respiratory illness activity indicated by CDC reports for Weeks32–36, 2024.
