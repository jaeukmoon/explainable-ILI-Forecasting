1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed fluctuating but stable patterns, with values of ['1189', '1228', '1203', '1223', '1170']. There was a slight increase from 1189 (Week 43, 2021) to 1228 (Week 44, 2021), followed by a slight decrease to 1203 (Week 45, 2021). Although Week 46, 2021 saw a small uptick to 1223, Week 47, 2021 ended with a decrease to 1170. The overall lack of significant growth during this 5-week span suggests a relatively stable ILI baseline, with minor fluctuations.
2. A moderate correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the stability observed in Weeks 43-47, 2021, combined with the subtle rise in certain age groups and specific regions, aligns with the surge to 2250 occurrences in Week 52, 2021. The consistent co-circulation of respiratory illnesses, increasing positivity rates, and regional disparities act as an underlying growth factor for future cases.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually trended upwards across Weeks 43-47, 2021, moving from 1.9% (Week 43, 2021) to 2.4% (Week 47, 2021), nearing the national baseline of 2.5%. This growing healthcare utilization for ILI is a significant indicator of future occurrences, reflecting rising respiratory illness activity nationwide.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) cases showed a clear increase, with Influenza A constituting up to 99.4% of positive specimens by Week 47, 2021. Detected cases were heavily concentrated in those aged 5–24 years, accounting for over 80% of cases by Week 47, 2021. The rising dominance of H3N2, coupled with its spread among younger populations, underscores its role in driving future ILI occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of various respiratory viruses and ongoing shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic were documented in Weeks 43-47, 2021. These factors introduced delays and complexities in ILI trend reporting while amplifying the number of cases attributed to surveillance adjustments. Such changes likely contributed to underreported or concentrated ILI cases, resulting in the higher occurrences (2250) reported after 5 weeks.
6. In summary, the reported 2250 future ILI occurrences (Week 52, 2021) are attributable to the stable ILI occurrences observed in the past data, increases in outpatient ILI visits nearing baseline, the rising dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), age-specific transmission trends, and pandemic-related data interpretation challenges. These factors cumulatively explain the observed escalation in Week 52, 2021.
