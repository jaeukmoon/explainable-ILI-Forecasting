1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent declining trend, with values decreasing from 10638 (Week23, 2023) to 7930 (Week27, 2023). This gradual reduction in ILI occurrences indicates decreasing respiratory illness activity during this period, likely as a result of seasonal factors and reduced detection of circulating influenza viruses.
2. Despite the declining trend in past ILI occurrences, the increase to 10038 future occurrences after 5 weeks (Week32, 2023) may reflect inversions in the trend likely influenced by external factors, as indicated by past reports. Notably, previous fluctuations (e.g., lower positivity rates and hospitalization changes) and the co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses suggest potential conditions for resurgence.
3. Increasing outpatient respiratory visits for ILI among children aged 0–4 years, from 1.5% (Week24, 2023) to 4.2% (Week27, 2023), highlight an age-specific rise in ILI activity despite the overall decline. This shift may contribute to an uptick in future occurrences, as children are key drivers of respiratory illness spread.
4. The persistent co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, RSV) alongside influenza, reported from Week23 to Week27, 2023, indicates overlapping illness reports complicating ILI surveillance. Such co-circulation may push future ILI occurrences beyond observed trends due to interactive viral contributions.
5. Hospitalization trends remained relatively stable but high, with values ranging from 850 (Week23, 2023) to 641 (Week27, 2023). This consistent burden, combined with complications from PIC-related deaths remaining above epidemic thresholds, suggests underlying unresolved respiratory illness pressure that could underlie the future rise in ILI occurrences to 10038.
6. In summary, the increase in future ILI occurrences to 10038 (Week32, 2023) is attributable to the declining trend in past data reversing due to age-specific outpatient activity increases, persistent co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, stable yet significant hospitalizations, and complications from concurrent PIC mortality trends exceeding epidemic thresholds.
