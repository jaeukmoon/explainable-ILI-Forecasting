1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating pattern but showed an overall upward progression, with values of ['1045', '1141', '1117', '1021', '1166']. Starting at 1045 in Week11, 2022, the occurrences increased to a peak of 1141 in Week12, 2022, followed by a slight decline to 1117 in Week13, 2022, and a dip to 1021 in Week14, 2022. However, by Week15, 2022, the ILI occurrences rose to the highest of the period at 1166, signaling an upward trajectory by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A strong positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is demonstrated, as the increase in Week15, 2022, acts as a precursor to the amplified number of occurrences (1954) after 5 weeks. The persistent rise from the fluctuations in Week14 (1021) to Week15 (1166) aligns with the observed intensification in ILI activity after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness steadily climbed from 1.8% in Week11, 2022, to 2.1% in Week15, 2022, despite remaining below baseline levels nationally. This consistent increase signals escalating respiratory activity, particularly in younger individuals and certain regions, contributing to the future spike. Influenza hospitalization rates rose across all weeks, reaching 9.8 per 100,000 in Week15, 2022, with weekly increases for 11 consecutive weeks, reflecting widespread severe illness that likely underpins the future surge. The gradual increase in influenza positivity in clinical samples from 7.7% in Week11, 2022, to 8.9% in Week15, 2022, dominated by A(H3N2), highlights intensifying viral activity responsible for heightened ILI occurrences. The co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, with 5.0–5.4% of influenza-positive specimens also testing positive for COVID-19, indicates combined respiratory pathogen activity escalating illness trends and amplifying reported ILI cases.
4. Elevated but slightly declining PIC mortality rates above the epidemic threshold (9.1%–7.1%) over the past 5 weeks reflect heightened respiratory illness burden, with COVID-19 as the primary contributor. This persistent severity aligns with the continued upward shift in ILI activity.
5. In summary, the observed 1954 ILI occurrences (after Week20, 2022) are driven by the upward trajectory in past time-series data, increasing outpatient visits, rising hospitalization rates, increasing influenza positivity, co-circulating respiratory pathogens, and persistent PIC mortality. These factors collectively indicate intensifying respiratory illness trends contributing to the future surge in ILI cases.
