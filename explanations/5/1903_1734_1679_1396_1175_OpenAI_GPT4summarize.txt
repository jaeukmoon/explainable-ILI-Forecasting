1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent downward trend, with values decreasing from 1903 (Week 48, 2020) to 1175 (Week 52, 2020). This decline highlights reduced ILI circulation over the observed period, likely influenced by external factors such as pandemic-related interventions and seasonal changes.

2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the consistent decline in ILI activity observed from Week 48 to Week 52, 2020, contrasts with the reported future increase to 1117 occurrences by Week 5, 2021. The drop in past weeks may have set a baseline for the subsequent rebound observed in future data.

3. Several summarized factors align with the future increase in ILI occurrences:  
   a. Outpatient visits for ILI, stable at 1.6% in all 5 weeks (Weeks 48–52, 2020), reflect a latent pattern of ongoing respiratory illness circulation despite low positivity rates for influenza. These baseline levels could have transitioned into a gradual rise, evident in the future uptick.  
   b. Persistent deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded epidemic thresholds across all 5 weeks, with rates rising from 12.8% in Week 48, 2020, to 13.6% in Week 52, 2020. While primarily driven by COVID-19, this trend signifies sustained respiratory illness activity that may overlap with ILI reporting.  
   c. Altered healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance inaccuracies, highlighted consistently in all CDC reports, affect ILI trends. This ongoing disruption, along with potential lags in reporting, may explain delayed recognition of cases contributing to the future rise to 1117 occurrences.

4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1117 by Week 5, 2021, can be attributed to the interplay between the initial decline in Weeks 48–52, 2020, stable ILI outpatient visit percentages, persistent PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-related disruptions to healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance systems. These dynamics likely masked the underlying respiratory illness activity that surfaced as an uptick in future weeks.
