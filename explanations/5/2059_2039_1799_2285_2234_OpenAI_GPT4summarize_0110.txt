1. The ILI occurrences from Week25 to Week29, 2024, were 2059, 2039, 1799, 2285, and 2234. The trend initially decreased from Week25 (2059) to Week27 (1799) but then increased sharply in Week28 (2285), followed by a slight reduction in Week29 (2234). Overall, the pattern indicates a fluctuation with no clear long-term direction, but the increase in Week28 suggests a potential transition toward higher activity.
2. Week34, 2024, occurs during the peak onset season in the U.S., which typically spans from Week32 to Week46. The fluctuating ILI activity and recent increases further support the classification of Week34, 2024, as part of the peak onset season.
3. From the time-series perspective, the fluctuation in recent weeks, along with increases in Week28 and Week29, suggests an upward trend in ILI occurrences. Projecting this pattern forward five weeks, the model anticipates a notable increase, aligning with the gradual onset of the peak onset season. This leads to the forecast ILI occurrence of 3408 for Week34, 2024.
4. Influenza positivity rates have been slightly declining but remain low, with a range of 1.1% in Week25, 2024 (#1) to 0.7% in Week29, 2024 (#1). Despite low positivity, co-circulating respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (Week25, 2024 #10; Week29, 2024 #7) contribute to respiratory illness levels and may drive future ILI occurrences.
5. Novel influenza virus cases, including human infections with A(H1N2)v (Week25, 2024 #7) and A(H5) (Week28, 2024 #8; Week29, 2024 #6), introduce potential risks of new ILI variants, especially with zoonotic exposures. These developments may support a rise in ILI levels as surveillance continues.
6. Current surveillance indicates continued co-circulation of Influenza A (H3N2), A(H1N1), and B viruses, all with high antigenic similarity to vaccine strains and minimal resistance to antivirals (Week25, 2024 #8; Week28, 2024 #9). However, vaccination coverage details remain limited, and uptake trends are not explicitly emphasized in recent weeks (Week27, 2024 #9; Week29, 2024 #9), potentially influencing ILI outcomes.
7. Combining the fluctuating but increasing ILI trend, peak onset season classification, co-circulating respiratory virus activity, novel influenza risks, and limited vaccination details, the predicted ILI occurrence for Week34, 2024, is 3408. This projection reflects anticipated increases as ILI activity transitions into the peak onset period.
