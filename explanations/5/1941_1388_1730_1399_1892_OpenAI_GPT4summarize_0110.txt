1. The reported ILI counts for the past five weeks—Week1 (1941), Week2 (1388), Week3 (1730), Week4 (1399), and Week5 (1892)—demonstrate an overall fluctuating trend with intermittent increases and decreases. The variations highlight a lack of sustained growth or decline, suggesting possible external influences on the healthcare-seeking behaviors or reporting. Notable dips occurred in Week2 and Week4, with recovery in Week3 and Week5. The lack of a clear upward or downward trajectory indicates suppressed influenza transmission typical of concurrent pandemic years.
2. Forecasting Week10, 2021 places it after the typical peak season (Week46, 2020 to Week6, 2021) and aligns it within the off-season. This is supported by historically low influenza positivity across previous weeks and subdued ILI indicators (Week1 to Week5, 2021 #1, #4). Hence, Week10, 2021 corresponds to the off-season.
3. A time-series model evaluating the past weeks predicts a muted ILI activity reflecting the low-level seasonal fluctuations observed in Weeks1–5, 2021. The suppressed ILI activity suggests that future occurrences will not significantly deviate as influenza transmission remains historically constrained. The forecast of 936 ILI occurrences for Week10, 2021 aligns with this stable, low transmission baseline in the off-season.
4. Influenza positivity rates remain exceptionally low, reflected by clinical lab rates of 0.4% in Week1, 0.1% in Weeks2, 4, and 5, and just 0.3% in Week3 (Week1 to Week5, 2021 #1, #4). This underlines reduced transmission dynamics during the pandemic year, dampening typical influenza waves.
5. Vaccination encouragement is broadly emphasized, but uptake trends are not highlighted, leaving unclear levels of herd immunity or collective protection this flu season (Weeks1 to Week5, 2021 #8, #9, #7, #8, #8). However, the CDC's strong focus on vaccines suggests existing protective strategies, likely moderating ILI trends in off-season weeks such as Week10, 2021.
6. Healthcare-seeking behavior remains altered due to COVID-19, affecting outpatient ILI visit data and reporting consistency (Week1 to Week5, 2021 #9, #9, #7, #8, #9). This variable skews historical comparisons but supports the observed atypical influenza seasonality and low ILI baseline influencing the Week10, 2021 projection.
7. Allowing for historically suppressed transmission (extremely low influenza positivity rates), ongoing vaccination efforts, and the effect of reduced healthcare access during COVID-19, the predicted ILI occurrences of 936 for Week10, 2021 accurately reflect the off-season dynamics and constrained influenza spread evident throughout Weeks1–5, 2021. The forecast aligns with stable, low fluctuations consistent with recent trends in ILI occurrences.
