1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week20 to Week24, 2024 are 1698, 1711, 1731, 1685, and 1476. The trend shows a slight increase from Week20 (1698) to Week22 (1731) but decreases from Week22 (1731) to Week24 (1476). This pattern indicates a mild fluctuation with a gradual downward tendency in the last two weeks.
2. Based on the timing and classification of influenza seasons in the U.S., the target week (Week29, 2024) occurs in the off-season. This aligns with observed low influenza activity in Weeks20–24, 2024 and the typical off-season range (Week9 to Week30), which characterizes reduced community spread.
3. The slight fluctuations followed by a decrease in ILI occurrences observed during the past five weeks suggest a low and declining trend. Using time-series forecasting, this indicates a model expectation of a continued decrease or leveling off of ILI activity, projecting a future count of 874 occurrences by Week29, 2024. This aligns with a low activity baseline typical of the off-season.
4. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory viruses has influenced respiratory illness trends, but their impact has been minimal in driving ILI spikes (Week20, 2024 #10; Week22, 2024 #10; Week24, 2024 #9).
5. Influenza vaccination coverage remains stable, and the majority of circulating strains match the components of the vaccine, enhancing protection against widespread influenza transmission (Week21, 2024 #10; Week22, 2024 #13; Week24, 2024 #8).
6. Regional ILI activity remains below baseline across all jurisdictions, and no jurisdictions have reported moderate or high ILI occurrences, further supporting the minimal influenza transmission risk (Week21, 2024 #5; Week23, 2024 #6; Week24, 2024 #4).
7. In summary, low and stabilizing ILI trends, off-season timing, stable co-circulation of respiratory viruses, strong vaccine coverage alignment with circulating strains, and minimal regional activity collectively justify the projected ILI occurrence of 874 for Week29, 2024.
