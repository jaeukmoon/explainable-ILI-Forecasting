1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1084', '1189', '1240', '1216', '1752']. There was a gradual rise from 1084 (Week44, 2021) to 1240 (Week46, 2021), followed by a minor dip to 1216 in Week47, 2021, and then a significant spike to 1752 in Week48, 2021. This sharp increase at the end of the period reflects an accelerating trend in ILI activity.
2. A positive correlation is evident between the past time-series data and the reported future value of 2533 occurrences. The sharp rise in Week48, 2021, serves as a precursor to the sustained increase, culminating in the heightened ILI activity reported after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed steady increases during the 5-week period, starting at 2.1% in Week44, 2021, to reaching the national baseline of 2.5% in Week48, 2021. This consistent rise in healthcare encounters aligns with the observed surge in ILI occurrences.
4. Hospitalizations due to laboratory-confirmed influenza grew markedly from 295 (Week44, 2021) to 841 (Week48, 2021). This progression highlights expanding severe cases, contributing to heightened overall ILI activity that aligns with the future increase to 2533.
5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, particularly in Week48, 2021, as stated in CDC reports, adds variability and complexity to ILI data but strongly supports the increasingly reported respiratory illnesses fueling future ILI occurrences.
6. Heightened ILI activity among the 5–24 years age group, which accounted for most Influenza A(H3N2) cases during Weeks44–48, 2021, indicates a demographically vulnerable segment driving overall case growth contributing to the reported future value.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 2533 (Week53, 2021) are driven by the upward trend in Weeks44–48, 2021, characterized by increasing outpatient visits, surging hospitalizations, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and heightened ILI activity within specific demographics (5-24 years).
