1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show a clear upward trend, progressing from 1502 (Week 35, 2021) to 1978 (Week 39, 2021). The data highlights incremental increases each week, with the most notable jump occurring between Week 35 (1502) and Week 36 (1743). This growing pattern signifies a steady rise in ILI activity throughout the monitoring period.
2. A positive correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences, as the continuous increase in ILI cases over Weeks 35–39, 2021, aligns with the eventual rise to 2296 cases by Week 44, 2021. The sustained upward movement over the past weeks likely contributed to the amplified ILI reporting 5 weeks later.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually increased from Week 35, 2021 (0.9%), to Week 39, 2021 (1.9%), remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%. While flu circulation was minimal, this rise reflects ongoing respiratory illness activity associated with other non-influenza pathogens. Such increases closely parallel the future ILI surge to 2296.
4. Elevated percentages of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) across Weeks 35–39, 2021, consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, with 21.1% (Week 37, 2021) being the peak. Such heightened PIC indicators reflect substantial respiratory disease prevalence, influencing subsequent ILI trends.
5. Concurrent COVID-19 impacts on healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance data, repeatedly highlighted in CDC reports, have contributed to changes in ILI reporting and interpretation. These disruptions may explain the sharp increase in ILI occurrences to 2296 after Week 39, 2021, despite low influenza transmission.
6. Despite limited influenza circulation (e.g., 0.1% positivity in Week 36, 2021) and the absence of significant subtype activity in laboratory reports, the rise in ILI activity is likely fueled by the prevalence of other respiratory viruses. Such indirect contributions likely influenced the observed future trend.
7. In summary, the reported 2296 future ILI occurrences (Week 44, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks 35–39, 2021, increased outpatient visits linked to non-influenza respiratory pathogens, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-associated disruptions in healthcare-seeking and routine surveillance systems.
