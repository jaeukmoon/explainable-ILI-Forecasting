1. The ILI occurrences from the past five weeks (Week24, 2024 to Week28, 2024) exhibit a clear decreasing trend: 1476, 1397, 1268, 1015, and 1025. After consistent declines from Week24 to Week27, there is a slight increase in Week28 from 1015 to 1025. However, the overall trend indicates a gradual reduction in ILI activity, suggesting stabilization at a lower level of occurrences.
2. Season Classification for Week33, 2024: According to the outlined U.S. flu season cycle, Week33, 2024 falls within the "Peak onset season," which generally spans from Week32 to Week46. This period is characterized by an early ramp-up in ILI activity leading into higher transmission rates later in the season. However, since the weeks leading to Week33 have shown low influenza activity, the onset may start slower than usual.
3. A correlation analysis of historical trends suggests that occurrences during "Peak onset season" typically show a slight rise or stabilization over prior weeks, depending on the starting baseline levels. Using a simple linear trend projection model, the average week-on-week change in occurrences for the past five weeks (-79, -129, -253, +10) is calculated as approximately -112.75. Applying this average reduction to the most recent value (1025), the projected linear reduction results in a baseline value of **811 occurrences** expected in Week33. This reflects continuation of the historical decreasing trend, tempered by the characteristics of the Peak onset season, where activity stabilizes before ramping up.
4. Three key CDC report insights influencing the forecast:
5. a. Low seasonal influenza activity: The CDC reports from Week24 to Week28, 2024 indicate persistently low influenza activity, with clinical specimen positivity rates declining from 1.4% to 0.8% and fewer respiratory visits (1.6% to 1.4%). This decline supports the trend of lower ILI occurrences into Week33.
6. b. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses: While COVID-19, RSV, and other respiratory viruses add variability, no major disruptions have been reported. Stable trends in co-circulating viruses support continued low ILI activity.
7. c. Vaccination and reduced antiviral resistance: Widespread vaccination recommendations and minimal resistance to antiviral treatments are reflected in the stable reduction of influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths. These factors further contribute to the projection of lower influenza activity in Week33.
5. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrence of 811 for Week33, 2024 is supported by the combination of (i) a decreasing trend in past weeks' occurrences, (ii) the seasonal classification of Peak onset season, where activity begins to stabilize before accelerating, (iii) a linear decline projection based on prior weekly changes, (iv) low current influenza activity, and (v) stable epidemiological factors from CDC reports fostering a low-risk environment. These jointly explain the anticipated low but stable ILI activity at 811 occurrences.
