1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating trend, with values of ['1829', '2107', '2109', '2190', '1855']. After an increase from 1829 in Week 43, 2021 to 2109 in Week 45, 2021, the trend peaked at 2190 in Week 46, 2021, followed by a decline to 1855 in Week 47, 2021. This pattern indicates intermittent surges in ILI activity, with overall variability across the observed period.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the increase from Week 43–Week 46, 2021 aligns with the reported rise in occurrences after 5 weeks to 3231 (Week 52, 2021). The earlier rise in Weeks 43–46 suggests a buildup of ILI activity, which likely contributed to the amplified ILI cases in the subsequent weeks.

3. In Week 47, 2021, outpatient visits for ILI reached 2.4% of healthcare encounters, progressively increasing from 1.9% in Week 43, 2021. Although still below the national baseline, this upward trajectory highlights increased levels of respiratory illness, contributing to the future ILI surge.
4. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) deaths consistently remained high, ranging from 14.1% (Week 44, 2021) to 15.5% (Week 47, 2021), surpassing epidemic thresholds primarily due to COVID-19. Persistent PIC mortality indicates an intensified respiratory illness burden, correlated with the rise in ILI occurrences over the following weeks.
5. Increasing dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) cases, particularly among the 5–24 age group, was noted in all weeks, with Influenza A accounting for more than 96% of positive lab detections by Week 47, 2021. This steady rise in influenza activity likely contributed to the higher future ILI cases.
6. In summary, the increase to 3231 future ILI occurrences (Week 52, 2021) can be attributed to the fluctuating yet rising trend in Weeks 43–46, 2021, escalating outpatient visits for ILI, elevated PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and increasing influenza activity driven by the A(H3N2) subtype.
