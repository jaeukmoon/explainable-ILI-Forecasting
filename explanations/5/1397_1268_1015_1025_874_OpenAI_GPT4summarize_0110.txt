1. The reported ILI counts from Week25 to Week29, 2024 are 1397, 1268, 1015, 1025, and 874. This represents a sharp decrease in Week26 (1268) after Week25 (1397), followed by a consistent declining trend through Week29 (874). The overall pattern shows a significant drop in ILI occurrences, indicating a steady reduction in activity levels across these weeks.
2. Week34, 2024 occurs during the typical off-season period. Based on historical patterns, the off-season spans from Week9 to approximately Week31 or Week32 each year. Current trends remain consistent with off-season activity, characterized by low ILI occurrences, minimal influenza positivity, and reduced community spread. Therefore, Week34, 2024 belongs to the off-season.
3. The consistent declining trend in ILI counts over the analyzed 5 weeks suggests a continuation of low seasonal activity. Historical data indicates that such patterns during off-season periods typically persist without sharp increases. Thus, projecting forward from Week29, 2024, the model estimates a gradual stabilization of low ILI levels, leading to the predicted count of 785 occurrences in Week34, 2024.
4. Influenza activity remains extremely low, with positivity rates declining steadily from 1.1% in Week25 to 0.7% in Week29 (Week25, 2024 #1; Week29, 2024 #1). This sustained decline indicates no imminent surge in transmission.
5. Vaccination Trends: While recent CDC reports emphasize the importance of vaccination, no updates suggest notable changes in vaccination coverage (Week25, 2024 #9; Week27, 2024 #8; Week29, 2024 #9). Furthermore, high antigenic similarity between vaccine strains and circulating viruses likely contributes to effective mitigation of influenza activity (Week25, 2024 #8; Week28, 2024 #9).
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and RSV persists but shows no significant impact on driving up ILI counts during this period (Week25, 2024 #10; Week27, 2024 #9; Week29, 2024 #7).
7. Given the sustained decline in past ILI counts, the off-season designation of Week34, 2024, stable co-circulation trends, and high vaccine similarity to circulating strains, the forecast of 785 ILI occurrences is consistent with current low transmission dynamics.
