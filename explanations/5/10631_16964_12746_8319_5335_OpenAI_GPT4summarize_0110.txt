1. The reported ILI counts from Week51, 2021 to Week3, 2022 are 10631, 16964, 12746, 8319, and 5335. This trend indicates a steep increase during the first two weeks (from 10631 in Week51, 2021 to 16964 in Week52, 2021), followed by a significant decline over the next three weeks, reaching 5335 in Week3, 2022. Overall, the data exhibits a peak in Week52, 2021, followed by a steady downward trajectory.
2. In the U.S., the peak season generally spans Week46 of one year to Week6 of the next year. Week8, 2022 occurs immediately after this window, during the off-season. As Week3, 2022 already shows stabilization at lower ILI levels, and considering Week8, 2022 falls into the off-season, the target week is classified as off-season.
3. The time-series data suggests that the steep decline from Week1, 2022 to Week3, 2022 will stabilize or possibly decline further as influenza activity tapers off during the off-season. This pattern implies reduced transmission levels and diminishing ILI occurrences, projecting future occurrences to settle at lower levels around 2196, consistent with trends in past off-seasons.
4. Influenza activity reports highlight that positivity for influenza among clinical specimens has dropped from a high of 6.2% in Week51, 2021 to 1.9% in Week3, 2022, indicating waning virus circulation.
5. Lower vaccination coverage compared to prior seasons and antigenic differences in A(H3N2) strains may slightly impede immunity protection, yet co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 (Week1, 2022 #8; Week2, 2022 #9; Week3, 2022 #9) complicates ILI activity.
6. Outpatient respiratory illness visits have declined consistently from 4.8% in Week52, 2021 to 2.8% in Week3, 2022 (above baseline but gradually normalizing), aligning with reduced community disease spread.
7. Considering the sharp decline in ILI trends, off-season timing of Week8, 2022, diminished virus positivity and outpatient visits, and moderate residual effects from lower vaccination rates and co-circulating respiratory infections, the projected ILI occurrence of 2196 is justified by these combined factors.
