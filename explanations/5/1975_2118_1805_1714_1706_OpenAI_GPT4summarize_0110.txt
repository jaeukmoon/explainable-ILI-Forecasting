1. The ILI occurrences for Week2 through Week6, 2021 show a declining trend: 1975, 2118, 1805, 1714, 1706. After an increase in Week3 (2118), the trend steadily decreased, indicating a pattern of diminishing activity. This suggests overall low and declining ILI activity during this period.
2. Week11, 2021 falls after the usual peak season (Week46, 2020 to Week6, 2021) and during the off-season, based on minimal ILI activity, atypical influenza patterns during COVID-19, and CDC reports indicating no significant resurgence in influenza activity by Week6, 2021. Hence, forecasting for Week11, 2021 aligns with the off-season period.
3. The downward trend observed from Weeks4 to Week6, 2021 in ILI occurrences and no indications of a significant surge in influenza activity from the CDC reports suggest that Week11, 2021 will likely continue this pattern of minimal activity. The future projection indicates a stabilization at low levels. Time-series analysis predicts only slight fluctuations, continuing the declines seen in previous weeks.
4. Influenza activity remains historically low, with only 0.1% of specimens testing positive nationwide, and no significant trends indicating resurgence, as reported in all weeks (Week2-Week6, 2021).
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior for ILI remains significantly altered by the COVID-19 pandemic, transforming traditional ILI surveillance and reducing outpatient visitation rates (Week2-Week6, 2021).
6. COVID-19 remains the dominant driver of PIC mortality, with influenza playing a minor role. The pandemic’s influence is evident in the elevated PIC deaths (14.7%-28.4%, Week2-Week6, 2021) and low influenza activity.
7. The forecasted ILI for Week11, 2021 reflects the ongoing off-season period, no significant influenza resurgence, and the influence of COVID-19 disruptions on traditional surveillance. Combined with the declining ILI trend from Week2-Week6, 2021, future ILI occurrences are expected to align with the current minimal levels.
