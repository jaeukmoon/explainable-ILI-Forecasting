1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a declining trend overall, though there was variability. The values started from 1734 in Week49, 2020, then decreased to 1679 in Week50, 2020, followed by further declines to 1396 in Week51, 2020, and 1175 in Week52, 2020. There was a slight rise to 1271 in Week53, 2020, indicating a minor rebound in ILI activity at the end of the 5-week period. This general declining trend reflects minimal influenza activity during these weeks.
2. The future occurrence value of 1093 (Week6, 2021) reveals a continuation of the declining trend observed in past ILI occurrences, particularly as the data shows a large reduction from the initial value of 1734 (Week49, 2020) to 1271 (Week53, 2020). This sustained decrease likely signifies the continued low influenza transmission noted throughout the reporting period.
3. Despite low influenza positivity rates ranging from 0.2% in Week49, 2020, to 0.1% in Week53, 2020, COVID-19-related PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) deaths consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds throughout, ranging from 14.3% (Week49, 2020) to 14.5% (Week53, 2020). This elevated PIC burden primarily linked to COVID-19 could contribute to non-specific respiratory illnesses being recorded as ILI, driving reported activity.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at approximately 1.6% throughout the 5 weeks (Week49–Week53, 2020), consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%. This stability reflects subdued influenza activity and healthcare behaviors shaped by pandemic conditions, which historically impact ILI surveillance.
5. Disruptions in traditional healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, noted in all 5 CDC reports, have likely influenced ILI underreporting and shifted the timeline of respiratory illness detection. This disruption aligns with overall lower influenza activity and decreased ILI occurrences.
6. The continued dominance of non-influenza respiratory illnesses or non-specific ILI cases was documented, with minimal laboratory-confirmed influenza cases reported—only 118 hospitalizations and limited strain circulation by Week53, 2020. This ongoing suppression of influenza activity due to pandemic mitigation measures helped constrain future ILI occurrences to 1093.
7. In summary, the reported 1093 future ILI occurrences (Week6, 2021) are attributed to the sustained overall decline in past ILI occurrences, stable yet subdued outpatient ILI percentages, persistent elevated PIC mortality mainly tied to COVID-19, minimal influenza positivity rates, and pandemic-driven interruptions to healthcare-seeking and ILI surveillance systems. These factors collectively reflect an atypically low influenza season exacerbated by pandemic influences.
