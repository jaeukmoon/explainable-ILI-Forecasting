1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent upward trend, starting from 1277 (Week 45, 2023) and increasing through 1403 (Week 46, 2023), followed by a slight dip to 1331 (Week 47, 2023), and then rising sharply to 1703 (Week 48, 2023) and further to 1827 (Week 49, 2023). This pattern highlights consecutive weekly growth in ILI activity, with a noticeable peak by Week 49, 2023.
2. A direct correlation exists between the past upward trend and the reported future ILI occurrences of 1777, as the sustained increase in Weeks 48 and 49, 2023, appears to set the stage for continued elevated levels, albeit with some stabilization or slight fluctuation observed in future data. The peak in Week 49, 2023, aligns temporally with the steady continuation in elevated future activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily climbed over the 5-week period, reaching 4.4% in Week 49, 2023, a level consistently above the national baseline of 2.9%. This prolonged period of heightened outpatient activity correlates strongly with the elevated ILI occurrences observed in future weeks.
4. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, was noted across all reports, with potential compounding effects reflected in continued ILI increases and future occurrences.
5. Rising influenza positivity rates throughout the 5 weeks, from 4.0% in Week 45, 2023, to 10.2% in Week 49, 2023, mirror the observed jump in ILI activity and directly influence future occurrences.
6. Hospitalization rates increased over the period, reaching 8.0 per 100,000 by Week 49, 2023, indicating a growing severity in respiratory illnesses and contributing to higher ILI occurrences in subsequent weeks.
4. The cumulative evidence from weekly ILI trends, increasing outpatient visits, elevated positivity rates, co-circulating respiratory pathogens, and rising hospitalization rates underscores the sustained high level of ILI occurrences reported after 5 weeks. These combined factors explain the observed future number of 1777 occurrences, highlighting the continued elevated impact of influenza and associated illnesses during this period.
