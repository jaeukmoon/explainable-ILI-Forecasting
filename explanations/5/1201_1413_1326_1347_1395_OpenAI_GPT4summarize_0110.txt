1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week31 to Week35, 2021 are 1201, 1413, 1326, 1347, and 1395, respectively. The data shows an overall increase from Week31 (1201) to Week32 (1413), followed by slight fluctuations but stabilizing at a higher average towards Week35 (1395). This trend suggests a gradual rise with minor variability rather than sharp increases or decreases.
2. Based on the timing, Week40, 2021 aligns with the peak onset season as it occurs after Week35, 2021 and before Week46, 2021. This is consistent with the gradual increase seen in past ILI trends and the typical seasonal classifications in the U.S.
3. Time-series analysis of past occurrences indicates that the observed rise in ILI counts from Week31 to Week35, 2021 is likely to propagate into a continued moderate increase towards Week40, 2021. Given the growth trends without sharp spikes or dips, the estimated value of 1250 ILI occurrences aligns with a stabilization toward a moderately elevated level.
4. Minimal influenza virus activity is reported across Week31 to Week35, 2021 (Week31 #4; Week32 #7; Week34 #1), with increases in ILI largely attributed to other respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 (Week33 #3; Week34 #4). This non-influenza respiratory virus activity supports the forecast of ILI occurrences remaining moderate rather than surging drastically.
5. Age-specific trends highlight increases across multiple age groups, particularly 0–4 years and 5–24 years (Week31 #3; Week32 #3; Week34 #2), contributing to a steady rise in outpatient visits for ILI and supporting a forecast of continued elevated ILI occurrences by Week40.
6. Healthcare-seeking behaviors significantly impact ILI surveillance and reporting (Week31 #8; Week33 #9), suggesting potential underestimation of ILI occurrences due to altered patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Correcting for such influences implies some increase in expected counts.
7. The forecasted ILI value of 1250 for Week40, 2021 reflects the stabilized trend of gradual increases from other respiratory viruses, ongoing age-specific trends, limited influenza circulation, and the timing within the peak onset season. These factors collectively justify the moderate ILI prediction.
