1. The past time-series ILI occurrences across the 5 weeks exhibit a consistent upward trend, starting at 1902 in Week13, 2022, and progressively increasing to 2654 by Week17, 2022. Weekly increases are observed: 1902 (Week13) to 1977 (Week14), 1977 to 2104 (Week15), 2104 to 2309 (Week16), and 2309 to 2654 (Week17). The steady growth emphasizes an ongoing rise in ILI activity during this period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the upward trajectory in past ILI occurrences and the future value of 3629 reported after 5 weeks. The steady weekly increases in Weeks13–17, 2022, set the stage for the subsequent surge to 3629, reflecting a continuation of the progressive ILI escalation observed in the past data.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness showed incremental increases over the weeks, climbing from 1.9% in Week13, 2022, to 2.2% by Week17, 2022. This upward trend in healthcare-seeking behavior mirrors and potentially drives the rise in ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza-associated hospitalizations steadily increased for 11 weeks, reaching 3243 in Week15 and peaking at 3070 by Week17, 2022, with a decreasing trend only observed at that point. This prolonged hospitalization activity reflects growing severity in respiratory illness cases, aligning with the increase to 3629 future ILI occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, particularly SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, as highlighted in all weeks, contributed to elevated respiratory illness levels across communities. Such overlapping pathogen activity complicated epidemiological trends, amplifying ILI occurrences beyond typical influenza dynamics.
6. Vaccine strain mismatches for Influenza A(H3N2) noted in Weeks14–17, 2022, may have reduced vaccine efficacy, potentially increasing susceptibility to illness. This factor likely compounded the ongoing ILI rise leading to the surge of 3629 occurrences after 5 weeks.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 3629 can be attributed to the consistent weekly increases during Weeks13–17, 2022, rising outpatient visits and hospitalizations, co-circulating respiratory pathogens, and vaccine mismatches against the dominant A(H3N2) strain. These factors cumulatively fueled the observed surge in ILI cases over time.
