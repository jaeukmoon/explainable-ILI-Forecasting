1. The reported ILI counts from Week32 to Week36, 2021 are 1043, 1040, 1101, 1255, and 1305. The trend indicates a gradual increase, with a significant rise from Week34 (1101) to Week35 (1255) and Week36 (1305). This upward trend suggests growing ILI activity in the weeks leading up to the forecasted target week (Week41, 2021).
2. Based on the U.S. influenza season classification, Week41, 2021 falls during the peak onset season. This aligns with the typical timeline where ILI activity begins to increase but has not yet reached peak levels. The rising trend in ILI occurrences confirms this classification.
3. From a time-series perspective, the steady rise in ILI counts during Weeks32–36, 2021, and the observed growth in Week36 (1305) provide evidence to project a future ILI occurrence of 1063 after minor fluctuations in the following weeks. Given that the peak onset season often exhibits increasing activity, this slight adjustment downward represents expected variability.
4. Minimal influenza virus circulation was reported nationwide during this period, with a positivity rate of 0.1% (Week34, 2021 #1; Week36, 2021 #3). The increase in ILI is attributed to other respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, likely driving the observed trend (Week33, 2021 #3; Week36, 2021 #2).
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior and pandemic-related factors, such as alternative care settings and overlapping COVID-19 symptoms, continue to complicate ILI monitoring (Week32, 2021 #8; Week35, 2021 #10; Week36, 2021 #9). Challenges in distinguishing influenza from other circulating respiratory viruses impact surveillance and prediction accuracy.
6. Vaccination trends remain unclear, with no substantial updates provided. However, routine vaccination remains emphasized, leaving the potential for improved preventive measures in the population unclear during this period (Week32, 2021 #6; Week34, 2021 #7; Week36, 2021 #8).
7. Considering the documented rise in ILI occurrences, classification within the peak onset season, and influencing factors such as non-influenza respiratory viruses and healthcare behavior changes, the projected ILI occurrence at 1063 for Week41, 2021 reflects a continuation of gradual growth with slight stabilization.
