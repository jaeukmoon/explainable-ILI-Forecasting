1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend, with values of ['16604', '14312', '11664', '9785', '11429']. There was a sharp decline from 16604 (Week 52, 2023) to 9785 (Week 2, 2024), followed by an increase to 11429 (Week 4, 2024). This rebound in ILI values during the later weeks suggests potential for rising activity, setting the stage for future increases.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the resurgence observed in Week 4, 2024 (11429) aligns with the substantial rise to 18300 future occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 9, 2024). The fluctuating but stabilizing trend in the observed weeks likely contributed to the escalated incidence observed in future data.
3. Increasing cumulative hospitalization rates from 22.3 per 100,000 (Week 52, 2023) to 47.8 per 100,000 (Week 4, 2024) demonstrate the severity of flu activity, particularly among older adults, who constituted the majority of hospitalizations.
4. Regional trends indicated persistently elevated positivity rates in Regions 6, 8, and others throughout the observed weeks. These high positivity rates signal increased ILI activity in key areas contributing to national ILI statistics.
5. Pediatric deaths sharply rose week over week, reaching a total of 65 by Week 4, 2024, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 being the predominant cause. High pediatric mortality is a proxy for severe flu seasons, correlating with overall ILI occurrences.
6. The co-circulation of influenza and other respiratory viruses like RSV and COVID-19 likely contributed to complex patterns of respiratory illnesses, which could have amplified the reported future ILI surge.
7. In summary, the rise to 18300 future ILI occurrences (Week 9, 2024) is linked to the fluctuating yet elevated past trends in ILI occurrences, rising hospitalization rates, regional persistence of influenza positivity, severe pediatric outcomes, and the compounding influence of co-circulating respiratory pathogens.
