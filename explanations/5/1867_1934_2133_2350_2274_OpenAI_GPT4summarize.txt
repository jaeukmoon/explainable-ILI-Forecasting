1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an upward trend followed by a slight decline. Starting at 1867 in Week 22, 2021, the values rose consistently to 1934 in Week 23 and 2133 in Week 24, peaking at 2350 in Week 25. However, in Week 26, 2021, the occurrences slightly dropped to 2274. This pattern indicates an overall increase in ILI activity with potential fluctuations by the end of the 5-week period.  
2. A positive correlation can be observed between past and future ILI occurrences. The increase in occurrences from Week 22 to Week 25, 2021, reflects a buildup in respiratory illness activity, which aligns with the reported future surge to 3987 occurrences after 5 weeks, likely representing a continuation of the escalating trend seen during the earlier period.  
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently accounted for 1.2% of all visits during the 5-week period, remaining below the national baseline of 2.6% but stable across Weeks 22–26, 2021. This stability, coupled with increasing ILI case numbers in certain weeks, suggests underlying growth in respiratory illness cases that contributed to the subsequent rise in future ILI occurrences.  
4. Persistent exceedance of the epidemic threshold for pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC)-attributed deaths was observed, ranging from 7.5% in Week 22 to 6.2% in Week 26, 2021 (all above epidemic thresholds of 5.7–6.1%). This sustained elevated PIC mortality signifies heightened respiratory illness activity that could be associated with the future uptick in ILI occurrences.  
5. The impact of shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as documented throughout Weeks 22–26, 2021, disrupted the accuracy of ILI reporting and surveillance. These disruptions likely delayed case detection and contributed to the observed future rise in ILI occurrences to 3987, emphasizing the influence of changing care practices on reporting trends.  
6. Despite minimal influenza virus circulation (e.g., <0.1% positivity rate in Weeks 24–25, 2021), other factors, such as respiratory illnesses caused by non-influenza pathogens or post-COVID-19 syndromic reporting trends, may have affected the future increase in ILI occurrences. Pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare access and illness monitoring likely magnified non-specific ILI reporting.  
7. In summary, the reported 3987 future ILI occurrences (Week 31, 2021) can be explained by the overall upward trend in ILI cases during Weeks 22–25, stable outpatient visit percentages for ILI, sustained PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the compounded effects of pandemic-induced shifts in healthcare behaviors and surveillance challenges.
