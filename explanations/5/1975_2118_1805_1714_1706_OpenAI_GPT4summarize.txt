1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating downward trend, with values of ['1975', '2118', '1805', '1714', '1706']. After peaking at 2118 (Week 2, 2021), the occurrences gradually declined, reaching the lowest value of 1706 by Week 6, 2021. This indicates a sustained decrease in ILI activity throughout this period.  

2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the continued decline in ILI occurrences during the past 5 weeks (Weeks 2–6, 2021) aligns with the future occurrences stabilizing at 2021. The tapering pattern observed in Weeks 5 and 6, 2021, where ILI values approached a steady state, acts as a precursor to the relatively stable future numbers.  

3. Several factors in the summarized CDC reports directly correlate with the future ILI occurrences:  
   - Outpatient visits for ILI consistently declined, falling from 1.4% in Week 2, 2021 to 1.1% by Week 6, 2021, remaining well below the national baseline of 2.6%. This sustained low outpatient ILI activity aligns with stable but reduced future ILI activity.  
   - The cumulative hospitalization rate for ILI remained exceptionally low, at 0.5–0.6 per 100,000 population across all weeks, reflecting minimal severe influenza activity.  
   - Minimal positivity rates for influenza were documented, with clinical lab detections consistently at or below 0.3% (e.g., 0.1% in Weeks 2, 4, and 6, 2021). Dominance of Influenza B subtype was noted in Weeks 5–6 but at levels far below seasonal norms, suggesting limited influenza-specific morbidity.  

4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2021 can be attributed to the downward trend in ILI activity during Weeks 2–6, 2021, as supported by decreased outpatient ILI visits, persistently low hospitalization rates, minimal influenza positivity rates, and the overarching influence of atypical influenza seasons driven by COVID-19 disruptions on healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance.
