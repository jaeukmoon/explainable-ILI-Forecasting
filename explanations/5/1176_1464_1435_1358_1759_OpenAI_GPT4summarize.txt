1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating pattern with an overall upward trend, increasing from 1176 (Week 13, 2021) to 1759 (Week 17, 2021). After an initial rise from 1176 in Week 13 to 1464 in Week 14, there was a slight dip to 1435 in Week 15, followed by another decrease to 1358 in Week 16. However, a significant surge occurred in Week 17, reaching 1759. This suggests a possible resurgence in ILI activity by the end of the observed period.

2. The upward trajectory in Week 17 aligns with the future reported ILI occurrences of 1817 after 5 weeks (Week 22, 2021), demonstrating a positive correlation between recent increases in the past ILI activity and subsequent results. The pronounced spike in Week 17 may serve as a precursor to the sustained higher ILI activity levels reported in Week 22.

3. Several report factors correlate with the future ILI occurrences:
   - Outpatient visits for ILI, though stable at 1.1% throughout Weeks 13–17, remain below the national baseline, as healthcare behaviors stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic likely suppressed traditional surveillance metrics. This may have masked actual respiratory illness trends contributing to the observed future rise.
   - Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold each week (e.g., 12.4% in Week 15 and 11.7% in Week 17). Though driven primarily by COVID-19, the persistently elevated PIC mortality signals an underlying respiratory illness burden that could reflect an overall increase in ILI occurrences.
   - Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacted both ILI surveillance and data interpretation. Undetected cases and delayed reporting may have contributed to the sharp ILI rise observed in Week 22.

4. In summary, the increase to 1817 future ILI occurrences (Week 22, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trend observed in Week 17, the persistent elevation of PIC mortality indicating broader respiratory illness activity, and complications introduced by healthcare-seeking and reporting disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which likely affected both past and future ILI data.
