1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks revealed a consistent decline, with values of ['17486', '15495', '14144', '14344', '13771']. A significant drop is observed from 17486 (Week 24, 2022) to 13771 (Week 28, 2022), with minor fluctuations (e.g., a slight increase from 14144 in Week 26, 2022, to 14344 in Week 27, 2022). This overall downward trend reflects decreasing respiratory illness activity during the 5-week span.
2. Despite the decline in past ILI occurrences, there is a notable correlation with the future projected value of 13526. The gradual decrease from Week 24 to Week 28, 2022, aligns with a prediction of ILI stabilization at relatively lower levels, as seen with the slight convergence between the Week 28 value (13771) and the future occurrence (13526).
3. Weekly outpatient visits for ILI showed steady declines from 1.9% (Week 24, 2022) to 1.6% (Week 28, 2022), consistently below the national baseline. The highest contributions remained among younger children (e.g., 6.5–8.8% across Weeks 24–28), indicative of localized respiratory activity, which could sustain future cases.
4. PIC mortality percentages steadily increased, from 8.8% in Week 26, 2022, to 9.5% in Week 28, 2022, exceeding epidemic thresholds. Despite low influenza-specific contributions, heightened overall respiratory mortality suggests underlying sustained illness burdens that may influence future ILI occurrences.
5. Shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional ILI surveillance throughout Weeks 24–28, 2022. These disruptions, along with co-circulating respiratory pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, likely delayed early detection while sustaining residual ILI activity, contributing to the future 13526 cases.
6. In summary, the reported 13526 future ILI occurrences (after Week 28, 2022) can be attributed to the steady declining trends in Weeks 24–28, 2022, consistent yet localized high ILI rates in certain age groups despite a national decline, sustained PIC mortality surpassing thresholds, and pandemic-driven effects on surveillance and healthcare behaviors.
