1. The ILI counts from Week42 to Week46, 2021 are 1218, 1189, 1228, 1203, and 1223, which exhibit a stable trend with slight fluctuations around a consistent baseline. The data shows no significant spikes or downward dips, indicating a steady pattern of ILI activity during this period.
2. Since Week51, 2021 falls within the typical peak season timeframe (Week46 of one year to Week6 of the next year), it is reasonable to classify Week51, 2021 as part of the peak season for ILI activity. While the ILI activity remains low in earlier weeks, the increasing laboratory detections and outpatient ILI visits suggest a gradual build-up to peak activity.
3. The historical stability in ILI occurrences from Week42 to Week46, 2021, combined with the general trend of increasing outpatient ILI activity reported in Week46, 2021, supports a forecast that ILI counts will moderately increase by Week51 as the peak season advances. Extrapolating from past patterns, the model predicts an elevated yet not sharply rising number of 1746 cases.
4. A steady increase in laboratory-confirmed influenza cases is observed as early as Week43, 2021, with Influenza A dominating and reaching 97.1% positivity in Week45, 2021 (#1 Week43, #1 Week45). This trend correlates with higher ILI activity in later weeks, consistent with typical seasonal rises.
5. Outpatient ILI visits are gradually increasing, moving closer to the national baseline of 2.5% (Week44, 2021 #4 and Week46, 2021 #4). This rise, particularly among certain age groups (0–4 and 5–24 years), also supports the trend toward higher ILI occurrences in subsequent weeks.
6. Vaccination efforts are ongoing, with 166.9M doses distributed by Week46, 2021 (Week46, 2021 #7). However, the absence of substantial vaccination uptake trends and the dominance of A(H3N2) (a subtype often associated with increased spread) likely result in moderate increases in influenza activity despite these preventative measures.
7. In summary, the stable ILI trends from Week42 to Week46, 2021, alignment of Week51 with the peak season, gradual increases in positivity rates and ILI visits, and dominance of influenza A(H3N2) drive the forecast to 1746 cases for Week51, 2021. This value reflects a reasonable increase aligned with seasonal activity but not an unusual surge.
