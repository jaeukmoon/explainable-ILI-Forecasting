1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 46–50, 2021) exhibited a consistent increase, with values rising steadily from 1240 (Week 46, 2021) to 1874 (Week 50, 2021). This upward trajectory, with marked increases in Week 48 (1752) and Week 49 (1772), indicates growing respiratory illness activity during the observed period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the consistent growth in ILI activity during Weeks 47–50, 2021, culminates in a further increase to 2084 occurrences reported after 5 weeks (Week 3, 2022). The rising trend in the past weeks serves as a precursor to elevated activity levels observed in the future data.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI grew from 2.4% (Week 47, 2021) to 3.1% (Week 50, 2021), exceeding the national baseline. This sustained increase in healthcare encounters for ILI reflects a climb in respiratory illnesses, directly correlating with the rise in future occurrences.
4. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) continually surpassed the epidemic threshold, rising from 14.5% (Week 46, 2021) to 18.8% (Week 50, 2021). This abnormal PIC mortality points to widespread severe respiratory illness, aligning with the observed future surge.
5. Increasing positivity rates for influenza in clinical labs, from 1.5% (Week 47, 2021) to 5.6% (Week 50, 2021), predominantly driven by Influenza A(H3N2), highlight escalating flu activity nationwide. This rise in lab-confirmed cases aligns with the amplified future ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, as noted across all 5 weeks, alongside lower vaccination uptake compared to the previous season (Week 48–50, 2021), further contributed to rising ILI trends and explain the sharp increase to 2084 cases after 5 weeks.
7. In summary, the reported 2084 future ILI occurrences (Week 3, 2022) resulted from the consistent upward trend in the past weeks, increasing ILI-related outpatient visits, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, rising influenza positivity, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and lower vaccination coverage. These combined factors fueled the sharp rise in future cases.
