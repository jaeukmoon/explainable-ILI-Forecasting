1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values of ['17393', '18744', '16149', '15014', '12554']. Starting with a peak at 18744 in Week 50, 2023, the occurrences steadily dropped, descending through Week 51, 2023 (16149) and Week 52, 2023 (15014), to reach their lowest point at 12554 by Week 1, 2024. This downward trend over time highlights a significant reduction in ILI activity during these weeks.
2. The decline in past ILI occurrences correlates with the subsequent future drop to 11037 occurrences observed in Week 6, 2024. The steady reduction in Weeks 50 through Week 1, 2024, projects a continuation of this decreasing trend, leading to the lowered future value.
3. Weekly outpatient ILI visits show a declining percentage over time, from 6.9% in Week 52, 2023, to 4.3% by Week 3, 2024. This steady drop reflects reduced respiratory illness activity in healthcare settings, consistent with declining ILI occurrences. Cumulative hospitalization rates remained elevated, with a significant seasonal high of 43.3 per 100,000 by Week 3, 2024, suggesting lower outpatient ILI reporting as more severe cases transition to hospital settings. Virus positivity rates for Influenza A also decreased, from 17.5% in Week 52, 2023, to 13.7% in Week 2, 2024, reflecting declining influenza-driven respiratory illness.
4. The interplay of co-circulating viruses, including influenza, RSV, and COVID-19, described as complicating ILI patterns in the CDC reports (Week 52, 2023, to Week 3, 2024), likely influenced the gradual decline in reported ILI occurrences as individual pathogen activity waned.
5. In conclusion, the reported future decrease to 11037 ILI occurrences in Week 6, 2024, corresponds to the observed declining trend in past time-series data (Weeks 50, 2023, to Week 1, 2024). This decline is supported by reduced outpatient ILI visits, a drop in virus positivity rates, and a shift in healthcare settings with higher hospitalization proportions alongside complex respiratory illness co-circulation.
