1. The reported ILI counts from Week14 to Week18, 2021 are 1464, 1435, 1358, 1759, and 1626. The trend exhibits a slight decrease from Week14 (1464) to Week16 (1358), followed by a sharp spike in Week17 (1759) before slightly declining in Week18 (1626). This pattern shows fluctuation with a notable spike in Week17, rather than a consistent increase or decrease.
2. Week23, 2021 aligns with the off-season since it occurs well after the typical peak season (ending around Week06) and before the peak onset season (beginning near Week32). Historical low influenza activity reported during the input period supports this classification.
3. The fluctuating trend observed in the past ILI occurrences suggests marginal changes in coming weeks. The spike in Week17 signals temporary activity, but the subsequent fall in Week18 implies that ILI occurrences will stabilize. Extrapolating over five weeks, the forecast of 1748 reflects a slight decline from the spike while accounting for marginal fluctuations around recent levels.
4. Influenza circulation remains extremely low nationwide, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in Weeks14–18, 2021 (Week14, 2021 #1; Week15, 2021 #1; Week16, 2021 #1; Week17, 2021 #1; Week18, 2021 #1), which limits the likelihood of a substantial increase in ILI activity during the forecast period.
5. Vaccination trends have shown no significant updates or changes, and vaccination levels are assumed to be stable (Week14, 2021 #10; Week15, 2021 #10; Week16, 2021 #8; Week17, 2021 #8; Week18, 2021 #8). This steady vaccination uptake further reduces the potential for an ILI surge.
6. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and overlapping COVID-19 monitoring significantly alter the accuracy of ILI data interpretation during the input period (Week14, 2021 #6, #11; Week15, 2021 #8, #9; Week16, 2021 #9, #10; Week17, 2021 #9, #10; Week18, 2021 #9, #11). These external influences suppress any significant fluctuations in reported ILI occurrences, contributing to the forecasted stability.
7. The forecast of 1748 ILI occurrences for Week23, 2021 is supported by the observed fluctuating ILI counts, the off-season timing, consistently low influenza activity and positivity rates, stable vaccination levels, and broader influences of external factors such as COVID-19 trends and changes in healthcare-seeking patterns.
