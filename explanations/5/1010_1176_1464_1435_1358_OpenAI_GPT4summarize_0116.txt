1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from the past five weeks (Week12, 2021 to Week16, 2021) show an overall increasing trend followed by a slight decline: Week12 (1010), Week13 (1176), Week14 (1464), Week15 (1435), and Week16 (1358). This suggests a fluctuating, but overall upward trajectory in the mid-term. Calculating the week-over-week change provides:
2. - Week13 vs Week12: (1176 - 1010) = +166 (16.4% increase)
3. - Week14 vs Week13: (1464 - 1176) = +288 (24.5% increase)
4. - Week15 vs Week14: (1435 - 1464) = -29 (2.0% decrease)
5. - Week16 vs Week15: (1358 - 1435) = -77 (5.4% decrease).
6. The average weekly growth rate during this period is approximately [(16.4% + 24.5% - 2.0% - 5.4%) / 4] = 8.37%. Applying this average growth over five weeks to Week16 (1358):
7. - Projected value for Week21 = 1358 * (1 + 0.0837)^5 ≈ 1789.
2. Seasonal classification: Week21, 2021 belongs to the Off-season. Influenza activity typically decreases following the Peak season (Week46 of one year to Week6 of the next year) and remains low through the Off-season (up to Week31). The overall low influenza positivity rates (0.1%) and minimal activity reported in the CDC reports align with Off-season characteristics.
3. Correlation analysis: Historical trends indicate that ILI occurrences tend to stabilize or decline during the Off-season, barring external disruptions. The values in Week12 to Week16 displayed a mild upward trajectory attributable to local fluctuations rather than significant seasonal or pandemic-driven changes. Applying the upward growth adjustment from stable activity (average growth of 8.37%), influenced by factors like low flu transmission but potential increases in healthcare-seeking behavior, aligns with our computed projection of 1789 for Week21.
4. Three CDC report factors significantly influencing the forecast:
5. - The persistently low influenza positivity rate (0.1% nationwide) throughout Weeks12 to Week16 reflects an environment of minimal flu transmission. While this indicates a low baseline, it also suggests that brief fluctuations, rather than a sustained outbreak, will influence projections (e.g., a mid-range upward adjustment in weekly averages).
6. - Altered healthcare-seeking behavior and monitoring, due to overlapping COVID-19 and flu surveillance changes, complicates data interpretation. This factor likely caused higher recorded ILI occurrences relative to historical Off-season norms. Its moderate influence aligns with the 8.37% forecasted growth rate.
7. - Minimal novel virus activity (e.g., no significant influenza variant detected aside from one A(H1N1)v in Week14, 2021), combined with stable vaccination trends, supports limited risk of a significant outbreak, anchoring the ILI forecast closer to stability with mild upward adjustments.
5. In summary, the forecast of 1789 for Week21 is derived from a combination of quantitative trend analysis, seasonal classification (Off-season), correlation modeling using historical trends, and qualitative influences (e.g., low flu spread, COVID-19 healthcare impacts) from the CDC reports. These factors collectively justify the projected increase from 1358 in Week16 to 1789 in Week21.
