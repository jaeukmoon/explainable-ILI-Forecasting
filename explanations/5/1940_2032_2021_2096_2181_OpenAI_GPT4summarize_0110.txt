1. The reported ILI counts from Week11 to Week15, 2022 are 1940, 2032, 2021, 2096, and 2181. The data shows a consistent upward trend, with weekly increases except for a slight dip in Week13 (2021) before continuing to rise to Week15 (2181). This indicates a stable growth pattern in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks.
2. The target week, Week20, 2022, belongs to the off-season based on U.S. influenza seasonality. Week20 is outside the typical peak season (Week46 through Week6) and also past the secondary peak (Week19 in 2022). While ILI activity is increasing as shown in Weeks13 to Week15, this gradual growth aligns with trends usually seen in the off-season, when activity levels remain below peak thresholds.
3. The consistent increase over the past weeks reflects a time-series trend of stable growth in ILI counts. Given the recurring pattern and projected continuity of these trends, the forecasted count for Week20, 2022 reflects a slight increase from Week15 levels, arriving at the predicted value of 2211.
4. Virus circulation during this period supports the rise in ILI counts. Nearly all influenza detections are attributed to Influenza A(H3N2), which is showing antigenic differences from vaccine strains, potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness (Week11 #7; Week14 #8; Week15 #10). This, combined with dominant A(H3N2) activity (Week15 #2-3), contributes to sustained ILI increases.
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, remains a complicating factor. Coinfections have been reported, with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates between 3.2% and 5.4% in hospitalized cases (Week11 #8; Week12 #9; Week14 #9; Week15 #11). These rates likely contribute to the overall respiratory illness trend, influencing ILI projections.
6. CDC data indicates increasing outpatient respiratory illness visits over the weeks, rising from 1.8% in Week11 to 2.1% in Week15 (Week11 #4; Week12 #4; Week15 #4). Although still below the national baseline, the incremental rise reflects the growing burden of illness spreading across regions and age groups (Week14 #4; Week15 #12).
7. The forecasted ILI count of 2211 for Week20, 2022, is justified by the observed time-series upward trend in ILI occurrences, the genetic variability and dominance of A(H3N2) strains potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness, and continued co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses contributing to overall illness prevalence. Considering these factors, a gradual increase in ILI activity aligns with the forecasted value for Week20 in the off-season.
