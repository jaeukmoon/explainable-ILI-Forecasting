1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed notable fluctuations, with values of ['1070', '1056', '644', '1006', '1121']. There was an initial decrease from 1070 (Week 19, 2023) to 1056 (Week 20, 2023) and then a sharp decline to 644 (Week 21, 2023), followed by a rapid rebound to 1006 (Week 22, 2023) and 1121 (Week 23, 2023), the highest value of the period. This pattern indicates a recovery in ILI activity toward the end of the 5-week period after the preceding dip.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 722 align with the variability observed in the prior weeks, particularly the significant drop in Week 21, 2023 (644 cases). This low point likely impacted subsequent trends, contributing to the reduced levels 5 weeks later. Additionally, the increase in Weeks 22 and 23, 2023, was not sustained strongly enough to drive a higher future value after 5 weeks.
3. Stable ILI outpatient visit percentages remain below the national baseline, ranging from 1.6% to 2.0% over Weeks 19–23, 2023. The subdued outpatient engagement indicates underlying minimal ILI activity, which supports the lower future ILI count of 722.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) were relatively stable, hovering around or slightly above epidemic thresholds (6.2%–7.0%) during Weeks 19–23, 2023. These modest yet persistent mortality rates reflect no significant surges in respiratory illnesses.
5. Low influenza positivity rates, between 1.0% and 1.2% across the 5-week period, demonstrate the minimal circulation of influenza viruses, limiting their contribution to ILI activity.
6. The co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory pathogens noted during all weeks added complexity but did not drive any significant spikes in illness during the observed timeframe, maintaining subdued ILI trends.
4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 722 (Week 28, 2023) are consistent with the fluctuating but subdued trends in the past 5 weeks, particularly the low point in Week 21, 2023. Stable outpatient ILI visit percentages, minimal influenza positivity rates, and contained respiratory illnesses largely constrained ILI activity, supporting this relatively low future value.
