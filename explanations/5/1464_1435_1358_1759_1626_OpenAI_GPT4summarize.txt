1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a somewhat fluctuating but slightly increasing pattern overall, with values of ['1464' (Week 14, 2021), '1435' (Week 15, 2021), '1358' (Week 16, 2021), '1759' (Week 17, 2021), and '1626' (Week 18, 2021)]. While there were noticeable dips in Weeks 15 and 16, the data spiked significantly in Week 17 to 1759, followed by a slight decrease to 1626 in Week 18. This overall variability, with a notable high point in Week 17, hints at increased ILI activity despite occasional declines.

2. The strong rise to 1759 in Week 17 and sustained activity at 1626 in Week 18 likely have a positive influence on the future increase to 1748 after 5 weeks (Week 23, 2021). This upward trend in the latter weeks of the provided past occurrences aligns with the elevated future ILI activity, suggesting that the peak and sustained levels during Weeks 17–18 served as a precursor to the reported future levels.

3. Several factors from the summarized reports signal a connection to the future ILI occurrences:  
   - Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at a relatively low 1.1% to 1.2% during Weeks 14–18, 2021, but the minimal variation in activity hints at a steady baseline of respiratory illness that may have carried forward.  
   - Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold across Weeks 14–18, reaching values such as 11.7% (Week 17) and 10.9% (Week 18), illustrating an ongoing burden of respiratory illnesses likely impacting general ILI trends.  
   - Ongoing disruptions to ILI data collection and interpretation due to COVID-19, including changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and overlapping illness reporting, suggest a delayed convergence of respiratory cases in future weeks.

4. In summary, the reported 1748 future ILI occurrences (Week 23, 2021) can be explained by the increasing trend observed in Weeks 17–18, 2021, coupled with persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, the steady but minimal outpatient ILI levels serving as a baseline, and pandemic-driven challenges in ILI surveillance. These combined factors contributed to the observed moderate increase after 5 weeks despite the overall low influenza activity during the period.
