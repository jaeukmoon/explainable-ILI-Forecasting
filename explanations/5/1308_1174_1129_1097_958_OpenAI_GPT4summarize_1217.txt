1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a clear downward trend, with values declining from 1308 (Week10, 2023) to 958 (Week14, 2023). Weekly rates decreased progressively, indicating a significant reduction in ILI activity over this period, with the steepest drop occurring between Week13 (1097) and Week14 (958). This declining trend reflects a reduction in respiratory illness activity leading into the future projection.
2. A strong negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The consistent decline in ILI cases during the past five weeks reflects a decreasing trend in respiratory illnesses. However, the reported future occurrence of 740 (Week19, 2023) extends this downward trajectory, aligning with the reduced respiratory activity trends observed in the preceding periods.
3. Stability in key virologic factors, including a low percentage of influenza positivity (ranging between 0.8%-1.0% in Weeks10-14, 2023), contributes to the sustained decline. Moreover, the cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza showed minimal weekly increases (60.4 per 100,000 in Week10, 61.4 per 100,000 in Week14, 2023), reflecting controlled severe case rates. Additionally, outpatient visits for ILI steadily decreased from 2.4% (Week10, 2023) to 2.1% (Week14, 2023), indicating reduced health-seeking behavior for respiratory illnesses.
4. Elevated deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) persisted slightly above epidemic thresholds, ranging from 8.6% (Week10, 2023) to 7.6% (Week14, 2023). Despite this, the gradual decrease post-Week12, 2023, aligns with the declining ILI occurrences. Such mortality trends suggest that overall respiratory illness severity lessened over time, correlating with the reduced ILI predictions.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, alongside influenza, influenced ILI totals during Weeks10-14, 2023. However, stable antiviral susceptibility (98%-100%), low mutation rates, and vaccines antigenically matched to circulating strains mitigated potential outbreaks and contributed to the future projected decline to 740 ILI cases by Week19, 2023.
6. In summary, the reported 740 future ILI occurrences (Week19, 2023) correlate strongly with the downtrending trajectory from Weeks10-14, 2023, influenced further by stability in ILI outpatient visits, reduced hospitalization rates, consistent PIC mortality above baseline but declining over time, and controlled co-circulation of respiratory pathogens.
