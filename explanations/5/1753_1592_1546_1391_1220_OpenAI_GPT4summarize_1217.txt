1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 22–26, 2023) showed a consistent decline, with values of ['1753', '1592', '1546', '1391', '1220']. This steady downward trend reflects a progressive reduction in ILI cases, with a decrease of 533 cases (30.4%) between Weeks 22 and 26. This decline aligns with the CDC reports indicating lower influenza activity and minimal ILI occurrences nationwide.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 1089 (Week 31, 2023) is a continuation of the declining trajectory observed in ILI occurrences during the past weeks. The consistent week-to-week reduction in the past data suggests that the trend of decreasing ILI cases persisted through the subsequent period, leading to 1089 occurrences 5 weeks later.
3. Hospitalizations for influenza demonstrated a decreasing pattern across the weeks, from 953 (Week 22, 2023) to 807 (Week 26, 2023), reflecting diminished influenza severity and reduced healthcare interactions, contributing to lower ILI occurrences. Similarly, outpatient visits for ILI declined from 1.9% (Week 22, 2023) to 1.4% (Weeks 25 and 26, 2023), signaling reduced community transmission of influenza-like illnesses. Additionally, virologic data revealed low influenza positivity rates decreasing from 1.1% (Week 22, 2023) to 1.2% (Week 26, 2023), with predominance of Influenza B (Victoria lineage), further indicating reduced activity. The co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, documented in the reports, may have slightly sustained ILI cases but not sufficiently to reverse the overall decline.
4. Other notable factors such as the stable PIC percentages near or slightly exceeding epidemic thresholds (6.2%–6.1% across Weeks 22–26, 2023) reflect consistent respiratory illness dynamics without significant increases. The absence of novel influenza virus detections or significant surges in pediatric mortality during this period also corroborates the decline in respiratory illness severity, linked to the observed future ILI decrease.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 1089 (Week 31, 2023) resulted from the consistent reduction in past ILI occurrences over Weeks 22–26, 2023. This trend was supported by reduced outpatient visits, declining influenza-related hospitalizations, minimal influenza positivity rates, and the lack of notable surges in other respiratory drivers. Together, these elements substantiate the prolonged decline in ILI activity leading to the reported future data.
