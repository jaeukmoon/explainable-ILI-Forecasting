1. The reported ILI counts from Week11 to Week15, 2022, are 1038, 973, 1002, 972, and 918. The trend shows a gradual decrease over the five weeks, with ILI counts dropping from 1038 in Week11 to 918 in Week15. The decline is relatively steady, with no sharp spikes or significant fluctuations, indicating a consistent downward trend in occurrences.
2. Week20, 2022, falls outside the typical peak influenza season (from Week46 of the previous year to about Week6 of the next year). Given that ILI counts and positivity rates are decreasing throughout the observed weeks (Week11 to Week15, 2022), coupled with the lower levels of influenza activity, Week20, 2022, aligns with the off-season period, which typically features minimal influenza activity and reduced community spread.
3. The observed trajectory in the past five weeks demonstrates a consistent decline in ILI occurrences. Based on historical time-series patterns, this downward trend is expected to continue into the off-season by Week20, 2022. Time-series forecasting models would project further reductions or a stabilization at a low level, leading to the estimated ILI occurrence of 762 for Week20, 2022.
4. The national positivity rates for influenza tested by clinical labs decreased slightly from Week11 (7.7%) to Week15 (8.9%), with Influenza A(H3N2) remaining the dominant strain (Week11, 2022 #1, #2; Week15, 2022 #2). This gradual and steady trend suggests no abrupt changes in ILI occurrences.
5. Vaccination efforts continue to be recommended for all eligible individuals, with no significant changes in vaccination uptake reported, and the current vaccine shows some antigenic differences for H3N2 but functionality for B/Victoria strains (Week11, 2022 #9; Week13, 2022 #9; Week15, 2022 #10). The vaccination drive helps maintain low ILI levels going into the off-season.
6. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and others, contributes to illness rates but not to significant influenza spikes, as co-infection positivity rates remain stable (Week11, 2022 #8; Week14, 2022 #9; Week15, 2022 #11). This further supports the continuation of low ILI activity.
7. The gradual decline in ILI occurrences, the timing during the off-season, the stabilizing effects of vaccination campaigns, and the dominance of a single strain (H3N2) with no evidence of significant antiviral resistance collectively justify the projected ILI occurrence of 762 for Week20, 2022.
