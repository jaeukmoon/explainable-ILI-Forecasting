1. The reported ILI counts from Week18 to Week22, 2024 are 13498, 12644, 12615, 12081, and 12014. The trend shows a consistent decline in ILI occurrences over these weeks, indicating a steady reduction in activity. No significant spikes were observed, and the decrease appears linear.
2. In the U.S., the off-season typically spans from Week01 to Week31 annually. Week27, 2024 falls within this timeframe, and the low influenza positivity rates and stable trends in prior weeks reinforce the classification of Week27, 2024 as part of the off-season. Therefore, the forecast aligns with the off-season period, which is characterized by minimal ILI activity.
3. From a time-series perspective, the steady decline in ILI occurrences (from 13498 in Week18, 2024 to 12014 in Week22, 2024) provides a clear trajectory of decreasing activity. Extending this trend forward five weeks suggests a continued reduction, matching the forecast of 9782 occurrences for Week27, 2024. This projection assumes no new external disruptions or significant changes in conditions.
4. Nationwide influenza positivity rates consistently declined from 3.1% in Week18, 2024 to 1.8% in Week22, 2024 (Week18 #1; Week19 #1; Week20 #1; Week21 #1; Week22 #1). The decreasing positivity supports the prediction of reduced ILI cases by Week27, 2024.
5. The influenza vaccine is effective, with vaccine components matching the circulating strains and antiviral susceptibility remaining stable (Week20 #9, #11; Week22 #9, #13). These factors help prevent significant increases in ILI cases during the off-season.
6. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, while persistent, has not shown significant influence in driving ILI increases (Week18 #10; Week20 #10; Week22 #10). Their contribution to overall respiratory illness remains stable and unlikely to disrupt predicted trends.
7. The combination of consistently decreasing ILI trends, off-season timing, robust vaccine effectiveness, and the absence of novel influenza strains or significant external disruptions leads to a logical forecast of 9782 ILI occurrences in Week27, 2024.
