1. The ILI counts from Week4 to Week8, 2024 are 1756, 2311, 2712, 2740, and 3311, showing a consistent increase in all consecutive weeks. This sharp upward trend indicates significant growth in influenza-like illness occurrences, with no stabilization or decline observed, signifying enhanced transmission rates and escalating activity.
2. Forecasting that Week13, 2024 belongs to the off-season is appropriate as it follows the peak season (typically ending by Week6 in the U.S.) and lies within the period of low-to-declining influenza activity. However, the observed elevated flu activity and increased ILI occurrences transitioning into Week8, 2024 suggest lingering effects of post-peak residual infections, often influencing early off-season trends.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent increase in ILI occurrences from Week4 to Week8, 2024 provides a foundation for expecting a decline following peak activity. However, given the trend's steep rise over these weeks, a forecasted moderate reduction toward stabilization by Week13, 2024 aligns well with predictive modeling, as seasonality and post-peak onset dampen further spikes. This culminates in projecting 1747 cases, reflecting an anticipated easing yet remaining above baseline off-season levels.
4. Influenza B activity has steadily risen, accounting for up to 41.0% of cases by Week8, 2024, with strains like Victoria lineage contributing significantly. This suggests a slower tapering of flu activity, likely prolonging elevated ILI counts beyond the typical peak season end.
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, continues to drive respiratory illness visits. The persistent burden from these viruses complicates ILI trends and slightly elevates expected occurrences in the off-season period.
6. Outpatient respiratory visits have consistently remained above the national baseline for 13+ weeks, with rates of 4.3–4.5% from Week4 to Week8, 2024. This sustained clinical burden indicates an unusual delay in reaching typical off-season lows.
7. The projection of 1747 ILI occurrences for Week13, 2024 is substantiated by the current sharp rise in ILI activity, ongoing contribution of Influenza B, overlapping respiratory infections, and sustained healthcare visits above baseline despite the transition into the off-season. The trajectory indicates moderated reductions, but not a complete drop, aligning with regional and seasonal dynamics.
