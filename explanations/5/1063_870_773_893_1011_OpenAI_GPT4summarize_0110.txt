1. The ILI occurrences from Week6, 2022 to Week10, 2022 followed a fluctuating trend, with values of 1063, 870, 773, 893, and 1011 respectively. While there was an initial drop from Week6 to Week8, Week9 and Week10 showed steady increases, indicating a potential resurgence in influenza activity nationwide. This upward trend in the last two weeks serves as an early indicator of rising activity leading into the forecasted period.
2. Forecasting the target week of Week15, 2022 classifies it as part of the peak onset season. Although this week is several weeks after the typical peak season (which generally ends around Week6 annually), the recent upward trajectory in ILI activity and CDC projections of increasing infections suggest that it aligns with a phase transitioning from low to moderate activity levels indicative of peak onset.
3. From the time-series perspective, the upward trend observed in Week9 (893) and Week10 (1011), coupled with a steady recovery phase following prior dips, suggests a momentum toward rising ILI occurrences in the subsequent weeks. Projecting forward from Week10 using a time-series forecasting model aligns with a gradual but consistent increase in cases, ultimately resulting in a prediction of 1166 ILI occurrences by Week15, 2022.
4. The increasing presence of Influenza A(H3N2), which constituted 99%-100% of all detected influenza viruses (Week6-Week10, 2022), indicates sustained and possibly rising transmission of a dominant virus less impacted by vaccine antigenicity (Week7, #7; Week9, #5).
5. Hospitalization rates climbed steadily for six weeks (Week6: 4.7/100,000; Week10: 5.9/100,000), with Influenza A accounting for the majority of hospitalizations (Week10, #7). This consistent rise in severe cases reflects heightened influenza activity overall and aligns with increasing ILI trends.
6. Vaccine uptake remained lower compared to previous seasons throughout Week6 to Week10, 2022 (Week6, #8; Week7, #8; Week8, #8), and antigenic mismatches with circulating A(H3N2) strains (Week6, #10; Week9, #5) may further reduce vaccine effectiveness, contributing to elevated ILI activity in the forecast period.
7. Combining the data on rising ILI trends (Week9-Week10), the classification of Week15 within peak onset season, steady hospitalization increases, prevalence of A(H3N2), suboptimal vaccination coverage, and antigenic divergence, the predicted occurrence of 1166 is justified as a result of the continued upward trajectory anticipated in activity.
