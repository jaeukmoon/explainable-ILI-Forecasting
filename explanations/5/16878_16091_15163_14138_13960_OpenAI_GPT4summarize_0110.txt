1. The reported ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks (Week13, 2024 to Week17, 2024) show a steady decline: 16878, 16091, 15163, 14138, and 13960. This indicates a consistent downward trend in ILI activity with no significant deviations, suggesting the tail end of elevated activity during its seasonal decline.
2. Forecasting the target week (Week22, 2024) falls within the off-season. Historically, in the U.S., the off-season spans after Week6 through Week31. The consistent decline in both positivity rates and ILI outpatient visits to below baseline levels (Week14, 2024 #3; Week15, 2024 #3; Week16, 2024 #3; Week17, 2024 #5) aligns with this period.
3. The consistent downward trend in ILI occurrences indicates that national influenza activity is waning. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the decreasing trajectory of the past 5 weeks suggests a moderate continuation of this decline, projecting a lower ILI occurrence value near 12014 for Week22, 2024.
4. Influenza positivity rates have continuously dropped across weeks, from 9.1% in Week13, 2024 to 3.9% in Week17, 2024 (Week13, 2024 #1; Week14, 2024 #1; Week15, 2024 #1; Week16, 2024 #1; Week17, 2024 #1). This signals diminishing transmission and reduced ILI occurrences, especially as outpatient visits return to and stay below the national baseline (Week14, 2024 #3; Week15, 2024 #3; Week16, 2024 #3; Week17, 2024 #5).
5. Vaccination coverage remains emphasized and has been effective. Reports confirm that circulating strains are well-matched to vaccines (Week13, 2024 #9; Week14, 2024 #7; Week15, 2024 #9; Week16, 2024 #9), helping mitigate severe outcomes and contributing to the slowing spread of influenza toward Week22.
6. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses (COVID-19, RSV) has been stable with no significant novel variants emerging (Week13, 2024 #11; Week14, 2024 #8; Week15, 2024 #8; Week16, 2024 #8; Week17, 2024 #7). This stability reduces the likelihood of sharp increases in ILI counts, supporting the anticipated gradual decline.
7. In summary, the projected ILI occurrences at 12014 for Week22, 2024 reflect the consistent decline observed in ILI trends, off-season classification, reduced positivity rates, stable vaccination effects, and the absence of significant external contributors to influenza-like illness. These factors collectively align with a moderate and expected reduction in ILI activity.
