1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating trend. Starting at 1289 in Week 39, 2023, ILI activity increased to 1500 in Week 40, then marginally rose to 1508 in Week 41. Subsequently, occurrences dipped to 1447 in Week 42 and dropped further to 1396 in Week 43, 2023. Despite fluctuations, the values remained elevated compared to the national baseline, indicative of moderate ILI activity.
2. A clear correlation exists between past and future occurrences. Although dropping slightly in Weeks 42-43, 2023, the future occurrence of 2458 in Week 48, 2023, significantly exceeds prior values, reflecting an emerging trend identified in Weeks 41-43. This suggests that even minor fluctuations in recent weeks can precede rapid future increases in ILI activity due to cumulative factors such as regional activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased gradually but consistently, from 2.1% in Week 39, 2023, to 2.7% in Week 43, 2023, remaining below the national baseline (2.9%). Regional increases in respiratory illness activity and higher ILI rates in age groups like children (7.1%) in Week 39 and young adults in Week 42 contributed to the rise.
4. Hospitalizations showed an escalating trajectory, moving from 0.1 per 100,000 in Week 39, 2023, to a cumulative rate of 0.8 per 100,000 in Week 43, 2023, with weekly hospitalizations increasing to 1,607 in Week 43. This uptick flagged increased severity of illness, correlating with subsequent surges in ILI cases.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (influenza, SARS-CoV-2, RSV) in all weeks coupled with a rise in positive influenza tests (1.0% in Week 39 to 1.9% in Week 43, 2023) and moderate-to-high regional ILI activity toward Week 43 highlight the intensifying disease burden. These factors likely fueled the significant jump to 2458 future ILI occurrences in Week 48, 2023.
6. In summary, the sharp rise to 2458 ILI future occurrences by Week 48, 2023, can be attributed to the emerging trajectory in Weeks 39-43, increasing outpatient visits and hospitalizations, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and regionally intensifying activity.
