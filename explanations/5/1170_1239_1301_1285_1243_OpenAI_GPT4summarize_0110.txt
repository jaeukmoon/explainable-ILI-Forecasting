1. The reported ILI occurrences for Week28 to Week32, 2022 are 1170, 1239, 1301, 1285, and 1243. The data shows a slight increase from Week28 (1170) to Week30 (1301), followed by a minor decrease in Week31 (1285) and Week32 (1243). Overall, this trend reflects a mild rise and then stabilization, without notable spikes or sharp drops.
2. Week37, 2022 falls in the peak onset season based on U.S. seasonality patterns, as it is within the transitional period (Weeks32-46) when ILI activity typically begins to climb. Despite slight fluctuations in the preceding weeks, the timing of Week37 aligns with the season when ILI trends usually increase moderately.
3. From the time-series perspective, the observed trend of mild fluctuations—followed by stabilization in recent weeks—suggests gradual growth in ILI occurrences as the season progresses. When projected forward five weeks, this pattern indicates continued gradual increases, given historical seasonality and established trends. Thus, activity around 1946 occurrences is reasonable.
4. CDC reports indicate ongoing low influenza activity but provide several critical future predictors: (1) Novel Influenza A (H3N2)v and A(H1N2)v variants have emerged (Week30, 2022 #7; Week31, 2022 #4; Week32, 2022 #4), posing a risk of increased transmission. (2) Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, continues to influence overall ILI trends (Week28, 2022 #8; Week29, 2022 #10; Week31, 2022 #10). (3) Vaccination trends and behaviors remain unclear, potentially limiting proactive immunity expansion (Week28, 2022 #9; Week30, 2022 #9; Week32, 2022 #11).
5. Outpatient ILI visit percentages have remained below the national baseline (1.6%-1.4%) but exhibit gradual declines over the past weeks (Week28, 2022 #3; Week29, 2022 #3; Week32, 2022 #5). These patterns, coupled with low positivity rates, suggest subdued activity that could gradually increase as seasonal onset progresses.
6. Influenza A dominance (~90%) persists across all surveillance, primarily H3N2, with sporadic Influenza B cases. The emergence of new variants (e.g., A(H3N2)v) warrants close monitoring as it could result in upward shifts in ILI within the peak onset season (Week30, 2022 #2; Week31, 2022 #3; Week32, 2022 #3, #4).
7. Combining the current low but gradually increasing ILI trends, novel variant circulation risks, and co-circulatory pressures, Week37, 2022 is projected to see a modest increase in cases, aligning with peak onset season expectations. Accordingly, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 1946 reflects these dynamics.
