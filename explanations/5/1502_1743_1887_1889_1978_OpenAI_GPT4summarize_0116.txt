1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week35, 2021 to Week39, 2021) display an increasing trend: 1502, 1743, 1887, 1889, and 1978. This clearly shows a steady upward trajectory, with a cumulative weekly increase of 241, 144, 2, and 89, respectively. The average weekly increase is approximately 119. Using this trend, projecting forward 5 weeks to Week44, 2021 involves adding 119 × 5 (595) to the last reported value (1978). This gives an estimated value of 1978 + 595 = 2573. However, adjustments are necessary due to influencing factors detailed below.
2. Week44, 2021 falls within the "Peak onset season," as per Background Knowledge. The peak onset season typically extends from Week35 to Week46, representing the period when influenza activity is increasing but has not yet reached its peak. This classification supports the observed growth in ILI occurrences and suggests continued increases through Week44, albeit moderately, before entering the peak season.
3. Historical trends and seasonality suggest a correlation between the recorded data and future occurrences. Based on past years' data during the peak onset season, ILI increases tend to taper off as the season transitions from baseline activity to the peak. To account for this, we assume a slight reduction in the average weekly growth rate leading to Week44. Adjusting the initial projection of 2573 downward by 10% based on peak onset season trends results in 2573 - 257 = 2316. This revised estimate is closer to the final forecast.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports that influence the future ILI occurrences are:
5. a. **Low baseline influenza circulation**: The reports emphasize that influenza activity remains minimal (e.g., Week36, 2021 mentions 0.1% positivity for flu tests). The low baseline limits the extent of growth in ILI cases, capping the upper limit of projections. Reducing the projected value by 20 cases accounts for this (2316 - 20 = 2296).
6. b. **Concurrent non-influenza respiratory viruses**: Increased respiratory illness visits, as noted in Week36 and Week37 reports, are attributed to non-influenza respiratory viruses. This artificially inflates ILI occurrences, necessitating a minor positive adjustment of approximately 20 cases (2296 + 20 = 2316), which balances this factor.
7. c. **Vaccination recommendations and population immunity**: CDC's routine flu vaccination recommendations during Week38 and Week39 can reduce the effective transmission of influenza. Factoring in potential vaccination effects leads to a downward adjustment of 20 (2316 - 20 = 2296).
5. In summary, the time-series trend reveals a steady increase in ILI occurrences that aligns with the peak onset season. The adjustment for historical trends (10% seasonal tapering) brings the projected value in line with expected peak onset behavior. Influencing factors from CDC reports—including low influenza circulation, other respiratory virus contributions, and vaccination impacts—support further refinements. Together, these factors justify a prediction of 2296 ILI occurrences for Week44, 2021.
