1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week46, 2021 to Week50, 2021) show an overall increasing trend, starting at 1223 in Week46, slightly dipping to 1170 in Week47, then rising sharply to 1408 in Week48, fluctuating to 1325 in Week49, and peaking at 1437 in Week50. This increasing trajectory suggests an intensifying flu season, aligning with CDC-reported rising flu activity, particularly with dominant Influenza A(H3N2) cases. To forecast Week3, 2022, we use this steady growth pattern with seasonal adjustments guided by CDC-reported factors influencing ILI trends.
2. Season classification: Week3, 2022 falls within the "Peak season." According to the background knowledge, the U.S. peak season generally spans from Week46 to Week6, and the ILI activity levels observed in the prior 5 weeks confirm the intensification typical of this phase. Week3 specifically lies near the midpoint of the peak influenza season.
3. Correlation analysis reveals a consistent upward trajectory in ILI occurrences, both in historical data and recent CDC reports. A linear growth model is used to compute the growth rate. From Week46 to Week50, ILI occurrences grow from 1223 to 1437, with weekly differences of -53 (Week47), +238 (Week48), -83 (Week49), and +112 (Week50). The average weekly growth rate is approximately +54 per week. Projecting this weekly growth forward for 5 weeks (to Week3, 2022), we calculate an ILI baseline forecast as follows:
4. **Baseline projection = 1437 (Week50) + (54 × 5 weeks) = 1437 + 270 = 1707.**
5. However, this must be further adjusted for seasonal effects and semantic factors inferred from the CDC reports.
4. Semantically, three key factors from the summarized CDC reports influence the Week3, 2022 forecast:
5. - **Peak season intensification:** Week50 reports 5.6% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with ILI outpatient visits trending upward (3.1% exceeding the national baseline). This indicates accelerating flu activity, justifying a higher forecast beyond the baseline calculated from historical data. This amplifies the projection by 20%, yielding: **1707 × 1.20 = 2048.**
6. - **Dominance of Influenza A(H3N2):** Week50 confirms that over 99% of positive influenza specimens are A(H3N2), a subtype known for higher transmission rates and severity, especially among young and middle-aged adults. This additional burden adds a 10% increase to our forecast: **2048 × 1.10 = 2253.**
7. - **Lower vaccination uptake:** CDC highlights lower vaccination rates compared to previous seasons. With vaccination coverage suboptimal, transmission is less mitigated, further intensifying ILI occurrences. This contributes a 3% increase: **2253 × 1.03 ≈ 2331.**
5. In summary, the ILI occurrences for Week3, 2022 are forecasted to be 2331. This value reflects an increasing trend extrapolated from historical data, adjusted for Peak season intensification, high Influenza A(H3N2) prevalence, and lower vaccine coverage. These factors collectively justify the significant rise from Week50’s value of 1437 to the predicted 2331.
