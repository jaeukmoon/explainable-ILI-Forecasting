1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an inconsistent yet slightly declining trend, with values of ['14072', '15539', '14753', '13311', '13616']. There was an increase from 14072 (Week 34, 2024) to a peak of 15539 (Week 35, 2024), followed by a steady decrease to 13311 (Week 37, 2024) before experiencing a modest rebound to 13616 (Week 38, 2024). This pattern reflects periodic fluctuations with no consistent upward or downward trajectory across the observed weeks.
2. A weak positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, with the highest value of 15539 (Week 35, 2024) serving as a potential precursor to the eventual rise to 15631 after 5 weeks (Week 43, 2024). The rebound from 13311 to 13616 (Week 37–38, 2024) may further indicate the early recovery of ILI activity, which aligns with the growth in future occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below baseline at 1.8% across Weeks 34–38, 2024, with slight increases reported among the 0–24 age groups. This consistent presence of ILI-related healthcare visits, despite being below the national baseline, suggests ongoing background activity contributing to the future occurrences.
4. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including influenza, RSV, and COVID-19, along with sporadic novel strain detections, was highlighted across Weeks 34–38, 2024. This interplay likely augmented respiratory virus activity, influencing a gradual rise in future ILI occurrences.
5. Minimal influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths (0.06% of total mortality) during Weeks 34–38, 2024, reflect stable but persistent flu-related illnesses. Stable antigenic compatibility with vaccines (e.g., 95–99.8%) further indicates consistent mild activity with potential to aggregate into higher ILI counts over time.
6. In summary, the reported 15631 future ILI occurrences (Week 43, 2024) arise from ILI rebounds following Week 37, stable outpatient reports despite low baseline values, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and persistent influenza activity paired with minimal hospitalizations and deaths, collectively driving an eventual increase.
