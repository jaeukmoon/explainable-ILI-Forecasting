1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['17987', '16276', '12979', '11487', '11116']. These progressively declining numbers from Week35, 2021, to Week39, 2021, indicate reduced ILI activity, possibly linked to lower influenza circulation and concurrent respiratory illness mitigation measures.
2. A moderate correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed. Despite the declining trend in past weeks, future occurrences rise to 13895 in Week44, 2021. This suggests a delayed response or interplay of factors, such as non-influenza respiratory viruses or changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors influencing the data.
3. The outpatient ILI visit percentages in the summarized CDC reports continued to fall weekly, from 0.9% in Week35, 2021, to 1.9% in Week39, 2021, below baseline thresholds. While these low percentages align with the declining past trend, they may underestimate actual ILI activity due to shifts in healthcare access and reporting.
4. Persistent high percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC), reaching 20.9% in Week38, 2021, and 18.7% in Week39, 2021, reflect indirect respiratory illness burdens, possibly leading to the rebound in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
5. The overlapping impacts of COVID-19, minimal influenza virus circulation, and other respiratory viruses (as noted in the consistent low positivity rates for influenza testing) contribute to the variability in ILI trends and act as key drivers behind the unexpected rise to 13895 future ILI occurrences.
4. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 13895 in Week44, 2021, is likely due to the compounding effects of non-influenza respiratory viruses, persistent PIC mortality reflecting ongoing respiratory illness burdens, and the unpredictability introduced by shifts in healthcare-seeking behavior and surveillance challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. This divergence from past declining trends highlights the complex interplay of pandemic-driven factors on ILI dynamics.
