1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a general upward trend, with values of ['1077', '1043', '1040', '1101', '1255']. There was a slight decline from 1077 (Week31, 2021) to 1040 (Week33, 2021) after an initial dip, followed by a steady and substantial increase to 1255 in Week35, 2021—the highest observed value during the period, indicating a rise in ILI activity.
2. A positive correlation exists between the upward trend in the past ILI occurrences and the future value of 1124 (Week40, 2021). The peak in Week35, 2021, signifies consistent respiratory illness activity, with slight reductions reflecting stabilization instead of marked decreases, supporting 1124 occurrences after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually increased from 2.0% (Week31, 2021) to 2.2% (Week34, 2021) over consecutive weeks, with significant rises explicitly noted among children aged 0–4 and 5–24 in various weeks. These demographic-specific increases contribute to the sustained higher ILI occurrences observed.
4. Persistent PIC mortality percentages rose steadily, from 11.9% (Week31, 2021) to 19.4% (Week34, 2021), significantly exceeding the epidemic thresholds, driven by respiratory illnesses including COVID-19. This heightened respiratory mortality trend correlates with ongoing ILI activity increases.
5. Factors such as variability in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to COVID-19, non-influenza respiratory viruses contributing to ILI increases, and limitations in accurate surveillance interpretations documented across all weeks are likely to have amplified both reported and future ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI value of 1124 (Week40, 2021) can be plausibly explained by the upward trend in Week35, 2021, increases in outpatient ILI visits across specific demographics, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-induced uncertainties affecting respiratory illness surveillance systems.
