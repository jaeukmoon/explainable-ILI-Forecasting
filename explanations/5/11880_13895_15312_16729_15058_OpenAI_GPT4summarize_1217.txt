1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks revealed an overall increasing trend with values of ['11880', '13895', '15312', '16729', '15058']. There was a steady rise from 11880 in Week43, 2021, to 16729 in Week46, 2021, followed by a slight decline to 15058 in Week47, 2021. This overall upward trajectory points to escalating ILI activity throughout this period, despite the final week's minor downturn.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the substantial increment observed across Weeks 43–46, 2021, coupled with the sustained elevated level in Week47, 2021, precedes the further amplified spike to 43523 in Week52, 2021. The rising trend in past weeks closely mirrors the projected surge after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed consistent increases, moving from 1.9% (Week43, 2021) to 2.4% (Week47, 2021), nearing the national baseline of 2.5%. This steady growth reflects increasing respiratory illness activity, which aligns with the intensified future ILI numbers. Hospitalization trends also rose gradually, from 282 in Week43 to 495 in Week47, boosting the correlation with heightened ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza A(H3N2)’s dominance, comprising over 90% of positive specimens—and particularly affecting the age group 5-24 years—was reported throughout the period. Its disproportionately high prevalence and regional cluster outbreaks (e.g., Michigan) suggest a key role in the abrupt rise in future occurrences. Meanwhile, deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained substantially above the epidemic threshold, ranging from 14.1% in Week44 to 15.5% in Week47. The persistence of high PIC mortality signals sustained pressures from respiratory illness activity.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behavior coupled with overlapping respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) disrupted traditional ILI data reporting across Weeks 43–47, 2021. These disruptions likely led to underreporting, followed by concentrated recognition of cases, thereby contributing to the sharp surge to 43523 future occurrences in Week52, 2021.
6. In summary, the reported 43523 future ILI occurrences (Week52, 2021) can be attributed to the consistent upward trend in ILI occurrences during Weeks 43–46, 2021, increasing outpatient visits and hospitalizations, dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) in younger age groups, persistently elevated PIC mortality, and the compounded effects of pandemic-related healthcare-seeking and reporting challenges.
