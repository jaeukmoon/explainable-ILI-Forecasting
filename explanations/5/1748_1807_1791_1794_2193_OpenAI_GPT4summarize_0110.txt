1. The reported ILI counts from Week23 to Week27, 2021 are 1748, 1807, 1791, 1794, and 2193. A stable pattern is observed from Week23 (1748) to Week26 (1794), with a marginal increase. Week27 (2193) reveals a sharp spike, suggesting a potential transition or early activity increase compared to prior weeks.
2. In the U.S., Week32, 2021 falls within the peak onset season, based on typical historical patterns starting around Week32. The slight upward trend in Week27, 2021 (2193 vs. earlier weeks) and concurrent contextual factors like healthcare disruptions and secondary influences advocate that Week32, 2021 is within this seasonal phase.
3. From a time-series analysis, the sharp rise in Week27, 2021 signals activity growth, deviating from prior stability. Projections for Week32, 2021 account for this shift and incorporate compounding trends associated with the peak onset season. Given past fluctuations and spikes, a forecast of 3416 ILI for Week32, 2021 suggests further escalation in initial transmission intensity.
4. Influenza activity nationwide remained low, with positivity rates near 0.1% in clinical and public health labs (Week23–Week27, 2021 #2). This indicates limited circulating influenza but does not exclude seasonality-driven growth starting from Week32, 2021 onward.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes and alternative care settings driven by the COVID-19 pandemic continue to skew surveillance data, obscuring trends (Week23 to Week27, 2021 #8, #7, #6). However, these disruptions align with the sharp Week27 increase, forecasting subsequent rises.
6. Virologic surveillance in Week27, 2021 detected an increase in Influenza B (70.6%) detections compared to Influenza A (29.4%), with the Victoria lineage confirmed for Influenza B (Week27, 2021 #2). This reflects low but emerging activity, correlating with the expected upward trajectory.
7. The projected ILI occurrences for Week32, 2021 are justified by (1) the recent upward trend in ILI counts (Week27 spike) after prior stability, (2) its position in the peak onset season, and (3) virologic evidence of modest influenza circulation increases. Combined with healthcare behavior disruptions and early transmission signals, 3416 occurrences align with these influences.
