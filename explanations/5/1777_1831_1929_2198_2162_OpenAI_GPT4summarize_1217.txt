1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks indicate a fluctuating but generally upward trend. The values progress from 1777 (Week 21, 2021) to 1831 (Week 22, 2021), then rise further to 1929 (Week 23, 2021). A notable peak of 2198 occurs in Week 24, 2021, followed by a slight decline to 2162 in Week 25, 2021. This pattern demonstrates increasing ILI activity with a tapering decline in the final week.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The consistent upward movement from weeks 21–24, 2021, followed by sustained heightened levels by Week 25, 2021, likely set the stage for the future increase to 2989 occurrences. This aligns with the observed trend of rising respiratory illness activity at the end of the 5-week period, reflecting sustained momentum in cases.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained low yet stable at 1.1% (Week 21, 2021) before inching up to 1.2% over Weeks 22–25, 2021. Despite being below the national baseline, this steady increase coincides with growing ILI activity in the time-series data, signaling a precursor to future rises. Elevated PIC mortality percentages, ranging from 8.3% (Week 21, 2021) to 6.6% (Week 25, 2021), consistently surpassed epidemic thresholds, driven primarily by COVID-19 but suggesting ongoing respiratory illness burdens contributing to ILI trends. Behavioral shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic, reported across all weeks, notably disrupted surveillance systems and data accuracy, potentially underestimating actual previous ILI levels and resulting in a sharper future surge as delayed recognition catches up.
4. Limitations in influenza positivity rates (ranging below 0.1% from clinical labs and minimal detections by public health labs) underscore that non-influenza respiratory illnesses or pandemic-related behaviors likely played a significant role in driving the future spike in occurrences. Furthermore, diminished vaccination-related data throughout this period leaves other contributing factors unmitigated, exacerbating ILI activity.
5. The reported 2989 future ILI occurrences (Week 30, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trend in past ILI data from Weeks 21–24, compounding effects of increasing ILI-related visits, persistent exceedance of epidemic PIC mortality thresholds, disruptions due to the pandemic, and the growing impact of non-influenza illnesses driving delayed and amplified reporting in future data.
