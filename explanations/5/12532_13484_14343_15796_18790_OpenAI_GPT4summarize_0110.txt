1. The reported ILI counts from Week15, 2022 to Week19, 2022 show a consistent increase: 12532, 13484, 14343, 15796, and 18790. This data presents a clear upward trajectory in ILI occurrences, with a particularly significant increase between Week18 (15796) and Week19 (18790). This suggests an intensifying trend of influenza-like activity during the observed weeks.
2. The target week, Week24, 2022, falls within the off-season for influenza in the U.S., as it is after the peak seasons (which generally end around Week6) and before peak onset seasons (starting from approximately Week32 or Week35). Increasing ILI occurrences during the off-season could be attributed to unusual seasonal deviations or overlapping drivers of respiratory illness, such as regional positivity spikes or reduced vaccine impact against Influenza A(H3N2).
3. From a time-series perspective, the continued rise in ILI cases over the past five weeks suggests further growth in the near term. The jump between Week18 and Week19 signals a potential acceleration, which, when projected forward, supports an estimate of moderate-to-high ILI occurrences around 17486 cases in Week24, 2022.
4. The rise in influenza activity tied predominantly to Influenza A(H3N2) and its consistent dominance (Week15, 2022 #1, #3; Week16, 2022 #2; Week19, 2022 #2) is a primary driver of the increase in respiratory illness visits and hospitalizations. Late-season antigenic differences in H3N2 strains from vaccine composition (Week15, 2022 #10; Week18, 2022 #8; Week19, 2022 #9) may contribute to vaccine mismatch and reduced protection.
5. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness increased weekly from Week15 (2.1%) to Week19 (2.4%) (Week15, 2022 #4; Week16, 2022 #6; Week19, 2022 #6), reflecting heightened transmission in younger populations and regions where activity exceeded local baselines (Week15, 2022 #12; Week18, 2022 #2; Week19, 2022 #7).
6. Cumulative hospitalization rates have risen continuously across the five reported weeks (from 9.8 per 100,000 in Week15 to 14.4 per 100,000 in Week19; Week15, 2022 #6; Week19, 2022 #3). Simultaneously, deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded epidemic thresholds each week (Week15, 2022 #9; Week16, 2022 #5; Week19, 2022 #4), with Influenza A dominating hospitalizations.
7. The forecast of 17486 ILI occurrences in Week24, 2022 is supported by a steadily growing trend in ILI counts, the dominance and antigenic drift of Influenza A(H3N2), suboptimal vaccine effectiveness, increased outpatient visits, and hospitalization rates. Together, these factors highlight intensifying late-season influenza activity during the off-season.
