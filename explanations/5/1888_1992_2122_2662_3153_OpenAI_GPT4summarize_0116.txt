1. **Trend Analysis**: From Week31, 2023 to Week35, 2023, the ILI occurrences in Region 5 increased steadily: ['1888', '1992', '2122', '2662', '3153']. The week-over-week changes are +104, +130, +540, and +491, indicating a consistent upward trajectory with an accelerating trend starting in Week33, 2023. To predict Week40, 2023, this trend suggests an expected continuation of increased ILI activity driven by compounding factors.
2. **Season Classification**: Week40, 2023 belongs to the Peak Onset Season based on CDC's seasonal definitions. The Peak Onset Season in the U.S. typically spans Week35 to Week46. ILI occurrences begin a marked increase during this period as the flu season intensifies, aligning with both historical seasonal patterns and the observed trends from recent weeks.
3. **Statistical Forecasting**: Using the weekly growth rates measured as percentages:
4. - Growth from Week31 to Week32: (1992 - 1888) / 1888 ≈ 5.5%
5. - Growth from Week32 to Week33: (2122 - 1992) / 1992 ≈ 6.5%
6. - Growth from Week33 to Week34: (2662 - 2122) / 2122 ≈ 25.5%
7. - Growth from Week34 to Week35: (3153 - 2662) / 2662 ≈ 18.4%
8. The average weekly growth rate is approximately 14.0%, with higher growth rates seen in recent weeks. At a compound weekly growth rate of 14.0%, projecting forward for 5 weeks (from Week35 to Week40):
9. - Week36: 3153 × 1.14 ≈ 3595
10. - Week37: 3595 × 1.14 ≈ 4098
11. - Week38: 4098 × 1.14 ≈ 4669
12. - Week39: 4669 × 1.14 ≈ 5323
13. - Week40: 5323 × 1.14 ≈ 6072
14. To adjust for seasonal damping (expected in the earlier stage of the Peak Onset), a reduction factor of 15% is applied, resulting in a prediction of approximately 5127 for Week40, 2023.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Historical patterns during Peak Onset Season reveal that ILI occurrences often escalate more sharply during this period due to increased transmission, school re-openings, and seasonal factors like cooler weather. Such patterns are consistent with the trend in Region 5, where weekly growth has been accelerating since Week33, 2023. This aligns with historical models that project enhanced ILI activity during these weeks.
5. **Influential CDC Factors in Forecasting**:
6. 1) **Seasonality and Flu Escalation**: The CDC reports note an increasing prevalence of respiratory virus circulation (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses), influencing healthcare-seeking patterns.
7. 2) **Pediatric Vulnerabilities**: Outpatient ILI visits among children ages 0-4 remain disproportionately high (e.g., 7.2% in Week35, 2023), indicating an early uptick in overall ILI activity this year driven by a more susceptible demographic.
8. 3) **No Novel Strains but Surging Co-Circulation**: While no novel influenza strains have emerged, increasing respiratory virus overlap and altered care dynamics amplify influenza-like illness activity across regions (reported Weeks34-35, 2023).
9. **Summary**: The forecast for Week40, 2023 is 5127 ILI occurrences, derived from increasing past trends, the Peak Onset Season's intensification, and heightened pediatric vulnerabilities and viral co-circulation reflected in the CDC reports. Statistical growth rates align with seasonality and recent data trends.
