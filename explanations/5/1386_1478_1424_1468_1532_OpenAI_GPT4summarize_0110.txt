1. The reported ILI counts from Week27 to Week31, 2023, are 1386, 1478, 1424, 1468, and 1532. The trend shows a consistent rise from Week27 (1386) to Week28 (1478), followed by a slight decrease in Week29 (1424), and then another gradual increase through Week30 (1468) and Week31 (1532). Overall, this trajectory represents a slow upward trend in ILI occurrences, but without significant spikes or dips.
2. Based on the U.S. seasonal definitions, the target week (Week36, 2023) falls within the peak onset season (typically starting around Week32-W35 to Week46). Observing the gradual increases in ILI activity coupled with CDC's emphasis on seasonality factors, Week36, 2023, aligns with the early build-up to higher flu activity characteristic of the peak onset season.
3. The slight upward trend in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks suggests an ongoing seasonal increase in activity. Historical data indicates that such trends project forward a continued increase, particularly as the system transitions from off-season to peak onset season. Considering this, the time-series forecasting model expects further growth, aligning with the projected value of 3514 ILI occurrences in Week36, 2023.
4. Influenza virus activity remains low nationally, with only 1.0% of specimens testing positive in Weeks29-31, 2023, but consistent detection of Influenza A (primarily H1N1) and B (Victoria lineage) suggests baseline community transmission with potential to grow during the peak onset season (Week27, 2023 #1; Week29, 2023 #1; Week31, 2023 #1).
5. Multiple respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, continue to co-circulate and show regional variability in trends, contributing to fluctuating respiratory illness markers (Week29, 2023 #8; Week30, 2023 #8; Week31, 2023 #8). These co-circulations intensify the ILI counts during transitions toward seasonal peaks.
6. Vaccination guidance remains largely uniform, with no significant updates in uptake. This stable vaccination activity, coupled with dominant circulating strains such as Influenza A H1N1, leaves potential gaps in population immunity as the season shifts (Week27, 2023 #9; Week28, 2023 #10; Week31, 2023 #9).
7. With a combination of factors including the gradual upward trend in ILI counts, classification as peak onset season (Week36, 2023), co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, and stable but unremarkable vaccination efforts, the forecast of 3514 ILI occurrences in Week36, 2023, strongly reflects both historical trends and CDC projections for increasing influenza activity during this transitional phase.
