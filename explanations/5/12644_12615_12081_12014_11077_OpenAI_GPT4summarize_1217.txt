1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['12644', '12615', '12081', '12014', '11077']. There was a gradual decline from 12644 (Week19, 2024) to 11077 (Week23, 2024), reflecting a steady reduction in ILI activity across this period. This trend suggests the flu season was winding down by Week23, 2024.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 10762 (Week28, 2024) show a slight increase compared to 11077 (Week23, 2024). This minor uptick suggests a correlation between decreasing prior occurrences and the subsequent plateau seen in future values. The stabilization in ILI occurrences may reflect the transition between seasonal flu peaks and other contributing factors, such as co-circulating respiratory viruses.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below baseline levels, from 2.0% (Week19, 2024) to 1.7% (Week23, 2024). This persistent low activity level suggests overall minimal influenza impact but highlights non-flu ILI influencers contributing to the future plateau in Week28, 2024.
4. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, particularly RSV and SARS-CoV-2, notably continued to influence respiratory illness trends throughout Weeks19–23, 2024. Multifactorial data indicate these pathogens likely contributed to the observed future ILI stability.
5. Stable influenza positivity rates (2.4% in Week19, 2024, to 1.6% in Week23, 2024) and low hospitalization rates (declining to 0.1 per 100,000 by Week23, 2024) suggest no significant influenza-driven uptick was anticipated. However, stable mortality trends and overall respiratory virus dynamics reflect factors likely sustaining future ILI occurrences at similar levels.
6. In summary, the reported 10762 future ILI occurrences (Week28, 2024) are attributable to the consistent decline observed in ILI data over the previous five weeks, low but persistent outpatient visits for respiratory illness, stable influenza positivity and hospitalization rates, and the continued influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors collectively explain the stability in ILI occurrence levels projected after 5 weeks.
