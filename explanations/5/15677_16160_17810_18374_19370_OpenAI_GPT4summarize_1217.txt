1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['15677', '16160', '17810', '18374', '19370']. There was a steady increase week by week, starting from 15677 in Week38, 2023, to 19370 in Week42, 2023. This sustained rise over the 5-week period indicates accelerating ILI activity leading into future weeks.
2. A direct positive correlation is observed between the steadily rising ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks and the significant increase in future occurrences, with Week42, 2023, showing the highest value of 19370 serving as a precursor to the 26404 future ILI occurrences in Week47, 2023. The progressive escalation in Weeks41-42 aligns with the amplified future value.
3. Rising outpatient visits for ILI mirror the upward trajectory in the past occurrences, increasing consistently from 2.0% (Week38, 2023) to 2.5% (Week42, 2023). This increase reflects a steady demand for healthcare services related to ILI, signifying a broader escalation in illness burden likely contributing to the future surge.
4. Persistent co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, is reported in Weeks38–42, 2023, complicating attribution but amplifying overall ILI activity. These additional contributing factors are likely exacerbating the observed respiratory illness trends culminating in Week47, 2023.
5. Elevated and rising influenza hospitalization rates highlight a growing severity in influenza-related illnesses, increasing weekly from 880 (Week38, 2023) to 1228 (Week42, 2023). This sustained increase in respiratory-related hospital admissions emphasizes a progressing trend in illness severity connected to future ILI surges.
6. Regional influenza activity variability, with moderate to high activity observed in certain jurisdictions (Weeks39–42, 2023), while overall national activity remains low, indicates potential regional hot spots driving up future ILI occurrences. The heterogeneity of activity, reported across regions and jurisdictions, signals uneven impact potentially contributing disproportionately to the increase to 26404 in Week47, 2023.
7. In summary, the reported 26404 future ILI occurrences (Week47, 2023) can be attributed to the steady upward trend in Weeks38–42, increasing ILI outpatient visits, co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, rising influenza hospitalizations, and regional variability in influenza activity. These complementary factors collectively explain the significant rise in future ILI occurrences.
