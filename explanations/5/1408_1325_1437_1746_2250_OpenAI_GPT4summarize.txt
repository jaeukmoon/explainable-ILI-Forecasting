1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent upward trend, starting from 1408 (Week 48, 2021) and steadily increasing through subsequent weeks to reach 2250 (Week 52, 2021). This marked escalation, especially the sharp rise from Week 50 to Week 52 (1437 to 2250), signals a notable intensification in ILI activity during this period.

2. A strong positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The continuous rise in ILI trends over the observed weeks, particularly the sharp increase toward the end of the series, serves as a precursor to the subsequent decline to 1057 after 5 weeks (Week 5, 2022). The exaggerated peak may have exhausted some susceptible populations or burdened healthcare systems, resulting in a relative reduction in ILI cases by Week 5, 2022.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI mirrored the upward trajectory of past occurrences, increasing from 2.5% (Week 48, 2021) to 4.8% (Week 52, 2021), consistently exceeding the national baseline. This progressive rise in ILI-related clinical visits reflects the growing respiratory illness burden, correlating closely with higher occurrences during the observed weeks and subsequent stabilization at 1057.

4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds across all weeks, increasing from 17.5% (Week 48, 2021) to 19.9% (Week 52, 2021). This elevated PIC mortality consistently indicates heightened respiratory illness activity, aligning both with the past escalation in occurrences and the eventual drop to 1057, potentially due to mitigating factors or saturation of susceptible populations.

5. Decreasing flu vaccination uptake compared to previous seasons, paired with evidence of antigenic differences in circulating Influenza A(H3N2) strains (Week 51–52, 2021), likely compounded the rise in ILI cases during Weeks 48–52. However, vaccination efforts and antiviral treatments promoted by the CDC may have factored into the subsequent stabilization of ILI cases at 1057 by Week 5, 2022.

6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) alongside influenza, particularly in densely populated regions reporting high activity in central and eastern U.S. (Week 52, 2021), further drove the escalation of ILI activity in Weeks 48–52. The observed future decline may reflect a natural ebb following the seasonal peak or reductions in exposure due to behavioral changes during holidays and winter.

7. In summary, the future occurrence of 1057 (Week 5, 2022) arose from the sharp upward trend in Weeks 48–52, 2021, driven by rising outpatient ILI visits, high PIC mortality surpassing thresholds, decreased flu vaccination rates with antigenic drift, and co-circulation of respiratory pathogens. The gradual decline by Week 5, 2022, suggests reduced activity post-peak, likely due to saturation of the exposed population and heightened public health interventions.
