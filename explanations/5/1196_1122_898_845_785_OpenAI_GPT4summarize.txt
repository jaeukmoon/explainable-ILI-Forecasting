1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks revealed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1196', '1122', '898', '845', '785'], spanning from Week 26 to Week 30, 2022. The data showed a decrease week by week, starting at 1196 in Week 26 and declining steadily to 785 by Week 30. This pattern reflects a decrease in ILI activity during this period.

2. The decline observed in the past ILI occurrences (Weeks 26–30, 2022) displays an inverse correlation with the future ILI count of 566 (expected by Week 35, 2022). The observed downward trend in the past weeks suggests a period of low ILI activity, leading to a sustained reduction of cases which likely moderated toward stabilization at 566 after 5 weeks.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI, documented at a steady rate of 1.6%-1.7% nationwide across Weeks 26–30, 2022, reflect relatively low but stable levels of health-seeking behavior related to respiratory illnesses. This stability likely contributed to the observed downward trend in ILI occurrences and aligns with the future figure of 566.

4. Mortality percentages due to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) were high (ranging from 8.8% to 10.0%) during Weeks 26–30, 2022, driven largely by COVID-19 rather than influenza. This consistency in PIC-related deaths, with influenza contributing minimally, supports the low influenza activity and reduced ILI occurrence seen in future data.

5. The low laboratory positivity rates for influenza across Weeks 26–30, 2022 (e.g., 1.4% in Week 26 decreasing to 0.5% in Week 30), indicate a sustained period of subdued influenza transmission. The dominance of non-influenza respiratory illnesses likely tempered ILI rates further, leading to a continuation of low activity as reflected by the future ILI number of 566.

6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 566 (Week 35, 2022) can be attributed to the consistent downward trend in past occurrences from Week 26–30, low and stable outpatient ILI visit rates, persistently high PIC mortality primarily driven by non-influenza factors, and low influenza positivity rates. These combined factors suggest a protracted phase of reduced ILI activity aligning with the reported future value.
