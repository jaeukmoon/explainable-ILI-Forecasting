1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent upward trend, beginning at 1799 (Week27, 2024) and steadily increasing through subsequent weeks to 2432 (Week31, 2024). This growth trajectory indicates a gradual rise in ILI activity by the end of the observed 5-week period, suggesting an increasing burden of respiratory illnesses.
2. The rising trajectory of past ILI occurrences correlates with the reported future value of 3241. The consistent upward pattern through Weeks28–31, 2024, culminating at higher values by Week31, serves as a precursor to the significant increase observed after 5 weeks, reflecting a continuation of growing illness trends.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased slightly during the observed period, from 1.4% in Week27, 2024, to 1.5% in Week31, 2024, consistently remaining below baseline thresholds but indicating minor growth in healthcare engagement attributed to respiratory illnesses, possibly influencing future occurrences. Vaccination and antiviral treatments saw high efficacy but low resistance, yet no specific updates on vaccination uptake suggest that vaccine coverage may have lagged, contributing to continued susceptibility. The co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and influenza during Weeks27–31, 2024, raised the compounded burden of respiratory illnesses and likely fueled ongoing increases in ILI numbers. Additionally, minor increases in positive influenza tests (from 0.9% in Week27 to 0.6% in Week31) and low hospitalization/mortality rates suggested sustained low activity but underscored potential underreporting or delayed patterns aligning with future surges.
4. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 3241 (Week36, 2024) stems from the steady upward trend in ILI cases (Weeks27–31, 2024), a slight rise in outpatient visits, ongoing respiratory virus co-circulation, and consistent low but growing influenza positivity, collectively driving the observed increase.
