1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week6 to Week10, 2023 are 1367, 1349, 1310, 1326, and 1362. This reflects mild fluctuations with a slight decline through Week8 (1310), followed by a minimal increase in Week9 (1326) and Week10 (1362). Overall, the pattern suggests stable and low ILI activity without any significant uptick or consistent decrease.
2. Week20, 2023 falls into the off-season classification as it occurs well after the typical peak season (Week46 to Week6) and during a period of low seasonal influenza activity, further supported by low influenza positivity percentages (Week6, 2023 #1; Week7, 2023 #1; Week8, 2023 #1; Week9, 2023 #1; Week10, 2023 #1).
3. The time-series perspective indicates that the mild fluctuations observed between Week6 and Week10 are not indicative of any major spike or sudden drop in ILI activity. Given this, the reported value of 1232 for Week20, 2023 aligns with a slight decline in trends over five weeks into a stable off-season baseline, as per the time-series forecasting model.
4. The national influenza positivity remains low at 1.4% to 1% in both clinical and public health labs (Week6, 2023 #1; Week7, 2023 #1; Week8, 2023 #1; Week9, 2023 #1; Week10, 2023 #1), reflecting minimal viral activity.
5. The seasonal influenza strains align well with current vaccine coverage, with over 99.9% susceptibility to antiviral medications (Week6, 2023 #9; Week7, 2023 #7; Week8, 2023 #9; Week9, 2023 #9; Week10, 2023 #9), reducing the likelihood of unexpected increases in ILI activity.
6. Co-circulating respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV remain stable without dominating the ILI trends (Week6, 2023 #13; Week7, 2023 #9; Week8, 2023 #11; Week9, 2023 #11; Week10, 2023 #12), ensuring no significant anomalous spikes in ILI occurrences.
7. The projected ILI occurrence of 1232 for Week20, 2023 is justified by current time-series trends, off-season timing, continued low influenza transmission, stable patterns of co-circulating viruses, and the effectiveness of vaccines and antiviral medications. This combination supports a prediction of stable and low ILI counts.
