1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week22 to Week26, 2024 are 1367, 1119, 924, 879, and 835. The trend consistently decreased over these weeks, showing a sharp decline between Week22 (1367) and Week23 (1119) and gradually tapering off through Week26 (835). This persistent decline reflects a stabilization toward a lower ILI baseline.
2. In the U.S., Week31, 2024 belongs to the off-season based on historical patterns and the timing within the annual ILI cycle. As peak onset season begins around Week32 or Week35 and continues until the peak season in Week46, the low influenza activity observed during Week26, 2024 (#1–#5) strongly supports the classification of Week31, 2024 as part of the off-season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent decrease in ILI counts suggests stabilization toward a seasonal baseline. The downward momentum aligns with typical off-season dynamics. Projecting forward to Week31, 2024, the forecasting model anticipates a continuation of this stabilization, estimating ILI occurrences at 795.
4. Nationwide influenza activity has remained low, with positivity rates declining from 1.8% in Week22, 2024, to 1.0% in Week26, 2024 (#1–#1). This steady reduction supports the prediction of reduced activity during Week31, 2024.
5. Circulating influenza strains, including A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Victoria, exhibit high genetic similarity to vaccine components, with low resistance to antiviral agents, indicating favorable vaccine effectiveness and manageable influenza risk (Week22, 2024 #13; Week25, 2024 #8; Week26, 2024 #9).
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and RSV continues to contribute to outpatient respiratory illness trends but has not led to significant spikes in ILI activity, consistent with historical off-season co-circulation patterns (Week22, 2024 #10; Week24, 2024 #9; Week26, 2024 #10).
7. Given the consistent downward trend in ILI occurrences, the classification of Week31, 2024 as off-season, stable conditions from virologic surveillance and vaccination coverage, and the absence of new influenza variants or significant co-circulation surges, the projected ILI occurrences for Week31, 2024 are 795.
