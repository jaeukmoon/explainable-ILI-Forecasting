1. The reported ILI counts from Week13 to Week17, 2022 are 1117, 1021, 1166, 1474, and 1676. The trend shows a consistent increase from Week14 (1021) to Week17 (1676) after a slight dip in Week14. Overall, this trend indicates a growing trajectory in ILI occurrences, with no evidence of stabilization or decline.
2. Forecasting Week22, 2022 aligns with the off-season classification. Since the peak season typically occurs between Week46 and Week6, and the peak onset season between Week32/35 and Week46, Week22, 2022 is well into the off-season period with expected minimal ILI activity based on historical patterns of influenza activity.
3. Examining past trends and projecting forward based on the consistent increase observed, the time-series data suggests the upward trend may taper slightly in later weeks due to entering the off-season. However, the increase in Week17 (1676) forms the basis for a moderate yet slightly elevated occurrence (1858) by Week22, 2022, indicative of residual elevated ILI cases before fully stabilizing.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) dominance persists, with 99.9% of subtyped viruses identified as A(H3N2) (Week14, 2022 #3; Week15, 2022 #3; Week17, 2022 #2). Continued dominance of A(H3N2), along with antigenic differences from the vaccine strain, has likely contributed to sustained transmission, influencing the projected ILI occurrences.
5. The co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses complicates attribution to influenza alone (Week13, 2022 #13; Week15, 2022 #12; Week17, 2022 #9). However, such co-circulation stabilizes or slightly elevates the baseline respiratory illness visits, contributing to the ILI projection.
6. Outpatient respiratory illness visits steadily rose during the reporting period but remained below the national baseline (Week13, 2022 #4; Week15, 2022 #4; Week17, 2022 #5). This low baseline reflects reduced community spread, limiting the extent to which ILI increases, contributing to the moderate projection of 1858 for Week22.
7. The predicted ILI occurrence of 1858 for Week22, 2022, is justified by the observed rising trend in ILI counts until Week17, the residual impact of A(H3N2) transmission boosted by antigenic differences, and consistent contributions from co-circulating respiratory viruses. Combined with the gradually declining trends observed during the off-season, this aligns with an anticipated moderate elevation of ILI occurrences before stabilizing further.
