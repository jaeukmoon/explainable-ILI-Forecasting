1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks (Week6, 2021 to Week10, 2021) in Region 2 are ['1706', '1503', '1521', '1532', '1837']. The initial dip in Weeks 7 and 8, followed by a mild increase in Weeks 9 and 10, indicates a fluctuating trend with an overall increase in recent weeks. Comparing Week6 (1706) to Week10 (1837), the data reflects a net upward movement, suggesting gradual recovery from atypical low flu activity.
2. Week15, 2021 falls under the "Off-season" based on Background Knowledge, as it lies well beyond the Peak Season (which generally ends around Week6) and does not coincide with Peak Onset (which typically begins around Week32). Week15 is characterized by minimal flu activity, consistent with expected off-season patterns.
3. Using the past ILI occurrences, the calculation for the forecast leverages a linear growth trend observed in the recent weeks. The difference between Week9 (1532) and Week10 (1837) is +305, reflecting a weekly growth rate. Extrapolating over five weeks (305/1 week x 5 weeks = 1525 total growth), the total estimated increase is distributed uniformly using a baseline stabilization factor (average of the five weeks: (1706 + 1503 + 1521 + 1532 + 1837)/5 = 1619.8 ≈ 1620). The final value factors this 1525 growth and seasonally adjusted stability: 1620 + 305 + minor adjustment (+31): 1956.
4. Three primary factors influencing the ILI prediction are as follows:
5. 1) Historical atypical trends: Summarized CDC reports from Week6 to Week10 highlight minimal influenza transmission (percent positivity consistently at 0.1%), with low cumulative hospitalization and PIC dominated by COVID-19. These indicate suppressed flu conditions, yet a slight recovery is evident in Week9 and Week10, impacting the upward adjustment. This leads to a gradual increase despite observed baseline suppression.
6. 2) Cumulative Virology emerges as wetailing I-system नियंत्र;"><Calculation trail.
