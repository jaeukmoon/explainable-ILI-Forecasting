1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating but generally upward trend, with values of ['11730', '11738', '11489', '11880', '13895']. After minor fluctuations from 11730 (Week 40, 2021) to 11880 (Week 43, 2021), there was a notable surge to 13895 in Week 44, 2021. This upward trajectory indicates increasing ILI activity toward the end of the observed period.

2. A positive correlation is evident between the past and future ILI occurrences. The significant rise in ILI activity in Week 44, 2021, strongly aligns with the observed jump to 18608 future occurrences by Week 49, 2021, suggesting a continuation of the upward trend recorded during the latter weeks of the observed timeframe.

3. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) rose progressively from 1.9% (Week 40, 2021) to 2.1% (Week 44, 2021), showing a consistent increase in ILI-related healthcare encounters. This aligns with the growing ILI activity and supports the surge in future cases after 5 weeks.  
   - The growing presence of Influenza A(H3N2), particularly within the 5–24 age group, was linked to localized outbreaks, reflecting an expanding influenza spread fueled by regional hotspots by Week 44, 2021.  
   - Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses and changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to COVID-19 disrupted traditional ILI data collection and likely contributed to future case amplification.  
   - Delayed and regional variability in surveillance compounded the challenges in timely identification of trends, potentially underestimating the steady buildup of ILI cases during Weeks 42–44, 2021.

4. In summary, the reported increase to 18608 future ILI occurrences (Week 49, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks 43–44, 2021, the rise in ILI-related outpatient visits, regional outbreaks of Influenza A(H3N2), co-circulating respiratory viruses, and disruptions in healthcare behaviors and data reporting. These aggregated factors provided a foundation for the sharp escalation in ILI activity 5 weeks later.
