1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed fluctuations within a narrow range, with values of ['1070', '1046', '965', '1107', '1072']. There was an initial decrease from 1070 (Week 24, 2021) to 965 (Week 26, 2021), followed by an increase to 1107 (Week 27, 2021) and a slight decline to 1072 (Week 28, 2021). This indicates overall steady yet slightly dynamic activity during the observed period, without any extreme variations in ILI cases.
2. A correlation between past and future ILI occurrences can be observed in the gradual stabilization of values after Week 26, 2021, which appears to precede the reported increase to 1543 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 33, 2021). The modest rise in the latter weeks (Weeks 27–28, 2021) suggests a potential baseline buildup for the subsequent significant increase in future ILI activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a slight increase from 1.2% (Weeks 24–26, 2021) to 1.3% (Weeks 27–28, 2021), reflecting minor but consistent growth in healthcare interactions associated with respiratory illnesses. This rising trend aligns with the eventual increase in ILI occurrences to 1543 after 5 weeks.
4. Persistent PIC mortality percentages, which were above epidemic thresholds throughout the period, ranged from 7.1% (Week 24, 2021), 6.6% (Week 25, 2021), and stabilized back to 7.1% (Week 28, 2021), mainly driven by COVID-19. This elevated PIC activity indicates notable burdens of respiratory diseases that may contribute to future ILI increases.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional surveillance methodologies, complicating data attribution and potentially contributing to delayed or aggregated future increases such as the jump to 1543 occurrences in Week 33, 2021.
6. Despite minimal influenza positivity rates (e.g., less than 0.1% in Weeks 24–28, 2021) and negligible lab detections, other respiratory pathogens or syndromic conditions not directly linked to flu may have played a role in gradually amplifying ILI occurrences into the future.
7. In summary, the reported rise to 1543 future ILI occurrences (Week 33, 2021) is supported by the stabilization in the past week trends, increasing ILI-related outpatient visits, ongoing elevated PIC mortality exceeding thresholds, and the compounded effects of pandemic-altered healthcare interactions and non-flu respiratory illness contributions.
