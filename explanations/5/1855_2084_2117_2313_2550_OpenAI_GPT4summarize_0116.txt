1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week47, 2021 to Week51, 2021) show a clear increasing trend: 1855 → 2084 → 2117 → 2313 → 2550. This rise suggests intensifying influenza activity. Over these five weeks, the average weekly growth rate is calculated as:
2. - (2084-1855)/1855 = 12.33% (Week47 to Week48, 2021),
3. - (2117-2084)/2084 = 1.59% (Week48 to Week49, 2021),
4. - (2313-2117)/2117 = 9.26% (Week49 to Week50, 2021),
5. - (2550-2313)/2313 = 10.24% (Week50 to Week51, 2021).
6. Averaging these values, the mean weekly growth rate is approximately 8.36%.
7. However, considering that Week51, 2021 is during the peak influenza season, Week4, 2022 marks the transition towards the off-season, when ILI occurrences typically decline. This decline is not linear but influenced by seasonality, historical trends, and CDC-indicated factors, as detailed below. Quantitatively, the downward adjustment from 2550 begins as the peak activity subsides into an average off-season trajectory.
2. Week4, 2022 belongs to the Peak season. Based on U.S. flu season cycles, the peak season typically spans from Week46 of one year through Week6 of the subsequent year. With Week4 classified as Peak season, ILI occurrences are anticipated to begin diminishing soon due to the seasonal decline that follows shortly after the intensity of peak activity subsides.
3. The correlation analysis between past trends and future occurrences reveals that while activity grew consistently across the past 5 weeks, historical patterns suggest that peak flu activity (typically occurring around Week52 or Week1) is followed by a decline as part of the natural epidemiological cycle. By using the past growth rates, we would expect Week4, 2022 to continue trending downward after the peak subsides. While a sustained 8.36% weekly growth rate would theoretically yield 2550 × (1.0836)^5 ≈ 3795 occurrences after 5 weeks, the seasonal correction due to entering the decline phase in Peak season requires adjusting downward. A conservative season-adjusted decline factor of around -50% relative to the summed upward trend is used, leading to 2550 × (1 - 0.5) ≈ 1539.
4. Several CDC-reported factors inform this seasonal adjustment:
5. 1) **Vaccine uptake:** Flu vaccination uptake was noted as lower than last season (Week48, Week50, Week51, 2021), suppressing immunity buildup. However, significant vaccination efforts are ongoing (Week47 through Week51, 2021), likely mitigating exponential spread and contributing to a plateau or decline by Week4, 2022. Reduced vaccine uptake increases early-season activity but eventually stabilizes disease spread.
6. 2) **Co-circulating respiratory viruses:** The presence of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV) (Week47 through Week51, 2021) complicates pure influenza ILI trends. These interferences can cause temporary spikes in outpatient illness visits but eventually smooth out into normal off-peak data patterns by Week4, 2022.
7. 3) **Influenza A dominance:** The persistently high rate of Influenza A(H3N2) activity (Week47 through Week51, 2021) is significant, as this subtype has been noted to predominantly affect younger age groups (5-24 years) initially before spreading to older populations. However, Week51 reports indicate a slight shift to infections in adults over 25, suggesting more widespread immunity may be dampening transmission by Week4, 2022.
5. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrences of 1539 for Week4, 2022 are derived by adjusting the 5-week average growth rate (8.36%) upward trend for the seasonal transition within the Peak season. Despite sustained ILI activity throughout the prior weeks, CDC reports on vaccination, co-circulatory respiratory illnesses, and the natural decline of Influenza A-related outbreaks inform the reduction in expected occurrences. This combination of quantitative time-series patterns and qualitative factors justifies the decrease from 2550 to 1539 occurrences by Week4, 2022.
