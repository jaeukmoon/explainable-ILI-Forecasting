1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent, gradual decline, with values of ['2095', '1972', '1835', '1887', '1769']. The highest was 2095 in Week 15, 2024, which steadily decreased to 1769 in Week 19, 2024, except for a slight rise in Week 18 (1887). This downward trend reflects a declining ILI activity during this period.
2. A strong correlation between past decreasing ILI occurrences and future occurrences can be inferred as the decline in past data (Weeks 15–19, 2024) corresponds to a further drop to 924 occurrences in Week 24, 2024. The consistent downward trajectory signals a continuation of declining trends into the future.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline over the five weeks, dropping from 2.5% (Week 15, 2024) to 2.0% (Week 19, 2024). The persistent stability or decline in ILI-related healthcare visits mirrors the reducing trend in ILI cases. Positive influenza test rates also decreased significantly from 5.9% (Week 15, 2024) to 2.4% (Week 19, 2024), directly reflecting the decreasing future ILI occurrences. The cumulative hospitalization rate, while high at 80.6 per 100,000 by Week 19, 2024, showed slowing increases, indicating reduced severe cases, consistent with a lower future ILI occurrence.
4. Mortality rates remained low and stable across Weeks 15–19, 2024, ranging from 0.4% to 0.1%, offering no exacerbating influence on severe ILI trends. No reported novel influenza strains or increased vaccine mismatch suggests the effectiveness of ongoing flu mitigation measures in maintaining downward ILI trends. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, COVID-19) did not lead to any spikes, further supporting the continued decline in both past and future ILI occurrences.
5. In summary, the reported future occurrence of 924 ILI cases (Week 24, 2024) reflects the steady decline in past ILI occurrences, falling outpatient visits below baseline, reduced positivity rates of influenza, slowing hospitalization growth, and stable mortality levels. This declining trend, reinforced by the absence of novel respiratory stressors or vaccine mismatches, explains the continued drop toward future ILI levels.
