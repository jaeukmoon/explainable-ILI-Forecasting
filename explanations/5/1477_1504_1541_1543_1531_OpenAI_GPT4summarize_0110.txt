1. The reported ILI counts from Week30 to Week34, 2021 are 1477, 1504, 1541, 1543, and 1531. Overall, this period shows a steady rise in ILI occurrences from Week30 to Week33, followed by a slight decline in Week34. This pattern indicates a gradually increasing trend, suggesting early seasonal activity as respiratory illness rates climb but remain below epidemic thresholds.
2. Week39, 2021 falls into the peak onset season since the peak onset typically begins around Week35 and lasts until Week46. During this phase, influenza activity starts to gradually rise, as evidenced by the increasing outpatient ILI observation trends and hints of respiratory viral circulation in minimally active influenza weeks. Hence, Week39, 2021 correlates with expected growing activity in this transitional phase preceding the peak season.
3. From a time-series analysis, past occurrences show consistent growth (Week30 to Week33) with minor fluctuations suggesting a predictable upward trend. Projecting this trajectory forward to Week39, 2021, a value of 1978 reflects moderate continuity in this pattern as respiratory viruses become more active during the early onset. This aligns with the incremental rise observed earlier.
4. Multiple factors strongly influence this forecast. First, a steady rise in outpatient ILI visits across all age groups throughout Weeks30–34 suggests heightened respiratory illness activity, probably caused by non-influenza pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 disrupting health dynamics (Week30 #7; Week33 #3). Second, vaccination promotions continue, but there is no notable rise in coverage reported yet, leaving the population more exposed to early viral transmissions (Week30 #9; Week34 #7). Third, virologic surveillance indicates extremely low influenza virus activity (Week30 #5; Week34 #1), but other respiratory illnesses, including novel influenza-like A(H1N2)v cases, are gradually noticed (Week32 #2), suggesting a potential uptick in illness trends.
5. Minimal influenza circulation nationwide is reported, with positivity rates close to zero and clinical labs confirming negligible detection of influenza (Week30 #5; Week34 #1).
6. Outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses continue to rise incrementally in all regions despite not surpassing the baseline nationally, with younger age groups (0–24 years) experiencing the bulk of increases (Week31 #3; Week34 #2).
7. Combining the observed trend, seasonal timing, and stated CDC findings, moderate growth in ILI activity is consistent with peak onset behavior, particularly influenced by non-influenza respiratory illnesses and limited vaccination progress. Thus, the value of 1978 occurrences for Week39, 2021 is well-supported by these patterns.
