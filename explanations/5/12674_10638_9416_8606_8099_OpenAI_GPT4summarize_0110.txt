1. The ILI counts from Week22, 2023 to Week26, 2023 exhibit a steady decrease: 12674 (Week22), 10638 (Week23), 9416 (Week24), 8606 (Week25), and 8099 (Week26). This consistent downward trend reflects diminishing influenza activity with no significant fluctuations or spikes over the five-week period.
2. Based on the time of year and influenza activity, Week31, 2023 corresponds to the off-season in the U.S., as it falls before the typical peak onset starting around Week32 or Week35, 2023 and aligns with low flu activity observed in these weeks.
3. The downward trend in ILI occurrences in the past five weeks suggests a continuation of minimal activity during the forecast period. Projecting forward from Week26, 2023, using time-series data, the expected decrease follows a consistent pattern, but some leveling off at a baseline of approximately 8887 ILI cases by Week31, 2023 is projected.
4. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory viruses contributes to the ILI baseline but does not indicate an influenza-specific increase (Week22, 2023 #9; Week23, 2023 #10; Week26, 2023 #9).
5. Virologic surveillance continues to report low influenza activity nationwide, with minimal positivity rates (Week22, 2023 #1; Week23, 2023 #1; Week26, 2023 #1). The mix of Influenza A and B subtypes, primarily stable in this period, does not suggest emerging variants capable of driving a sharp increase in cases.
6. Vaccination preparation is recommended, though there is no evidence of a large surge in vaccination uptake or any immediate impact on ILI rates during the forecast period (Week22, 2023 #10; Week25, 2023 #9; Week26, 2023 #10).
7. Given the consistent decline in ILI occurrences, off-season timing, minimal influenza positivity, co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, and no reported variant of concern, the projected ILI occurrence level of 8887 for Week31, 2023 aligns with historical trends and current epidemiological patterns.
