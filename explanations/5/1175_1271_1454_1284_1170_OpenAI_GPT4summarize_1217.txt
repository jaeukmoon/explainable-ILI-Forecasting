1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks display a highly variable trend, indicating fluctuations in ILI activity. Week52, 2020 recorded 1175 cases, which rose to 1271 in Week53, 2020 and peaked at 1454 in Week1, 2021. This was followed by a decline to 1284 in Week2, 2021 and further down to 1170 in Week3, 2021. The variability, particularly the peak in Week1, 2021, followed by decreasing values, suggests irregular ILI activity within the observed period.
2. A weak downward correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences, as the highest value (1454 from Week1, 2021) is followed by a tapering trend in Weeks2–3, 2021. The future occurrence reported as 1013 reflects a continuation of this decline in ILI activity after Week3, 2021, aligning with the downward trajectory seen at the end of the past 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient ILI visits consistently stayed below the national baseline (e.g., 1.6% in Week52, 2020, reducing to 1.3% in Week3, 2021). This persistent low activity reflects a suppressed influenza season and contributes to the relatively low future occurrence of 1013.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained significantly above epidemic thresholds across all five weeks, ranging from 13.6% (Week52, 2020) to 14.8% (Week3, 2021). Despite the influence of COVID-19 on PIC mortality, the elevated figures indicate an overall respiratory illness burden that aligns with continued ILI occurrences, albeit at a reduced scale in the future.
5. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional influenza surveillance systems and healthcare-seeking behaviors, as highlighted across all weeks. These challenges likely suppressed ILI reporting and diagnostics, contributing to lower observed and future ILI occurrences, including the reported 1013.
6. While influenza positivity rates were exceptionally low throughout all five weeks (e.g., 0.1% in Week53, 2020 and 0.3% in Week3, 2021), the reported gradual rise in Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 circulation and regional increases in ILI (Week53, 2020) suggest that some activity persistently sustained respiratory illness levels, leading to moderate future occurrence levels.
7. In summary, the future occurrence of 1013 can be attributed to the fluctuating past ILI trend, declining ILI outpatient visits, consistently elevated PIC mortality reflecting respiratory illness burdens, disrupted surveillance due to COVID-19, and the limited yet ongoing circulation of influenza.
