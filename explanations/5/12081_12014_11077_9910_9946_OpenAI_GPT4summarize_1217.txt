1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but overall declining trend, with values of ['12081', '12014', '11077', '9910', '9946']. There was a slight decrease from 12081 (Week21, 2024) to 12014 (Week22, 2024), followed by a sharper decline to 11077 in Week23, 2024, and 9910 in Week24, 2024. Week25, 2024 showed a marginal increase to 9946. Despite this brief rebound, the general decline likely reflects the waning influenza season.
2. A marginal positive correlation exists between the declining past ILI trend and the subsequent future ILI occurrences of 10818 (Week30, 2024). While a reduction in ILI cases was observed in previous weeks, the slight rebound between Week24 and Week25 provides a precursor to the observed resurgence of 10818 after 5 weeks, hinting at stabilization or resurgence potentially driven by external factors.
3. Outpatient respiratory illness visits steadily declined from 1.9% (Week21, 2024) to 1.5% (Week25, 2024), with values consistently below the national baseline. This subtle reduction reflects reduced respiratory illness activity but does not negate the possibility of localized upticks influencing long-term trends. Co-circulating respiratory viruses (such as SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other pathogens) reported consistently across all weeks emphasize the multifactorial nature of ILI trends, impacting overall ILI activity. Regional variability in influenza and respiratory illness incidence, noted particularly in Week25, 2024, also reinforces the likelihood of localized and unpredictable future increases. Although antiviral resistance remained minimal and vaccination coverage was stable across all 5 weeks, the co-circulation of Influenza A and B, alongside non-influenza respiratory viruses, supports the 10818 ILI occurrences in Week30, 2024.
4. Other significant factors from the CDC reports include the cumulative stabilization of deaths attributed to influenza at 0.1% across all weeks, indicating reduced severity across broader population groups but potentially underestimating localized risks affecting future trends. Antigenic similarities between circulating virus strains and vaccine components (noted throughout Weeks21–25) reflect effective immunization but do not entirely prevent respiratory illnesses. Environmental factors and sporadic novel influenza virus detections with potential avian or swine origins (e.g., A(H5) in Week21, 2024, and A(H1N2)v in Week25, 2024) contribute to complex dynamics influencing disease reporting.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 10818 (Week30, 2024) can be attributed to the interplay of a marginal rebound in past ILI trends, subdued but consistent minor regional activity, non-influenza respiratory virus co-circulation, stable vaccination efficacy coupled with sporadic novel influenza cases, and environmental or localized factors that counterbalance broader declining national trends.
