1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed fluctuations, with values ['1386', '1170', '1239', '1301', '1285']. There was an initial decline from 1386 (Week 27, 2022) to 1170 (Week 28, 2022), followed by an increase to 1239 (Week 29, 2022), a further rise to 1301 (Week 30, 2022), and a slight decrease to 1285 (Week 31, 2022). This indicates an overall stabilization with minor variations in ILI activity during the observed period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is present, as the recovery from 1170 in Week 28, 2022, to higher levels in Weeks 29–31, 2022, leads into the observed future increase to 1430 occurrences after 5 weeks. The stabilization toward the latter weeks of the past data sets the stage for the subsequent rise in ILI occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently low, ranging between 1.5%-1.7% during Weeks 27–31, 2022, yet children aged 0-4 years had consistently high ILI rates (6.1%-7.3% across all weeks), indicating a substantial burden among younger populations that could drive higher future occurrences.
4. Persistent high mortality rates due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), exceeding epidemic thresholds (ranging from 8.8% in Week 27, 2022, to 10.0% in Week 31, 2022), mark elevated respiratory illness activity. Although influenza made up a small fraction of PIC deaths, the overarching respiratory burden likely contributed to the future surge in ILI cases.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, as emphasized in each CDC report, creates significant overlaps in respiratory illness data, thereby amplifying ILI reports and influencing future occurrences. Furthermore, altered healthcare-seeking behaviors during ongoing pandemic disruptions likely caused delayed or concentrated reporting, increasing the observed future ILI activity.
6. Despite consistently low influenza positivity rates (ranging from 0.4%-0.7% during Weeks 27–31, 2022), the cumulative burden of undiagnosed or alternative respiratory pathogens helped maintain a consistent baseline of ILI cases, supporting the eventual rise to 1430 occurrences after 5 weeks.
7. In summary, the reported 1430 future ILI occurrences (Week 36, 2022) are attributed to the stabilization in past ILI trends, consistently high rates of ILI in children, PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and disrupted healthcare behaviors during the pandemic. These combined factors set the stage for the observed future increase.
