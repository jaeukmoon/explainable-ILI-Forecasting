1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week7 to Week11, 2021 were 1503, 1521, 1532, 1837, and 2021. The trend shows a steady and notable increase across these weeks. While the initial three weeks show minor increases (Week7: 1503 to Week9: 1532), a sharp rise is observed from Week9 to Week10 (1837) and continues into Week11 (2021). This steady upward movement suggests emerging growth in ILI activity.
2. Week16, 2021 belongs to the off-season, as it occurs outside the typical U.S. peak season window (Week46 through Week6). Additionally, influenza positivity (Week11, 2021 #1) remained exceptionally low, well below baseline levels, and further supports this classification.
3. From the time-series perspective, the sharp rise in Week10 and Week11, 2021 signals a potential continuation of slightly elevated activity. However, historical lows in positivity and hospitalizations (Week11, 2021 #5) temper the likelihood of a significant outbreak. Projecting this pattern forward by five weeks, the model expects the trend to stabilize and slightly fluctuate, leading to 1924 ILI occurrences in Week16, 2021.
4. Influenza activity remained unusually low nationwide, with positivity rates stable at 0.1% across all weeks, yet virological surveillance highlights continuing circulation of Influenza A and B (Week11, 2021 #1).
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and overlapping COVID-19 symptoms complicate the accuracy of ILI estimations (Week11, 2021 #9). The concurrent pandemic likely limits traditional ILI transmission and reporting but could cause minimal underestimations in the forecast.
6. A novel influenza A(H1N1)v linked to swine exposure was reported (Week11, 2021 #8). While human-to-human transmission was not evident, such events could indirectly amplify surveillance efforts, affecting trends in the coming weeks.
7. Overall, the forecast of 1924 ILI occurrences reflects a tempered continuation of low but slightly rising activity. This aligns with minor increases in recent weeks, the off-season timing, persistently low influenza positivity, and other confounding factors like ongoing COVID-19 challenges and behavioral changes.
