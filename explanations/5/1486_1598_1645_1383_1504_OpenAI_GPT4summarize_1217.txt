1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed fluctuations without a clear consistent directional trend, with values of ['1486', '1598', '1645', '1383', '1504']. Initially, a steady increase was observed from 1486 in Week18, 2021, to 1645 in Week20, 2021. However, this rise was followed by a sharp decline to 1383 in Week21, 2021, before a modest rebound to 1504 in Week22, 2021. This volatile pattern reflects an oscillating rather than a steady-state trajectory.
2. There is a weak direct correlation between the observed past time-series data and the future ILI occurrences of 1469 (Week27, 2021). The decline during Week21, 2021, and only partial recovery in Week22, 2021, might have served as a precursor to the stabilization at a slightly lower value of 1469 in Week27, 2021, compared to the earlier peak in Week20, 2021. These oscillations in reported ILI occurrences likely influenced the eventual leveling-out of future occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) remained stable across the reporting period—1.2% for Weeks18–19, 2021, a slight increase to 1.3% in Week20, 2021, and returning to 1.1% in Week21, 2021, and 1.2% in Week22, 2021—well below the national baseline of 2.6%. These consistently low outpatient ILI visits align with reduced respiratory activity contributing to lower future ILI occurrences. Rates of pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC)-related mortality also showed a declining trend from 10.9% (Week18, 2021) to 7.5% (Week22, 2021), suggesting reduced overall respiratory illness severity by the season's end. Minimal influenza positivity in clinical and public health labs, consistent across all weeks (e.g., 0.1% positivity rates in Weeks18–20, 2021), reflects a negligible viral contribution to ILI, likely sustaining the observed low future levels. CDC reports highlight disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors from COVID-19, which may have altered ILI reporting. Such system adjustments reflect increasing data skewness that partially explains the variability in past occurrences and the reduced future value.
4. Despite significant fluctuations in the past time-series, the lack of pronounced influenza activity, stable outpatient ILI visits, and declining PIC mortality collectively explain why the future ILI occurrences stabilized at 1469 in Week27, 2021, slightly below the earlier period's average.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1469 (Week27, 2021) result from oscillations in the past ILI series, stable low outpatient ILI percentages, negligible influenza activity in surveillance data, and pandemic-driven changes in healthcare-seeking and reporting practices. These combined factors explain the modestly lower stabilization pattern observed in Week27, 2021.
