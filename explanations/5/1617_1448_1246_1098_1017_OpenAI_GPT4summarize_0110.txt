1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week20 to Week24, 2023 are 1617, 1448, 1246, 1098, and 1017. This trend reveals a consistent and significant decrease in ILI counts across the five-week period, with no evidence of sudden spikes or stabilization. Thus, the pattern indicates a steady downward trajectory.
2. The forecasted Week29, 2023 aligns with the off-season period, as peak ILI activity generally spans from Week46 to Week6, followed by the off-season from approximately Week7 to Week31. Given the continued low influenza activity and virologic indicators during Week20–Week24, 2023, Week29 clearly falls within the off-season.
3. The observed downward trend in ILI occurrences (from 1617 in Week20 to 1017 in Week24) informs the forecast for Week29, 2023. Extrapolating the steadily declining pattern forward suggests that ILI levels are expected to continue decreasing, eventually settling lower by Week29. Time-series forecasting consistently projects such reductions during the off-season, yielding a projected occurrence of 662.
4. Influenza activity remained minimal nationwide throughout Weeks20–24, with only 1.0%–1.2% of specimens testing positive for influenza and most jurisdictions reporting minimal ILI activity (Week20 #1, #3; Week24 #1, #8).
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 are contributing but not significantly elevating ILI trends, as influenza remains a small proportion of total respiratory hospitalizations, and overall virologic positivity continues to decline (Week20 #10; Week22 #9; Week24 #9).
6. Seasonal trends and CDC expectations indicate continued low influenza activity during the summer, with minimal flu activity occurring historically in the off-season period (Week21 #10; Week22 #10; Week24 #8). Co-circulation dynamics do not yet signal a resurgence.
7. The steady decline in ILI occurrences (from Week20 to Week24), the off-season timing (Week29, 2023), the low influenza positivity and activity levels, and the absence of contributing spikes from other respiratory illnesses collectively support the projected ILI occurrence of 662.
