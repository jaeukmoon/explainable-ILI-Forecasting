1. The ILI occurrences show a steadily increasing trend over the past 5 weeks, rising week by week from 1182 in Week7, 2022 to 1940 in Week11, 2022. This consistent growth trajectory suggests a progressive spread of ILI activity with no significant dips or fluctuations, aligning with an upward momentum.
2. Forecasting Week16, 2022, it falls within the off-season as it is outside the general peak season (commonly Week46 to Week6). However, the increasing flu activity observed and ongoing rise in hospitalization and outpatient visits during Weeks7-11, 2022 indicates this week could see heightened activity, but it still aligns more closely with late off-season/transition toward higher activity.
3. The past trends from Week7-11, 2022 display a clear upward trajectory. Using a time-series approach, extending this linear increase forward to Week16, 2022, and factoring in the continuing rise in outpatient ILI visits, hospitalization rates, and influenza positivity, the projected occurrences of 2531 fit within this trend's expected parameters over five weeks.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) remained the dominant strain (accounting for nearly all reported cases), with evidence of antigenic differences from vaccine strains (Week7 #2, Week8 #2, Week9 #3, Week10 #9, Week11 #7). This could cause reduced vaccine-derived immunity, contributing to sustained or rising activity over time.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and others, persisted throughout Weeks7-11, 2022 (Week7 #9, Week9 #9, Week10 #12, Week11 #8), potentially compounding respiratory illness rates in communities and influencing ILI trends.
6. Vaccination coverage remained below that of previous years during Weeks7-11, 2022, coupled with continued CDC recommendations for improved uptake (Week7 #8, Week8 #8, Week10 #10, Week11 #9). Lower vaccination rates, combined with rising hospitalizations, predict further upward pressure on ILI occurrences.
7. The linear 5-week upward trend of ILI occurrences, dominance of A(H3N2) with antigenic differences, ongoing virus co-circulation, and low vaccination rates substantiate the predicted increase to 2531 occurrences in Week16, 2022.
