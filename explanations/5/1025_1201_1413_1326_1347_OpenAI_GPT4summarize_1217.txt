1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1025', '1201', '1413', '1326', '1347']. The initial increase from 1025 (Week 30, 2021) to 1201 (Week 31, 2021) continued to 1413 (Week 32, 2021), followed by a slight dip to 1326 (Week 33, 2021) and a subsequent rise to 1347 (Week 34, 2021). This indicates an overall increase in ILI activity, albeit with minor fluctuations.
2. A strong positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the upward trajectory seen over the past 5 weeks, particularly the amplification from Week 30 to Week 32, 2021, directly aligns with the future increase to 1140 reported ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 39, 2021). This upward trend forms the foundation for the anticipated rise post-Week 34, 2021.
3. Outpatient visits attributed to ILI steadily rose from 1.9% (Week 30, 2021) to 2.2% (Week 34, 2021), with all age groups consistently reporting increases week-over-week. For example, notable growth in ILI visits was observed in specific age brackets such as 5–24 years in Week 32, 2021, and continued increases in younger groups (0–4 years and 5–24 years) by Week 34, 2021. This ongoing age-specific rise reflects respiratory virus transmission trends that contributed to the future surge.
4. Elevated percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), consistently above epidemic thresholds, were recorded, climbing from 9.0% (Week 30, 2021) to 19.4% (Week 34, 2021). This surge, primarily driven by COVID-19 rather than influenza, underscores heightened respiratory illness activity, correlating directly with the increased future ILI occurrences.
5. Disruptions in traditional ILI surveillance systems due to changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic limited the precision of real-time trend data. These limitations likely masked portions of current ILI increases (misattributed to COVID-19 or other respiratory conditions), resulting in the delayed recognition of the cumulative rise that is manifest in the future ILI count of 1140.
6. Despite minimal influenza-specific virologic activity (<0.1% positive influenza tests reported in Week 34, 2021) throughout the period, rising cases of non-influenza respiratory illnesses such as SARS-CoV-2 propelled ILI occurrences. Simultaneous reporting of non-influenza pathogens amplified the overall ILI counts, explaining the rise to 1140 occurrences.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 1140 (Week 39, 2021) results from the steady upward trend in past ILI occurrences, rising ILI-related outpatient visits across age groups, elevated PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and the compounding effects of pandemic-influenced healthcare behavior and non-influenza respiratory viruses driving transmission increases.
