1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a slight downward trend, with values of ['1416', '1293', '1230', '1340', '1263']. There was an initial sharp decline from 1416 (Week 46, 2020) to 1230 (Week 48, 2020), followed by a brief increase to 1340 (Week 49, 2020) before dropping again to 1263 in Week 50, 2020. This indicates a fluctuating yet declining ILI activity over the observed period, with no consistent upward trajectory.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the declining trend in ILI occurrences during the final weeks (Week 48–50, 2020) contrasts with a substantial drop to 916 occurrences after five weeks. The lack of sustained elevation in the past weeks indicates diminishing ILI activity corresponding to the reduced future occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently low throughout the observed timeline, at 1.5% (Week 46, 2020) to 1.6% (Week 50, 2020), below the national baseline of 2.6%. This low level of outpatient ILI activity reflects reduced respiratory illness prevalence, correlating with the drop to 916 occurrences in future data.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded epidemic thresholds but remained consistently driven by COVID-19 rather than influenza, accounting for percentages such as 10.7% (Week 46, 2020) and 13.3% (Week 50, 2020). This dominance of COVID-19 cases over influenza aligns with suppressed ILI trends during this period and the subsequent decline to 916 occurrences.
5. Low influenza positivity rates in both clinical and public health labs (e.g., 0.2% in Week 46, 2020; 0.1% in Week 48, 2020; and 0.3% in Week 50, 2020) suggest limited circulation of influenza viruses. Combined with continued COVID-19 mitigation measures such as masking and social distancing, this likely restrained influenza activity, contributing to the observed drop to 916 occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 916 (Week 55, 2020) are attributable to the overall declining trend in ILI over the past five weeks, consistently low outpatient ILI visits below the national baseline, dominance of COVID-19-driven PIC mortality, low influenza positivity rates, and the persisting impact of public health measures suppressing influenza circulation.
