1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a general increasing trend, with values rising from 1437 (Week 50, 2021) to 3033 (Week 52, 2021), followed by a slight decline to 2895 (Week 1, 2022). This trajectory highlights a sharp increase in ILI activity through Week 52, 2021, followed by stabilization at elevated levels, which reflects seasonal influenza escalation during the observed period.

2. A clear negative correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences. Despite the sharp rise in ILI cases reaching a peak in Week 52, 2021, followed by elevated stabilization in Weeks 1 and 2 of 2022, there is a pronounced drop in future ILI occurrences to 870 (Week 7, 2022). This decline may indicate that the spike in prior weeks reached its peak, followed by a substantial waning of influenza activity over the five subsequent weeks.

3. Several factors from the CDC reports correlate with the future decline to 870 in Week 7, 2022:  
   - Declining influenza positivity rates: Positivity decreased significantly from 6.2% (Week 51, 2021) to 2.2% (Week 1, 2022), suggesting a reduction in influenza transmission, which aligns with the sharp drop in reported ILI cases.  
   - Regional variation and waning regional activity: Reports from Week 1, 2022, and Week 2, 2022, indicated that influenza activity had begun to decline in certain regions, correlating with the national decline to 870 occurrences.  
   - Co-circulation of respiratory viruses and evolving healthcare-seeking behavior: The reports highlight co-circulating pathogens (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) and changes in healthcare visits during Weeks 1 and 2 of 2022, which likely impacted ILI reporting and contributed to the observed reduction in Week 7, 2022.

4. In summary, the drop to 870 ILI occurrences in Week 7, 2022, is attributed to the prior rise and subsequent peak in ILI cases (Weeks 50–52, 2021), followed by a decline in influenza positivity rates, diminishing regional activity, and disruptions in healthcare behavior and reporting. These factors collectively shaped the observed post-peak reduction in ILI occurrences.
