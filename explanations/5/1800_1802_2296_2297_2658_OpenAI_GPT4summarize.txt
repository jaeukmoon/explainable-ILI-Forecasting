1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks revealed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1800', '1802', '2296', '2297', '2658']. Although the increase from 1800 (Week 42, 2021) to 1802 (Week 43, 2021) was minimal, Weeks 44, 45, and 46 showed significant weekly increases, peaking at 2658 during Week 46, 2021—the highest in the observed period. This rising trend indicates growing ILI activity, particularly in the later weeks.

2. A strong positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences. The consistent upward trajectory by Week 46, 2021, serves as a precursor to the future spike of 4249 occurrences after 5 weeks. The reported rise aligns with the notion that increasing ILI activity during the 5-week period sets the stage for the observed amplified ILI rates.

3. Multiple factors in the summarized CDC reports correlate with the rise in future ILI occurrences. First, outpatient visits for ILI gradually increased from 1.8% in Week 42 to 2.2% in Week 46, 2021, despite remaining below the national baseline of 2.5%. This steady elevation reflects escalating respiratory illness activity. Second, Influenza A(H3N2), particularly impacting ages 5–24 years, became more dominant in later weeks, with public health labs detecting increased influenza positivity rates (0.1% Week 42 to 1.0% Week 46). Third, the proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed the epidemic threshold, ranging from 16.5% in Week 42 to 14.5% in Week 46, showing sustained respiratory illness severity. These factors collectively indicate rising illness trends and greater ILI burden.

4. In summary, the reported 4249 future ILI cases after 5 weeks likely stem from the rising trajectory in past ILI occurrences (Weeks 42–46, 2021), growing ILI-related healthcare visits, increased influenza (particularly A(H3N2)) positivity, and persistently elevated PIC mortality rates above epidemic thresholds. These trends, coupled with regional outbreaks and evolving healthcare behaviors during this period, culminated in the significant future ILI surge.
