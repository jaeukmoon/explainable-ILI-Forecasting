1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week41 to Week45, 2020 are 1162, 1017, 1079, 1171, and 1320. Initially, the trend reflects a dip from Week41 (1162) to Week42 (1017), followed by a gradual increase through Week45 (1320). This pattern demonstrates a fluctuating trend with a slow upward trajectory by Week45.
2. In the U.S., the target week (None) lies shortly after Week45, 2020, which corresponds to Peak onset season, as this period extends from about Week35 to Week46. Given the data, the rising ILI occurrence aligns with the transition toward peak activity, supporting the classification of the target week within the Peak onset season.
3. The time-series pattern of ILI counts indicates slight fluctuations but an overall moderate increase across the 5 weeks. This gradual rise correlates with historical observations of activity leading to the Peak season, making a predicted occurrence of 1263 reasonable by continuing the upward trajectory with mild fluctuations.
4. Influenza positivity among respiratory specimens is reported at low levels (Week41 to Week45, 2020 #1, #2); however, a small gradual rise is evident (e.g., Week45: 0.2%, up from Week44: 0.1%), reflecting incremental viral circulation.
5. Outpatient ILI visits, remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%, show a steady increase (Week41 to Week45, 2020 #4: 1.2%, 1.2%, 1.2%, 1.3%, 1.5%), coinciding with greater healthcare-seeking behavior and rising prevalence of respiratory illnesses.
6. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceed the epidemic threshold each week during the analysis period (Week41 to Week45, 2020 #5, #6: 7.2%, 7.6%, 8.2%, 8.1%, 8.9%), reinforcing an environment of elevated respiratory burden that correlates with increasing ILI incidence.
7. Given the gradually rising trend in ILI counts, alignment with the Peak onset season, increasing outpatient ILI visits, slightly rising influenza positivity, and higher PIC-associated deaths, the forecasted value of 1263 for future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks is justified.
