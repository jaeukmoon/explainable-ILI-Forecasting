1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week23, 2024 to Week27, 2024) in Region 1 show a consistently **decreasing trend**, with values of 1685, 1476, 1397, 1268, and 1015. The weekly percentage decrease from one week to the next is approximately -12.4% (1685 to 1476), -5.3% (1476 to 1397), -9.2% (1397 to 1268), and -19.9% (1268 to 1015). The overall decline rate over the 5 weeks averages around **11.7% per week**, indicating a clear downward trajectory in ILI activity, consistent with an ongoing off-season reduction. If a weekly -11.7% average decline continues for the subsequent 5 weeks, the occurrences project to approximately 790 by **Week32, 2024**.
2. Season Classification: **Week32, 2024 falls within the Peak onset season**, as Week32 marks the transition into heightened ILI activity in anticipation of the U.S. flu season. However, since previous weeks (Week23–Week27) are within the off-season, the seasonal baseline remains low as the system navigates the early stages of the onset period.
3. A correlation analysis between past trends and future ILI projections shows how the historical pattern influences Week32's forecast. The consistent -11.7% average weekly decline over 5 weeks suggests that the trend is primarily driven by reduced flu positivity (below 2%), low hospitalization rates (stable at 0.1–0.2 per 100,000), and minimal outpatient respiratory visits (remaining under 1.5% of visits). Assuming this trend persists, the ILI occurrence can be estimated via exponential smoothing: **1015 × (1 - 0.117)^5 ≈ 790**.
4. Three influencing factors from the CDC reports directly support this forecast:
5. First, **low influenza positivity** (decreasing from 1.6% in Week23 to 0.9% in Week27) suggests reduced transmission, aligning with declining ILI occurrences. This supports the sustained downward trend toward Week32, 2024.
6. Second, **minimal respiratory illness activity** (outpatient visits below baseline, from 1.7% in Week23 to 1.4% in Week27) indicates suppressed flu activity with no moderate-to-high ILI activity reported in any region.
7. Third, **anticipated seasonal transition and co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, COVID-19, and flu)** introduce potential gradual increases in activity. However, the CDC's expectation of low flu prevalence in the near term mitigates any immediate resurgence, keeping ILI occurrences stable or slightly declining.
5. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrences of 790 for Week32, 2024 are justified by the combination of the steadily declining 5-week trend (-11.7% weekly average decrease), the classification of Week32 as part of the Peak onset season, and CDC-reported factors such as low influenza positivity and minimal respiratory illness activity. The stabilization near baseline levels in the off-season further supports this projection, with the early Peak onset season not yet fully amplifying ILI activity.
