1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating trend with values ['1117', '1093', '990', '914', '1013']. There was a decrease from 1117 (Week4, 2021) to 914 (Week7, 2021), followed by an increase to 1013 in Week8, 2021. This variability indicates no clear continuous trend but highlights a recent rise in ILI activity during the last observed period.
2. A weak positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed. The increase from Week7, 2021 (914) to Week8, 2021 (1013) provides a possible early signal of the future increase to 1209 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week13, 2021).
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained low but stable at 1.1% in Weeks6–7, 2021, eventually decreasing slightly to 0.9% in Week8, 2021. While the percentage stayed below the national baseline of 2.6%, the steady reporting of ILI activity reflects underlying illness trends supportive of the future increase.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained significantly above the epidemic threshold across all weeks, decreasing from 28.4% (Week4, 2021) to 16.4% (Week8, 2021) but still reflecting elevated respiratory-related illness activity during this period.
5. Healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI surveillance were continuously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic throughout all weeks, disrupting reliable tracking and potentially concentrating future ILI reporting. This compounded with increased virological and outpatient detections, particularly in growing pediatric trends, supports the rise to 1209 occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 1209 future ILI occurrences (Week13, 2021) can be attributed to slight increases in Week8, 2021 occurrences, stable ILI outpatient visits, ongoing elevated PIC mortality figures, and pandemic-driven disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior that likely delayed and amplified eventual reporting.
