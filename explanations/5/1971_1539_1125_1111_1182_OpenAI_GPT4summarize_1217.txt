1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a sharp decline initially, from 1971 (Week 3, 2022) to 1111 (Week 5, 2022), followed by a slight increase to 1182 (Week 7, 2022). This represents an overall downward trend, reflecting a reduction in ILI activity during this period despite a marginal rise in the last week of observation.
2. The relationship between past and future ILI occurrences shows a lagged amplification. While the downward trend in the past weekly data may suggest declining activity, the slight uptick in Week 7, 2022 (1182), likely signals the beginning of increased respiratory illness activity, culminating in higher future occurrences of 2032 (Week 12, 2022).
3. Hospitalization rates increased consistently over the weeks, rising from 4.3 per 100,000 (Week 3, 2022) to 4.9 per 100,000 (Week 7, 2022), particularly among individuals aged 65+ and children, indicating higher severity of cases, which likely contributed to the future rise.
4. Low flu vaccination rates persisted throughout the observed period, with vaccination uptake consistently lower than the previous season across all weeks. This factor decreased population-level immunity, exacerbating the potential for increased ILI occurrences.
5. Concurrent circulation of respiratory viruses, including Influenza A(H3N2), RSV, and COVID-19, compounded by antigenic differences in circulating Influenza A strains, contributed to variability in ILI trends. These factors likely amplified respiratory illness activity leading to the future increase to 2032 occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 2032 future ILI occurrences (Week 12, 2022) are explained by the slight increase in Week 7, 2022, steady hospitalization rate growth, reduced vaccination coverage, and co-circulation of respiratory viruses, culminating in heightened activity over the subsequent weeks.
