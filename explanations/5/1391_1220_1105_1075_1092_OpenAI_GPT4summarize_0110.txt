1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week25 to Week29, 2023 are 1391, 1220, 1105, 1075, and 1092. The data reveals a consistent decline from Week25 (1391) to Week28 (1075), followed by a slight increase in Week29 (1092). This indicates a primarily decreasing trend with minor fluctuations, showing no evidence of a significant upward momentum in ILI activity during this time.
2. Based on typical patterns for ILI activity in the United States, Week34, 2023 falls in the off-season. Week29, 2023 CDC data confirms minimal influenza activity, which aligns with the off-season designation as influenza-related metrics remain well below peak onset or peak thresholds.
3. The past time-series data demonstrates a clear decline with minor stabilization in Week29. Projecting this pattern forward suggests little variation in the coming weeks, aligning with a continuation of the off-season and relatively low ILI activity. The forecast of 1227 ILI occurrences reflects this gradual leveling off, consistent with the historical trajectory.
4. The proportion of positive influenza specimens remains low, with Week28 (0.9%) and Week29 (1.0%) consistent with reduced flu activity levels. No novel influenza strains have emerged (Week25-Week29 #8, Week29 #9), and co-circulating respiratory illnesses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, contribute minimally to significant ILI changes (Week25 #10, Week28 #11, Week29 #8).
5. Hospitalizations due to laboratory-confirmed influenza decreased, such as 641 in Week27, 689 in Week28, and 573 in Week29 (Week27 #5, Week28 #6, Week29 #5). This correlates with a broader decline in influenza morbidity and suggests steady low ILI activity levels.
6. Outpatient ILI visits also remained below the national baseline throughout the period, from Week25 (1.4%) to Week29 (1.1%), reflecting minimal influenza spread. Pediatric groups exhibit elevated rates but contribute only to regional variability (Week25 #3, Week29 #4). The overall stable and low outpatient activity sustains the off-season classification.
7. Summarizing, the declining ILI occurrences reflect an off-season environment with nationally minimal influenza activity, low positivity rates, decreasing hospitalizations, and outpatient visits. The extrapolated forecast of 1227 ILI occurrences in Week34, 2023 captures the continuation of this low-activity trend.
