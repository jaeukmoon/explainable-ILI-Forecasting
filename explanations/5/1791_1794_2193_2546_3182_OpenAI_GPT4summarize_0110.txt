1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week25 to Week29, 2021 are 1791, 1794, 2193, 2546, and 3182. This indicates a clear and steady upward trend, with weekly increases in ILI cases observed across the 5-week period. Starting from a minimal level in Week25, 2021, the rise becomes sharper in Week28 and Week29, indicating potential seasonal shifts or external influences contributing to increased circulation or reporting.
2. In the U.S., the peak onset season usually begins around Week32 and extends to Week46. Given the upward trend in ILI occurrences in the preceding weeks and that Week34, 2021 falls within the peak onset period, it is consistent with the peak onset season.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the five-week trend demonstrates a steady and accelerating increase in ILI occurrences. Using historical progression and the recent steeper increases between Week27 (2193) to Week29 (3182), a projection to Week34 assumes a continuation of this rising pattern, contributing to the forecasted ILI occurrence of 3784.
4. The summarized CDC reports from Week25 to Week29, 2021, highlight three key factors strongly influencing forecasting:
5. a. Increasing outpatient visits for ILI, with Week29 showing three consecutive weeks of increases across all age groups, especially in younger populations (Week29 #2).
6. b. Minimal current influenza activity but the possibility of shifts due to concurrent influences, such as alternative healthcare settings and changing healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, which impact accurate ILI reporting trends (Week25 #8, #9; Week29 #6, #9).
7. c. Seasonal timing and behavioral patterns, with minimal flu circulation alongside a gradual increase in ILI indicators, signaling the start of seasonal respiratory illness activity (Week27 #3, #10; Week29 #10).
5. Small but continuous rises in respiratory specimens testing positive for ILI were noted (Week27 #1, Week29 #1-#2), suggesting an early signal of seasonal factors affecting ILI trends.
6. The impacts of alternative care systems, influenced by COVID-19 (Week26 #6, Week29 #6), are complicating traditional data interpretations, but the upward trend in ILI-related outpatient visits and minimal competing factors indicate reliable forecasting potential.
7. Based on the clear five-week trend of increasing activity, concurrent seasonal timing associated with the peak onset season, and CDC data on minimal current influenza activity with gradual increases in ILI-related visits, the prediction for Week34, 2021 aligns with 3784 occurrences. This value reflects a continuation of the rising trend, bolstered by seasonal and behavioral indicators.
