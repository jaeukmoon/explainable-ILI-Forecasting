1. The past time-series ILI occurrences for the 5 weeks showed fluctuations within a narrow range, with values recorded as ['1367', '1349', '1310', '1326', '1362']. These numbers indicate a slight decline during the initial weeks from 1367 (Week 6, 2023) to 1310 (Week 8, 2023). However, there was a rebound in later weeks, returning to 1362 (Week 10, 2023). The overall pattern demonstrates stability in ILI activity with no significant trend up or down.
2. The relatively stable ILI patterns observed in the past data likely influenced the future occurrences of 1232 in Week 15, 2023. Although the future ILI occurrences show a slight decrease compared to the past values, the subdued fluctuations across past weeks suggest that this decline is consistent with the overall stabilization of ILI trends during Weeks 6–10, 2023.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable yet slightly above the baseline, recorded at 2.6% consistently during Weeks 6 to 8, 2023, before dropping to 2.4% in Weeks 9 and 10, 2023. This decline in outpatient ILI visits correlates directly with the slightly lower future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks. Additionally, low influenza positivity rates (ranging from 0.9% to 1.0%) and declining weekly hospitalizations for influenza reflect overall low-level activity, contributing to the observed stabilization of ILI occurrences. Regional variations also highlighted moderate-to-high activity only in specific jurisdictions, potentially dampening any broader escalation in future ILI trends.
4. Persistent mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained slightly above the epidemic threshold, ranging from 9.4% in Week 6, 2023, to 8.6% in Week 10, 2023. This trend slowly declined over the period, mirroring the overall stabilization of respiratory illness activity that aligns with lower reported future ILI values. Similarly, hospitalizations consistently decreased each week, from 1,992 cases in Week 6, 2023, to 1,387 in Week 10, 2023, reflecting diminishing influenza severity across the population.
5. In summary, the slight decrease in future ILI occurrences to 1232 (Week 15, 2023) is attributable to stable yet slightly declining ILI trends in Weeks 6–10, 2023, declining outpatient ILI visits, reductions in hospitalizations, low influenza positivity rates, and minimal PIC mortality. Regional variations in activity remained localized, further reinforcing subdued national ILI trends after 5 weeks.
