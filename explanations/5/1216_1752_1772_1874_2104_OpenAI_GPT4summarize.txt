1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1216', '1752', '1772', '1874', '2104']. Starting in Week 47, 2021, at 1216, the ILI activity climbed significantly each week, peaking at 2104 in Week 51, 2021. The sharp and sustained rise in ILI occurrences over these weeks reflects an escalating trajectory of influenza-like illness activity.  

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the sustained increase observed in Weeks 47–51, 2021, acts as a strong precursor to the reported future number of 1484 occurrences after 5 weeks. The eventual drop from Week 51 levels may reflect the natural progression of ILI activity tapering off after a sharp peak.

3. The percentage of outpatient visits for ILI rose from 2.4% in Week 47, 2021, to 3.8% in Week 51, consistently exceeding the national baseline during the latter weeks. This sustained growth in ILI-related healthcare visits aligns closely with the overall rise in ILI activity.  
   Mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) increased from 15.5% in Week 47, 2021, to 19.2% in Week 51, remaining above the epidemic threshold. This consistent elevation of PIC mortality reflects heightened respiratory illness activity in the population, aligning with the observed ILI trends.  
   Vaccination uptake was lower compared to previous seasons, as reported across all 5 weeks. With suboptimal coverage and ongoing genetic evolution of Influenza A(H3N2) strains, the level of community immunity may have been insufficient to prevent the increase in ILI occurrences.  

4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence of 1484 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the strong upward trend observed in Weeks 47–51, 2021, elevated rates of outpatient ILI activity above baseline, persistent PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, and limited vaccine uptake contributing to ongoing transmission. These factors collectively explain the transition from high past ILI activity to the eventual observed fluctuations.
