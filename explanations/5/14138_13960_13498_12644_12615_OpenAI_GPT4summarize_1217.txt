1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent declining trend, with values of ['14138', '13960', '13498', '12644', '12615']. This represents a steady decrease in ILI activity from Week16, 2024 (14138) to Week20, 2024 (12615), with the most significant drop occurring between Week17, 2024 (13960) and Week18, 2024 (13498). This pattern reflects a nationwide reduction in influenza activity as reported by CDC data.
2. A clear inverse correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences. Despite the continuous decline in ILI cases over the 5 weeks (Weeks 16–20, 2024), the future value of 9946 suggests that the decreasing trend persisted into the subsequent period. The sharp reduction from 12615 in Week20, 2024, to 9946 after 5 weeks highlights the sustained decline in flu activity over time.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI dropped consistently, starting at 2.3% in Week16, 2024, and stabilizing at 2.0% by Week20, 2024. This stabilization below the national baseline for seven weeks aligns with the continued decline in ILI cases after 5 weeks. High-risk groups such as adults aged 65+ years showed significantly elevated cumulative hospitalization rates (220.7 per 100,000 in Week19, 2024), which reflect reduced ILI activity in broader populations due to improving containment in these vulnerable groups. The positivity rate of respiratory specimens testing for influenza reduced from 4.8% (Week16, 2024) to 2.0% (Week20, 2024). This progressive decline contributed to the overall reduced ILI rates. Deaths attributed to influenza remained low, dropping further from 0.3% in Week16, 2024, to 0.1% by Week20, 2024, signifying diminished severe influenza impacts and aligning with future lower ILI occurrences.
4. Contributing factors detailed in CDC reports—such as declining flu activity with shrinking percentages of specimens testing positive for influenza, co-circulating viruses (COVID-19 and RSV), and improved vaccination coverage—significantly impacted the ILI trends. While co-circulating viruses like SARS-CoV-2 contributed variably, they likely did not result in spikes, as trends continued downward. The sustained focus on flu vaccinations and antivirals may have further mitigated influenza burden, hastening the decline.
5. In summary, the reported 9946 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks can be attributed to the continuous decrease in past time-series ILI data from Weeks 16–20, 2024, consistent declines in outpatient ILI visits and positivity rates, diminishing influenza severity as indicated by hospitalization and mortality trends, and effective mitigation efforts through vaccination and antiviral applications. The prevailing downward trajectory observed during these weeks serves as a strong predictor for the future decline.
