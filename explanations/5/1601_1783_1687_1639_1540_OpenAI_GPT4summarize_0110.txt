1. The reported ILI counts from Week34 to Week38, 2021 are 1601, 1783, 1687, 1639, and 1540. The trend initially increased from Week34 (1601) to Week35 (1783), followed by a gradual decrease through Week36 (1687), Week37 (1639), and Week38 (1540). Overall, this pattern reflects a mild fluctuation, with a short-term peak in Week35 before slowly declining through Week38.
2. Based on historical data, Week43, 2021 falls within the Peak onset season. This aligns with the influenza activity beginning to increase gradually but not yet reaching peak season levels. The current observed low positivity rates and ILI data below the national baseline further support classification into Peak onset season.
3. The time-series analysis indicates a mild rise followed by a steady decline, suggesting stabilization around a lower baseline. By projecting this pattern five weeks forward from Week38, 2021, the ILI occurrence in Week43, 2021 is expected to exhibit marginal growth compared to Week38, reflecting typical trends in early Peak onset season projections. The forecast for Week43 aligns with 1829 occurrences.
4. Minimal influenza circulation persists, as evidenced by influenza positivity rates at 0.1% during Weeks34 to Week38, 2021 (Week34, 2021 #1; Week36, 2021 #3; Week38, 2021 #2). This low activity partly contributes to moderating the growth of ILI occurrences.
5. The concurrent influence of other respiratory viruses, particularly SARS-CoV-2, dominates ILI trends and PIC mortality, accounting for over 20% of total deaths in Weeks36-38 (Week36, 2021 #6; Week37, 2021 #3; Week38, 2021 #3). This indirect pressure contributes to altered healthcare-seeking behavior and variability in ILI data interpretation.
6. The absence of significant changes in vaccination coverage or trends during Weeks34-38, 2021, combined with steady CDC recommendations for annual vaccination, implies limited impact of vaccination as a driver for immediate ILI activity changes (Week34, 2021 #7; Week36, 2021 #8; Week37, 2021 #8). Vaccination's delayed effect further minimizes its influence on short-term ILI trends.
7. Combining the historical ILI trend of mild decline, the classification of Week43 into Peak onset season, and contributing factors like low influenza circulation, dominant co-circulating respiratory viruses, and generally stable or unreleased vaccination activity, the ILI forecast of 1829 occurrences in Week43, 2021 is justified as consistent and predictable.
