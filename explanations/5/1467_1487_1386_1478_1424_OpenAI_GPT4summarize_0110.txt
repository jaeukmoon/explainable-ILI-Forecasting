1. The ILI counts from Week25 to Week29, 2023 are 1467, 1487, 1386, 1478, and 1424. The data shows a mild fluctuation with no consistent upward or downward trend. The highest count occurred in Week26 (1487), followed by a drop in Week27 (1386). By Week29, 2023, the activity remained stable at lower levels (1424). Overall, the trend suggests stability with minor fluctuations rather than a definitive increase or decrease.
2. Based on the historical off-season classification (e.g., Week1 to Week31, 2023), Week34, 2023 represents the transitional period between the off-season and the peak onset season. Given the low ILI activity and nationwide minimal flu positivity in recent weeks, Week34, 2023 can be categorized as part of the off-season.
3. The time-series analysis of Weeks25 to Week29, 2023 shows a stable yet slightly decreasing ILI pattern. Projecting this trend forward five weeks, historical data suggests a notable increase in ILI cases as the transition towards the peak onset season approaches. This increase aligns with expectations in late-August to September, historically marking the start of gradual activity increases.
4. The proportion of positive influenza specimens remained under 1.2% across all weeks (Week25, 2023 #1; Week26, 2023 #1; Week27, 2023 #1; Week28, 2023 #1; Week29, 2023 #1). Though low, the stability of circulating viruses such as Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 may influence anticipated slight increases closer to Week34, 2023.
5. Reports of co-circulating respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and RSV, complicate tracking (Week25, 2023 #10; Week26, 2023 #10; Week28, 2023 #11; Week29, 2023 #8). These pathogens likely contribute to an uptick in ILI cases, driving future ILI activity above baseline.
6. Low but persistent hospitalization levels (e.g., 768 in Week25, 807 in Week26, 641 in Week27, 689 in Week28, and 573 in Week29) signal steady infections from influenza during this off-season (Week25, 2023 #4; Week26, 2023 #5; Week27, 2023 #5; Week28, 2023 #6; Week29, 2023 #5). This steady transmission may lead to moderate growth in the subsequent five weeks, especially with typical seasonal increases beginning near Week34, 2023.
7. Considering prior mild fluctuations in ILI counts, the transitional timing between the off-season and the peak onset season, stable detection of influenza despite low positivity, and the influence of co-circulating viruses, the forecast accurately projects an increase to 3088 ILI occurrences in Week34, 2023. This aligns with the anticipated seasonal activity buildup and the shifting patterns in disease transmission during the late summer.
