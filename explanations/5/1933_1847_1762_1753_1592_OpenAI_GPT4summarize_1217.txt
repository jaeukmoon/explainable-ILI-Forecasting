1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent decline, with values of ['1933', '1847', '1762', '1753', '1592']. The trend began with 1933 cases (Week 19, 2023) and showed sustained decreases, culminating in 1592 cases by Week 23, 2023. This downward trajectory reflects diminishing ILI activity during this period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the steady decline during Weeks 19–23, 2023, contrasts with the subsequent increase to 1075 after 5 weeks (Week 28, 2023). The lows reached in Week 23, 2023, may represent a nadir, serving as a baseline from which the future rebound arises.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below the national baseline of 2.5%, reported at 1.9% (Week 19, 2023) and further declining to 1.6% (Week 23, 2023). This low and declining healthcare engagement for ILI during past weeks suggests a subsequent rise based on seasonal trends or other respiratory activity after Week 23, 2023.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and RSV) alongside influenza complicates ILI trends, as reported persistently across Weeks 19–23, 2023. These overlapping pathogen dynamics might explain the future spike to 1075 ILI cases, as minor shifts or interactions amplify respiratory illness reports.
5. Regional variations were noted across Weeks 19–23, 2023, with some CBSAs and states experiencing high or moderate ILI activity even as national trends remained minimal. These areas of heightened illness could potentially drive the observed future increase in ILI occurrences through local or regional transmission pockets.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences reaching 1075 (Week 28, 2023) can be attributed to the past decline providing a baseline, increases in seasonal or regional respiratory activity, overlapping pathogen co-circulation, and pockets of higher-than-minimal regional trends despite overall national declines.
