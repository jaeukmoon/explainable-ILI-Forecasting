1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a steady decline, with values of ['19923', '17486', '15495', '14144', '14344']. Specifically, Week23, 2022 (19923), marked the highest ILI occurrence, followed by a consistent decrease across Weeks 24 (17486), 25 (15495), and 26 (14144). Week27, 2022 (14344), showed a slight increase. This overall downward trend, with a temporary rise in the final week, signals decreasing ILI activity during this period.
2. The future ILI occurrences (11715) align with the downward trajectory observed in previous weeks, particularly the sustained decline from Week23 (19923) through Week26 (14144). The slight uptick in Week27 (14344) did not significantly affect the overall downward correlation, as the trend points towards continued decline leading to lower future ILI occurrences.
3. Key factors contributing to the correlation include: a) Steady reductions in outpatient visits for ILI, dropping from 2.1% (Week23, 2022) to 1.7% (Week27, 2022), reflecting reduced respiratory illness activity. b) Influenza activity steadily decreased, with positive respiratory specimen rates dropping from 3.4% (Week23, 2022) to 0.7% (Week27, 2022), indicative of waning influenza transmission. c) Hospitalizations for influenza consistently decreased over Weeks23–27, from 2089 (Week23, 2022) to 751 (Week27, 2022), highlighting declining severe respiratory illness burden.
4. Contributions to the observed decrease include low geographic spread of influenza, with only minimal or no high-activity areas reported across Weeks23–27, 2022, supporting the decline in ILI cases. Additional healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the pandemic likely impacted interpretation and reduced ILI reporting. No significant co-circulating respiratory virus activity or vaccination trends influenced a rise in ILI, further maintaining the downward ILI trend.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 11715 reflect the consistent decline in ILI activity from Weeks23 to 27, 2022, supported by decreasing outpatient ILI visits, declining positivity in influenza specimens, lower hospitalization rates, minimal geographic activity, and pandemic-driven healthcare behavior shifts. The observed trajectory reinforces a lower-level ILI occurrence for the future.
