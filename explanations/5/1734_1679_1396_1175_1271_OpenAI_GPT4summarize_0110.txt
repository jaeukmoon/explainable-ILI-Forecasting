1. From Week49, 2020 to Week53, 2020, ILI occurrences showed a decreasing trend: 1734 (Week49, 2020), 1679 (Week50, 2020), 1396 (Week51, 2020), 1175 (Week52, 2020), and 1271 (Week53, 2020). After a consistent decline from Week49 to Week52, there was a small increase in Week53. Overall, the trend indicates a decline followed by slight stabilization rather than a consistent ongoing drop.
2. Week5, 2021 falls within the U.S. peak season (Week46, 2020 to Week6, 2021). However, given the unusually low influenza activity in Week49 to Week53, 2020 and stable indicators below the national baseline, Week5, 2021 reflects a period of atypically low peak activity within the season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the sharp drop in ILI counts from Week49 to Week52, 2020 suggests declining activity but without a sharp resurgence. The slight stabilization in Week53 hints at a gradual leveling rather than an imminent surge. Projecting this trend forward, the ILI count for Week5, 2021 is forecasted at 1093, as the peak season remains atypical and low.
4. Influenza activity was unusually low nationwide, with respiratory specimens testing positive at only 0.1%-0.3% (Week49 #1; Week53 #1).
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes, compounded by COVID-19 conditions, impacted ILI trends and reporting reliability (Week49 #9; Week52 #9).
6. Vaccination remained widely encouraged but specific uptake data were lacking. The ongoing pandemic likely affected vaccination rates and influenza spread (Week50 #9; Week53 #8).
7. The projected occurrence of 1093 aligns with observed stabilization in recent ILI counts, low influenza transmission rates during the peak season, and disruptions caused by the pandemic. These factors collectively contribute to an atypical low-score forecast during peak timing.
