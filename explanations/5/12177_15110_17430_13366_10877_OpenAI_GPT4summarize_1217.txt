1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but overall declining trend, with values of ['12177', '15110', '17430', '13366', '10877']. A peak occurred in Week50, 2023 (17430), followed by a sharp decline to Week52, 2023 (10877). This downward trajectory suggests a reduction in ILI activity by the end of the observed period.
2. A clear correlation is noted between the declining ILI occurrences during Weeks51–52, 2023, and the lower future ILI activity (10476) in Week2, 2024. The consistent reduction across weeks is mirrored in the reported ILI occurrences after 5 weeks, indicating the overall trend of decreased respiratory illnesses.
3. The proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza peaked in Week52, 2023 (17.5%), before a decline to 13.7% in Week2, 2024. This decline aligns with diminishing ILI activity. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness (peaking at 6.9% in Week52, 2023) consistently dropped to 4.7% by Week2, 2024, further reflecting reduced flu activity. Additionally, influenza-attributable hospitalizations decreased from 18,526 in Week1, 2024, to a slightly more stable level in Week2, 2024, illustrating improved control and fewer severe cases. Co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., COVID-19 and RSV) contributed to complex trends but stabilized, aiding in decreased future ILI occurrences.
4. Despite earlier increases, Week2, 2024, data reflects a stabilization and reduction in activity. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, the predominant strain, showed low antiviral resistance, contributing to effective management efforts (Week1–2, 2024). Furthermore, vaccination updates from CDC across Weeks50, 2023, to Week2, 2024, indicate potential herd immunity effects reducing disease spread. The decline in outpatient respiratory visits and hospitalizations further corroborates the control over ILI activity.
5. In summary, the reported 10476 future ILI occurrences (Week2, 2024) are consistent with the observed downward trend in ILI from Week50–52, 2023, to Week2, 2024, influenced by decreasing influenza test positivity rates, falling outpatient visits, reduced hospitalizations, and widespread vaccination efforts combined with stabilization in co-circulating respiratory viruses.
