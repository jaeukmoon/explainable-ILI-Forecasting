1. The ILI occurrences from Week6, 2024 to Week10, 2024 are 16168, 16987, 16544, 16509, and 15338, respectively. The trend exhibited an initial peak in Week7, 2024, then decreased gradually over the following weeks with a notable drop in Week10, 2024. This reflects an overall declining trend in ILI occurrences after Week7, 2024, though the values remain above baseline levels.
2. Forecasting target week (Week15, 2024) belongs to the off-season. In the U.S., the typical off-season follows the peak season (Week6 of the following year). As Week10, 2024 marks the transition into the off-season and influenza activity continues to decline, it aligns with the reduced flu spread characteristic of this period.
3. From a time-series perspective, the decreasing ILI occurrences from Week7, 2024 to Week10, 2024 indicate a consistent downward trajectory. Projecting forward, the model predicts a continued decline in activity over the next five weeks. The target value of 13604 aligns with this decreasing trend, reflecting a gradual reduction in ILI occurrences during the off-season.
4. The notable elevation of Influenza B (up to 45.6% in Week10, 2024) is contributing more to overall ILI trends compared to earlier weeks but remains insufficient to reverse the downward ILI trend (Week7, 2024 #2; Week9, 2024 #2; Week10, 2024 #2).
5. Vaccination coverage continues to provide protection, with vaccines effectively aligned with circulating strains. Although vaccination updates are missing, the CDC continues to recommend vaccination through Week10, 2024, based on benefits against severe illness and the low likelihood of variant mismatch (Week6, 2024 #7; Week9, 2024 #8; Week10, 2024 #10).
6. Co-circulation of additional respiratory viruses, including RSV and COVID-19, persists and marginally influences ILI trends (Week6, 2024 #9; Week8, 2024 #10; Week10, 2024 #11). However, as influenza hospitalization rates continue to trend downward (Week7, 2024 #5; Week9, 2024 #4) and antiviral susceptibility remains high, these factors do not significantly elevate ILI levels.
7. In conclusion, the decline in ILI occurrences, alignment with off-season classification, protective effects of vaccination, and the lack of novel influenza variants driving a spike all justify the projected value of 13604 for Week15, 2024. This reflects a continued but stable downturn in influenza activity leading into the off-season.
