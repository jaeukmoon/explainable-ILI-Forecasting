1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week23 to Week27, 2023 are 10638, 9416, 8606, 8099, and 7930. A clear downward trend is evident, with weekly decreases in reported ILI cases. This consistent decline suggests reduced transmission, likely influenced by declining influenza activity and the off-season timing.
2. Week32, 2023 falls into the off-season category. This period is marked by minimal influenza activity in the U.S., consistent with observed trends spanning Week23 to Week27, 2023, as well as low outpatient visits for ILI (below baseline) and declining positivity rates for respiratory specimens testing for influenza.
3. The time-series analysis of Weeks23-27, 2023 shows a steady and consistent decline in ILI occurrences, from 10638 to 7930. Projecting this trend forward, it is reasonable to anticipate a reversal or leveling off as the off-season transitions towards the peak onset season around Week32. The prediction of 10038 ILI occurrences aligns with a slight uptick, possibly influenced by co-circulating respiratory viruses and baseline fluctuations.
4. Influenza activity during the reporting weeks has consistently remained low, with positivity percentages ranging from 1.0% to 1.2% (Week23 #1; Week24 #1; Week25 #1; Week26 #1; Week27 #1), and minimal activity nationwide in most jurisdictions, despite variances in some localities (Week27 #11).
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV continue to contribute to outpatient respiratory illness visits, complicating the interpretation of ILI trends while potentially influencing an increase in expected cases (Week23 #10; Week24 #9; Week25 #10; Week26 #9; Week27 #9).
6. Younger age groups, notably children under 5, exhibit higher outpatient ILI visit rates (Week24 #5; Week25 #3; Week26 #4; Week27 #10). This demographic's vulnerability amidst co-circulating viruses might drive localized spikes, contributing to the slight ILI rebound expected by Week32.
7. The projection of 10038 ILI occurrences in Week32, 2023 reflects a modest increment compared to Week27, 2023. This forecast is supported by low yet persisting influenza activity, the influence of other respiratory viruses, and population susceptibility as the off-season transitions towards early peak onset season dynamics. Trends signal that while ILI prevalence remains subdued overall, gradual increases could emerge in preparation for the fall season.
