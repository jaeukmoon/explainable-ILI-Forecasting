1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a steady decline, with values of ['1015', '1025', '874', '930', '830']. ILI decreased from 1015 in Week27, 2024, to 830 in Week31, 2024, except for a slight increase from 874 in Week29, 2024, to 930 in Week30, 2024. This overall downward trend reflects reduced respiratory illness activity heading into Week31, 2024.
2. A weak correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the consistent decline in ILI activity over 5 weeks (Weeks27–31, 2024) does not align with the sharp rise in ILI occurrences to 964 after 5 weeks (Week36, 2024). The decline in Weeks29–31 does not predict such a notable increase in Week36, 2024, suggesting external factors contributing to the rise.
3. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza, RSV, and COVID-19, as consistently reported from Week27 to Week31, 2024, adds complexity to ILI trends. This interaction likely contributed to future rises in ILI occurrences due to overlapping respiratory illness impacts on surveillance data.
4. Antiviral resistance, while minimal, was consistently detected in both Influenza A and B viruses, including Week27–31, 2024. This may have reduced treatment efficacy for certain cases, indirectly fueling higher future ILI occurrences.
5. Zoonotic influenza risks, as indicated by novel Influenza A(H5) cases in Week28 and Week29, 2024, brought increased attention to respiratory pathogen monitoring and may have influenced future rises in ILI surveillance and reporting.
6. In summary, the reported 964 future ILI occurrences (Week36, 2024) can be explained by underlying recurrent viral co-circulation trends, antiviral resistance influencing case outcomes, and zoonotic influenza cases prompting heightened surveillance. These factors likely counteracted the downward trend observed in Weeks27–31, 2024, resulting in the unexpected rise by Week36, 2024.
