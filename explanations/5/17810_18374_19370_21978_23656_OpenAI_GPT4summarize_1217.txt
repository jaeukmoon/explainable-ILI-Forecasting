1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a steady upward trend, with values increasing from 17810 (Week40, 2023) to 23656 (Week44, 2023). The rise was gradual from 17810 in Week40, 2023, to 18374 in Week41, 2023, followed by a sharper increase to 21978 in Week43, 2023, and a peak of 23656 observed by Week44, 2023. This upward trajectory indicates amplifying influenza-like illness activity over the observed period.
2. The positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident as the progressively rising trend in the past weeks aligns with the significant future increase to 34012 after 5 weeks (Week49, 2023). The upward momentum seen in Weeks43 and 44, 2023, serves as a precursor to the future intensification of ILI activity.
3. In Week44, 2023, outpatient visits for ILI reached 2.9%, hitting the national baseline, after rising steadily from 2.2% in Week40 to 2.7% in Week43. Increased outpatient activity reflects heightening respiratory illness trends, setting the stage for elevated future ILI cases.
4. Cumulative increases in influenza-related hospitalizations from 0.1 per 100,000 (Week40, 2023) to 1.2 per 100,000 (Week44, 2023) suggest intensifying influenza severity, mirrored in rising future occurrences after 5 weeks.
5. The rise in influenza positivity rates from 1.1% in Week40, 2023, to 3.0% in Week44, 2023, along with reports of moderate-to-high ILI activity in an increasing number of jurisdictions and certain regions (e.g., Regions 4, 6, and 9), further underscores the regional and national burden, likely contributing to the amplified future activity level.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 34012 (Week49, 2023) can be attributed to the consistent ascendancy observed from Week40 to Week44, 2023, rising outpatient ILI visits and hospitalization rates, increasing influenza positivity, and regional activity surges, all aligned with broader national respiratory illness trends.
