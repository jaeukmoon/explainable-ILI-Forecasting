1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a sharp decline, starting at 1205 (Week17, 2023) and progressively dropping to 644 (Week21, 2023). The most significant reduction occurred between Weeks20 and 21, where values dropped from 1056 to 644. This overall downward trend reflects decreasing ILI activity throughout the observed period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed. The consistent decline in past weeks does not directly predict the increase to 856 cases after 5 weeks (Week26, 2023). However, the later stabilization of factors like outpatient visits and co-circulating respiratory viruses may influence the rise in the future weeks.
3. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained just above epidemic thresholds, with Week17 indicating 7.3% and Week21 showing 7.0%. This persistent alignment above thresholds reflects underlying respiratory illness pressures, potentially driving future ILI increases. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently stayed stable at or near 2.0%, remaining below the national baseline but possibly reflecting ongoing symptomatic spread. Co-circulation of multiple pathogens, particularly SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, alongside influenza, continued through Week21, complicating illness patterns and possibly contributing to the mapped future increase.
4. Despite a sharp decline in ILI occurrences over the 5-week period, elevated PIC mortality rates, sustained outpatient ILI visits, and co-circulating respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, highlight lingering drivers that could explain the rise in future ILI occurrences to 856.
5. The uptick in ILI cases to 856 after Week21, 2023, aligns with consistent PIC pressures and co-circulating virus activity despite earlier declining values, suggesting non-linear influences and broader respiratory illness dynamics shaping the future trend.
