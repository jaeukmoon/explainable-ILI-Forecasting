1. The ILI counts from Week47 to Week51, 2021 are 15058, 17928, 18608, 22179, and 28956. The trend demonstrates a steady and sharp increase in occurrences, particularly from Week49 (18608) to Week51 (28956), indicating an accelerating spread of influenza-like illness during the monitored period. This sharp upward trajectory reflects a significant rise in flu activity and suggests movement toward the peak flu season.
2. Forecasting the target week (Week4, 2022) belongs to the peak season. This is because Week4 typically falls within the traditional peak season range of Week46 to approximately Week6, where flu activity reaches its highest. Additionally, the consistent sharp rise in past ILI occurrences supports this classification.
3. From a time-series perspective, the strong upward trend observed during the last five weeks (Week47 to Week51, 2021) implies that ILI counts will likely remain elevated or slightly decrease as flu activity begins leveling off. Extrapolating from this pattern, future ILI occurrences are expected to moderate following recent rapid increases, projecting a value like 13413 for Week4, 2022 due to potential partial stabilization during the ongoing peak season.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, particularly Influenza A(H3N2), has been the dominant subtype detected, with up to 99.8% of Influenza A cases attributed to this strain (Week49, 2021 #2). This strain heavily influences the ILI activity increase during Weeks47 to Week51, 2021.
5. Flu vaccination uptake shows early signs of being lower compared to previous seasons (Week48, 2021 #7; Week50, 2021 #7; Week51, 2021 #8). Limited vaccination coverage likely contributes to the rapid and widespread ILI case growth, pushing the season into the peak phase.
6. Hospitalization rates and influenza positivity rates have risen sharply, with hospitalizations increasing from 495 in Week47, 2021 to 1825 in Week51, 2021, and influenza positivity rates climbing from 1.5% in Week47, 2021 to 6.2% in Week51, 2021 (Week47, 2021 #2, #6; Week51, 2021 #2, #5). These increases are consistent with an ongoing and intensifying peak season.
7. In summary, the projection for Week4, 2022 as 13413 ILI occurrences is supported by the observed rapid ILI increase during Weeks47 to Week51, 2021. Contributing factors include aggressive Influenza A(H3N2) circulation, low vaccination uptake, and rising positivity and hospitalization rates, all characteristic of the peak influenza season's progression.
