1. The reported ILI counts from Week13 to Week17, 2024, are 13834, 13338, 13604, 12541, and 13258. This data indicates an overall declining trend with mild fluctuations. The peak ILI count occurred in Week13 (13834), followed by consistent reductions from Week14 (13338) onward, except for a slight uptick in Week17 (13258). This pattern reflects a gradual tapering of activity as flu activity declines nationally.
2. In the U.S., the off-season typically occurs after Week06 and spans until around Week31. Week22, 2024 is situated well within this off-season period. The reductions in influenza positivity rates, outpatient respiratory visits, and hospitalizations, reported consistently from Week13 to Week17, align with the off-season classification. Therefore, Week22, 2024 is forecasted to belong to the off-season.
3. From a time-series perspective, consecutive declines in ILI counts observed from Week13 to Week17 demonstrate a predictable tapering trend, typical of off-season periods. Extrapolating this pattern forward five weeks to Week22, 2024, suggests continued gradual reductions, reflecting lower community transmission and ILI incidents. This supports the forecast of 11996 as a reasonable estimate for Week22, 2024, within the expected stability of off-season trends.
4. CDC reports from Week13 to Week17 highlight key factors contributing to the forecast. Influenza activity is steadily declining, with respiratory specimen positivity rates dropping from 9.1% in Week13 to 3.9% in Week17. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently decreased, falling below the national baseline from Week14 onward. Hospitalization rates have also decreased gradually, with cumulative rates reaching 79.8 per 100,000 by Week17, indicating reduced disease severity over time. These indicators support declining, off-season influenza activity.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, remains a contributing factor, complicating overall influenza attribution but not driving sharp increases in ILI occurrences. This is highlighted in all weeks (e.g., Week13 #11, Week14 #8, Week15 #8, Week16 #10, Week17 #7), demonstrating a stable rather than surging influence on respiratory illness trends.
6. Despite regional variations and ongoing virus circulation, CDC reports consistently indicate no detection of novel influenza viruses and that vaccination effectiveness remains reliable (e.g., Week13 #9, Week14 #7, Week15 #9, Week16 #9, Week17 #6). These factors, coupled with declining positivity and hospitalization rates, reduce the likelihood of unexpected surges in ILI counts by Week22, 2024.
7. In conclusion, the forecast of 11996 ILI occurrences for Week22, 2024, is justified by the observed declining trend in ILI counts from Week13 to Week17, the off-season timing, and consistent reductions in viral positivity, hospitalizations, and outpatient respiratory illness visits as per CDC reporting. Co-circulation of respiratory illnesses and stable vaccine effectiveness also contribute to a controlled and predictable decline during this period.
