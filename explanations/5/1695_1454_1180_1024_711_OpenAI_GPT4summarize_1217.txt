1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent and significant decline, with values of ['1695', '1454', '1180', '1024', '711']. This trend demonstrates a gradual reduction in reported ILI activity, dropping steadily week by week from 1695 in Week 22, 2022, to 711 in Week 26, 2022. The sharp decline reflects a diminishing trajectory in ILI cases over this period.
2. A negative correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the sharp drop from 1695 (Week 22, 2022) to 711 (Week 26, 2022) likely indicates a stabilization trend that continues to decline, leading to a much lower occurrence of 769 after 5 weeks (Week 31, 2022). This alignment highlights the predictive continuation of the downward trend in ILI occurrence.
3. Influenza positivity rates decreased consistently, from 5.9% (Week 22, 2022) to 1.4% (Week 26, 2022), indicating reduced circulation of influenza viruses over time. This decrease directly aligns with lower ILI activity in subsequent weeks. Non-specific impacts from co-circulating respiratory viruses were noted but diminished, further emphasizing a decline.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI dropped steadily, from 2.3% (Week 22, 2022) to 1.7% (Week 26, 2022), consistently staying below the national baseline. The reduction in healthcare-seeking behavior for ILI highlights reduced respiratory illness activity, correlating with the lower future ILI occurrence of 769 in Week 31, 2022.
5. Hospitalization rates for lab-confirmed influenza also declined, reflecting drops from 2089 new cases in Week 23, 2022, to 964 in Week 26, 2022. The waning hospitalization burden indicates de-escalation of severe influenza cases, contributing to the continued decline in future ILI activity.
6. Healthcare-seeking behavior modifications due to the COVID-19 pandemic further limited ILI cases observed through traditional surveillance systems. This limitation likely contributed to lower reported ILI after 5 weeks and supports the reduced 769 occurrences documented in Week 31, 2022.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence of 769 in Week 31, 2022, can be attributed to the consistent downward trend in past ILI occurrences (Weeks 22–26, 2022), decreased influenza positivity rates, lower outpatient visits for ILI, reduced hospitalization rates for lab-confirmed influenza, and pandemic-driven healthcare-seeking behavior adjustments.
