1. The reported ILI counts from Week22 to Week26, 2023 are 1753, 1592, 1546, 1391, and 1220. This trend exhibits a consistent week-over-week decline in occurrences, suggesting reduced transmission intensity. The drop from Week22 (1753) to Week26 (1220) highlights a steady decrease in cases, with no significant fluctuation or spike observed during this period.
2. Forecasting the target week (Week31, 2023) places it during the off-season, as Week31 occurs after the typical peak season (Week46 to Week6) and before the peak onset season (starting around Week32 or Week35). Current ILI activity indicators and reports align with the quiet off-season period when community spread remains minimal.
3. Analyses of past trends show that prior weeks have seen a sustained decline in ILI occurrences. Given this downward trajectory and the off-season classification, a continued decline or stabilization is expected, albeit at a slower pace as activity levels approach their seasonal baseline. Projecting this trend forward by five weeks, Week31, 2023 is forecasted at 1089 occurrences, reflecting a gradual tapering of cases from Week26.
4. Influenza positivity rates have remained very low across all reported weeks, with values such as 1.1% (Week22, 2023), 1.0% (Week23, 2023), and 1.2% (Week26, 2023). There is no indication of new or intensified influenza activity, supporting an expectation of continued low ILI burden.
5. The co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory viruses has persisted in recent weeks (Week22, 2023 #9; Week23, 2023 #10; Week26, 2023 #9). While these factors contribute to ILI surveillance challenges, they have not driven any significant spikes in overall influenza activity during the off-season.
6. CDC anticipates low ILI activity during the summer months and has consistently reported minimal flu activity in most jurisdictions nationwide (Week22, 2023 #10; Week24, 2023 #8; Week26, 2023 #8). Combined with the downward trajectory in outpatient visits for ILI, this expectation reinforces the likelihood of low future occurrences.
7. The predicted value of 1089 ILI occurrences for Week31, 2023 is justified by the ongoing off-season classification, steady declines in cases, low positivity rates, and minimal transmission of influenza. These factors collectively indicate a stable and reduced ILI burden consistent with historical patterns for late summer.
