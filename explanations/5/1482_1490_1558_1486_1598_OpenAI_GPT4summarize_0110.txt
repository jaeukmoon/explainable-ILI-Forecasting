1. The reported ILI counts from Week15 to Week19, 2021 are 1482, 1490, 1558, 1486, and 1598. These values show an overall mild fluctuation with a slight upward trend, particularly notable from Week17 (1558) and Week19 (1598), after a temporary dip in Week18 (1486). This indicates a generally stable pattern with periodic minor increases.
2. Week24, 2021 occurs significantly later than the typical U.S. peak flu season (from Week46–Week6) and aligns with the off-season phase when ILI and influenza activity remain minimal. This is confirmed by the low activity described in Weeks15 through Week19, 2021. Thus, Week24, 2021 belongs to the off-season.
3. Projecting from the past weeks, where ILI activity showed consistent fluctuations around a modest baseline, no strong upward or downward trend has emerged. Forecasting forward, this suggests that occurrences in Week24, 2021 are unlikely to change significantly from prior weeks, maintaining generally stable and low ILI occurrences.
4. Minimal ILI activity was reported across all jurisdictions during Weeks15–Week19, 2021, with outpatient ILI visits remaining between 1.1% and 1.2%, well below the national baseline of 2.6%. This stable outpatient activity supports low transmission projections (Week15, Week17, Week19 #6, #7).
5. COVID-19 remains the dominant driver of pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC)-related deaths, exceeding the epidemic threshold, while actual influenza activity is minimal. This competitive suppression from COVID-19 further reduces influenza's transmission and impacts future ILI counts (Week15, Week16, Week18 #5, #9).
6. Virologic surveillance consistently reports exceptionally low influenza positivity rates in Weeks15 through Week19, 2021 (about 0.1% positivity), further evidenced by low hospitalization rates (0.8 per 100,000) and no significant rise in novel virus activity. This supports the stable forecast for Week24, 2021 (Week15, Week17, Week18 #1, #4, #10).
7. Considering the mild fluctuations in ILI trends, the off-season classification of Week24, 2021, and the minimal influenza activity described in the CDC reports, the projected ILI occurrence after 5 weeks aligns at 1474.
