1. The ILI occurrences from Week52, 2020 to Week3, 2021 were 1402, 1451, 1475, 1259, and 1042. The data shows a small increase from Week52, 2020 (1402) to Week1, 2021 (1475), followed by a notable decline in Week2, 2021 (1259) and Week3, 2021 (1042). This trend indicates a peak followed by a consistent drop in ILI occurrences over the five weeks, aligning with the end of the peak season.
2. Week8, 2021 falls into the off-season as it is after the typical peak season window (Weeks46–6). Consistent with this, influenza activity from Week52, 2020 to Week3, 2021 remained unusually low (Week52, 2020 #1; Week53, 2020 #1; Week1, 2021 #1; Week2, 2021 #1; Week3, 2021 #1). Hence, Week8, 2021 reflects a low-activity off-season.
3. Based on historical patterns, the significant decline in ILI cases during the past five weeks suggests a continued downward trajectory. Using time-series forecasting, this steady reduction projects that the count will stabilize at lower levels in the upcoming weeks, forecasting Week8, 2021 at 641 occurrences.
4. Influenza positivity rates have been consistently minimal, with respiratory specimens testing positive at <0.5% (Week52, 2020 #1; Week1, 2021 #1; Week3, 2021 #1), and minimal regional or national increases in ILI activity were observed through Week3, 2021 (Week52, 2020 #4; Week2, 2021 #10). The trend of reduced positive cases aligns with suppressed transmission.
5. Vaccination coverage and uptake remain recommended but unchanging, with no significant increases highlighted (Week52, 2020 #8; Week1, 2021 #8; Week3, 2021 #8); this sustains the current low levels of influenza spread and hospitalizations (Week1, 2021 #7; Week2, 2021 #5; Week3, 2021 #5).
6. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 remains dominant, contributing to healthcare-seeking shifts and a reduced focus on ILI-specific surveillance (Week52, 2020 #6, #9; Week53, 2020 #9; Week1, 2021 #9; Week3, 2021 #7). This together with overlapping pandemic challenges suppresses traditional influenza transmission and hospitalizations (Week53, 2020 #7; Week1, 2021 #7; Week2, 2021 #5).
7. Given the off-season classification, the downward trend in ILI occurrences observed from Week52, 2020 to Week3, 2021, and the influence of minimal influenza positivity, low vaccination impacts, and suppressed flu activity due to COVID-19 dominance, the projected ILI occurrence for Week8, 2021 is 641.
