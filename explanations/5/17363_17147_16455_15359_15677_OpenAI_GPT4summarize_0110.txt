1. The reported ILI counts from Week34 to Week38, 2023 are 17363, 17147, 16455, 15359, and 15677. A declining trend is evident from Week34 (17363) to Week38 (15677), with a steady decrease until Week37 (15359) followed by a slight rebound in Week38 (15677). This suggests a generally downward trajectory with minor fluctuations, indicative of low ILI activity levels.
2. Forecasting for Week43, 2023 places it within the peak onset season. In the U.S., the peak onset period spans approximately from Week35 to Week46 annually. The target week aligns with this period, supported by the increasing potential for influenza activity as flu season approaches and historical seasonality.
3. From a time-series perspective, observed declines in ILI counts over the past five weeks indicate the waning tail of the off-season. However, a small rebound observed in Week38 could signify the early onset of expected increased activity in the peak onset season. Projecting forward to Week43 given these dynamics, the model accounts for potential ILI growth, estimating 21978 occurrences as the start of seasonal escalation.
4. Multiple respiratory viruses co-circulate, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, which continue to variably contribute to ILI rates regionally. This complicates precise ILI attribution but suggests the potential for slightly variable increases in activity as respiratory viruses surge in the cooling months (Week38, 2023 #8; Week37, 2023 #9; Week36, 2023 #9).
5. Outpatient ILI visits are gradually increasing, noted at 1.7%, 1.9%, and 2.0% from Week34 to Week38. Additionally, higher ILI percentages among young children (up to 6.8% in Week38) indicate a steady rise in healthcare-seeking behavior, potentially influencing broader projections (Week38, 2023 #3; Week37, 2023 #6; Week36, 2023 #4).
6. Despite low ILI positivity rates (hovering between 0.6%–0.9%), hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed influenza have risen from 779 in Week34 to 880 in Week38. This signals an uptick in severity among detected cases and aligns with seasonal expectations for ramping activity (Week38, 2023 #4; Week37, 2023 #4; Week34, 2023 #4).
7. The forecast value of 21978 reflects a combination of gradually increasing activity in the peak onset season, consistent with historical patterns, alongside contributions from co-circulating respiratory viruses, rising healthcare engagement, and a shift toward broader community transmission. This aligns with emerging signs of seasonal escalation as captured in surveillance and forecasting models.
