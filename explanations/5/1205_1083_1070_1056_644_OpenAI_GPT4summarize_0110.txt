1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week17, 2023 to Week21, 2023 are 1205, 1083, 1070, 1056, and 644, respectively. The trend shows a steady decline over this period, with a marked drop from Week20 (1056) to Week21 (644), indicating a decreasing trajectory in ILI cases. This consistent downward trend reflects stability in low influenza activity without unexpected spikes.
2. Based on the seasonal framework for ILI activity, Week26, 2023 falls within the off-season, as it occurs well after the typical peak (Week46 to Week6) and peak onset (Week32 to Week46) periods. Additionally, nationwide influenza activity remains low, with positivity rates below 2% during the prior weeks (Week17-Week21, 2023). The off-season designation is further supported by declining hospitalization rates and outpatient ILI visits below the baseline.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent downward trend in the past five weeks signals minimal future escalation in ILI cases. The sharp decline in Week21 (644) indicates that influenza activity is likely stabilizing at a reduced baseline. Projecting this pattern forward to Week26, 2023 leads to a forecast of 856 ILI occurrences, signifying a slight increase due to natural activity variability, yet remaining consistent with off-season trends.
4. Influenza activity has been consistently low nationwide, with respiratory specimen positives below 2% across all weeks (Week17-Week21, 2023). This continued low positivity aligns with off-season projections for Week26, 2023.
5. Vaccination efforts remain stable, with the seasonal vaccine well-matched to circulating strains and antiviral susceptibility remaining high. This indicates effective prevention and treatment options (Week17, 2023 #7; Week18, 2023 #9; Week19, 2023 #7; Week20, 2023 #7; Week21, 2023 #8), contributing to the containment of ILI cases.
6. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, persists but does not indicate a significant interaction driving influenza activity (Week17, 2023 #10; Week19, 2023 #9; Week20, 2023 #10; Week21, 2023 #8). This co-circulation has introduced variability within ILI trends but has not caused major disruptions recently.
7. In summary, the forecast for Week26, 2023 anticipates an ILI occurrence of 856, consistent with the off-season status. This value is supported by the declining trend in past ILI occurrences, stable vaccination coverage with a well-matched vaccine, low influenza positivity rates, and ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses without significant surges. These factors collectively justify the projected ILI count, reflecting minimal influenza activity during the off-season.
