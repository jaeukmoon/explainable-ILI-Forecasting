1. The reported ILI counts from Week36 to Week40, 2021 are 16276, 12979, 11487, 11116, and 11730. From Week36 to Week40, there was a sharp decline from 16276 to 11116 over the initial four weeks, followed by a slight increase to 11730 in Week40. This suggests a downward trend with a small recovery near the end but no strong indication of a substantial rise or spike.
2. Forecasting that the target week (Week45, 2021) belongs to the Peak onset season aligns with the timing in the typical U.S. influenza calendar (Week35 to Week46), given that influenza virus circulation is beginning to show slight activity, although it remains low (Week40, 2021 #1, #10).
3. From a time-series perspective, the significant decline in ILI occurrences over Weeks36-40, softened by the slight uptick in Week40, hints at a stabilization phase with potential gradual increases. Accounting for seasonal effects, the multiyear pattern of transitioning toward the peak season during Week45 supports projecting an increase from Week40 levels, resulting in an anticipated ILI count of 15312.
4. The ongoing presence of other respiratory viruses contributes marginally to ILI activity despite minimal influenza circulation (Week36, 2021 #2; Week37, 2021 #5; Week40, 2021 #10), potentially causing slight weekly fluctuations.
5. Vaccination rates are expected to increase as the CDC continues to encourage vaccinations during early fall, particularly by the end of October, which could help modulate significant flu growth (Week40, 2021 #8; Week37, 2021 #8).
6. Specimens testing positive for influenza and hospitalizations have started appearing (Week40, 2021 #1, #7), with Influenza A and B subtypes detected in public health labs, indicating low but notable virus activity entering the peak onset phase.
7. In conclusion, despite the ongoing low-level circulation of influenza, the seasonal timing, anticipated gradual increase in cases due to peak onset trends, co-circulating respiratory pathogens, and early signs of flu activity justify projecting Week45, 2021 with a moderate increase to 15312 ILI occurrences.
