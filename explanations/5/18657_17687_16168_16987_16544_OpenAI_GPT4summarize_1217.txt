1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating downward trend overall, with values ['18657', '17687', '16168', '16987', '16544']. There was an initial steep decrease from 18657 (Week4, 2024) to 16168 (Week6, 2024), followed by a minor rebound to 16987 (Week7, 2024). The final slight decline to 16544 (Week8, 2024) depicts sustained yet slightly diminishing ILI activity across the observed period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the downward trend in Weeks 4–8, 2024, precedes the reduced future occurrence of 13834 after 5 weeks. Despite short-term fluctuations, the gradual fading of ILI occurrences aligns with the lower-end total recorded after this period.
3. Regional trends in influenza positivity showed notable variations, with some regions (e.g., regions 6, 7, and 8) reporting measurable increases, but no pervasive national spikes were evident, as positivity rates steadily declined from 16.2% (Week4, 2024) to 14.2% (Week8, 2024). This inconsistency in regional trends likely influenced suppressed future occurrences.
4. Hospitalization rates, especially those tied to severe Influenza A (H1N1) illness, plateaued toward Week8, 2024, with a cumulative stabilization to 61.5 per 100,000. This indicates that while activity remained elevated, it ceased to worsen, helping to moderate the expected future occurrence of 13834.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2, due to their persistent detection (e.g., 4.0% of flu-associated hospitalizations tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Week4, 2024), competed with ILI categorization. This might have contributed to lower influenza-attributable rates by Week13, 2024, among reported illnesses.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 13834 (Week13, 2024) is explained by the observed downward trend in Weeks 4–8, 2024, declining influenza positivity nationwide, plateauing hospitalization rates, and the compounding influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses. These moderated overall ILI activity, aligning with the reduced future occurrence reported.
