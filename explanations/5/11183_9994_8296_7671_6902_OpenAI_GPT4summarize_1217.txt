1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showcased a consistent downward trend, with values of ['11183', '9994', '8296', '7671', '6902'] for Weeks 9 through 13, 2024. Weekly values dropped progressively from 11183 (Week 9, 2024) to 6902 (Week 13, 2024), reflecting a marked decline in ILI activity during this period.
2. A strong correlation exists between the declining past ILI occurrences and the lower future ILI occurrence of 4713 after 5 weeks (Week 18, 2024). The downward trajectory observed consistently from Week 9 to Week 13, 2024, strongly aligns with the decrease to 4713 occurrences reported for the future, suggesting the continuation of this declining pattern.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily decreased from 4.1% (Week 9, 2024) to 3.0% (Week 13, 2024), demonstrating a continued national decline in ILI-related healthcare visits. This drop closely aligns with the downward ILI trend and informs the future decreased occurrence.
4. Influenza testing positivity rates consistently diminished, from 13.9% (Week 9, 2024) to 9.1% (Week 13, 2024). These proportions suggest reduced spreading and transmission of influenza over time, contributing to the decreased ILI activity projected in the future.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, such as RSV and COVID-19, were notably impacting trends. Their declining influence, as highlighted across Weeks 9–13, 2024, signals reduced respiratory illness burden over time, further driving the anticipated drop to 4713 future occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 4713 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 18, 2024) result from the consistent decline in past ILI data, decreasing outpatient ILI visit rates, sustained reductions in influenza positivity, and weakening impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses, all indicating a tapering trajectory of ILI activity.
