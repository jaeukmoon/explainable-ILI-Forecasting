1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week32 to Week36, 2021 are 1541, 1543, 1531, 1502, and 1743. The pattern shows an overall stable trend with marginal fluctuations from Week32 to Week35. However, a significant spike in ILI activity occurred in Week36 (1743), signaling a potential upward shift in respiratory illness activity. This deviation from previous stability suggests increasing circulation of respiratory pathogens.
2. Considering that Week41, 2021 falls within the U.S. Peak onset season (Week32-Week46), the observed upward trend aligns with expectations of increased viral activity in this phase. Therefore, Week41, 2021 is forecasted to belong to the Peak onset season.
3. The time-series analysis reflects a steady to slightly increasing trend in ILI occurrences, particularly after the spike noted in Week36. Projecting forward to Week41, the increase in ILI activity in recent weeks might sustain due to seasonal drivers and broader respiratory illness circulation. Consequently, using this trajectory, the model anticipates a rise from prior weeks, resulting in the forecasted count of 2067.
4. Minimal influenza virus activity was consistently reported across Weeks32 to Week36. Only 0.1% of specimens tested positive for influenza during this period, with low influenza-associated hospitalization and no significant subtype characterization provided, suggesting other respiratory viruses are the primary contributors to ILI (Week34 #1, #4; Week36 #3, #4).
5. COVID-19 continues to drive a high proportion of PIC-related deaths (14.6%-21.0% from Week32 to Week36), with symptoms overlapping ILI cases, leading to elevated outpatient respiratory illness visits but not from influenza itself (Week32 #4; Week36 #6).
6. Healthcare-seeking patterns influencing ILI data collection, combined with changes in access to care during the pandemic, contribute to uncertainty in surveillance accuracy. This impact is crucial to interpreting trend deviations accurately (Week32 #8; Week35 #10; Week36 #9).
7. The forecasted value of 2067 reflects the upward revised trajectory of ILI activity during the Peak onset season, driven by an increasing trend observed in Week36, the influence of other respiratory viruses, and complications in data accuracy tied to healthcare-seeking behaviors during the pandemic. These factors collectively justify the projected rise in occurrences.
