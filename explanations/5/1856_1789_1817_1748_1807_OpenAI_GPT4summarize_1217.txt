1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but slightly declining trend, with values of ['1856', '1789', '1817', '1748', '1807']. The period began at 1856 (Week20, 2021), dropped to 1789 (Week21, 2021), briefly rebounded to 1817 (Week22, 2021), then declined again to 1748 (Week23, 2021) and rose slightly to 1807 (Week24, 2021). This fluctuating but generally stable trend indicates no strong or persistent growth in ILI activity during these weeks.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 3182 represents a significant increase compared to the past 5 weeks. This rise does not correlate with the slightly declining trend observed in past data ('Week20 to Week24, 2021') but may indicate a lagging or external factor influencing the sharp increase in ILI cases 5 weeks later.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at 1.3% (Week20, 2021) and then fluctuated between 1.1% and 1.2% through Week24, 2021, consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%. The sudden increase in future occurrences may reflect a delayed impact of other respiratory pathogens or altered healthcare-seeking behavior not immediately evident from these percentages. PIC deaths remained elevated (9.5% in Week20 to 7.1% in Week24), consistently surpassing epidemic thresholds. While largely attributed to COVID-19, the elevated level of respiratory illness may have indirectly facilitated future ILI activity. Additionally, disruptions in healthcare patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as highlighted across all CDC reports, suggest changes in surveillance systems and behavioral factors that may have distorted ILI trends and reporting accuracy. The identification of novel Influenza A variants (e.g., H3N2 and H1N2v) throughout Weeks 20–24, while not linked to widespread human-to-human transmission, emphasizes the unpredictable nature of influenza activity and future ILI dynamics.
4. Despite minimal influenza positivity rates throughout Weeks 20–24, 2021 (e.g., less than 0.1% in Week24) and limited influenza cases detected in public health labs, the reported future increase in occurrences likely stems from non-influenza respiratory illnesses or changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors.
5. In summary, the significant rise to 3182 future ILI occurrences can be attributed to a combination of potentially delayed impacts of elevated respiratory-related mortality (PIC), disruptions in healthcare patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, surveillance system challenges, and novel influenza variant identification amid minimal activity. While past time-series data did not indicate a strong upward trend, external or lagging factors likely drove the sharp increase.
