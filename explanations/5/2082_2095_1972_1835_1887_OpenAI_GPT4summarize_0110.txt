1. The reported ILI counts from Week14 to Week18, 2024 are 2082, 2095, 1972, 1835, and 1887. This demonstrates a consistent downward trend, with a gradual decline in ILI occurrences over the five-week period. There are no significant spikes or sharp rises, suggesting a continuing decrease in ILI activity.
2. Forecasting target week (Week23, 2024) belongs to the off-season as it falls well after the peak season, which typically ends around Week6 of the year in the U.S. The continuous decrease in flu activity at or below baseline levels (evident from Week14 to Week18, 2024) further confirms this classification.
3. From a time-series perspective, the decreasing trend in ILI occurrences (2082 in Week14 to 1887 in Week18, 2024) suggests a projection of continuing declines into subsequent weeks. Given the steady reduction, the model anticipates that ILI occurrences for Week23, 2024 will drop further to 1119, consistent with off-season patterns and historical decay trends.
4. Several factors from the CDC reports strongly influence this forecast.
5. Nationwide influenza positivity rates have steadily declined from 7.7% in Week14, 2024 to 3.1% in Week18, 2024, indicating a decreased prevalence of flu activity.
6. Outpatient respiratory illness visits have consistently been below the national baseline, decreasing from 2.8% in Week14, 2024 to 2.1% in Week18, 2024, reflecting lower community transmission of ILI.
7. CDC reports explicitly predict further declines in influenza activity during this period, supported by the stabilization of co-circulating respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, which remains manageable at current levels.
5. Genetic matching of influenza strains to the current vaccine and stable antiviral susceptibility (Weeks14–18, 2024) contribute to effective disease mitigation and reduce ILI occurrences, especially among high-risk populations.
6. The cumulative hospitalization rate has only slightly increased from 76 per 100,000 in Week14, 2024 to 80.3 per 100,000 in Week18, 2024, indicating a stabilizing trend despite the off-season transition. This stability reflects a lower burden of severe cases as flu activity diminishes.
7. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrence of 1119 for Week23, 2024, is driven by the steady declining trend in ILI counts, the off-season timing, reduced influenza positivity and outpatient visit rates, and the effectiveness of current vaccines and antivirals. Together, these factors point towards a continued decrease in ILI activity, consistent with the observed patterns.
