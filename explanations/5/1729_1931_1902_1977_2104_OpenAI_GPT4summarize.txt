1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent upward trend, starting from 1729 in Week 11, 2022, to 2104 in Week 15, 2022. After a slight dip in Week 13 (1902), the values steadily increased through Weeks 14 and 15. This progression signals sustained growth in ILI activity during the monitored period.  

2. The future ILI occurrence of 3625 in Week 20, 2022, correlates positively with the upward trajectory in the past time-series data. The steady rise in Weeks 14 and 15, coupled with increasing influenza activity, hospitalizations, and outpatient visits during these weeks, likely contributed to the elevated ILI occurrences reported after 5 weeks.  

3. Outpatient visits for ILI rose from 1.8% in Week 11, 2022, to 2.1% in Week 15, 2022, reflecting gradual increases over time, particularly in younger populations. This consistent growth corresponds with increased respiratory illness activity nationwide, serving as an early indicator of the rise in future ILI cases.  
   
4. Cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza increased weekly, from 6.5 per 100,000 in Week 11, 2022, to 9.8 per 100,000 in Week 15, 2022. This suggests an intensifying burden of severe respiratory illness, aligning with the projected surge in ILI occurrences.  

5. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 (5.0-5.4% coinfection rates by Week 15, 2022) with influenza likely amplified the burden of respiratory illnesses, complicating clinical presentations and contributing to higher ILI occurrences.  

6. In summary, the increase to 3625 ILI occurrences in Week 20, 2022, is a result of the consistent upward trend in ILI activity (Weeks 14-15, 2022), rising outpatient visits, escalating hospitalization rates, and the compounding effects of co-circulating respiratory pathogens.
