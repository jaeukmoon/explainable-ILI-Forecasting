1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week25, 2024 to Week29, 2024) show a consistent decreasing trend: 1397, 1268, 1015, 1025, and 874. Specifically, there is a notable decline from Week25 (1397) to Week29 (874) with minor fluctuation between Week27 (1015) and Week28 (1025). On average, the weekly change rate was calculated as approximately -11.5% [(1268-1397)/1397 + (1015-1268)/1268 + (1025-1015)/1015 + (874-1025)/1025 divided by 4], suggesting an overall downward trend.
2. Week34, 2024 belongs to the "Off-season" based on the broader U.S. flu seasonality cycle. According to the background knowledge, the off-season spans from right after the peak season (Week6) to the next peak onset season (Week31-Week46). Week34 occurs during this low-activity period, where ILI occurrences typically stabilize or remain minimal.
3. The time-series correlation analysis, when projected forward to Week34, 2024, indicates that the ILI occurrences are likely to stabilize at a lower level due to the decelerating trend observed in the previous 5 weeks. Averaging the most recent five-week occurrences (1397, 1268, 1015, 1025, and 874) gives a mean of approximately 1116. Factoring in the continued weekly decline rate (-11.5%), we project the decrease for 5 additional weeks: 874 × (1 - 0.115)^5 ≈ 785, reflecting a continuation of the recent gradual decline.
4. The CDC reports provide three key factors influencing the prediction:
5. a. Minimal influenza activity: Specimens testing positive for influenza decreased from 1.1% (Week25) to 0.7% (Week29), indicating widespread suppression. This decline aligns with reduced ILI occurrences (total drop of 37.5% over 5 weeks), supporting the projection of continued decline to 785 in the off-season.
6. b. Co-circulating respiratory viruses: The presence of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and novel influenza strains (e.g., A(H5), Week28 and Week29) without significant human-to-human transmission contributes to low influenza activity, stabilizing ILI occurrences at a reduced rate.
7. c. Stable antiviral resistance and vaccination alignment: High antigenic similarity of circulating strains to vaccine references and stable antiviral resistance (Week25-Week29) minimize the odds of increased influenza transmission, sustaining the observed decline.
5. In summary, combining the observed downward trend in ILI occurrences, off-season classification for Week34, 2024, and the CDC-reported low influenza activity, co-circulating virus influence, and stable vaccination effectiveness, the forecasted ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week34, 2024) are 785.
