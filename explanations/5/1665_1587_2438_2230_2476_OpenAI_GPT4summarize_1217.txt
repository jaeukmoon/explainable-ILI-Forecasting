1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating trend with weeks of increase and decline. Starting from 1665 (Week 38, 2021), there was a decrease to 1587 (Week 39, 2021), followed by a significant jump to 2438 (Week 40, 2021). The value slightly decreased to 2230 (Week 41, 2021) but rose again to 2476 (Week 42, 2021). The overall pattern indicates instability, with a notable rise in ILI activity occurring by Week 40 and sustaining through Week 42.
2. A positive relationship between the past and future ILI occurrences is observed. The significant increase during Week 40, 2021, through Week 42, 2021, aligns with the higher future ILI occurrence of 2652 observed 5 weeks later. The sustained activity in Weeks 40–42 serves as an indication of an amplified trend culminating in elevated cases.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently declined in percentage, reaching 1.8% by Week 42, 2021, below the national baseline. Despite lower percentages, the stable or declining trend may still reflect increasing absolute case numbers seen in the time-series data, indicating underlying susceptibility or other respiratory factors.
4. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently accounted for a high number of deaths—20.9% in Week 38, declining to 16.5% by Week 42, 2021—well above the epidemic threshold. This persistent PIC-related mortality highlights elevated co-circulation of respiratory illnesses, aligning with the future ILI increase.
5. The impact of healthcare-seeking behavior shifts, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, has disrupted traditional ILI reporting and interpretation during Weeks 38–42, 2021. These changes likely delayed accurate surveillance, contributing to an apparent surge in ILI cases observed in the future.
6. Low influenza activity (e.g., 0.1% positivity in Week 38–42, 2021), coupled with the co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens, suggests the increase in ILI occurrences involves non-influenza illnesses. Laboratory-confirmed influenza remained minimal, while broader respiratory infection trends likely influenced the spike in future ILI numbers.
7. In summary, the future occurrences of 2652 ILI cases can be explained by the notable increase in Weeks 40–42, 2021, sustained PIC-related mortality, underlying growth in respiratory illness trends despite low flu activity, and the pandemic’s impact on care-seeking behaviors and data reporting.
