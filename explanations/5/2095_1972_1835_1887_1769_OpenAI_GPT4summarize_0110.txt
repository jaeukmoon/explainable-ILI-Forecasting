1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week15 to Week19, 2024, show a consistent decreasing trend: 2095, 1972, 1835, 1887, and 1769. This steady decline indicates a reduction in influenza-like illness activity over the weeks, with a minor fluctuation in Week18 (1887) before continuing downward. Overall, the trajectory highlights diminishing ILI activity rather than fluctuations or increases.
2. Week24, 2024 falls within the off-season for influenza activity, as per historical patterns in the U.S. (Week9 to Week30), with the absence of indications of increased positivity or significant novel outbreaks in the preceding weeks. Low outpatient ILI percentages, declining influenza positivity rates, and the national trend all confirm off-season timing.
3. Historical trends indicate a steady decline that projects Week24 ILI activity toward much lower levels compared to Week19. With a consistent downtrend in past counts and reduced positivity rates nationwide, the estimated occurrences align with typical off-season activity, forecasting 924 as the expected value.
4. Influenza positivity rates have continually fallen from Week15 (5.9%) to Week19 (2.4%) (Week15, 2024 #1; Week16, 2024 #1; Week17, 2024 #1; Week18, 2024 #1; Week19, 2024 #1), showing no signs of resurgence.
5. Vaccination efforts remain consistent, with well-matched vaccines and maintained antiviral effectiveness. No significant changes in vaccination coverage are observed (Week15, 2024 #9; Week16, 2024 #9; Week17, 2024 #6; Week18, 2024 #8; Week19, 2024 #10). This reduces the likelihood of upward spikes in activity.
6. Co-circulating viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, persist (Week15, 2024 #8; Week16, 2024 #10; Week17, 2024 #7; Week18, 2024 #10; Week19, 2024 #9), but their stable behavior aligns with typical off-season trends, further validating low ILI counts.
7. Combining the downward trend in ILI occurrences, off-season classification for Week24, stable influenza positivity decreases, protective vaccination impacts, and low nationwide outpatient visits, the forecast of 924 occurrences is justified. Reduced seasonality ensures low ILI counts in this off-season timeline, supported by all provided data points.
