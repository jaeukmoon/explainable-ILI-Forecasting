1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistently downward trend, with values of ['13026', '13095', '12870', '12523', '12011']. There was a slight increase between Week17, 2023 (13026) and Week18, 2023 (13095), but subsequent weeks revealed a steady decline, reaching the lowest value of 12011 in Week21, 2023. This overall decreasing trend indicates a reduced intensity of ILI activity by the end of the 5-week observed period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the declining trend in past ILI occurrences contrasts with the sharp drop to 8099 occurrences observed 5 weeks later. The continuous decrease over Weeks 18–21, 2023, signals a consistent reduction in ILI activity, which aligns with the significantly lower future values recorded.
3. ILI outpatient visits remained stable or minimally fluctuated across all 5 weeks, consistently below the national baseline of 2.5% (e.g., 2.0% in Weeks 17, 18, 20, and 1.9% in Weeks 19, 21), reflecting ongoing minimal ILI activity across reporting periods, which correlates with subdued future occurrences. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained just above epidemic thresholds but declined from 7.3% (Week17, 2023) to 6.5% (Week20, 2023), suggesting reduced respiratory disease severity contributing to lower ILI trends. The generally low percentage of influenza-positive specimens reported (e.g., 1.0%, 0.9%, 1.2% across clinical labs) indicates little contribution from influenza activity to ILI occurrences.
4. Minimal influenza circulation was observed, with Influenza B dominating over Influenza A in most weeks. Variants matched the seasonal vaccine strains, alongside widespread antiviral susceptibility, reducing the potential for increased illness severity. Additionally, the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, RSV) likely suppressed influenza's contribution to ILI while complicating data interpretation, thus explaining lower values in future occurrences.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 8099 reflect the compounding effect of a consistent downward trend in past ILI data, stable yet minimal outpatient ILI visits below baseline, and low influenza positivity. Other contributing factors include declining PIC mortality percentages and effective vaccine-virus antigenic match alongside stable antiviral susceptibilities, signaling reduced respiratory illness severity and aligned with continued low ILI activity.
