1. The reported ILI counts from Week4 to Week8, 2022 are 1539, 1125, 1111, 1182, and 1261. The trend shows an initial sharp decline from Week4 (1539) to Week5 (1125) followed by a stabilization with minor fluctuations between Week6 (1111), Week7 (1182), and Week8 (1261). Overall, the ILI occurrences indicate a general decline early on with slight increases later, suggesting sporadic activity rather than sustained growth.
2. In the U.S., Week13, 2022 falls outside the typical peak season (Week46 through Week6) and aligns with the off-season, characterized by minimal influenza activity and reduced ILI trends. Given the consistently low positivity rates and sporadic influenza activity, Week13, 2022 is classified as part of the off-season.
3. From a time series perspective, the ILI activity over the past five weeks showed no significant spikes and stabilized after initial declines. Projecting these observations forward to Week13, 2022, the pattern suggests low activity similar to Week8, 2022. Based on this, the model predicts ILI occurrences of 2021 as a continuation of slight fluctuations around this range.
4. Low vaccination uptake compared to previous seasons (Week4, 2022 #6; Week5, 2022 #8; Week7, 2022 #8) has limited population immunity, potentially allowing sporadic rises in activity without triggering significant spikes.
5. Influenza A(H3N2), which constitutes the majority of circulating strains, shows some antigenic differences from the vaccine strain, reducing vaccine effectiveness (Week5, 2022 #10; Week6, 2022 #10; Week8, 2022 #8). However, its consistent dominance limits the emergence of new ILI-driving strains.
6. Sporadic influenza activity persists, with positivity rates for influenza remaining low (Week4, 2022 #1; Week6, 2022 #1; Week8, 2022 #1). Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 co-infections, while present, remain relatively minor (Week4, 2022 #8; Week5, 2022 #7; Week8, 2022 #6), indicating no significant additional burden on ILI trends.
7. Combining the observed stable ILI trends, off-season classification, low vaccine uptake, antigenic mismatches in dominant strains, and sporadic activity levels, the predicted ILI occurrences of 2021 for Week13, 2022 are consistent with the continuation of low influenza impact and limited variation in respiratory illness activity.
