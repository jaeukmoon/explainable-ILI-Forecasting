1. The past ILI occurrences from Week22 to Week26, 2021, are 1831, 1929, 2198, 2162, and 2237. The trend indicates a steady increase from Week22 (1831) to Week24 (2198), followed by a slight fluctuation with a decrease in Week25 (2162) and a minor rebound in Week26 (2237). Overall, this is a moderately increasing and slightly fluctuating trend over the given weeks.
2. Week31, 2021, falls within the off-season because U.S. off-season typically spans from the end of the most recent peak season (Week01) to the next peak onset season (starting Week32 or later). Given the consistently minimal influenza activity reported below baseline across Weeks22–26, 2021, and no significant signs of emerging peak activity, Week31, 2021 aligns most closely with the off-season period.
3. Projecting forward using time-series analysis, the historical steady increases in ILI occurrences with slight fluctuations suggest a continuation of this pattern. A gradual increase over five weeks is expected as ILI activity trends upward, influenced by minor seasonal factors and co-infections. Thus, the future ILI occurrence of 3108 for Week31, 2021, reflects this projection of moderate growth from recent values.
4. Across Weeks22–26, 2021, influenza activity remained extremely low nationwide, with ILI outpatient visits consistently at 1.2%, far below the national baseline of 2.6% (Week22, 2021 #1; Week23, 2021 #1; Week24, 2021 #1; Week25, 2021 #3; Week26, 2021 #3). This indicates that influenza alone is unlikely to significantly elevate near-term ILI activity.
5. Co-infection trends, specifically COVID-19 dominating PIC deaths (Week22, 2021 #3; Week23, 2021 #4; Week24, 2021 #5; Week25, 2021 #5; Week26, 2021 #4), amplify respiratory illness encounters, including ILI diagnoses. This dynamic interaction between conditions drives a moderate rise in reported ILI cases.
6. The ongoing impacts of behavioral changes in healthcare-seeking influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic (Week22, 2021 #7; Week23, 2021 #8; Week24, 2021 #7; Week25, 2021 #8; Week26, 2021 #6) contribute to altered ILI data trends and a higher likelihood of a gradual increase. Reporting inconsistencies further complicate the interpretation.
7. The prediction of future ILI occurrences (3108) is driven by combining the recent gradual upward trend in ILI reports, the off-season classification for Week31, 2021, the impact of COVID-19 on total respiratory illness visits, and healthcare-seeking dynamics. While baseline influenza activity remains minimal, the interplay with other respiratory illnesses supports the anticipated increase over the coming weeks.
