1. The past ILI occurrences from Week23 to Week27, 2024, show a clear declining trend: 1685, 1476, 1397, 1268, and 1015. This consistent decrease over the five weeks indicates reduced ILI activity without any significant spikes or fluctuations.
2. Week32, 2024, falls into the peak onset season, as it aligns with the period from Week32 to Week46 when influenza activity typically begins increasing from its off-season baseline toward higher levels. This classification aligns with patterns in historical seasonal cycles in the U.S.
3. Time-series analysis of the provided ILI data indicates an ongoing reduction in occurrences. Extrapolating this pattern forward would suggest continued decreases initially. However, given that Week32 enters the peak onset season, historical trends suggest a potential slowing of the decline or stabilization near the predicted value of 790, reflecting early increases in activity associated with the transition to this new phase.
4. Influenza activity remains low, with clinical lab positivity declining from 1.6% in Week23 (2024) (#1) to 0.9% in Week27 (2024) (#1). This declining positivity correlates with the observed downward trend in ILI occurrences (#1).
5. A high proportion of Influenza A (especially A(H3N2)) has dominated positivity in recent weeks (Week23 to Week27). While no significant changes in antiviral resistance or vaccine efficacy were reported, the CDC highlights the importance of monitoring novel variants such as A(H1N2)v in Week25 (#7) or A(H5N1) in Week26 (#8), which could influence future trends.
6. Co-circulation of influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 continues across the U.S., with overlapping respiratory illnesses contributing to ILI patterns (#9, Week23–Week27). Despite this, cocirculation influence has remained minimal due to low overall activity.
7. The predicted ILI occurrence of 790 for Week32, 2024, reflects the ongoing decline observed in prior weeks, tempered by the potential stabilization or early increases typical of the peak onset season. The low positivity rates, manageable viral co-circulation, and absence of major resistance trends align with this projection, while sustained monitoring remains critical heading into a period of increased influenza activity.
