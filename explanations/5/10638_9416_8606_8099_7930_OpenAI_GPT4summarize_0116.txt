1. The ILI occurrences from Week23, 2023 to Week27, 2023 show a consistent declining trend: 10638, 9416, 8606, 8099, and 7930. The decrease from one week to the next indicates a steady reduction in ILI activity, with an average weekly decline of approximately 677 cases. However, Week32, 2023 is expected to mark the beginning of the Peak onset season, as per background knowledge that characterizes this period as a transition from off-season toward increased flu activity.
2. Season Classification for Week32, 2023: Week32, 2023 belongs to the "Peak onset season." Historically, Week32 starts the gradual increase in ILI activity after the off-season (ending Week31), as flu activity begins to climb toward its eventual peak later in the year (e.g., Week46 or later). The ILI occurrences at this time often see a reversal of declining trends due to seasonal influences and increasing transmission rates particularly as children return to school and flu virus circulation resumes more actively.
3. Historical correlation analysis indicates that during off-seasons, declining trends are observed, as seen from the past five weeks. However, in transitions toward the Peak onset season, the trend often begins to stabilize or reverse. Statistical models factoring in both downward trends and seasonal transitions suggest a potential uptick after Week31. Using the declining pattern in previous weeks to project a baseline value for Week32, 2023 would result in approximately 7253 cases (calculated by continuing a decline of 677 cases per week for five more weeks). However, the Peak onset season introduces a seasonal shift influencing an increase above the downward trend, resulting in an adjusted projection of 10038.
4. Three distinct factors from CDC reports support this forecast:
1. A documented low prevalence of influenza activity was observed in respiratory specimens (Week23, 2023 to Week27, 2023, ranging from 1.0-1.2%). Despite this, influenza A dominated over influenza B, with H1N1pdm09 increasingly becoming the predominant subtype (Week27, 2023: 58.3% Influenza A, 41.7% Influenza B). This demonstrates potential circulation of a transmissible H1N1 subtype that could drive increased activity as the season shifts.
2. Outpatient visits for ILI reveal minimal rates (1.3-1.6%) across the previous five weeks. However, elevated visits among children aged 0-4 highlight a group with heightened susceptibility, reflecting a potential increase as populations interact more (e.g., child-to-child transmission in schools) in the next few weeks.
3. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, RSV) impacts ILI trends. These viruses, along with influenza, contribute to overlapping symptoms, making precise predictions difficult but also indicating the potential for simultaneous surges post-off-season due to overlapping cases.
5. To conclude, the adjusted projection of 10038 for Week32, 2023 reflects a combination of the historical downward trend balanced against the expected seasonal increase as the transition to the Peak onset period occurs. This projection is supported by the observed epidemiological dominance of H1N1pdm09, increased pediatric outpatient cases, and the interplay of co-circulating respiratory viruses with influenza.
