1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent decline from 16964 (Week 52, 2021) to 3606 (Week 4, 2022), indicating a downward trend in ILI activity. This steady decrease in reported occurrences suggests that influenza activity may have peaked in Week 52, 2021, and gradually subsided over the subsequent weeks.
2. A negative correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences, as the declining trend in ILI occurrences over Weeks 52, 2021, to 4, 2022, aligns with a further drop to 2576 future occurrences after 5 weeks (predicted for Week 9, 2022). This reduction reflects a continuation of the downward trend seen in the latter weeks of the past data.
3. Several summarized CDC report observations indicate factors influencing the future ILI decline:
4. - Influenza positivity rates steadily declined from 3.8% (Week 52, 2021) to 1.7% (Week 4, 2022), reflecting reduced viral transmission during this period.
5. - Outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses decreased significantly from 4.8% (Week 52, 2021) to 2.0% (Week 4, 2022), indicating diminishing respiratory activity.
6. - Hospitalization rates showed slowing increases, reaching 4.4 per 100,000 by Week 4, 2022, suggesting the burden of severe cases was stabilizing.
7. - Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2, complicating ILI trends, persisted but contributed less to overall ILI trends by Week 4, 2022.
4. Reduced vaccination uptake compared to previous seasons, reported consistently across these weeks, likely allowed for some level of ongoing transmission. However, the predominance of A(H3N2) strains genetically related to vaccine strains, despite some antigenic differences, may have constrained more aggressive viral spread.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 2576 (Week 9, 2022) are attributable to the downward trajectory of past ILI trends, declining positivity and outpatient rates, stabilization in hospitalization rates, and the effects of co-circulating viruses and partially effective vaccination coverage. These factors collectively led to a sustained decrease in ILI activity over the observed and predicted period.
