1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show a consistent downward trend, with values of ['15338' (Week10, 2024), '15334' (Week11, 2024), '14964' (Week12, 2024), '13834' (Week13, 2024), and '13338' (Week14, 2024)]. The decrease is steady, with the largest drop occurring between Week12 and Week13, suggesting a declining pattern of ILI activity during this period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident as the declining trend in the past 5 weeks contrasts with the future occurrence of 12862 (Week19, 2024). Although the decrease has continued through Week14, 2024, the reported lower value of 12862 indicates that the trend has further stabilized, maintaining the decline but at a slower rate, consistent with the waning flu season.
3. A significant reduction in outpatient visits for ILI, from 3.7% in Week10, 2024, to 2.8% in Week14, 2024, aligns with the continued decrease in ILI activity, which corresponds to the drop in future ILI occurrences. Declining positivity rates for respiratory specimens, decreasing from 15.4% in Week10, 2024, to 7.7% in Week14, 2024, reflect the diminishing influenza activity that aligns with the future projection. The reduction in influenza-related deaths from 0.6% (Week11, 2024) to 0.4% (Week14, 2024) highlights improved mortality outcomes, which occur along with fewer severe cases driving ILI decreases. Declining national hospitalization rates, with a cumulative rate increasing from 67.9 per 100,000 (Week10, 2024) to only 76.0 per 100,000 (Week14, 2024), show flu severity lessening during the period, which directly impacts future ILI rates.
4. The overall decline in ILI-related activity, as evident in outpatient visit representation, hospitalization trends, and influenza positivity rates, along with reduced severe influenza outcomes, provides a unified explanation for the decreased future ILI occurrences reported as 12862 (Week19, 2024), reflecting the ongoing resolution of the flu season.
