1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1731', '1685', '1476', '1397', '1268']. Starting from 1731 in Week 22, 2024, ILI occurrences steadily declined week by week, reaching 1268 in Week 26, 2024. This decline reflects a diminishing pattern of ILI activity across this period.
2. A strong negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed. The declining trajectory in ILI activity over Weeks 22–26, 2024, aligns with the subsequent drop to 830 occurrences in Week 31, 2024. The steady decrease in prior weeks appears indicative of the much-lowered future ILI levels.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI declined consistently over the 5 weeks, falling from 1.9% (Week 22, 2024) to 1.4% (Week 26, 2024). This gradual reduction in ILI-related healthcare visits reflects diminishing ILI activity, which correlates with the low future ILI occurrences of 830 after 5 weeks.
4. Low influenza positivity rates were observed, progressively decreasing nationally from 1.8% (Week 22, 2024) to 1.0% (Week 26, 2024). Similarly, hospitalization rates for influenza remained very low, between 0.1–0.2 per 100,000 population throughout the 5-week period. These stable and low indicators represent minimal influenza burden, supporting the reduced future ILI occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (influenza, COVID-19, RSV) remained stable during Weeks 22–26, 2024, with no major shifts in activity. Low antiviral resistance and high vaccine effectiveness were reported for circulating influenza strains, reflecting effective disease control. These conditions contributed to the observed decline in ILI activity and predicted low future levels of 830 occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 830 future ILI occurrences (Week 31, 2024) are attributable to the consistent downward trend in past ILI data, declining outpatient visits for respiratory illness, low hospitalization and positivity rates for influenza, and effective control of respiratory virus co-circulation within Weeks 22–26, 2024, resulting in suppressed influenza-like activity.
