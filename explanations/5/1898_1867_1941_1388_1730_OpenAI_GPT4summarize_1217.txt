1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating trend, with initial values of 1898 (Week52, 2020), followed by a slight decline to 1867 (Week53, 2020). This was succeeded by a peak at 1941 (Week1, 2021), after which values dropped significantly to 1388 (Week2, 2021). The final week (Week3, 2021) displayed a partial recovery to 1730. Overall, despite short-term fluctuations, the trend indicates an overall volatility without a definitive directional pattern over the observed period.
2. The significant decline in ILI occurrences observed in Week2, 2021 (1388), followed by a partial rebound to 1730 in Week3, 2021, suggests potential underreporting or delayed rises in respiratory illness activity. This, combined with no sustained declines, corresponds with the eventual drop in occurrences to the reported future value of 1031, indicating a possible flattening of respiratory illness activity following prior peak fluctuations.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI declined from 1.6% (Week52, 2020) to 1.3% (Week3, 2021), consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%. This decline in healthcare-seeking behavior for flu-like symptoms aligns with the observed decrease in future ILI occurrences to 1031.
4. The proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza remained remarkably low, ranging between 0.1% and 0.4% across Weeks52, 2020 to Week3, 2021. Such minimal positivity rates reflect suppressed influenza transmission, contributing to the drop in future ILI occurrences to 1031.
5. Reports of pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC)-related deaths consistently remained elevated, ranging from 13.6% (Week52, 2020) to 14.8% (Week3, 2021). However, the majority of deaths were linked to COVID-19 rather than influenza, suggesting muted influenza-specific mortality with no significant contribution to future ILI increases.
6. Healthcare-seeking behaviors were significantly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic throughout the 5-week period. These behavioral changes complicate ILI surveillance, potentially resulting in suppressed reporting and reduced outpatient ILI cases, evidenced by the drop to 1031 future occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 1031 future ILI occurrences (Week8, 2021) can be attributed to sustained low influenza positivity rates, declining outpatient visits for ILI, heightened COVID-19-driven disruption in healthcare and reporting behaviors, high PIC-related mortality dominated by COVID-19, and the overall volatility in prior weeks’ ILI activities with no consistent upward trajectory observed. These factors collectively explain the observed decrease in future ILI data.
