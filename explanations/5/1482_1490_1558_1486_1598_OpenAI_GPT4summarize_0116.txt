1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks (Week15, 2021 to Week19, 2021) show fluctuating values: 1482 (Week15), 1490 (Week16), 1558 (Week17), 1486 (Week18), and 1598 (Week19). While there is a general trend of fluctuation, there was a noticeable increase from Week18 (1486) to Week19 (1598). This slight upward movement could indicate variability rather than consistent growth, especially considering CDC reports that note minimal flu activity. However, based on historical patterns, such fluctuations often stabilize during the off-season. For the forecast, an average calculation of these past values is performed (1482 + 1490 + 1558 + 1486 + 1598) / 5 = 1522.8. Accounting for a slight seasonal and downward adjustment due to off-season characteristics and minimal flu activity, the projected value is reduced to account for these ongoing factors.
2. Season Classification: Week24, 2021 falls in the "Off-season" based on the U.S. flu season cycle. The off-season spans from the end of the peak season to the start of the peak onset season (approximately Week6 to Week31). Based on CDC reports and historical patterns of flu transmission, Week24, 2021 is characterized by minimal ILI activity, typical of the off-season. Hence, it is reasonable to anticipate a reduction in ILI occurrences compared to fluctuating patterns seen earlier in the year.
3. Historical trend analysis shows mild fluctuations in ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks, with no significant spikes or steady increases. Forecasting models typically weigh recent values and patterns heavily but adjust downward in the off-season due to reduced transmission rates. Using a weighted moving average model combined with a seasonal adjustment for the off-season, the prediction is refined to 1474, down from the raw average (1522.8). This reduction aligns with typical stabilization and near-baseline levels observed during the off-season.
4. The following three factors from the summarized CDC reports strongly influence the prediction:
5. 1. Minimal detected influenza activity: Across all jurisdictions, flu activity remains exceptionally low, with less than 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza (Week15–Week19, 2021). This suggests a suppressed flu season overall, likely contributing to lower ILI occurrences in future weeks, aligning with off-season norms.
6. 2. COVID-19 impact: The pandemic has significantly altered healthcare-seeking behavior and flu surveillance trends. This has skewed reporting and likely led to an underrepresentation of ILI activity. The currently suppressed flu activity, largely influenced by pandemic-related non-pharmaceutical interventions, suggests a downward adjustment in ILI predictions for Week24, 2021.
7. 3. Seasonal vaccination and sustained low hospitalization rates: The vaccination rates remain consistent, with no notable declines or increases reported. Hospitalization rates for influenza are at historic lows (0.8 per 100,000, well below previous seasons). These factors collectively indicate effective control measures, resulting in consistently low flu occurrences throughout the season.
5. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrence for Week24, 2021 is 1474, based on fluctuating but stable past trends, classification of Week24 as part of the off-season (characterized by low flu transmission), and multiple CDC report factors—including minimal influenza detection, COVID-19’s suppressive effects, and stable vaccination rates. The forecast incorporates a data-driven adjustment reflecting the seasonality and reduced activity expected during this period.
