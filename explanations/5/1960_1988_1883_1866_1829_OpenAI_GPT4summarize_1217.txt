1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over 5 weeks showed a steady decline, starting from 1960 (Week14, 2023) to 1829 (Week18, 2023). The week-by-week values decreased from 1960 to 1988, followed by a further drop to 1883 in Week16, 2023, 1866 in Week17, 2023, and finally 1829 in Week18, 2023. This consistent downward trend reflects a gradual reduction in ILI activity over the observed period.
2. A negative correlation between past time-series and future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks is apparent, as the steady decline in past data did not align with the reported future ILI value of 1098 (Week23, 2023). The persistent drop in ILI activity through Weeks14–18 does not directly predict the sharp decrease seen after 5 weeks, suggesting other external or compounding factors influenced future values.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below the national baseline of 2.5%, decreasing from 2.1% (Week14, 2023) to 2.0% by Week18, 2023. This sustained low outpatient visit rate aligns with the overall decline in ILI occurrences and potentially contributed to the future reduction.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained above epidemic thresholds, ranging from 7.6% in Week14 to 6.9% in Week18, 2023. Despite being above epidemic levels, the gradual decline in PIC mortality over 5 weeks reflects improving respiratory illness trends, aligning with reduced ILI occurrences in both past and future weeks.
5. Seasonal influenza activity remained low throughout Weeks14–18, 2023, with influenza positivity declining from 1.0% (Week14, 2023) to 0.9% (Week18, 2023). This stable and minimal viral activity, coupled with effective vaccination rates and high antiviral susceptibility, likely contributed to the sharp drop in future ILI values to 1098.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1098 (Week23, 2023) can be attributed to the consistent 5-week downward trend in past ILI data, low outpatient visits for ILI, declining PIC mortality, and minimal influenza viral activity. These factors collectively reflect a stable to declining respiratory illness environment, resulting in a significant future reduction.
