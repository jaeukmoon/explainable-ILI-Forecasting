1. The ILI occurrences from Week26, 2024 to Week30, 2024 demonstrate an initial drop from 1268 (Week26, 2024) to 874 (Week29, 2024), followed by a minor uptick to 930 (Week30, 2024). This trend reflects a consistent decline over four weeks succeeded by a stabilization and slight increase. Overall, the pattern suggests low activity with marginal fluctuations rather than a continuous rise or sharp drop.
2. In the U.S., the off-season spans from the end of the peak season until the peak onset season, typically concluding in Week30-31. Week35, 2024 aligns with the transition to the peak onset season, characterized by a gradual increase in influenza activity leading toward higher levels in subsequent weeks.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the consistent decline from Week26 to Week29, followed by a minor increase in Week30, suggests stabilization at lower levels of ILI occurrences. Projecting forward five weeks under this trend indicates a gradual near-term rise as activity transitions into the peak onset season. This pattern forecasts a settled count of 797 at Week35, 2024, reflecting the seasonal shift.
4. Positivity rates for influenza remain extremely low throughout the five weeks, ranging from 1.0% in Week26, 2024 to 0.7% in Week30, 2024. This demonstrates limited viral circulation, aligning with the off-season but indicating potential preparation for gradual increases (Week26-30, 2024 #1, #2, #6).
5. The strong antigenic similarity between circulating influenza strains and vaccines enhances preventative efforts. With minimal resistance to antiviral treatment detected, control measures remain effective, further mitigating rapid increases despite co-circulating viruses (Week26-30, 2024 #7, #9, #10).
6. Continued co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, such as RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and avian influenza A(H5), influences the overall respiratory illness landscape. Although not significant enough to substantially elevate ILI occurrences during the transition period, vigilance is warranted for an increase nearer to the peak onset season (Week26-30, 2024 #10, #11).
7. Given the past ILI downward trend and stabilization, the gradual seasonal shift into the peak onset season, low influenza positivity rates, effective vaccinations, and co-circulation trends, the forecast of 797 ILI occurrences by Week35, 2024 is consistent with these conditions.
