1. The reported ILI counts from Week26 to Week30, 2024 are 2039, 1799, 2285, 2234, and 2362. The trend initially dropped between Week26 (2039) and Week27 (1799), followed by an increase from Week28 (2285) and Week30 (2362). Overall, this pattern indicates a mild upward trend after an early dip, suggesting potential growth in ILI occurrences post-Week30, 2024.
2. The target week (Week35, 2024) falls within the peak onset season, as it aligns with the expected start of this period (Week32-Week46, 2024) in the U.S., and the ILI activity has begun to show mild increases in the past weeks, indicating the transition from off-season to peak onset season.
3. The time-series analysis suggests a slight growth following the stabilization between Week28 and Week30, 2024. Projecting forward using this increasing pattern, a significant rise aligns with historical trends of activity increasing during the peak onset season. Thus, the occurrence of 3954 cases in Week35, 2024 represents this progression.
4. While influenza activity remains low currently, the co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as influenza, RSV, and COVID-19 continues to pose challenges (Week26, 2024 #10; Week28, 2024 #10; Week30, 2024 #6). This may exacerbate ILI occurrence as conditions shift into the peak onset season.
5. Despite low positivity rates, novel influenza risks, such as A(H5N1) infections, have been consistently reported in past weeks (Week26, 2024 #8; Week28, 2024 #8; Week29, 2024 #6). These zoonotic developments may elevate surveillance needs and contribute to increased illness reports if further outbreaks occur.
6. Current ILI outpatient visits remain below baseline but show a slight upward trend (Week26, 2024 #5; Week29, 2024 #5; Week30, 2024 #3), aligning with the recent increase in reported occurrences. This suggests an approaching seasonal shift consistent with peak onset activity.
7. The projected 3954 ILI cases for Week35, 2024 are justified by the emerging upward trend in ILI counts, the timing within the peak onset season, co-circulating respiratory viruses, rising outpatient respiratory illness visits, and emerging zoonotic threats. These factors collectively drive the forecasted increase.
