1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a clear upward trend, with values of ['1910', '1936', '2164', '2131', '2388']. Starting at 1910 in Week 31, 2021, the occurrences showed consistent increases, reaching 2388 by Week 35, 2021. This steady rise in ILI activity suggests escalating respiratory illness cases by the end of the observed period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the persistent increase toward 2388 in Week 35, 2021, aligns with the significant rise to 2438 reported after 5 weeks (Week 40, 2021). This continuity indicates that the upward momentum in ILI cases during Weeks 31–35, 2021, carried forward into subsequent weeks, contributing to future occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI rose incrementally each week, reaching 2.2% by Week 34, 2021, and consistently approaching but staying below the national baseline of 2.6%. Age-specific spikes in ILI visits, particularly among children aged 0–4 and 5–24, suggest an expanding pool of individuals reporting respiratory illness, which likely contributed to the observed future increase.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to PIC (pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19) increased significantly, reaching 19.4% in Week 34, 2021, well above the epidemic threshold of 5.5%. This ongoing respiratory illness activity signals widespread respiratory infections that further align with the sustained increase in ILI futures.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behavior and surveillance complexities introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted ILI monitoring systems throughout Weeks 31–35, 2021. These disruptions likely resulted in delayed recognition or underreporting of cases, with a subsequent surge reflected in the future value of 2438 occurrences.
6. Minimal influenza virus circulation across Weeks 31–35, 2021, with positivity rates holding at 0.1%, points to a higher contribution of non-influenza respiratory viruses driving the increase in ILI occurrences. Such overlapping illnesses with shared symptoms, coupled with pandemic-related sensitivities, could amplify respiratory illness attributions, explaining the rising future figures.
7. In summary, the reported 2438 future ILI occurrences (Week 40, 2021) are attributable to the upward trend in Weeks 31–35, 2021, incremental increases in ILI-related outpatient visits, elevated PIC mortality well above epidemic thresholds, and non-influenza respiratory viruses. Pandemic-driven healthcare-seeking patterns and reduced surveillance accuracy compounded these factors, resulting in the observed future increase.
