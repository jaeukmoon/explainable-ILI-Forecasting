1. The reported ILI counts from Week19 to Week23, 2024 are 1881, 1698, 1711, 1731, and 1685. This indicates a generally fluctuating but slightly declining trend overall, with a peak at Week19 (1881) followed by a mild decline through Week23 (1685). Despite minor variations, the data reflects a broader stabilization around lower levels, consistent with off-season dynamics.
2. Forecasting the target Week28, 2024, aligns with the U.S. off-season classification. By Week23, 2024, the Nation was well beyond the peak season window and remained in the off-season, with persistent low positivity rates and outpatient visits below baseline levels. Seasonal expectations and historical patterns confirm that Week28, 2024 is within the off-season.
3. Extrapolating from the slightly declining but stable ILI pattern from Week19 to Week23, 2024, the time-series model projects that Week28, 2024 will reflect continued stabilization at reduced levels. The low ILI counts signify a return to baseline activity typical of the off-season, which leads to an estimated ILI occurrence of 1025.
4. Nationwide influenza activity remains low, with influenza positivity rates steadily decreasing from 2.4% in Week19, 2024 to 1.6% in Week23, 2024. This downward trend demonstrates sustained minimal viral transmission levels during the off-season, supporting a low forecast.
5. The influenza vaccine remains effective, with circulating virus strains matching the vaccine components (Week21, 2024 #10; Week22, 2024 #13). Stable antiviral susceptibility, with no significant resistance trends reported (Week21, 2024 #11; Week22, 2024 #8), further aids in keeping ILI occurrences suppressed.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, persist as contributing factors to overall respiratory illnesses (Week19, 2024 #9; Week20, 2024 #10; Week22, 2024 #10). However, none have shown a sharp increase or novel evolution that would significantly elevate ILI rates (Week23, 2024 #7; Week22, 2024 #8).
7. Low influenza activity (as seen in stable or decreasing ILI measures), effective vaccination coverage, and the absence of novel viral pressure converge to predict a continuation of declining trends. These align with historical off-season expectations, justifying the projected Week28, 2024 ILI occurrence of 1025.
