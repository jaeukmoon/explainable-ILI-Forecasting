1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a general upward trend, progressing from 1815 (Week 41, 2021) to 2109 (Week 45, 2021). Although there was a slight dip from 1815 in Week 41 to 1785 in Week 42, subsequent weeks experienced consistent increases, reaching the peak value of 2109 in Week 45. This overall rising trend signals heightened respiratory illness activity by Week 45, 2021.
2. A clear positive correlation exists between the increasing ILI occurrences in the latter weeks of the observed period (Weeks 43–45, 2021) and the reported future value of 2313 after 5 weeks (Week 50, 2021). The escalating trajectory in the final weeks of the data set served as a precursor to the amplified ILI occurrences observed in the future period.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a gradual increase over the 5 weeks, rising from 1.8% in Week 41, 2021, to 2.1% in Weeks 44–45, 2021. This steady increase in ILI-related healthcare visits aligns with the growth in ILI cases, supporting the higher future occurrence of 2313.
4. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, decreasing slightly from 17.5% in Week 41, 2021, to 14.4% in Week 45, 2021, but remaining significantly high. The elevated PIC mortality throughout this period reflects intense respiratory illness activity driving the future ILI surge.
5. Increased influenza activity identified through laboratory surveillance, notably with Influenza A(H3N2) dominance, rising from 0.1% positive respiratory specimens in Week 41, 2021, to 0.7% in Week 45, contributes to the subsequent ILI rise. Regional variations like outbreaks among the 5–24 age group particularly support the elevated future occurrences.
6. Multiple respiratory viruses co-circulating alongside influenza (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) complicated traditional ILI trends, potentially inflating respiratory illness encounters and contributing to the observed sharp rise in future ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2313 (Week 50, 2021) are attributed to an overall upward trend in past ILI data, increasing outpatient ILI visits, persistently high PIC mortality rates, a growing prevalence of Influenza A(H3N2) activity, and the compounded effects of co-circulating respiratory pathogens impacting healthcare behaviors and reporting.
