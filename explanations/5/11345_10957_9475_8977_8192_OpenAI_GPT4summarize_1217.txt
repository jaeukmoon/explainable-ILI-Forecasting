1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show a consistent decrease, with values of ['11345', '10957', '9475', '8977', '8192']. The ILI occurrences dropped steadily each week, starting at 11345 in Week 5, 2024, decreasing to 8192 in Week 9, 2024. This sustained decline reflects diminishing ILI activity during this period.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 4433 (Week 14, 2024) shows a continuation of the downward trend observed in the past time-series data. The progressive reduction over Weeks 5–9, 2024, correlates strongly with the lower future value at Week 14, 2024, suggesting that the earlier declining pattern in ILI occurrences persisted over the following weeks.
3. Several factors in the CDC reports align with the decline in future ILI cases. (a) A gradual decrease in the influenza positivity rate among tested specimens, from 15.8% in Week 5, 2024, to 13.9% in Week 9, 2024, indicates diminishing influenza activity. (b) A stable or slightly decreasing percentage of outpatient visits for ILI, which remained above baseline but shifted from 4.5% in Week 7, 2024, to 4.1% in Week 9, 2024. (c) Hospitalization rates for influenza saw only slight increases between Weeks 5–9, 2024, and leveled off at 64.8 per 100,000 by Week 9, 2024, reflecting plateaued severity for observed cases. (d) Mortality attributed to influenza or influenza-associated deaths remained stable at 0.7%–0.8% during Weeks 5–9, 2024, further signaling controlled or waning respiratory illness impact.
4. High co-circulation of respiratory viruses, such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2, persisted throughout Weeks 5–9, 2024. However, their contributions appear to decline in alignment with the reduced ILI trends rather than exacerbating any resurgence. Decreasing co-infections may have contributed to lower future ILI occurrences.
5. The decline to 4433 future ILI occurrences (Week 14, 2024) reflects the consistent downward trend observed in ILI occurrences over Weeks 5–9, 2024, and aligns with key CDC-reported indicators: the reduced influenza positivity rate, stable ILI-related outpatient visit percentages, plateaued hospitalization rates, and controlled mortality trends. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses likely dwindled in severity, further contributing to reduced ILI activity in the subsequent weeks, culminating in the observed future value.
