1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating yet slightly declining trend, with values of ['1770', '1795', '1933', '1847', '1762']. There was an initial increase from 1770 (Week17, 2023) to 1933 (Week19, 2023), which marked the peak. However, the following weeks showed a steady decline, reaching 1762 (Week21, 2023), the lowest value in the 5-week period. This pattern signals diminishing ILI activity by the end of the observed period.
2. A weak negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the downward trajectory observed in the latter weeks of the past data (Weeks20–21, 2023) contrasts with the sharp decrease to 1220 reported after 5 weeks (Week26, 2023). The decline in Weeks20–21 appears to set a precedent for the further reduction in ILI activity observed after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below the national baseline (2.5%) throughout the 5-week period, stabilizing at 1.9–2.0% across Weeks17–21, 2023. This steady low rate of ILI-related healthcare visits reflects diminished respiratory illness activity, aligning with the reduced future ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) hovered close to epidemic thresholds, starting at 7.3% (Week17, 2023), remaining stable at 6.9–7.0% through Weeks18–21, 2023, but failing to exhibit a pronounced spike. The sustained PIC mortality near threshold levels suggests limited upward pressure on future ILI activity.
5. Public health reports emphasized low influenza positivity rates (1.0–1.2% in Weeks17–21, 2023) and stable cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza (62.6 per 100,000, Weeks18–21, 2023). These low viral activity rates, combined with widespread vaccine strain matches and antiviral susceptibility, contributed to the low ILI trends and the subsequent drop to 1220 future occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 1220 future ILI occurrences (Week26, 2023) can be attributed to the overall declining trend in Weeks20–21, 2023, stable and below-baseline ILI outpatient visits, PIC mortality near threshold levels without significant surges, and low influenza positivity rates coupled with effective vaccination and antiviral measures. These combined factors reflect reduced respiratory illness activity, consistent with the declining future ILI reports.
