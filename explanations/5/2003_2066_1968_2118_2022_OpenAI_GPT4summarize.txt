1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating trend without a clear upward or downward pattern, with values of ['2003' (Week 14, 2021), '2066' (Week 15, 2021), '1968' (Week 16, 2021), '2118' (Week 17, 2021), and '2022' (Week 18, 2021)]. A slight alternation was observed as Week 15 saw a rise to 2066 from 2003 in Week 14, followed by a dip to 1968 in Week 16 and another peak at 2118 in Week 17 before dropping marginally to 2022 in Week 18. The overall fluctuations suggest a stable baseline level of ILI activity with minimal escalation over this timeframe.

2. The future ILI occurrences of 1934 (Week 23, 2021) correlate with the relatively stable baseline seen during the previous 5 weeks. The absence of a significant increase or drop in the final weeks of the past time series (Weeks 17 and 18, 2021) aligns with the similarly maintained consistency in ILI occurrences evidenced in Week 23, 2021, showing little deviation from recent activity levels.

3. Several key factors from the summarized CDC reports correlate with the future ILI occurrences. Firstly, outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained at stable percentages (1.1% from Weeks 14–17, 2021 and 1.2% in Week 18, 2021), below the national baseline, reflecting a minimal risk of reporting spikes in ILI. Secondly, influenza positivity rates in clinical labs held steady at exceptionally low levels (0.1%) throughout Weeks 14–18, 2021, markedly minimizing influenza-specific contributions to future ILI trends. Thirdly, minimal ILI activity reported across all jurisdictions during this period further validates the basis for relatively low future occurrences. These stability metrics support the continued low ILI activity seen in Week 23, 2021.

4. In summary, the reported 1934 future ILI occurrences (Week 23, 2021) are attributable to the stable baseline of past ILI occurrences characterized by minimal fluctuations, consistent low outpatient visits for ILI, exceedingly low influenza test positivity rates, and minimal ILI activity in all jurisdictions. These factors collectively reflect the persistently reduced influenza and general respiratory illness activity in the observed period.
