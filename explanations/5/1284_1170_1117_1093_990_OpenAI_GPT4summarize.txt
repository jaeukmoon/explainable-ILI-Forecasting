1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values of ['1284', '1170', '1117', '1093', '990'] spanning Week 2 to Week 6, 2021. This downward trend highlights a steady reduction in ILI activity, dropping by 294 cases from Week 2 to Week 6.

2. Despite the declining trend in past ILI occurrences, the future ILI occurrence of 1099 (Week 11, 2021) corresponds to a slight rebound from the downward trajectory. This increase (by 109 cases compared to Week 6, 2021) could reflect the complex interplay of factors not captured directly in the downward time-series data, such as potential disruptions or delayed effects influencing ILI activity.

3. Minimal influenza activity reported by the CDC across all weeks (less than 0.3% of specimens testing positive) indicates historically low viral circulation, suggesting the ILI occurrences are driven more by non-influenza respiratory illnesses.  
   - Hospitalization rates remained historically low, ranging only from 0.5 to 0.6 per 100,000 population (Week 2 to Week 6, 2021), indicating limited severity in influenza and ILI cases.  
   - PIC mortality rates, though driven primarily by COVID-19, ranged between 14.7% and 22.3% (Week 2 to Week 6, 2021), consistently surpassing epidemic thresholds, reflecting the overlapping impact of respiratory illnesses.  
   - COVID-19 disruptions to healthcare-seeking behavior and data surveillance persisted in all weeks, likely leading to underreported ILI activity in the earlier weeks and influencing the observed future rebound.  

4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1099 in Week 11, 2021, can be explained by the decelerating past week trends, potential leveling off of ILI activity influenced by minimal influenza activity, persistent COVID-19 disruptions, and PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds. These factors interplay to suggest stabilization or slight increases in ILI occurrences after the initial decline.
