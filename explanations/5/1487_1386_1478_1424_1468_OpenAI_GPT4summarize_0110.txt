1. The reported ILI counts from Week26 to Week30, 2023 are 1487, 1386, 1478, 1424, and 1468. These show a relatively stable pattern with minor fluctuations rather than any significant upward or downward trend. This stability over the past five weeks sets the basis for a modestly increasing projection.
2. Based on U.S. seasonality patterns, Week35, 2023 aligns with the onset of the Peak onset season. This period is characterized by an early rise in ILI activity, often beginning at a slower pace as community transmission starts to increase.
3. When analyzing trends, the stable observations seen in Weeks26 through 30, 2023, suggest baseline ILI occurrences. However, considering the seasonal shift into the Peak onset season, ILI occurrences are expected to show a gradual increase, which matches historical patterns from off-season to Peak onset season activity. This trend aligns with predictions of 4133 ILI cases for five weeks ahead, indicating a projected amplification of ILI activity.
4. Hospitalization trends remain significant, as admissions relatively decreased but still indicate continued influenza-related cases (e.g., 807 in Week26, 689 in Week28, and 649 in Week30). These trends suggest ongoing influenza circulation paired with potential growth during the Peak onset season.
5. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, adds to background respiratory illnesses and increases outpatient visits for ILI. Reports in Week26 through Week30, 2023 consistently identified co-circulating pathogens contributing to nationwide ILI counts, even as influenza positivity stayed low.
6. Limited increases in Influenza A (H1N1) dominance and novel influenza cases (e.g., H3v and H1N2v in Week30, 2023) align with concerns of seasonal variability impacting ILI occurrences, especially during transitional periods. These factors can lead to higher counts as new variants circulate and immunity wanes.
7. In summary, the stable baseline counts seen in Weeks26 to 30, 2023, the Peak onset classification for Week35, the seasonal upward trend, ongoing hospitalizations, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and observed Influenza A (H1N1) dominance collectively justify the forecasted value of 4133 ILI occurrences. This figure represents a reasonable increase as ILI activity transitions into the seasonal Peak onset phase.
