1. The reported ILI counts from Week13 to Week17, 2021 are 1176, 1464, 1435, 1358, and 1759. The data shows an initial increase from Week13 (1176) to Week14 (1464), a slight dip during Week15 (1435) and Week16 (1358), and a significant rise in Week17 (1759). The overall pattern suggests mild fluctuations with a notable spike in the latest week.
2. Week22, 2021 falls within the off-season, as it occurs well after the typical peak season (which ends by Week6) and before the peak onset season (starting roughly Week32). Supporting this classification are the exceptionally low influenza activity levels reported nationwide during Week13 to Week17, 2021.
3. Time-series analysis highlights a period of fluctuations with a significant rise in ILI activity by Week17 (1759). Accounting for this upward trend and projecting forward over five weeks, the model anticipates continued moderate growth, leading to an estimated count of 1817 ILI occurrences in Week22, 2021. This is consistent with past fluctuation patterns and aligns with time-series forecasting.
4. Influenza activity remains historically low, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza during Weeks13-17, 2021. This low positivity signals limited potential for widespread outbreaks in the short term.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior continues to be influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to potential underreporting and altered interpretation of ILI surveillance trends. This dynamic is noted across Weeks13-17, 2021 and contributes to the projected moderate increases without drastic spikes.
6. Vaccination trends and effectiveness were stable, with no significant updates during Weeks13-17, 2021. Annual vaccination remains ongoing and recommended by the CDC, providing a level of preventive coverage against influenza spread.
7. Combining these observations—recent mild fluctuations, off-season classification, minimal influenza positivity, pandemic-altered healthcare behaviors, and stable vaccination trends—the projection for Week22, 2021 logically estimates 1817 ILI occurrences, reflecting continued moderate growth from the recent Week17 spike without major outbreak escalation.
