1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating pattern with an overall decline after peaking in Week35, 2024. Starting at 11971 in Week33, 2024, ILI occurrences increased through Week34 and Week35 (14072, 15539) before dropping to 14753 and further to 13311 in Week37, 2024. This downward trend in Weeks 36 and 37 signals a reduction in ILI activity moving into Week38.
2. A correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, with the decline in the latter weeks (Weeks 36–37, 2024) serving as a precursor to the stabilization at a moderately high occurrence of 13545 after 5 weeks (Week43, 2024). The future value reflects a plateau rather than a sharp increase, aligning with the leveling activity observed in the trends of the last two weeks of the past data.
3. Stable outpatient ILI visit percentages at 1.8% in Week35–37, 2024, reflect consistent respiratory illness reporting, supporting the moderate future occurrence of 13545. Minimal influenza positivity rates (0.4%) in clinical samples across all 5 weeks signal suppression of large-scale flu amplification. Stable but low antiviral resistance and effective vaccine matches (Week33–37, 2024) limit further escalation of ILI activity. Co-circulation of RSV and SARS-CoV-2, documented in Week36 and Week37, 2024, may have subtly amplified respiratory illness during this period without significantly disrupting the overall downward trend.
4. The steady drop in ILI occurrences in Week36 and Week37, 2024, combined with stable outpatient visit percentages and low influenza-associated hospitalization rates, aligns with the moderate occurrence of 13545 in Week43, 2024. Preventative measures, including vaccination and low antiviral resistance, further mitigate any sharp increase in ILI activity. Co-circulating respiratory viruses may contribute to the observed plateau, but their impact is limited given the consistently low activity metrics.
5. In conclusion, the reported 13545 ILI occurrences in Week43, 2024, are tied to a combination of the declining trend in Weeks 36–37, consistent respiratory illness visit rates below baseline, low hospitalization and mortality rates, well-matched vaccines, and limited burden from co-circulating respiratory pathogens. These factors collectively contribute to a stabilized outcome in future data without significant surges in activity.
