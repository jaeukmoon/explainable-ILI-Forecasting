1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week22, 2024 to Week26, 2024) show a clear decreasing trend. Starting at 1757 in Week22, ILI occurrences sequentially declined to 1636, 1587, 1425, and then 1405 by Week26. The weekly decrease slowed over time, with the reduction between consecutive weeks as follows: from Week22 to Week23 (-121), Week23 to Week24 (-49), Week24 to Week25 (-162), and Week25 to Week26 (-20). This gradual tapering in the rate of decline suggests a stabilization trend as occurrences approach a baseline level.
2. Forecasting target Week31, 2024, belongs to the "Off-season." According to background knowledge, Week31 falls within the interseasonal period (or off-season) between the peak season and peak onset season. This timeframe typically exhibits lower ILI activity, consistent with CDC reports indicating minimal influenza activity nationwide during past weeks. This classification further supports stabilization or slight increases rather than dramatic spikes or drops.
3. The correlation analysis between historical trends and future projections indicates that the data aligns with a baseline seasonal fluctuation during the off-season. Using the past 5 weeks’ ILI occurrences as reference, ILI trends appear to be stabilizing. Applying a moving average calculation (e.g., [(1757+1636+1587+1425+1405)/5 = 1562]), we observe that the average reflects the overall downward trend but requires adjustment for the slowing rate of decline as stabilization is reached. Incorporating this pattern suggests a minor rise by Week31 due to baseline fluctuations, revising the forecast to 1509 by considering the slowed rate of change.
4. Three key factors from the CDC reports influence the forecast quantitatively:
1. Influenza activity has been consistently low for the past five weeks (Week22 to Week26), with influenza positivity rates declining from 1.8% (Week22) to 1.0% (Week26). This gradual drop in positivity rates aligns with the stabilization trend in regional ILI data, minimizing the likelihood of significant activity surges. Quantitatively, this suggests increasing proximity to baseline ILI levels, informing the relatively modest adjustment to 1509.
2. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, has been stable with no major outbreaks. The presence of low co-circulating activity implies no external disruptions (e.g., new variants or surges) capable of significantly shifting the baseline, reinforcing stabilization predictions. This factor further informs the estimate, reducing the likelihood of a drop below typical off-season baselines near Week31.
3. Vaccination effectiveness and preventive measures, highlighted for their antigenic match to circulating strains, suggest greater control over influenza spread. With high vaccine compatibility for Influenza A and B, and antiviral resistance stability, containment reinforces minimal growth at near-baseline ILI levels, pointing to a stable future ILI volume.
5. The decreasing trend in ILI occurrences over the last 5 weeks, combined with the classification of Week31, 2024, as off-season, supports the forecast of stabilization near baseline levels. The forecast result of 1509 is calculated by adjusting the average (1562) based on seasonal fluctuation trends and collaboration with factors provided in the CDC reports, emphasizing low influenza activity, stable co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and effective vaccine matches. Together, these point to a gradual stabilization aligned with historical off-season patterns.
