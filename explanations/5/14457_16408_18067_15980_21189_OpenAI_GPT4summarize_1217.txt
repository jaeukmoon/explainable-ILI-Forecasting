1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall increasing trend, with values ['14457', '16408', '18067', '15980', '21189']. While Week44, 2023 (14457), to Week46, 2023 (18067), demonstrated a consistent growth, Week47, 2023 (15980), saw a slight dip before spiking significantly in Week48, 2023 (21189). This overall upward trend underscores the rising ILI activity leading to heightened future occurrences.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the increasing trend in past ILI occurrences and the reported future ILI occurrences (24647). The sharp rise during Weeks46–48, 2023 signals escalated disease activity, acting as a precursor to the continued growth observed after Week48, resulting in 24647 occurrences after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently increased, exceeding national baselines in consecutive weeks: 2.9% (Week44, 2023), 3.5% (Week45, 2023), 3.7% (Week46, 2023), 3.9% (Week47, 2023), and 4.0% (Week48, 2023). This steady rise in outpatient ILI visits reflects heightened respiratory illness activity, contributing to the future spike in ILI occurrences.
4. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza grew prominently, moving from 1.2 per 100,000 (Week44, 2023) to 5.5 per 100,000 (Week48, 2023), driven by severe cases among adults 65+ years. This increase in hospitalizations mirrors the amplified ILI burden in the future data.
5. The escalating influenza positivity rates in clinical specimens jumped from 3.0% (Week44, 2023) to 6.8% (Week48, 2023), with Influenza A(H1N1) being predominant. This growth in lab-confirmed influenza activity aligns closely with the surge to 24647 occurrences, reflecting the virus's significant contribution to the overall respiratory illness burden.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences (24647) can be attributed to the observed upward trend in past ILI occurrences, rising outpatient ILI visits surpassing baselines, increased hospitalization rates for severe influenza cases, and expanding positivity rates of influenza in clinical specimens during Weeks44–48, 2023. These factors collectively signal intensified influenza-like illness activity and its sustained growth.
