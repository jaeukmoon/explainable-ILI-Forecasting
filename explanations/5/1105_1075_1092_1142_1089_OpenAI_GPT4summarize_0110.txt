1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week27 to Week31, 2023 are 1105, 1075, 1092, 1142, and 1089. These values fluctuate within a narrow range, showing minimal variation across the five weeks. There is a slight rise by Week30 (1142) followed by a return to lower levels by Week31 (1089), indicating a generally stable pattern without any significant spikes or downward shifts.
2. Forecasting Week36, 2023 aligns with the Peak onset season. In the U.S., the Peak onset season typically begins between Week32 and Week35 and gradually increases towards the Peak season. Week27 to Week31, 2023 report minimal flu positivity and activity but align temporally with the expected transition toward the Peak onset season.
3. The stable trend in prior weeks suggests a continuation of the current pattern with gradual increases expected as the U.S. transitions into the Peak onset season. From the time-series perspective, the mild rise in Week30 and small decline in Week31 imply a slow and steady build, contributing to a predicted ILI occurrence of 1476 in Week36, 2023.
4. Summary insights from the CDC reports support the forecast:
5. 1) Continued low ILI positivity (1.0% to 1.2%) across Weeks27-31, 2023 (Week27 #1, Week28 #1, Week29 #1, Week30 #1, Week31 #1), with minor increases in outpatient visits for children under five (Week27 #10; Week28 #4; Week30 #3). This indicates a minimal but persistent baseline level of activity likely to broaden gradually in the Peak onset season.
6. 2) Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV remains a factor influencing ILI trends (Week27 #10; Week29 #8; Week30 #8; Week31 #8). These contribute to respiratory illness activity variability and potential additive effects in upcoming weeks.
7. 3) Increasing dominance of Influenza A ((H1N1)pdm09) over Influenza B with no significant new variants reported (Week28 #3; Week29 #3; Week30 #7; Week31 #7) suggests stable but slightly increasing ILI occurrences without unexpected spikes.
5. Despite the relatively low ILI activity in Weeks27-31, 2023, the approaching Peak onset season (Week36, 2023) and historical data trends suggest a steady rise in activity. The continued circulation of respiratory viruses combined with stable dominance of (H1N1)pdm09 and low influenza vaccination reporting may contribute to a modest increase in ILI occurrences.
6. The projected ILI occurrence value of 1476 for Week36, 2023 is justified by stable prior trends, progression toward the Peak onset season, and co-circulation of other respiratory factors contributing to respiratory illness dynamics.
