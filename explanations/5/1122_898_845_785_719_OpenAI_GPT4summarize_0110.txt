1. The reported ILI counts from Week27 to Week31, 2022 are 1122, 898, 845, 785, and 719. The data reveals a consistent declining trend over five weeks, with ILI occurrences dropping steadily. This suggests reduced circulating influenza activity and a lower burden of respiratory illness as the weeks progress. No significant spikes or fluctuation are observed, indicating a stable decline.
2. Week36, 2022 falls into the peak onset season, as this period generally begins around Week32 or Week35 in the U.S., leading up to the peak season later in the year (e.g., Week46 of the year). Despite the ongoing decline in activity, Week36, 2022 marks the transitional phase where baseline activity can begin trending upward toward the peak.
3. Historical time-series data shows a declining trend during Weeks27 to Week31, 2022 (1122 to 719). Based on this trajectory, a model forecast would typically project continued decrement in ILI activity. However, given that Week36, 2022 corresponds to the peak onset season, minor increases in ILI occurrences are anticipated due to rising influenza activity. Therefore, the forecast of 768 ILI occurrences suggests the beginning of a slight upward adjustment in the pattern, aligning with typical seasonal dynamics.
4. Influenza activity is consistently low across Weeks27 to Week31, 2022, with very few respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza (e.g., Week27, 2022 #1; Week31, 2022 #1). This reflects subdued influenza circulation and reduces the likelihood of sharp spikes in ILI occurrences.
5. Despite low nationwide influenza, novel Influenza A (H3N2)v infections were detected in Weeks30 and 31, 2022, linked to swine exposure, though no sustained human-to-human transmission was reported (Week30, 2022 #7; Week31, 2022 #4). This emergence may contribute to modest ILI increases in subsequent weeks if localized exposures lead to further cases.
6. Changing healthcare behavior and co-circulation of respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 may partially drive ILI counts, even in the off-season. These trends complicate pure influenza trends and could cause fluctuations before the expected peak onset season (Week27, 2022 #10; Week30, 2022 #10; Week31, 2022 #10).
7. The forecast of 768 ILI occurrences for Week36, 2022 reflects the interaction of a declining trend, low baseline influenza activity, and the expected transition in the peak onset season. Contributing factors include novel virus detections (Influenza A (H3N2)v), dynamics of healthcare-seeking behavior, and co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens. These elements together justify a modest anticipated increase as the season transitions.
