1. The reported ILI counts from Week29 to Week33, 2021 are 1230, 1477, 1504, 1541, and 1543. This trend shows a consistent increase over all five weeks, signifying a gradual upward trajectory with no significant dips but some stabilization toward Week33 (1543). This pattern suggests rising activity that may plateau or increase further in the subsequent weeks.
2. Based on the timing (Week38, 2021) and the U.S. season classification, Week38, 2021 falls into the peak onset season. The observed rising trends in ILI visits (Week29, 2021 #2; Week30, 2021 #1; Week31, 2021 #3; Week32, 2021 #3; Week33, 2021 #2) along with increasing respiratory illness activity align with the transition toward a peak onset phase, supporting the classification.
3. From the time-series perspective, the steady increases in past ILI occurrences, accompanied by stabilization, imply a likely continuation of this growth pattern into the near future. This projection assumes the trend increments observed over Week29 to Week33 will persist, possibly leading to a projected count of 1889 ILI occurrences by Week38, 2021.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI have risen consistently over five weeks (Week29, 2021 #8; Week30, 2021 #1; Week31, 2021 #2; Week32, 2021 #3; Week33, 2021 #2), particularly across multiple age groups, suggesting heightened respiratory illness transmission.
5. Novel influenza variant activity (Week32, 2021 #2) such as the A(H1N2)v infections in Wisconsin, though isolated, adds potential risk factors for influenza-related illnesses during this timeframe.
6. Co-circulation of non-influenza respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 (Week29, 2021 #9; Week30, 2021 #7; Week31, 2021 #3; Week32, 2021 #9; Week33, 2021 #3) likely contributes to elevated ILI visits as flu-related activity remains minimal. Combined viral interactions during seasonal transitions may lead to overlapping symptoms and consequent increases in recorded ILI trends.
7. In summary, the successive increase in ILI visits, classification of Week38, 2021 as part of the peak onset season, and compounding effects of non-influenza viruses alongside potential novel variants justify the prediction of 1889 ILI occurrences in Week38, 2021. These factors collectively indicate an ongoing surge in respiratory illnesses, especially as the season progresses toward its higher intensity phases.
