1. The past ILI occurrences from Week20, 2023 to Week24, 2023 exhibit a consistent decreasing trend: 1617, 1448, 1246, 1098, and 1017. This pattern shows a steady decline in ILI activity by an average weekly reduction of approximately ((1617-1017)/4) = 150 cases per week. Given this trend, a continuation of the decline could naturally lead to a much lower ILI occurrence by Week29, 2023 if no interfering factors are introduced.
2. Season Classification for Week29, 2023: Week29 falls into the off-season period, based on the typical U.S. influenza calendar. This is a time with minimal influenza activity as the prevalence of flu and other respiratory illnesses decreases significantly during summer, which reduces baseline ILI occurrences. Minimal flu activity is corroborated by the CDC's expectation during the summarized reports, further strengthening the off-season classification.
3. Historical correlation analysis supports this declining trend. Using a time-series perspective, the pattern suggests that ILI occurrences continue to decrease during off-season weeks as they return closer to baseline levels. Extrapolating the data based on the average week-to-week reduction of 150 cases and accounting for flattening trends during the off-season (typically, the decline rate slows down toward lower activity levels), a reduction of around 70% of the Week24, 2023 value (1017) is reasonable. Applying this reduction factor predicts an occurrence value of approximately 1017 * 0.65 = 662 by Week29, 2023.
4. Three main factors from the CDC reports influence the forecasting:
5. 1) **Declining influenza positivity rates:** From Week20 (1.1%), Week21 (1.2%), Week22 (1.1%), Week23 (1.0%), to Week24 (1.1%), a flat or slightly decreasing trend in influenza positivity rates suggests weak viral transmission. This strongly indicates that ILI occurrences will remain low and decline further, affecting the expected value negatively. Mathematically, flat positivity rates combined with the earlier week's decrease make a drop of 35% (from Week24) plausible.
6. 2) **Seasonal influenza decline:** CDC mentioned throughout these weeks that flu activity remains minimal during summer weeks, with expectations of further decline through the summer season. This seasonality reduces the likelihood of any significant spikes in ILI occurrences for Week29. Off-season adjustments typically reduce the baseline proportion of ILI cases to the lower 600-700 range.
7. 3) **Co-circulation of respiratory viruses:** Coexisting illnesses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 add a minor baseline influence while flu itself is waning. However, their relative contribution remains insignificant as CDC surveillance highlights reductions in their contributions. Any increase due to co-circulating viruses is likely offset by overall declining trends.
5. In summary, the projection of 662 cases for Week29, 2023 in Region 8 arises from several quantitative and qualitative observations: a steady decline in historical data that flattens in the off-season, supported by reduced influenza activity, off-season classification, and minimal co-circulating respiratory influences. These factors together justify the prediction.
