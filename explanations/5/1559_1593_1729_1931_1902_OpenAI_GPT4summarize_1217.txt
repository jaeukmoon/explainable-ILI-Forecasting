1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a noticeable upward trend, with values of ['1559', '1593', '1729', '1931', '1902']. An initial increase from 1559 (Week9, 2022) to 1593 (Week10, 2022) was followed by more substantial rises in Weeks11 and 12, peaking at 1931. Although there was a slight decline to 1902 in Week13, the overall pattern captures a persistent upward trajectory in ILI activity.
2. The positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident as the significant escalation in activity during Weeks11–13, 2022, with values nearing 2000, aligns with the reported rise to 2895 cases after five weeks. The steep growth during the last three weeks of past occurrences signals the sustained elevation in ILI activity reflected in the future data.
3. Weekly percentages of outpatient visits attributed to ILI steadily increased, climbing from 1.6% (Week9, 2022) to 1.9% (Week13, 2022). This growth points to increasing healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory illnesses, likely contributing to the uptick in future ILI occurrences.
4. Hospitalization rates for influenza rose consecutively over the five weeks: from 5.5 per 100,000 in Week9, 2022, to 8.0 per 100,000 in Week13, 2022. This consistent increase highlights intensifying severity in flu cases, a precursor to the observed surge to 2895 cases.
5. Increasing positivity rates for influenza from clinical labs, rising from 5.8% (Week9, 2022) to 8.3% (Week13, 2022), underscore heightened flu virus circulation. Coupled with the dominance of A(H3N2) strains showing antigenic differences, this supports the projected escalation of future ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, with coinfection rates reaching 3.2–5.9% during Weeks9–13, 2022, reflects overlapping respiratory illnesses that likely compounded the rise in ILI activity.
7. In summary, the reported 2895 future ILI occurrences (occurring 5 weeks post-Week13, 2022) can be attributed to the steady upward trend in past ILI data, rising outpatient visits, escalating hospitalization rates, increasing influenza positivity tied to dominant variant activity, and compounding effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses.
