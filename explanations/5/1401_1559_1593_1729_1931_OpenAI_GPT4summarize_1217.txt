1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Week8 to Week12, 2022) demonstrated a consistent upward trend, starting from 1401 in Week8 and steadily rising to 1931 by Week12, 2022. Week-to-week increases indicate a progression in ILI activity, with notable jumps between Weeks 11 and 12, reaching the highest level during this period. This sustained upward pattern highlights increasing respiratory illness activity.
2. A strong positive correlation between the upward trajectory of past ILI occurrences and the future value of 2654 is evident. The continuous rise in the latter weeks of the observation period (Week12, 2022) aligns with the extrapolated future spike after 5 weeks. The progressive increase suggests amplification of ILI activity, peaking with the projected figure of 2654.
3. The increasing percentage of positive clinical lab specimens for influenza, rising steadily from 4.1% in Week8 to 7.7% in Week11, strongly correlates with the future spike, reflecting rising influenza activity. Elevated hospitalization rates for influenza, climbing from 5.2 per 100,000 in Week8 to 7.2 per 100,000 in Week12, indicate more severe cases over time, contributing to the projected ILI increase. The dominance of the A(H3N2) influenza strain, known for causing significant outbreaks and evolving antigenically, further aligns with the rise in ILI activity. Reports of co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, with coinfection rates of up to 6.1% in Week8 and 5.4% in Week12, suggest compounded respiratory illness burden driving the future surge.
4. Increased outpatient visits for ILI steadily grew from 1.5% (Week8) to 1.8% (Week12), reflecting heightened flu-like symptoms in the population. Consistently rising hospitalization trends, reaching seven consecutive weekly increases by Week12, emphasize worsening influenza activity over time. Mortality rates due to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC), consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds (16.7% in Week8, 8.3% in Week12), reflect elevated respiratory illness severity, aligning with the future surge.
5. In conclusion, the future ILI occurrences of 2654 can be attributed to the upward trend in past ILI occurrences, rising positive influenza detection rates, increasing hospitalization rates and severity associated with Influenza A(H3N2), the impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses, and supporting metrics such as outpatient visits, PIC mortality rates, and seven-week hospitalization increases. These combined factors convincingly explain the projected rise.
