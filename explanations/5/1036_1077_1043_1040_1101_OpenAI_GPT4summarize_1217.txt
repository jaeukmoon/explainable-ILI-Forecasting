1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed variability but ended with an overall upward trend, with values of ['1036', '1077', '1043', '1040', '1101']. There was an initial increase from 1036 (Week30, 2021) to 1077 (Week31, 2021), a slight decline to 1043 (Week32, 2021) and 1040 (Week33, 2021), followed by a rise to 1101 (Week34, 2021). This pattern indicates subtle but persistent growth in ILI activity by the end of the observed period.
2. A moderate positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The increase to 1101 in Week34, 2021, signals a gradual buildup of respiratory illness activity, which aligns with the reported decrease to 975 after five weeks (Week39, 2021), likely reflecting a slight drop after prior increases. This suggests a trailing impact of waning respiratory illness activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed an incremental rise over the past five weeks, from 1.9% (Week30, 2021) to 2.2% (Week33–34, 2021), with increases consistently noted across all age groups. This upward trend reflects enhanced respiratory illness spread, driven by non-influenza respiratory pathogens that correlate positively with future occurrences.
4. PIC (Pneumonia, Influenza, COVID-19) deaths, dominated by COVID-19, exhibited notable increases, beginning from 9.0% in Week30, 2021, and peaking at 19.4% in Week34, 2021. This persistently high PIC mortality indicates an intensification of respiratory illnesses, further driving future ILI activity.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighted in all reports, have complicated traditional ILI data interpretation. These changes, alongside concurrent circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and minimal influenza activity, have likely amplified non-specific respiratory illness reporting, ultimately contributing to the future ILI decrease to 975 as trends stabilize.
6. Despite minimal influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% in Week34, 2021), the documented rise in other respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, exerted a substantial influence on ILI occurrences. This substitution effect of non-influenza pathogens aligns with the eventual stabilization of ILI cases at 975.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 975 (Week39, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks 30–34, consistent increases in outpatient visits for ILI, persistently high PIC mortality rates, and the overwhelming influence of shifting healthcare-seeking behaviors, compounded by dominant SARS-CoV-2 activity and non-influenza respiratory pathogen circulation.
