1. The reported ILI counts from Week33 to Week37, 2024 are 11971, 14072, 15539, 14753, and 13311, respectively. The trend initially shows a steady increase from Week33 (11971) to a peak at Week35 (15539). Subsequently, the occurrences decreased slightly in Week36 (14753) and Week37 (13311). This trend can be characterized as an early increase followed by a mild decline, suggesting peak onset season activity moving toward stabilization.
2. Based on U.S. influenza season trends, Week42, 2024 falls within the typical peak onset season, occurring before the usual peak season beginning around Week46 and after the off-season ending around Week31. The reported data, including increasing trends with a peak around Week35, supports the classification of Week42, 2024, in the peak onset season.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the initial rise in occurrences followed by a slight decline suggests that ILI counts are stabilizing after early peak onset signals. Historically, these patterns during the peak onset season indicate a moderate increase in occurrences as flu activity gradually builds toward the peak period. Projecting this forward, the forecast of 13545 ILI occurrences reflects this anticipated trend.
4. Hospitalization and death rates remain low (Week33 to Week37, 2024 #5, #6), with stable outpatient visit rates for respiratory illnesses below the seasonal baseline (Week33 to Week37, 2024 #4). This reduced severity suggests limited near-term surges but supports gradual activity increases during the peak onset period.
5. Sustained low flu positivity (Week33 to Week37, 2024 #1), along with antigenic similarity between circulating strains and vaccines (Week33 to Week37, 2024 #8), indicates effective vaccination campaigns and reduced viral diversity. This contributes to moderate but rising ILI trends as community transmission persists.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 (Week33 to Week37, 2024 #10) affects overall respiratory illness trends, with potential additive effects on reported ILI occurrences in overlapping regions, contributing to the moderate projected increase.
7. The predicted ILI count of 13545 is justified by the slight decline following recent peak trends (Week33 to Week37, 2024), alignment with the peak onset season timeline, and the influence of gradually increasing transmission within a context of co-circulating respiratory viruses, effective vaccination, and low severity metrics. These factors collectively point to a moderate increase consistent with early peak onset activity.
