1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a clear upward trend, with values of ['10080', '10778', '12532', '13484', '14343']. The data shows a steady week-by-week increase from 10080 in Week13, 2022, to 14343 by Week17, 2022. This consistent growth in ILI activity indicates escalating influenza-like illness cases throughout the observed period, with no decline or stagnation evident.
2. There is a strong positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences. The escalating trajectory in Weeks16 and 17, 2022, which recorded the highest values of 13484 and 14343 respectively, strongly aligns with the observed surge to 23985 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week22, 2022). The sustained weekly rise in past values directly foreshadows the high future occurrence.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness consistently increased over the weeks, moving from 1.9% in Week13, 2022, to 2.2% in Week17, 2022. Though these percentages remained below the national baseline, the upward trend indicates growing healthcare encounters driven by respiratory illnesses, aligning with higher future ILI occurrences.
4. Hospitalizations due to influenza steadily rose over the 5-week period, climbing from 8.0 per 100,000 in Week13, 2022, to 12.2 per 100,000 by Week17, 2022. This continuous increase in severe cases reflects heightened flu activity, predicting a significant ILI surge in Week22, 2022.
5. Mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) hovered above the epidemic threshold throughout, fluctuating between 6.8% and 7.5%. This persistent PIC mortality underscores severe ongoing respiratory illness activity, contributing to the high future ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, exacerbated respiratory illness trends, as highlighted in CDC reports, adding complexity to the ILI surge dynamics. Additionally, regions with higher influenza activity, such as the south-central and northeast regions, experienced intensified transmission, supporting the rise to 23985 by Week22, 2022.
7. In summary, the reported 23985 future ILI occurrences (Week22, 2022) stem from the sustained upward trend in Weeks13–17, 2022, increasing outpatient visits for respiratory illness, rising hospitalization rates, persistent PIC mortality above the epidemic threshold, and compounding effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses, significantly amplifying influenza activity trends.
