1. The reported ILI occurrences for the past five weeks are 1293, 1230, 1340, 1263, and 1077. A gradual decline is observed from Week47 (1293) to Week51 (1077), with a mild peak in Week49 (1340). This trend indicates an overall decreasing pattern with slight fluctuations, likely due to external factors influencing healthcare-seeking behavior or surveillance consistency.
2. Week3, 2021 falls within the typical U.S. peak season (Week46–Week6) based on the historical influenza activity timeline. However, given the reported low flu positivity rates (Week47 #1; Week48 #1; Week51 #1), minimal ILI activity (Week47 #2; Week50 #5), and the significantly reduced influenza spread due to ongoing public health measures, the target week aligns more closely with off-season characteristics despite being within the peak season time frame. Therefore, it is reasonable to classify Week3, 2021 as part of the off-season.
3. The time-series ILI data reflects an overall declining trend over the analyzed period, suggesting continued reductions in ILI activity for Week3, 2021. Combined with historically low influenza activity documented in CDC reports and the lack of indications for an upward spike, the projection of 783 occurrences aligns with this downward trajectory.
4. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduces influenza spread and affects healthcare-seeking behavior, leading to unusually low influenza activity (Week47 #6, #10; Week49 #9; Week51 #8).
5. Influenza positivity rates remain extremely low, with only 0.1% to 0.3% of specimens testing positive across the past five weeks (Week47 #1; Week48 #1; Week49 #1; Week50 #1; Week51 #1), signifying limited influenza transmission.
6. Public health measures, including masking, social distancing, and increased vaccination emphasis, continue to suppress influenza transmission, as noted consistently in the CDC reports (Week48 #10; Week49 #10; Week50 #10; Week51 #10).
7. The forecasted value of 783 ILI occurrences is supported by the declining trend in past ILI data, the off-season classification of Week3, 2021, and the compounded impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures, low influenza circulation, and altered healthcare-seeking behaviors. These factors collectively explain the lower-than-usual predicted ILI occurrence.
