1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a steady and significant decline, with values of ['1983', '1695', '1454', '1180', '1024']. This consistent downward trend from 1983 (Week 21, 2022) to 1024 (Week 25, 2022) indicates a reduction in ILI activity across the observed timeline, with no disruptions in this declining pattern.
2. A clear correlation exists between the decreasing trend of past time-series occurrences and the future ILI occurrences, as evidenced by the drop in ILI to 1024 in Week 25, 2022, and the continuation of this reduction to 835 after 5 weeks, showing a prolonged impact of the downward trajectory seen in the past data.
3. Influenza positivity rates sharply declined, from 5.7% in Week 21, 2022, to 1.8% in Week 25, 2022. This consistent reduction aligns with the drop in ILI and reflects diminishing viral circulation or respiratory illness burden in the population. Outpatient visit percentages for ILI also decreased steadily, from 2.3% in Week 21, 2022, to 1.8% in Week 25, 2022, signifying reduced medical consultation for respiratory illnesses, further supporting the observed future drop in ILI occurrences. Cumulative influenza hospitalizations declined significantly, from 2089 new cases in Week 23, 2022, to 1307 in Week 25, 2022, reflecting a reduced impact of severe illnesses.
4. Other potential contributors to the ILI decline include minimal long-term care facility outbreaks, which reported a drop in influenza-positive cases (from 0.5% in Week 21, 2022, to 0.3% in Week 25, 2022). Reduced co-infections with SARS-CoV-2, seen in 4.4% of public health lab specimens early in the season (Week 21, 2022) and holding steady or decreasing, likely mitigated the respiratory illness burden overall. Geographic variability showed reduced regional influenza activity, with fewer jurisdictions reporting high or very high levels of activity, indicating broader control of ILI spread.
5. In summary, the reported 835 future ILI occurrences (Week 30, 2022) can be explained by the substantial and consistent decline in past ILI occurrences, the parallel decreases in influenza test positivity rates, outpatient ILI visit percentages, and influenza-associated hospitalizations, as well as additional mitigating factors, including reduced outbreaks in long-term care facilities, diminishing co-infections, and geographically limited ILI activity. These combined trends point to a predictable continuation of declining respiratory illness burden reaching the value of 835.
