1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Week 14–18, 2022) displayed a consistent upward trend, indicating a steady rise in ILI activity. The values increased consecutively from 1977 (Week 14, 2022) to 2895 (Week 18, 2022), with notable growth observed in subsequent weeks. This steady increase reflects escalating influenza-like illness occurrences during the observed period.

2. The positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the upward trajectory observed in the data (Week 14–18, 2022) aligns with the reported increase to 3158 five weeks later (Week 23, 2022). The continuation of the rising trend in ILI occurrences strongly supports the likelihood of amplified activity in Week 23, 2022.

3. Multiple factors reported in the summarized CDC reports align with the observed future ILI increase:
   - **Influenza-related hospitalizations** rose consistently every week until Week 17, 2022, reaching a peak of 3,243, reinforcing that severe outcomes of respiratory illnesses drive overall ILI increases.
   - **Influenza virus positivity rates** rose steadily during the 5-week period (8.4% in Week 14 to 8.6% in Week 18, 2022), indicating growing influenza prevalence, predominantly A(H3N2), a strain associated with significant illness severity.
   - **Co-circulation of respiratory viruses** (including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza) significantly contributed to illness complexity, with 5-4.7% of influenza-positive samples also testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, fueling increased respiratory illness activity.

4. In summary, the reported 3158 future ILI occurrences (Week 23, 2022) can be attributed to a consistently rising trend over the past 5 weeks, sustained increases in ILI-related hospitalizations, higher influenza positivity rates driven by dominant A(H3N2), and the impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors collectively support the transition to the higher ILI activity level observed.
