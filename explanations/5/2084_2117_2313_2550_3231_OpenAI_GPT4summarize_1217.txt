1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent increase, starting at 2084 in Week48, 2021, then rising steadily through 2117 (Week49, 2021), 2313 (Week50, 2021), and 2550 (Week51, 2021), before peaking at 3231 in Week52, 2021. This progression reflects a pronounced upward trajectory in ILI activity over the observed period.
2. The sharp decrease in future ILI occurrences to 1125 (Week5, 2022) contrasts with the significant rise during the prior 5 weeks yet reflects a delayed seasonal decline, common post-holiday and after a peak flu period, as implied by Week52 trends. The future number correlates inversely with the preceding surge, aligning with natural flu season cyclic patterns.
3. Outpatient respiratory illness visits over the past 5 weeks showed continuous increases, rising from 2.5% (Week48, 2021) to 4.8% (Week52, 2021). The sustained incline paralleled the peak in ILI activity, potentially exhausting the susceptible population, leading to a sharp drop in Week5 occurrences as transmission slowed down.
4. Mortality due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed epidemic thresholds across the weeks, climbing from 17.5% (Week48, 2021) to 19.9% (Week52, 2021). While COVID-19 drove most deaths, the elevated mortality indicates simultaneous stress on healthcare resources, likely reducing ILI surveillance and cases by Week5, 2022.
5. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza A(H3N2) and SARS-CoV-2, further complicated Week48–52 dynamics. This interaction may have driven the peak ILI cases, with subsequent declines influenced by virus-vaccine disparities, depleted susceptible groups, and reporting dynamics.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1125 (Week5, 2022) reflect a natural post-peak decline in respiratory illness activity following volatility in Weeks48–52, 2021, driven by rising outpatient ILI visits, high PIC mortality, and co-circulating respiratory pathogens amidst early signs of influenza A evolution.
