1. The past time-series ILI occurrences exhibited fluctuations with values ['1759', '1626', '1786', '1856', '1789']. Week17, 2021, saw a decrease from 1759 (Week16, 2021) to 1626, followed by an increase to 1786 in Week18, 2021, and a peak at 1856 in Week19, 2021. A slight decrease to 1789 was observed in Week20, 2021. This pattern implies variability but a predominantly stable ILI pattern near 1800 in the final weeks.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 1794 closely correlates with the relatively stable values above 1780 observed in Weeks19 and 20, 2021. The comparison demonstrates continuity in ILI trends, as the sustained near-peak levels align with the reported future occurrence.
3. Outpatient ILI visits remained consistent throughout the weeks, reported at 1.1% (Week17, 2021), 1.2% (Weeks18–19, 2021), and 1.3% (Week20, 2021). These percentages, staying below baseline but gradually increasing, suggest a stable yet slightly rising trend in ILI-related healthcare utilization.
4. PIC deaths accounted for 11.7% (Week17, 2021), 10.9% (Week18, 2021), 10.1% (Week19, 2021), 9.5% (Week20, 2021), and 8.3% (Week21, 2021). Despite a downward trend, PIC mortality remained above epidemic thresholds, signifying ongoing respiratory illness activity influencing ILI trends.
5. Minimal influenza activity and low positivity rates persisted across all weeks, consistently reported at 0.1% of specimens. However, the ongoing COVID-19 impact and altered healthcare-seeking behaviors, highlighted in every report, influenced ILI data collection and interpretation, likely contributing to stable future ILI levels.
6. In summary, the reported 1794 future ILI occurrences align closely with stable but slightly fluctuating patterns in past weeks, steady outpatient ILI visits, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and the continuing impact of COVID-19 on ILI data interpretation.
