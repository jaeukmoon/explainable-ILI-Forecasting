1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with reported values of ['17310', '16585', '15411', '14829', '14594']. Starting at 17310 in Week7, 2023, there were steady decreases across subsequent weeks, ending at 14594 by Week11, 2023. This pattern suggests a sustained decline in ILI activity over this 5-week period.
2. A negative correlation is observed between the past and future ILI occurrences since the steadily declining trend in Weeks7–11, 2023, corresponds to a further reduction in future ILI cases, reaching 12757 by Week16, 2023. The consistent drop in past time-series ILI occurrences directly aligns with the lower future value.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a declining trend, decreasing from 2.6% in Week7, 2023, to 2.4% in Week11, 2023, consistently staying near or below the national baseline. This stability and slight drop in outpatient visits for ILI likely contributed to the continued decline in future ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exhibited a downward slope, moving from 9.0% in Week7, 2023, to 8.7% in Week11, 2023, while remaining slightly above the epidemic threshold. The persistent but gradual decrease in PIC mortality reflects declining respiratory illness activity, likely influencing the lower reported future ILI occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV persisted throughout Weeks7–11, 2023, as noted in CDC reports. These viruses, coupled with stable influenza activity, complicate interpretation but suggest a reduced influenza-specific burden contributing to the observed decrease in ILI cases in future data.
6. Improvements in healthcare-seeking behavior stability and vaccination alignment with circulating strains during Weeks7–11, 2023, contributed to mitigating flu activity. Vaccines remained well-matched, and antiviral susceptibility was nearly universal, reducing the potential for spikes in ILI cases and aligning with the reported future decline to 12757.
7. In summary, the reported 12757 future ILI occurrences (Week16, 2023) can be explained by the consistent decline in past ILI trends, reductions in outpatient visits and PIC mortality, stable respiratory illness dynamics dominated by non-influenza pathogens, and the mitigating effects of vaccination and antiviral effectiveness.
