1. Past ILI occurrences from Week7 to Week11, 2024 show an overall declining trend. After peaking at 18300 in Week9, occurrences strongly dropped by Week10 (16477) and Week11 (14164). This pattern of decline indicates the possibility of abating influenza activity entering subsequent weeks as the season begins to wane.
2. Week16, 2024 falls within the off-season period for ILI activity in the U.S. This aligns with historical patterns, where off-season spans from Week9 to Week30, following the peak season ending around Week6. Declining trends in ILI and cumulative factors support categorizing Week16, 2024 as part of the off-season.
3. The time-series data reflects a clear peak-to-decline pattern, with notable reduction after Week9, 2024. Projecting forward, the model anticipates a continuation of decreasing ILI occurrences, consistent with recent trends. Week16, 2024 is forecasted to experience subdued ILI activity as the trajectory aligns with waning seasonal activity, settling at 6649.
4. Influenza positivity rates steadily declined from Week7 (14.8%) to Week11 (12%), lowering the transmission rate and indicating a diminishing flu season (Week7-Week11 #2). This reduction in prospective case generation supports fewer ILI occurrences after five weeks.
5. Vaccination trends show consistent recommendations by the CDC, with vaccines effectively matching circulating strains and retaining low antiviral resistance (Week7-Week11 #7, #8, #10). These effective measures are mitigating severe outcomes and curbing the spread, facilitating lower ILI counts in following weeks.
6. Outpatient ILI visits and cumulative hospitalizations show declining trends, with Week11 rates (3.4% outpatient visits, 70.2 cumulative hospitalizations per 100,000) stabilizing compared to earlier weeks (Week7 Week11 #4, #5). This sustained decrease aligns with waning ILI spread into Week16, 2024.
7. In summary, the declining ILI trend, reduced positivity rates, vaccination impact, and stabilization of hospitalizations collectively justify the projected value of 6649 for Week16, 2024. This value reflects the expected typical off-season prevalence following a steady decline in activity.
