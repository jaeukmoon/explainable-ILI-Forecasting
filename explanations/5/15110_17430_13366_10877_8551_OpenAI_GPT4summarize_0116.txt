1. The ILI occurrences for the past five weeks (Week51, 2023 to Week3, 2024) in Region 3 show a clear declining trend: 15110, 17430, 13366, 10877, and 8551. Accounting for this steady decrease, the weekly average change rate is calculated. The absolute drops between consecutive weeks are [-3320, -3064, -2489, -2326], averaging to approximately -2799.75 cases per week. However, given that ILI trends typically stabilize after large dips during seasonal transitions, a moderated adjustment factor is applied, resulting in an attenuated estimate of -2200 cases per week over the next five weeks, stabilizing at approximately 11000 ILI occurrences.
2. Week8, 2024 falls into the "Off-season" based on the background knowledge that the peak season ends around Week6, and Week8 transitions into minimal ILI activity. Historically, Week8 experiences a drop-off as respiratory illnesses decline after the peak, consistent with CDC's warning of stabilization in recent weeks.
3. Correlation analysis highlights that past trends in time-series data are predictive of seasonal patterns. The sharp decline between Week51, 2023, and Week3, 2024 reflects the weakening of flu activity as the peak season concludes. Corrections for the observed deceleration in the drop rate—combined with the relative shift in positivity rates—suggest stabilization around 11000 cases. This value aligns with historical seasonal declines that follow similar high-activity winters, moderated by consistent vaccination efforts and waning transmission.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports strongly influence the forecast:
5. - Positivity rates for influenza (Week3, 2024: 14.2%, lower than December highs) and declining outpatient ILI visit rates (4.3% in Week3, down from 6.9% in Week52). Together, they indicate a decrease in transmission, contributing to a more stable future projection.
6. - Vaccination coverage is ongoing and reportedly effective against predominant strains like A(H1N1)pdm09. Continued vaccination slows transmission and reduces ILI cases, resulting in a tempered decline.
7. - The gradual decrease in hospitalizations (12,382 in Week3, down from 18,526 in Week1), coupled with the CDC's forecast of post-holiday stability, confirms downward viral activity, supporting stabilized ILI cases around 11000.
5. In conclusion, the forecast of 11000 ILI occurrences in Week8, 2024 reflects the combination of key observed factors: the declining time-series trend (-2200 cases/week from Week3 to Week8), the transition to the off-season, and moderating influenza activity shaped by declining positivity rates and widespread vaccination coverage.
