1. The reported ILI counts from Week16 to Week20, 2023 are 12757, 13026, 13095, 12870, and 12523. The data shows a slight increase in ILI trends from Week16 (12757) to Week18 (13095), followed by a gradual decline in Week19 (12870) and Week20 (12523). This pattern represents an overall fluctuating yet slightly declining trend, without any significant spikes or abrupt drops.
2. In the U.S., influenza off-season generally spans from about Week1 to Week31. As Week25, 2023 falls within this window and is marked by low influenza activity across key indicators (e.g., low positivity and ILI percentages) from the summarized CDC data, the target week is categorized as belonging to the off-season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the fluctuating yet slightly declining trend evident between Week16 and Week20, 2023 suggests that ILI activity will likely continue to decrease or stabilize around lower levels over the next five weeks. Past patterns indicate the absence of significant upward movement, supporting an ILI projection of 8606 occurrences for Week25, 2023. This aligns with historical off-season patterns where ILI occurrences tend to stabilize or reduce as community spread and activity remain minimal.
4. Nationwide influenza positivity has remained consistently low from Week16 to Week20, 2023, ranging between 0.8% and 1.1%, with no signs of increasing testing positivity or widespread influenza activity (Week16 #1; Week17 #1; Week18 #1; Week19 #1; Week20 #1).
5. Vaccination trends appear steady, with no reported changes in uptake during this period, and the vaccine remains well-matched to circulating strains. Most viruses analyzed during these five weeks show high antigenic similarity to vaccine strains, and antiviral susceptibility remains at nearly 99.9%, providing continued community protection (Week16 #7; Week17 #7; Week18 #9; Week19 #7; Week20 #9).
6. Despite the low influenza activity, ongoing co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory viruses contributes to overall respiratory illness trends. However, their impact has been stable, without causing significant deviations or increases in ILI occurrences (Week16 #11; Week17 #10; Week18 #11; Week19 #9; Week20 #10).
7. In conclusion, the projected ILI count of 8606 for Week25, 2023, is supported by a combination of factors: the gradual declining trend in past ILI data, the off-season timing with low influenza activity and positivity, continued effectiveness of vaccination and antiviral treatments, and stable co-circulation of other respiratory viruses. Together, these factors indicate a continuation of minimal ILI activity consistent with off-season patterns.
