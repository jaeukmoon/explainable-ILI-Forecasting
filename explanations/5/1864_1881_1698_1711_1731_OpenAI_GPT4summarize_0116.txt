1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences for the past five weeks (Week18 to Week22, 2024) show a slight fluctuating trend, with values ['1864', '1881', '1698', '1711', '1731']. Initially, from Week18 (1864) to Week19 (1881), there is a small increase of 17 cases (+0.91%), followed by a significant decline to Week20 (1698) with a decrease of 183 cases (-9.73%). Weeks21 (1711) and Week22 (1731) show a small rebound but remain close to Week20's value. This indicates an overall declining trend with occasional minor recovery, reflecting seasonal tapering typical of influenza during the off-season when activity moderates after the peak season.
2. Week27, 2024 falls within the "Off-season" based on influenza seasonality in the U.S. The typical off-season spans from approximately Week9 to Week30 each year, characterized by minimal or baseline ILI activity and the absence of new widespread transmission. Week27 squarely lies in this period, where ILI occurrences decrease toward baseline levels, consistent with CDC data indicating low flu activity earlier in this off-season.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the declining trend over the past five weeks suggests continued stabilization toward baseline activity by Week27, 2024. Using a weighted moving average of the past ILI occurrences, future values are estimated while accounting for the off-season adjustment. First, the simple average of ['1864', '1881', '1698', '1711', '1731'] is calculated:
4. Average = (1864 + 1881 + 1698 + 1711 + 1731) ÷ 5 = 1777.
5. Given the off-season classification, where ILI occurrences typically drop further due to reduced flu transmission, a 40-45% seasonal downward adjustment is applied to reflect expected reductions by Week27:
6. Forecast = 1777 × (1 - 0.43) = 1014.89 ≈ 1015.
4. Three factors from CDC reports strongly influence this forecast:
5. 1) Declining positivity rates for influenza over the past five weeks (e.g., 3.1% in Week18 to 1.8% in Week22) indicate weakening viral transmission, confirming the seasonal decline and low flu circulation during this period. This reduces the likelihood of significant surges leading into Week27.
6. 2) Minimal outpatient respiratory illness visits (stable at 2.1% to 1.9% below the national baseline) signal subdued viral activity overall, consistent with historical off-season trends in flu surveillance. The stable outpatient rate aligns with the forecasted reduction in ILI occurrences.
7. 3) Effective vaccine matching and antivirals (weeks reporting genetic characterization matches vaccine strains and minimal drug resistance) minimize risk escalation during the off-season. Coupled with no novel influenza virus detection, this ensures that viral activity remains at baseline or below levels, supporting the drop in ILI occurrences.
5. In conclusion, the prediction of 1015 ILI occurrences for Week27, 2024, is explained by the declining trend in recent weeks, the off-season classification, and the influence of key factors such as low positivity rates, stable outpatient respiratory illness visits, and robust vaccine and antiviral effectiveness. Together, these validate a projected decrease aligned with historical seasonal dynamics.
