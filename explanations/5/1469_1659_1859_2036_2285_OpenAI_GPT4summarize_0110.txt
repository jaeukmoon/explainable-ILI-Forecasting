1. The reported ILI counts from Week27 to Week31, 2021 are 1469, 1659, 1859, 2036, and 2285. This demonstrates a consistent upward trend, with ILI occurrences increasing steadily each week. No significant spikes or dips are present in the data, indicating a gradual rise in activity. The upward trajectory points to climbing influenza-like respiratory illness activity over time.
2. Forecasting target week (Week36, 2021) belongs to the peak onset season. Based on U.S. seasonal trends, Week36 typically falls within the peak onset season when ILI activity begins increasing from baseline levels toward higher seasonal intensity. The rising trajectory observed in the ILI data supports this seasonal classification.
3. Time-series correlation analysis shows a linear growth pattern in ILI occurrences from Week27 to Week31, with the weekly increments aligning closely (190, 200, 177, and 249). Projecting this forward, we anticipate the continuation of this growth over the next five weeks (Week32 to Week36), culminating in a projected value of 3010. This reasoning aligns with historical patterns of gradual increases during the peak onset season.
4. Rising outpatient visits for ILI (Week27, 2021 #3; Week28, 2021 #3; Week29, 2021 #1; Week30, 2021 #1; Week31, 2021 #2) reflect consistent week-by-week increases in all age groups, suggesting heightened respiratory illness activity contributing to the upward ILI trend.
5. Increased non-influenza respiratory illnesses driven by other viral agents like SARS-CoV-2 (Week27, 2021 #5; Week29, 2021 #7; Week31, 2021 #9) are influencing overall ILI trends, even though influenza activity itself remains low. The rising ILI numbers reflect this broader respiratory illness influence, amplifying the forecasted trend.
6. Virologic surveillance shows minimal influenza positivity (Week27, 2021 #1; Week28, 2021 #1; Week30, 2021 #5; Week31, 2021 #4), but the CDC has emphasized that flu activity remains unpredictable (Week27, 2021 #9; Week30, 2021 #10; Week31, 2021 #10) and may increase during this transitional period. Rising respiratory illnesses combined with the potential onset of influenza activity contribute to the expected ILI growth.
7. Combining the recent consistent upward numerical trend, the timing of the peak onset season (Week36, 2021), broader respiratory illness activity, and the uncertain future dynamics as flagged in CDC reports, the prediction for Week36 is 3010 ILI occurrences, justified by ongoing increases observed in past weeks.
