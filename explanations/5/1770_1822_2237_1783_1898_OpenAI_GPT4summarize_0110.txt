1. The reported ILI counts from Week48, 2020 to Week52, 2020 are 1770, 1822, 2237, 1783, and 1898. The data exhibits a notable increase between Week48 (1770) and Week50 (2237), followed by a significant dip in Week51 (1783). Week52 (1898) sees a small recovery. Overall, the trend is characterized by an initial rise followed by fluctuating decreases, lacking a consistent upward trajectory.
2. Week4, 2021 falls within the typical peak season for influenza activity in the U.S., which generally spans from Week46 to Week6 of the following year. Despite atypically low flu activity during the observed period, the timing suggests that Week4 aligns with the peak season.
3. The fluctuating ILI counts observed from Week48 to Week52, 2020 suggest that the earlier upward trend (Week48 to Week50) has plateaued or begun to decline. Projecting this pattern forward five weeks, along with the continuous influences of pandemic factors, leads to an estimated future ILI occurrence of 1399, consistent with a reduction from Week52 (1898).
4. Influenza activity remains unusually low for the 2020-2021 season, with respiratory specimens testing positive at consistently low rates of 0.1%-0.3% across Week48 to Week52 (Week48, 2020 #1; Week49, 2020 #1; Week50, 2020 #1; Week51, 2020 #1; Week52, 2020 #1).
5. Outpatient visits for ILI were stable at 1.6% from Week48 to Week52, remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%, with most jurisdictions reporting minimal activity (Week48, 2020 #2; Week49, 2020 #4; Week50, 2020 #4; Week51, 2020 #3; Week52, 2020 #4).
6. The CDC consistently projected that flu activity might increase in the coming months, but the ongoing mitigating effects of COVID-19 disruptions, masking, and healthcare-seeking behavior suggest this season could remain atypically low (Week48, 2020 #9, #10; Week49, 2020 #10; Week50, 2020 #11; Week52, 2020 #10, #11).
7. Considering the declining ILI trend, peak-season timing, low flu circulation, stable outpatient visits, and continued pandemic-related suppression of influenza activity, the future ILI occurrences for Week4, 2021 are forecasted to be 1399, reflecting weak flu transmission during an unusually low-intensity peak season.
