1. The reported ILI counts from Week39 to Week43, 2023 are 16160, 17810, 18374, 19370, and 21978. The trend shows consistent growth over the five weeks, with a notable uptick from Week42 (19370) to Week43 (21978). This steady rise indicates an accelerating pattern entering a higher activity phase, reflective of the onset of the flu season.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans from Week46 of a given year to about Week6 of the following year. Since Week48, 2023 falls into this period and there are visible signs of increasing activity from Week42 and Week43 (e.g., rising ILI counts and positivity rates), this forecasts Week48, 2023 as belonging to the peak season.
3. The consistent upward trajectory from Week39 to Week43, 2023 suggests a pattern of escalation common during the transition to peak influenza activity. A time-series projection model extends this trend forward, anticipating continued growth over the next five weeks due to seasonal amplification, resulting in a forecast of 30264 ILI occurrences for Week48, 2023.
4. Influenza positivity in clinical labs increased consistently from 1.0% in Week39 (Week39, 2023 #1) to 1.9% in Week43 (Week43, 2023 #1), while outpatient ILI visits also rose from 2.1% in Week39 (Week39, 2023 #3) to 2.7% in Week43 (Week43, 2023 #3). Increased positivity and outpatient visits reflect escalating viral transmission.
5. Hospitalization trends reveal a rising trajectory, with weekly flu-related hospitalizations increasing from 1,040 in Week39 (Week39, 2023 #4) to 1,607 in Week43 (Week43, 2023 #4). This growth aligns with seasonal progression toward peak activity.
6. CDC reports signal increasing ILI trends in most regions (Week42, 2023 #9; Week43, 2023 #10), with multiple areas moving from minimal or low activity to moderate or high activity levels, supporting further amplification of flu activity going into Week48.
7. Considering the steady increase in historical ILI counts, the alignment of Week48, 2023 with peak season, the influence of rising positivity, hospitalization, and outpatient trends, and regionally escalating activity, the projected value of 30264 is consistent with the expected peak-season dynamics.
