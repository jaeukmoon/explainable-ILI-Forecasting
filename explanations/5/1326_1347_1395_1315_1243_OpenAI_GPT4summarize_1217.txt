1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but overall downward trend, with values of ['1326', '1347', '1395', '1315', '1243']. An initial increase from 1326 (Week 33, 2021) to 1395 (Week 35, 2021) was observed, followed by a significant decline to 1243 in Week 37, 2021. This general decrease in activity suggests diminishing ILI occurrences by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the declining trend observed in the past 5 weeks (Weeks 33–37, 2021) contrasts with the lower future ILI occurrences of 1218 after 5 weeks (Week 42, 2021). The consistent decline reflects reduced community-wide respiratory illness activity.
3. Nationwide outpatient ILI activity consistently remained below the national baseline, marking 2.2% (Week 33, 2021), 2.2% (Week 34, 2021), 0.9% (Week 35, 2021), 2.3% (Week 36, 2021), and 2.1% (Week 37, 2021). Although some fluctuations occurred, these values stayed consistently low, indicating limited sustained transmission of ILI-inducing illnesses and directly aligning with the reduced future occurrences.
4. PIC mortality consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, with percentages rising from 17.2% (Week 33, 2021) to 21.1% (Week 37, 2021), driven primarily by COVID-19. This trend reflects a high burden of respiratory illness predominantly tied to COVID-19 rather than influenza, supporting the conclusion of lower influenza-related activity and the observed reduction in future ILI occurrences.
5. Continued low influenza circulation, with influenza positivity rates reported at 0.1% (Weeks 34–36, 2021), minimal Influenza A and B detections, and no reported influenza-associated pediatric deaths, points to other respiratory viruses driving ILI trends. The absence of significant influenza-related activity logically connects to the decline in future ILI occurrences to 1218.
6. Behavioral changes in healthcare-seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional ILI surveillance systems, leading to challenges in accurately interpreting trends. These disruptions, combined with minimal influenza activity and competing respiratory viruses, contributed to the reduced and stabilized future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
7. In summary, the measured decline from 1395 (Week 35, 2021) to 1243 (Week 37, 2021), consistent low ILI below baselines, dominance of COVID-19-driven PIC mortality, minimal influenza virus circulation, and surveillance limitations stemming from pandemic-driven changes collectively explain the reduced future ILI occurrences of 1218 in Week 42, 2021.
