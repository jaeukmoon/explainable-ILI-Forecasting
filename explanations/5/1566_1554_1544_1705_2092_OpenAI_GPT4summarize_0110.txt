1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week 41 to Week 45, 2020 are 1566, 1554, 1544, 1705, and 2092. The trend suggests an initial slow decrease from Week 41 (1566) to Week 43 (1544), followed by a sudden and significant increase in Week 44 (1705) and Week 45 (2092). This pattern points to emerging ILI activity after a relatively steady period. The sharp rise over Weeks 44 and 45 indicates a potential upward trend driven by contributing factors.
2. Based on the timing and influenza activity trends in the U.S., Week 45, 2020 aligns with the Peak onset season, which typically spans from Week 32 to Week 46. Given the increasing trajectory of ILI occurrences, forecasting for five weeks ahead suggests that the target week (None) will transition toward or within the Peak season, further amplified by expected seasonal dynamics.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the observed sharp rise in ILI occurrences in Weeks 44 and 45 is likely indicative of an approaching peak phase. Extrapolating this trend forward, the model anticipates continued growth in ILI cases over the next five weeks, projecting the count to reach 2237 based on historical patterns and recent sharp increases.
4. Influenza activity remains low as only 0.1%-0.3% of respiratory specimens tested positive across Weeks 41-45, 2020. This suggests limited virus circulation; however, the increases in outpatient ILI visits (from 1.2% in Week 43 to 1.5% in Week 45) signal heightened respiratory illness-related healthcare-seeking behavior and a rise in overall ILI trends.
5. Reports highlight 8.9% of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) by Week 45, surpassing the epidemic threshold of 6.1% in every prior week. The influence of concurrent COVID-19 activity on ILI counts is evident, even as influenza-specific positivity remains low.
6. Vaccination efforts during Weeks 41-45 prioritize broad coverage, but there are no specific trends or updates regarding uptake. Delayed vaccination rates or limited effectiveness against the circulating strains could reduce mitigation effects, allowing ILI activity to trend upward alongside seasonal peaks.
7. Given the recent sharp increase in ILI occurrences, classification of Week 45, 2020 within the Peak onset season, concurrent respiratory illnesses driving PIC-related deaths, and the indirect effects of COVID-19 alongside limited flu virus circulation, the projected count of 2237 for None is consistent with historical precedents and current upward trends.
