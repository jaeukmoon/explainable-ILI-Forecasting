1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall upward trend, with values of ['1013', '975', '949', '1099', '1213']. There was an initial decline from 1013 (Week 8, 2021) to 949 (Week 10, 2021), followed by a sharp increase in Weeks 11 and 12, reaching 1213 in Week 12, 2021, the highest in the observed period. This pattern indicates a resurgence in ILI activity during the latter weeks of the 5-week time series.  

2. A strong positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the sharp rise toward the end of the past data (Weeks 11 and 12, 2021) aligns with the future increase to 1558 reported ILI occurrences by Week 17, 2021. The upward trajectory in Weeks 11 and 12 serves as a precursor to the amplified ILI activity observed in the future period.  

3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained low but began stabilizing at 0.9% from Week 8, 2021, and onward, with continued concerns about younger age groups, as slight increases in the 0–4-year-old cohort were noted in Week 12, 2021. This age-specific uptick may have contributed to the rise in future ILI occurrences.  

4. Elevated percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) were consistently reported, though decreasing slightly during the observation period (16.4% in Week 8 to 11.4% in Week 12, 2021). The persistent PIC mortality, still significantly above epidemic thresholds, reflects ongoing respiratory illness activity, which aligns with the reported future ILI surge.  

5. The influence of altered healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, documented in all weeks, likely disrupted traditional ILI data but may have concentrated detection efforts on cases presenting with ILI symptoms. This could have amplified future ILI reporting.  

6. Despite minimal influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% in Weeks 8–12, 2021) and low hospitalization rates (0.7 per 100,000 population across all weeks), the rise in ILI occurrences suggests contributions from non-specific respiratory illnesses or other circulating pathogens. Predictions from Week 12 about potential increases in flu activity in upcoming months also support the observed future increase.  

7. In summary, the reported 1558 future ILI occurrences (Week 17, 2021) can be attributed to the substantial rise in ILI activity in Weeks 11 and 12, 2021, increasing trends in younger age groups, persistent PIC mortality levels exceeding epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-related healthcare-seeking behavior changes that influenced ILI reporting and surveillance.
