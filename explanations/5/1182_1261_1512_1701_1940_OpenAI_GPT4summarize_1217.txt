1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a steady and significant upward trend, with values of ['1182', '1261', '1512', '1701', '1940']. The increase from 1182 (Week 7, 2022) to 1261 (Week 8, 2022) marked the initial growth, followed by notable surges in subsequent weeks, reaching 1701 (Week 10, 2022) and 1940 (Week 11, 2022), demonstrating a clear escalation in ILI activity throughout the period.
2. A strong positive correlation can be observed between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the consistent rise in ILI cases by the latter weeks of the past data (Week 10–11, 2022) is followed by a further increase to 2531 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 16, 2022). The upward trajectory in the past weeks serves as an indication of the amplified activity observed in future data.
3. The percentage of clinical specimens positive for influenza rose steadily over the 5 weeks, increasing from 4.2% (Week 7, 2022) to 7.7% (Week 11, 2022). This factor indicates intensifying influenza activity, which directly correlates with the higher ILI cases reported in the future.
4. Hospitalization rates due to influenza showed a sustained increase, rising from 4.9 per 100,000 (Week 7, 2022) to 6.5 per 100,000 (Week 11, 2022). This consistent surge in hospitalizations reflects growing severity of cases, suggesting a link to the reported rise in future ILI occurrences.
5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., 6% SARS-CoV-2 and influenza co-infection in Week 7, 2022, rising to 3.5% among hospitalized cases in Week 11, 2022), compounded the burden of respiratory illnesses, bolstering the future ILI surge to 2531.
6. Influenza A(H3N2) dominance (e.g., 98%-100% among subtyped Influenza A cases through Weeks 7–11, 2022) combined with antigenic drift reduced vaccine effectiveness, as reported throughout the summarized CDC reports. This likely contributed to increased susceptibility and rising ILI activity observed in future data.
7. In summary, the rise to 2531 future ILI occurrences (Week 16, 2022) is attributable to the upward trend in past ILI data, increasing influenza positivity, escalating hospitalization rates, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and reduced vaccine coverage and effectiveness against the dominant A(H3N2) strain.
