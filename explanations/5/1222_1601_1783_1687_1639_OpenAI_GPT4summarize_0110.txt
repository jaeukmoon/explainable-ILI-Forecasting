1. The reported ILI counts from Week33 to Week37, 2021 are 1222, 1601, 1783, 1687, and 1639. The trend shows an initial increase from Week33 (1222) to Week35 (1783), followed by a moderate decrease in Week36 (1687) and Week37 (1639). While fluctuations are present, the overall trajectory during these weeks stabilizes at moderately elevated counts compared to earlier weeks, reflecting a plateauing trend.
2. Week42, 2021 falls within the Peak onset season, as this is the period from Week32 to Week46 when ILI activity typically starts climbing toward its peak. Although low influenza activity is reported, the moderate rise and subsequent leveling in ILI counts suggest that activity fits within the early ramping-up phase of influenza transmission.
3. From the time-series perspective, the observed upward trend in the earlier weeks (Week33 to Week35, 2021), followed by stabilization (Week36 to Week37, 2021), reflects a typical pattern during the Peak onset season. The mild reduction seen in Week36-Week37 does not indicate an abrupt decline. This stabilizing pattern, projected forward five weeks, aligns with an estimated ILI occurrence of 1785 based on moderate fluctuations around the observed levels.
4. Influenza activity remains notably low, with circulating respiratory illness largely driven by non-influenza viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) (Week33 #1, #3; Week34 #4; Week37 #5). This continues to suppress significant spikes in influenza-specific activity.
5. Limited influenza virus circulation is corroborated by clinical and public health labs, with low positivity rates over all reported weeks (Week33 #3; Week34 #1; Week36 #3; Week37 #6). Consequently, any increase in ILI is unlikely to reflect influenza alone, dampening the expected peak.
6. Ongoing impacts of healthcare-seeking behavior changes from the pandemic create challenges for accurately tracking trends (Week33 #9; Week34 #8; Week36 #9; Week37 #9). This can cause slight variability in reported ILI numbers without reflecting dramatic changes in actual illness spread.
7. Despite the stable vaccination recommendations, vaccination trends are not updated in the reports (Week34 #7; Week36 #8; Week37 #8), suggesting minimal contribution to shifting ILI trends during these weeks.
8. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrence of 1785 aligns with the observed stabilization in recent weeks, the influence of non-influenza respiratory viruses, the constraints of healthcare-seeking changes, and the context of the Peak onset season. These factors collectively explain the moderate and steady trajectory into Week42, 2021.
