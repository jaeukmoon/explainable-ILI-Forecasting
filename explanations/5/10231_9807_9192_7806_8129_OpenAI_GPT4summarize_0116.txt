1. The ILI occurrences over the past five weeks (Week24, 2024 to Week28, 2024) decreased consistently, with values of 10231 (Week24), 9807 (Week25), 9192 (Week26), 7806 (Week27), and 8129 (Week28). The general trend is decreasing, despite a slight increase between Week27 and Week28. This downward trend reflects a stabilization of ILI activity during the summer months, typical of the "Off-season," when influenza activity is low.
2. Week33, 2024 belongs to the "Off-season" based on U.S. flu seasonal classifications. The period from Week9, 2024 to Week31, 2024 is designated as the Off-season, characterized by minimal ILI activity and baseline disease prevalence. Week33 is just entering the Peak onset season, but the lag in data generally sees current low activity levels extended.
3. A time-series analysis indicates a steady decrease over the past five weeks, with the rate of decline flattening toward the final weeks (7806 to 8129). The simple average of the past five weeks is (10231 + 9807 + 9192 + 7806 + 8129) / 5 = 9023. However, as Week33 lies in the Off-season, an adjustment to reflect continued decline is applied. Assuming a decay rate consistent with Off-season patterns, typically 10-12% decline over five weeks, we estimate a drop of around 11% from the Week28 occurrence, predicting a future value of approximately 8129 × (1 - 0.11) ≈ 7319.
4. CDC reports over the five weeks emphasize the following key factors influencing the projection:
5. (1) Influenza activity and positivity rates are consistently low, with clinical lab positivity rates declining from 1.4% (Week24) to 0.8% (Week28). This suggests continued minimal spread of influenza during Week33.
6. (2) The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza remains extremely low (0.1-0.2 per 100,000), and deaths attributed to influenza are stable and negligible (0.1%). These indicators align with baseline activity trends in the Off-season.
7. (3) There is co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, COVID-19), but they do not appear to add significantly to ILI activity, as vaccination and antiviral resistance data suggest manageable disease control.
8. These factors, coupled with the historical decline pattern, confirm the continuation of low ILI activity.
5. In conclusion, the predicted ILI occurrences in Region 9 after five weeks (Week33, 2024) are 7319. This prediction is driven by the observed decreasing trend in previous weeks, the Off-season classification of the target week, historically consistent baseline ILI activity levels during this season, and the CDC-reported low flu activity, hospitalization, and mortality rates. Quantitative adjustments reflecting the Off-season decline (11% over five weeks) substantiate this forecast.
