1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent and sharp upward trend, with values rising steadily from '1325' (Week 49, 2021) to '3033' (Week 1, 2022). This significant increase highlights escalating respiratory illness activity throughout the period. The most pronounced jump occurred in Week 51, 2021 (2250) to Week 1, 2022 (3033), signaling intensified flu activity leading up to the peak period.
2. A strong positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed. The dramatic increase during the last two weeks of the recorded period (Weeks 51, 2021, and Week 1, 2022) aligns with a subsequent sharp decline to 1063 after 5 weeks (Week 6, 2022), reflective of the natural progression of flu seasons where sharp peaks are often followed by a decline. This suggests that the ILI decline was a direct result of the subsiding flu activity after a seasonal peak.
3. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illnesses showed a marked rise from 2.7% (Week 49, 2021) to 4.3% (Week 1, 2022), exceeding baseline levels in multiple jurisdictions, reflecting a nationwide escalation in flu activity. Hospitalization rates also surged, increasing from 1,057 new flu-related admissions (Week 49, 2021) to 3.4 cumulative admissions per 100,000 population (Week 1, 2022). The compounding effect of severe flu cases and multiple respiratory viruses (SARS-CoV-2 co-circulation) created conditions for the initial spike, with subsequent declines corresponding to reduced transmission activity.
4. Regional variations played a significant role in the patterns observed. Central and eastern U.S. regions experienced higher ILI activity versus the western U.S., which consistently reported lower activity. After the flu peaked in these regions, declines in cases align with the overall future ILI decrease. Lower-than-expected flu vaccination uptake (reported consistently across all weeks) likely exacerbated the initial activity but subsequently stabilized, leading to reduced transmission rates by Week 6, 2022.
5. In summary, the reduction to 1063 future ILI occurrences (Week 6, 2022) after the recorded peak weeks corresponds to the natural flu season culmination. Contributing factors include a sharp initial rise in ILI occurrences, high hospitalization and outpatient visit rates (Weeks 49–Week 1), regional activity variations, and eventual subsiding of Influenza A (H3N2)-driven infections and associated ILI activity. Declines were further influenced by diminished virus transmission post-peak and ongoing public health interventions.
