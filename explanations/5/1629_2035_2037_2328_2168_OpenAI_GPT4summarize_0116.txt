1. Explanation:
1. The past 5 weeks of ILI occurrences (Week37, 2023 to Week41, 2023) show an increasing and then slightly fluctuating trend overall: 1629 → 2035 → 2037 → 2328 → 2168. Week37 (1629) to Week38 (2035) reflects a substantial increase (406 cases, approximately 24.92%). From Week38 (2035) to Week39 (2037), there was minimal change (2 cases, 0.1% increase). Week39 (2037) to Week40 (2328) saw another notable increase (291 cases, approximately 14.29%), followed by a slight decline from Week40 (2328) to Week41 (2168), a reduction of 160 cases (approximately -6.88%). The trend points to overall growth with some fluctuations, suggesting increasing ILI activity influenced by seasonal and external factors.
2. Week46, 2023 belongs to the "Peak season," as it falls within the period typically associated with the highest intensity of ILI activity (Week46 through Week6, the following year). Epidemiologically, this is the time when flu transmission is most widespread, and ILI occurrences traditionally peak.
3. Correlation analysis with historical data shows an increasing trend aligning with the approach to peak season. Using a time-series forecasting method, simple linear regression or weighted moving average can explain the forecasted value: calculate the weekly relative growth rate for the increases (using Week37 to Week40 where increases were consistent) and project forward. Average growth rates for Growing weeks were Week37 to Week38 (24.92%) and Week39 to Week40 (14.29%), which yields a mean growth rate of 19.61%. Applying this average growth rate to Week41's value (2168), we project Week46 as follows:
4. Week46 = 2168 × (1 + average growth rate per week over 5 weeks). Using compound growth over 5 weeks:
5. Week46 = 2168 × (1 + 0.1961)^5 = 3453 (rounded). This reflects a consistent increase aligned with past trends and peak season.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports contributing to this forecast include:
1. Signs of increasing influenza activity were observed in Week41, 2023, with a rise in positivity (1.3%) and steady outpatient ILI visits (2.3%). These indicators point to growing flu activity nationally, particularly in some regions with moderate activity, suggesting a higher future burden.
2. Hospitalization rates significantly increased from Week37 (820) to Week41 (1,228), indicating growing flu severity, which corroborates ILI trends and aligns with the historical rise in cases before peak season.
3. Co-circulation of respiratory pathogens (SARS-CoV-2, RSV with influenza) in all weeks may increase overall susceptibility to respiratory illnesses, fostering flu transmission during a period of heightened activity.
5. The prediction of 3453 cases for Week46, 2023, reflects a combination of increasing ILI trends over the past 5 weeks, the seasonal classification as Peak season, and key factors from CDC reports that indicate growing flu activity, higher hospitalizations, and pathogen interactions.
