1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed variability but demonstrated an overall upward trend towards the end, with values of ['1114', '888', '803', '832', '999']. The initial decrease from 1114 (Week5, 2022) to 803 (Week7, 2022) was followed by a gradual week-to-week increase, reaching 999 (Week9, 2022). This rising pattern at the end of the 5-week period signals escalating ILI activity that aligns with a future increase to 972.
2. A moderate positive correlation exists between the tapering recovery in ILI occurrences by Week9, 2022, and the future occurrences of 972. While past weeks showcased lower values in the middle weeks, the upward trajectory in Week8 and Week9 implies a resurgence in respiratory illness activity contributing to the near-maintenance of elevated future ILI levels.
3. The increasing percentage of positive influenza specimens from 2.0% (Week5, 2022) to 5.8% (Week9, 2022) reflects greater flu activity, with Influenza A(H3N2) dominance at over 97%-99.7%. This contributes directly to the sustained ILI levels observed in the future. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, impacting 5.9% of cases (Week9, 2022), emphasizes the compound effect of multiple viruses fueling ILI occurrences. Low flu vaccination rates throughout the 5 weeks, lower than the prior season, weakened population immunity, keeping ILI occurrences elevated. Increased hospitalization rates, rising consistently from 4.5 per 100,000 (Week5, 2022) to 5.5 per 100,000 (Week9, 2022), indicate worsening illness severity, which correlates with continuing elevated ILI activity in future weeks.
4. The persistence of dominant Influenza A(H3N2) activity with antigenic differences potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness, compounded by increasing positivity rates and co-circulation of respiratory viruses, underpins the observed future ILI value of 972. The upward trend in ILI cases near the end of the observed period paired with ongoing public health concerns such as low vaccination rates and rising hospitalizations explains the sustained ILI levels reported after 5 weeks.
