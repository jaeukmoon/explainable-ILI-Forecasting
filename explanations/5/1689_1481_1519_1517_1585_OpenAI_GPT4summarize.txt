1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks presented a fluctuating trend but with a slight upward movement toward the end of the period. Specifically, values of ['1689', '1481', '1519', '1517', '1585'] (Week 6–Week 10, 2021) show an initial decline from 1689 in Week 6 to 1481 in Week 7, followed by gradual increases in Weeks 8–10, peaking at 1585 in Week 10. This suggests a mild resurgence in ILI activity late in the time frame.  

2. A correlation between the past and future occurrences is discernible. While the fluctuations were relatively modest in the past weeks, the upward drift in Weeks 9 and 10, especially the gradual increase from 1517 (Week 9) to 1585 (Week 10), aligns with and could precede the marked rise to 2066 after 5 weeks, signaling a possible delayed escalation beyond the observation period.  

3. Multiple significant factors from the CDC reports support the future rise. First, reports consistently highlighted growing ILI trends among children aged 0–4 years across Weeks 6–10, 2021, while older age groups showed declines. Increased ILI activity in pediatric populations can amplify the overall future numbers, given their higher susceptibility and potential for transmitting respiratory illnesses. Second, minimal influenza positivity across all weeks (e.g., 0.1% each week) indicates the contribution of other seasonal respiratory illnesses, potentially amplified in subsequent weeks. Third, persistent challenges in healthcare-seeking behavior and surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic complicated reliable ILI tracking, meaning that latent increases in ILI activity might not be fully captured immediately but emerge later, contributing to the sudden future rise to 2066.  

4. In summary, the reported 2066 future ILI occurrences (Week 15, 2021) can be attributed to the slight upward trend in past occurrences (Weeks 9–10, 2021), amplified ILI-related pediatric activity, the ongoing influence of non-influenza respiratory illnesses, and delayed recognition due to disrupted healthcare and surveillance systems during the pandemic. These factors jointly explain the observed future spike.
