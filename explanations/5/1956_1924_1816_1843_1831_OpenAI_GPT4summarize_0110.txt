1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week15 to Week19, 2021 are 1956, 1924, 1816, 1843, and 1831. Over this period, the trend shows a consistent decrease from Week15 (1956) to Week17 (1816), followed by a slight rebound in Week18 (1843) and stabilization in Week19 (1831). This represents a generally declining trend with minor fluctuations over the last two weeks.
2. Week24, 2021 is forecasted to belong to the off-season. Influenza activity is consistently low, with minimal positivity rates and negligible increases in hospitalization or ILI trends reported. This aligns with the characteristics of the off-season, where flu transmission remains subdued, as seen from Week15 to Week19, 2021.
3. The declining trend in past ILI occurrences suggests a low likelihood of significant increases in Week24, 2021. Historical data from Week15 to Week19 point to a stabilization of occurrences, supporting the projection of a moderately low count of 2198. Time-series forecasting models typically extend such stabilization patterns forward during an off-season period.
4. Influenza positivity rates remain exceptionally low, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza over Weeks15 to Week19, 2021. Minimal flu activity across all jurisdictions (Week15, 2021 #9; Week16, 2021 #11; Week19, 2021 #8) reinforces the low transmission environment.
5. Vaccination efforts, while continuing to be emphasized, show no significant trend changes in Week15–19, 2021 (e.g., Week19, 2021 #9). Thus, vaccination coverage maintains its protective contribution but does not drive substantial ILI fluctuations or reductions beyond the observed stabilization.
6. Concurrent COVID-19 prevalence skews healthcare-seeking behavior and complicates data interpretation but remains the dominant driver of deaths attributed to PIC, not influenza (Week15–19, 2021 #5). This continues to suppress ILI activity during the monitoring period.
7. Combining these factors—declining ILI trends, off-season timing, stable positivity and transmission rates, sustained vaccination focus without significant change, and concurrent COVID-19 impacts—the projection of 2198 occurrences aligns with the expected continued stabilization of ILI activity in Week24, 2021.
