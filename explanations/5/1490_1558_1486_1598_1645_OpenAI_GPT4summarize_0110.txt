1. The reported ILI counts from Week16 to Week20, 2021 are 1490, 1558, 1486, 1598, and 1645. This trend shows a mild increase overall, rising from Week16 (1490) to Week17 (1558), followed by slight fluctuations in Week18 (1486) and Week19 (1598), and ending with a further increase in Week20 (1645). The uptick in Week20 indicates a possible stabilization or slight rise in activity after earlier fluctuations.
2. In the U.S., Week25, 2021 falls well outside the typical peak season (spanning Weeks 46–06) and aligns with the off-season period, which generally persists from Week07 through Week31. Reports from Week16 to Week20 confirm unusually low ILI activity, which mirrors off-season characteristics. Thus, Week25, 2021 is most consistent with the off-season period.
3. The time-series analysis reveals slight fluctuations in ILI counts over the past five weeks, with a mild growth trend toward the end, indicating low but gradually rising activity. Projecting this forward, the model anticipates stabilization around recent levels, resulting in a future occurrence close to 1495 ILI cases by Week25, 2021, reflecting minimal variability.
4. Historical influenza activity remains exceptionally low, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for Week16 through Week20. This suggests minimal viral transmission after peak season and supports the off-season classification (Week16, 2021 #1; Week17, 2021 #1; Week18, 2021 #1; Week19, 2021 #1; Week20, 2021 #1).
5. Healthcare-seeking changes due to the continued dominance of COVID-19 in PIC deaths and monitoring hinder accurate assessment of traditional ILI activity (Week16, 2021 #9; Week17, 2021 #9; Week18, 2021 #10; Week19, 2021 #10; Week20, 2021 #10). This creates conditions for potentially obscured but still low ILI trends.
6. Encouragement of vaccination remains consistent, but no significant increase in uptake is noted, which limits its near-term impact on reducing transmission further (Week16, 2021 #8; Week17, 2021 #8; Week18, 2021 #8; Week19, 2021 #9; Week20, 2021 #9).
7. Given the overall static trends in ILI occurrences, off-season timing in Week25, 2021, historically low influenza positivity rates, COVID-19’s impact on healthcare behaviors, and lack of impactful vaccination changes, the forecasted ILI occurrence is 1495, consistent with a low-activity off-season pattern.
