1. The reported ILI counts from Week9 to Week13, 2021 are 1532, 1837, 2021, 1982, and 1977. The trend shows an initial increase from Week9 (1532) to Week11 (2021), followed by a minor decline by Week13 (1977). Overall, the trajectory indicates slight fluctuation, with a peak occurring in Week11 and subsequently leveling off rather than a consistent rise or fall.
2. Based on U.S. season classifications, the target week (Week18, 2021) falls after the typical peak season (Week46–Week6) and during a sustained period of minimal ILI activity. This aligns with the off-season phase, characterized by low influenza transmission and stable patterns. Hence, Week18, 2021 is classified as an off-season period.
3. From the perspective of time-series analysis, the observed pattern of a mild rise followed by stabilization and slight reduction reflects a stable fluctuation of ILI occurrences. It is reasonable to project that these mild fluctuations would continue for the next several weeks, leading to a forecast of 1843 occurrences in Week18, 2021. The historical trajectory supports this projection, given the absence of a pronounced upward or downward trend.
4. Nationwide influenza positivity remains exceptionally low at 0.1% across all five weeks (Week9, 2021 #1; Week10, 2021 #1; Week11, 2021 #1; Week12, 2021 #1; Week13, 2021 #1), reflecting minimal transmission.
5. Cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza are significantly lower compared to past seasons, measured consistently at 0.7 per 100,000 population (Week9, 2021 #7; Week10, 2021 #6; Week11, 2021 #5; Week12, 2021 #6; Week13, 2021 #4), indicating reduced severity and impact of ILI.
6. Health-seeking behavior changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to impact surveillance metrics and outpatient ILI visits, which remain well below the national baseline of 2.6%, sustaining a stable level of 0.8–1.0% throughout the five weeks (Week9, 2021 #4; Week10, 2021 #3; Week11, 2021 #4; Week12, 2021 #4; Week13, 2021 #3). Altered healthcare behavior likely suppresses reported ILI counts.
7. Combining the stabilization of ILI trends, low positivity rates, minimal hospitalization, altered healthcare behaviors, and classification of Week18, 2021 as an off-season, the projected ILI occurrences of 1843 align with the expected continued stability of mild fluctuations.
