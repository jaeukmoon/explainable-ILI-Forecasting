1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks revealed a fluctuating downward trend, with values of ['2081', '2003', '2143', '1755', '1808']. While there was an initial increase from 2081 (Week13, 2024) to 2143 (Week15, 2024), the subsequent weeks demonstrated a decline, reaching 1755 (Week16, 2024). By Week17, 2024, there was a modest rebound to 1808. This pattern reflects declining ILI activity after Week15, 2024.
2. The decline observed in the past time-series, particularly between Weeks 15–17, 2024, correlates with the reduced future ILI occurrences of 1731 noted after 5 weeks. The consistent reduction in Weeks 16 and 17 acts as a predictive indicator of the continued downward trajectory observed in the future data.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually declined from 3.0% (Week13, 2024) to 2.2% (Week17, 2024), settling below the national baseline by Week14, 2024. This steady reduction in clinic visits suggests a corresponding decrease in ILI activity statewide.
4. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza dropped from 9.1% (Week13, 2024) to 3.9% (Week17, 2024), reflecting diminished viral transmission, which aligns with the reported future decline to 1731 occurrences.
5. Declines in hospitalization rates, from 74.2 per 100,000 (Week13, 2024) to 79.8 per 100,000 (Week17, 2024), coupled with consistent decreases in influenza-attributable deaths (0.5% in Week13 to 0.2% in Week17), reinforce the observed downward trend in ILI occurrences over time.
6. Although co-circulating non-influenza respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 were noted throughout this period, their impact on ILI trends appeared stable or declining, as documented in declining virologic activity across most regions.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1731 (Week22, 2024) are consistent with the observed decline in past time-series data, reductions in ILI-related outpatient visits, declining influenza positivity rates, reduced hospitalization and mortality rates, and the weakening activity of co-circulating respiratory viruses.
