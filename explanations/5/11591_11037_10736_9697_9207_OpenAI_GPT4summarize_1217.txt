1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decreasing trend, with values of ['11591', '11037', '10736', '9697', '9207']. There was a steady decline in ILI occurrences every week, starting from 11591 in Week7, 2024, to 9207 in Week11, 2024. This indicates a gradual waning in influenza-like illness activity by the end of the observed 5-week period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the steadily decreasing trend in past occurrences (Weeks 7–11, 2024) aligns with the drop to 7093 cases reported after 5 weeks (Week16, 2024). The ongoing decline during the past 5 weeks, coupled with region-specific reductions highlighted in reports, foreshadows continued reduction in activity leading to the lower value reported after 5 weeks.
3. Region-specific decreases in ILI activity were observed in Weeks 10 and 11, 2024, with flu activity decreasing in most regions except for a slight increase in the Pacific Northwest. This aligns with the overall declining trend in ILI occurrences nationally and contributes significantly to the observed drop to 7093 future cases.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently decreased across the past weeks, declining from 4.5% in Week7, 2024, to 3.4% in Week11, 2024. This downward trend in healthcare-seeking behavior for ILI reports mirrors reduced influenza activity, directly correlating with the continued decline to 7093 occurrences after 5 weeks.
5. Declines in influenza virus positivity rates also contributed to the trend, with clinical lab positivity rates dropping from 14.8% in Week7, 2024, to 12.0% in Week11, 2024. Parallel reductions in Influenza A and Influenza B detections, as well as decreasing hospitalizations and deaths attributed to influenza, illustrate a broad seasonal downturn underpinning the drop to 7093 cases by Week16, 2024.
6. Vaccination efficacy and antiviral interventions played a crucial role, with influenza vaccines closely matching circulating strains and antiviral resistance remaining low across the observed time frame. Sustained vaccination efforts likely mitigated illness severity and transmission, intensifying the reduction in ILI cases reported after 5 weeks.
7. In summary, the reported 7093 future ILI occurrences (Week16, 2024) directly result from the consistent downward trajectory in past occurrences (Weeks 7–11, 2024), regional and national decreases in ILI-related outpatient visits, declining positivity rates for influenza viruses, and reductions in associated hospitalizations and deaths. Effective vaccination coverage and treatment further amplified the decline, ensuring continued reductions in future ILI activity.
