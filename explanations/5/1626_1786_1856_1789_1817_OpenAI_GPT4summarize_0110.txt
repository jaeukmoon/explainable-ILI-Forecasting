1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week18 to Week22, 2021 were 1626, 1786, 1856, 1789, and 1817, respectively. This represents a moderate initial increase from Week18 to Week20, peaking at 1856, followed by minor fluctuations with slight decreasing trends in Week21 and Week22. Overall, this suggests a generally low but mildly fluctuating pattern, with no dramatic surges in occurrences.
2. Forecasting Week27, 2021 as belonging to the off-season is supported by the timing of Week27, which falls after the typical peak season (Week46–Week6) and remains too early for the peak onset season (Week32–Week46). Additionally, the consistently low influenza activity and outpatient respiratory illness visits corroborate the off-season classification.
3. The time-series analysis suggests that the prior ILI trend in Weeks18–22 indicates stability with small fluctuations, reflecting persistently low activity levels. Projecting this trend forward, a continuation of low activity with marginal increases from week-to-week aligns with the forecasted value of 2193 for Week27, 2021.
4. CDC reports indicate that influenza positivity rates in clinical labs remained around 0.1% from Week18 to Week22, confirming minimal virus circulation and low community spread.
5. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below the national baseline of 2.6% (1.2%–1.3%), showing no significant increases across these five weeks despite slight variations in younger age groups (Week18, Week22).
6. Concurrent COVID-19 dominance and altered healthcare-seeking behaviors are noted to significantly distort ILI surveillance and reporting accuracy, maintaining low ILI trends (Week18 #9; Week20 #10; Week22 #7).
7. The observed moderately increasing ILI pattern leading to Week22, aligned with minimal virus circulation and continued off-seasonal flu activity, supports the slightly higher but still low forecast of 2193 for Week27, 2021.
