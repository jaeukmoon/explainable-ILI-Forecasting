1. The reported ILI counts from Week28 to Week32, 2024 are 1421, 1444, 1469, 1509, and 1504. The data indicates a gradual rising trend between Week28 (1421) and Week31 (1509), followed by a slight dip in Week32 (1504). However, the overall trend over the five weeks shows steady growth with minor fluctuations, suggesting a potential gradual increase in ILI activity.
2. Week37, 2024 falls within the peak onset season based on U.S. influenza seasonality. This period typically spans from Week32 to Week46, characterized by the initiation of climbing ILI levels from low offseason activity. Increasing ILI occurrences and CDC-report trends correspond to peak onset season timing.
3. From a time-series perspective, the past five-week ILI data presents a steady upward trajectory. Extrapolating this trend five weeks forward suggests a continuation of this moderate growth. Given the lack of dramatic spikes or plateaus, a progression to an ILI occurrence of 2257 in Week37, 2024 aligns with this model.
4. National influenza activity remains low, with positivity rates decreasing (Week28, 2024 #1; Week29, 2024 #1; Week30, 2024 #1; Week31, 2024 #1; Week32, 2024 #1). However, increasing respiratory visit rates suggest mild upward momentum in activity (Week30, 2024 #3; Week31, 2024 #6; Week32, 2024 #4).
5. Vaccine effectiveness lags due to ongoing antigenic mismatch issues with some circulating strains, reported low vaccine coverage, and decreased vaccine effectiveness (Week31, 2024 #7, #/-
