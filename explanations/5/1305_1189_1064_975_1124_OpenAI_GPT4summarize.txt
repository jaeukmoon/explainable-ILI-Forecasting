1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating trend, with values of ['1305' (Week 36, 2021), '1189' (Week 37, 2021), '1064' (Week 38, 2021), '975' (Week 39, 2021), '1124' (Week 40, 2021)]. The data initially declined sharply from a peak of 1305 in Week 36 to a low of 975 in Week 39. However, by Week 40, the trend reversed toward an increase, rising to 1124. This suggests a potential recovery in ILI occurrences toward the end of the observation period.

2. The correlation between past and future ILI occurrences aligns with the observed rebound by Week 40, 2021. Despite the initial decline in Weeks 37–39, the recovery evident in Week 40 signals an upward trend. This rebound is consistent with the future ILI occurrence reaching 1189 after 5 weeks, indicating continuity in the upward trajectory.

3. Several factors from the CDC reports suggest explanations for future ILI occurrences:  
   - Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below the national baseline (e.g., 1.9% in Week 40, 2021), reflecting suppressed but stable ILI activity likely influenced by non-influenza respiratory pathogens.  
   - Elevated percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) persisted across all weeks (e.g., 18.0% in Week 40, 2021, far exceeding the epidemic threshold). These trends indicate a high burden of respiratory illnesses that may indirectly contribute to future ILI cases.  
   - Circulating non-influenza respiratory viruses were repeatedly identified as primary contributors to ILI increases. Reports in Weeks 36–40 pointed to limited influenza virus transmission while highlighting other respiratory pathogens as key drivers.

4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence of 1189 can be attributed to a fluctuating past trend with a recovery signal by Week 40, 2021, consistent with future increases. Contributing factors include suppressed baseline ILI due to limited influenza activity, high PIC mortality indirectly reflecting respiratory illness burden, and the role of non-influenza respiratory viruses as major contributors to ILI activity.
