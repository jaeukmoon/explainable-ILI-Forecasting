1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated an overall upward trend before declining, with values of ['1079', '1171', '1320', '1416', '1293']. There was a progressive increase from 1079 (Week 43, 2020) to a peak of 1416 (Week 46, 2020), followed by a decline to 1293 in Week 47, 2020. This pattern suggests a general rise in ILI activity over the early weeks, which then stabilized at a high level by the end of the observed period.

2. The reported future ILI occurrences of 1069 (Week 52, 2020) correlate with the declining trend toward the end of the past data series (Weeks 46–47, 2020). While ILI activity peaked mid-period (Week 46, 2020), the subsequent reduction to 1293 by Week 47 aligns with the lower future value, indicating a continuation of the downtrend.

3. Several factors from the CDC reports contribute to the future ILI occurrences of 1069:  
   - Outpatient visits for ILI gradually increased from 1.2% (Week 43, 2020) to 1.6% (Week 47, 2020), showing a modest elevation in healthcare encounters, though still below the 2.6% national baseline.  
   - Persistent high percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) were noted, climbing from 8.2% in Week 43 to 11.3% in Week 47, consistently exceeding the epidemic threshold. This reflects ongoing respiratory illness activity despite low influenza positivity rates.  
   - Influenza positivity rates remained low (e.g., 0.2% in Weeks 43 and 47, 2020), with minimal lab detections. However, the broader respiratory illness burden likely contributed to sustaining ILI activity, influenced significantly by COVID-19 and limited flu virus transmission.

4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1069 (Week 52, 2020) can be attributed to the earlier growth followed by a decline in past ILI trends, moderate increases in ILI-related outpatient visits despite remaining below baseline levels, and sustained respiratory illness activity driven by PIC mortality and non-specific respiratory pathogens, reinforced by the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
