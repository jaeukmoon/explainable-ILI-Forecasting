1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Week 18 to Week 22, 2021) followed a fluctuating trajectory: ['1626', '1786', '1856', '1789', '1817']. After a notable increase from 1626 (Week 18, 2021) to 1856 (Week 20, 2021), there was a minor decline to 1789 (Week 21, 2021) before a slight rise to 1817 in Week 22, 2021. This pattern indicates relatively stable yet slightly increasing ILI activity toward the later weeks of the observed period.

2. A moderate positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences. The gradual rise in ILI values during the observed 5-week period, particularly the peak of 1856 in Week 20, 2021, aligns with the eventual increase to 2193 future occurrences by Week 27, 2021. This trend suggests a sustained or gradually intensifying ILI activity.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed stability at 1.2% for Weeks 18 and 19, 2021, followed by a slight increase to 1.3% (Week 20, 2021), and a subsequent return to 1.1–1.2% for Weeks 21 and 22, 2021. Although below the baseline, this subtle fluctuation in outpatient ILI visits may reflect underlying respiratory illness activity contributing to the future rise in occurrences.
   
4. Percentages of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained above epidemic thresholds throughout Weeks 18 to 22, 2021, though largely associated with COVID-19. Notably, PIC deaths decreased from 10.9% (Week 18) to 7.5% (Week 22, 2021). This persistent respiratory illness burden likely overlaps with ILI trends captured in the observed data.

5. Disruptions in ILI surveillance methods due to alternative healthcare-seeking behaviors amid the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasized across all reports, may have delayed the accurate detection of ILI cases. These disruptions could have contributed to the apparent stabilization of ILI in the immediate term but ultimately fueled an eventual increase in future occurrences.

6. Minimal influenza activity (e.g., 0.1% positivity rates in all weeks, limited lab-detected cases) indicates continued low influenza-specific contributions to ILI data. However, the persistence of other respiratory pathogens or non-specific ILI activity, influenced by pandemic-related shifts, likely drove the rise in future ILI cases.

7. In summary, the reported 2193 future ILI occurrences (Week 27, 2021) are attributable to the slight upward trend in Weeks 20–22, 2021, small fluctuations in outpatient visits for ILI, persistent PIC mortality levels, disrupted healthcare-seeking patterns, and non-influenza respiratory illness contributions amplified by the pandemic context.
