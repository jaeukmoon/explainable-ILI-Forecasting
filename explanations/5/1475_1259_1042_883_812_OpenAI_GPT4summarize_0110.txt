1. The reported ILI counts from Week1 to Week5, 2021, show a clear downward trend. Starting at a high of 1475 in Week1, 2021, occurrences steadily declined through Week5, 2021 (812). The drop reflects a significant reduction over time without notable fluctuations, suggesting a consistent decline in ILI activity during this period.
2. Week10, 2021, is part of the off-season for the U.S. This aligns with ongoing low ILI activity and influenza positivity below baseline thresholds (Week1, 2021 #1; Week2, 2021 #4; Week4, 2021 #3). The influenza positivity rate from surveillance data remained far below expectations for peak or peak onset seasons, confirming Week10, 2021, falls in the off-season period.
3. The time series pattern of steady declines from Week1 to Week5, 2021, strongly influences the prediction of lower ILI occurrences in Week10, 2021. The consistent decline, coupled with no signs of resurgence or significant spikes, justifies projecting a further reduction, providing a predictive baseline of the ILI count reaching 606 after five weeks.
4. Nationwide influenza positivity remained exceptionally low, ranging between 0.1% and 0.4% across clinical and public health labs (Week1, 2021 #1, #3; Week4, 2021 #1; Week5, 2021 #1), indicating minimal transmission and subdued influenza activity. This suppression strongly correlates with lower ILI occurrences.
5. Outpatient respiratory visits for ILI consistently dropped below the national baseline (2.6%), reaching just 1.1% by Week5, 2021 (Week1, 2021 #4; Week4, 2021 #3; Week5, 2021 #4). This metric reflects reduced flu-like presentation in the community, aligning with declining ILI occurrences.
6. The dominant influence of COVID-19 (PIC deaths: 14.7% to 28.4%, Week2, 2021 #6; Week4, 2021 #5) continued to suppress traditional influenza behaviors due to alternative healthcare utilization patterns and limited transmission of seasonal influenza strains (Week1, 2021 #9, #10; Week3, 2021 #7, #10). These disruptions likely prevent a significant rise in ILI numbers.
7. Bringing these factors together, the persistent decline in ILI activity, the off-season classification for Week10, 2021, the very low influenza positivity, and the ongoing strong influence of COVID-19 confirm the expected ILI occurrence of 606. This prediction reflects the sustained suppression of influenza transmission and subdued community activity, consistent with historical trends and the pandemic's influence.
