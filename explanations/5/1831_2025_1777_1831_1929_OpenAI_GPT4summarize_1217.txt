1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed slight fluctuations without a clear upward or downward trajectory, with values of ['1831', '2025', '1777', '1831', '1929']. There was an initial increase from 1831 (Week19, 2021) to 2025 (Week20, 2021), followed by a decline to 1777 (Week21, 2021). A small recurrent rise was observed to 1831 (Week22, 2021), ending with a moderate increase to 1929 (Week23, 2021). This inconsistent pattern indicates variable ILI activity during the observed period.
2. The increase to 2386 future occurrences after 5 weeks may correlate with the moderate resurgence noted in Week22 and Week23, 2021. The trend toward the latter weeks suggests a gradual recovery in ILI activity that serves as a precursor to the reported rise over the following 5 weeks.
3. Despite minimal influenza activity, outpatient visits for ILI slightly increased from 1.1% (Week21, 2021) to 1.2% (Week22 and Week23, 2021), which, though below the national baseline, signals a potential buildup in respiratory-related healthcare visits contributing to the future rise. Additionally, pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC)-associated deaths remained persistently above the epidemic threshold, ranging from 8.3% (Week21, 2021) to 7.6% (Week23, 2021), driven largely by COVID-19 but indicative of continued respiratory health challenges. The identification of novel influenza variants, such as H1N2v or H3N2v in Week20 and Week21, 2021, underscored the need for sustained surveillance amidst an evolving viral landscape. Behavioral changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic complicated traditional surveillance, introducing potential underreporting or delays that likely surfaced as elevated occurrences weeks later.
4. Collectively, these factors – the erratic yet slightly rising trend in past occurrences, the gradual increase in ILI-related visits, above-threshold PIC mortality, and disrupted surveillance systems – underlie the increase to 2386 occurrences 5 weeks later.
