1. The reported ILI counts from Week17 to Week21, 2023 are 1770, 1795, 1933, 1847, and 1762. The trend displays a moderate increase from Week17 (1770) to Week19 (1933), followed by a decline in Week20 (1847) and Week21 (1762). This behavior can be classified as a fluctuating pattern with a peak around Week19, indicating no sustained increase or consistent drop.
2. In the U.S., the off-season generally spans from right after the peak season up to the next peak onset (from Week1, 2023 to Week31, 2023). The reported low ILI activity (below the baseline) during Weeks17-21, 2023 aligns with off-season characteristics. Hence, Week26, 2023 belongs to the off-season period.
3. The decreasing trend in ILI counts during the latter weeks (from Week19 onward) suggests a movement toward lower activity. Time-series models typically consider recent patterns as stronger indicators, with declining ILI occurrences leading to lower projected values. When projecting forward five weeks, the model anticipates continued low activity with minor fluctuations, leading to a forecast of 1220 ILI occurrences for Week26, 2023.
4. Influenza activity levels remained consistently low nationally, with 0.9-1.2% positivity from Week17 to Week21, 2023. No significant surges or upward seasonal changes were noted during this period, aligning with stable off-season trends (Week17-21, 2023 #1).
5. Vaccination coverage remained constant, and most circulating strains were antigenically similar to vaccine strains (Week17, 2023 #9; Week18, 2023 #9; Week19, 2023 #7; Week21, 2023 #9). Thus, immunization efforts effectively mitigated risks of rising ILI cases during the forecasted period.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, contributed to respiratory illness patterns but did not escalate influenza-specific ILI significantly (Week17, 2023 #10; Week19, 2023 #9; Week21, 2023 #8). This stabilizing factor supports the prediction of low ILI counts.
7. The forecast of 1220 ILI occurrences in Week26, 2023 is justified by the declining ILI trend in recent weeks, consistent off-season classification, matched vaccine coverage, and minimal influenza positivity reported nationwide.
