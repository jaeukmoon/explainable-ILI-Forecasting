1. The ILI occurrences from Week8, 2024 to Week12, 2024 reported a consistent decline. Counts decreased as follows: 11037 in Week8, 10736 in Week9, 9697 in Week10, 9207 in Week11, and 9168 in Week12. This pattern represents a clear downward trend over the five weeks, without any significant spikes or irregularities.
2. Week17, 2024 falls within the off-season period for ILI activity in the U.S., as it is well after the typical peak season (ending around Week6, 2024). The declining ILI activity over the past few weeks and diminished positivity rates support this off-season classification.
3. The past declining trend from Week8 to Week12, 2024 suggests a continued reduction in ILI occurrences in the coming weeks. Projecting from the time-series perspective, the ongoing decreases combined with historical patterns in seasonal behavior point to the stabilization of ILI activity at a lower baseline level over the next five weeks, aligning with the prediction of 6135 occurrences by Week17, 2024.
4. Despite the slight variability in regional trends during Week8 to Week12, 2024, overall national influenza activity has been decreasing consistently. By Week12, the percentage of positive respiratory specimens fell to 10.5%, reinforcing attenuation in ILI occurrences and aligning with expectations of reduced illness levels during the off-season.
5. Vaccination coverage and its matching effectiveness against circulating strains remain supportive. Though no new vaccination trends were reported, CDC confirmed that vaccines are aligned with predominant A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and Influenza B/Victoria, contributing to lower flu transmission (Week9, 2024 #8; Week10, 2024 #10).
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses such as RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and others continue to affect respiratory illness trends (Week8, 2024 #10; Week12, 2024 #8). However, these influences do not appear to intensify ILI rates significantly and are unlikely to disrupt the projected decline in influenza cases moving into Week17.
7. Given the ongoing declines in ILI counts, positivity rates, and outpatient visits, coupled with effective vaccination against circulating strains and the off-season timing of Week17, 2024, the projected ILI occurrences of 6135 are justified as reflective of continued stabilization and reduced community transmission.
