1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks indicated a steady decline in values from 2058 (Week21, 2022) to 1399 (Week24, 2022), followed by a slight rebound to 1543 in Week25, 2022. This overall downward trend, coupled with a minor increase in the final week, reflects a reduction in ILI activity with hints of stabilization by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A strong correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the consistent decline observed during Weeks 21-24, 2022, aligns with the reduced value of 785 future occurrences by Week30, 2022. The slight rebound in Week25 could contribute to the moderate level of ILI activity seen after the 5-week period.
3. Influenza positivity rates significantly decreased from 5.7% (Week21, 2022) to 1.8% (Week25, 2022) across clinical specimens, indicating a waning flu season that aligns with the reduction in ILI in future weeks. The gradual drop in outpatient visits dedicated to ILI, from 2.3% in Week21 to 1.8% in Week25, further correlates with a decline in healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory illnesses, consistent with lower future ILI occurrences. The impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, remained a notable factor but showed diminishing contributions over time, reflected in the reduced future ILI activity. The effect of reduced antigenic match between vaccines and H3N2 strains may have maintained some residual activity but was insufficient to prevent the decline in overall ILI rates.
4. Late-season influenza decline, reduced outpatient healthcare-seeking for respiratory illness, and diminishing co-contributions from other respiratory pathogens traditionally associated with ILI collectively drove the drop to 785 future cases.
5. In summary, the reported 785 future ILI occurrences (Week30, 2022) stem from the overarching downward trend in ILI cases across Weeks 21–24, 2022, diminishing influenza positivity rates, decreased outpatient respiratory-related visits, and subsiding contributions of co-circulating respiratory illnesses. The slight rebound in Week25 suggests sustained low-level activity but no significant resurgence.
