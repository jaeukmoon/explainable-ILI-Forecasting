1. The reported ILI counts from Week12 to Week16, 2022 are 1141, 1117, 1021, 1166, and 1474. Initially, the trend steadily declined from Week12 (1141) to Week14 (1021). However, a significant increase was observed in Week15 (1166) and further intensified by Week16 (1474). Overall, the trend demonstrates an upward trajectory toward the end of the observed period, suggesting a rise in ILI activity in the coming weeks.
2. Forecasting that Week21, 2022 belongs to the off-season aligns with the general background knowledge, as it falls after the typical influenza peak season (Week46, 2021 through Week6, 2022). However, it is notable that Week19, 2022 often exhibits a secondary peak, which could influence the ILI occurrences during this off-season period.
3. Extrapolating from the upward trajectory observed in Week15 and Week16, 2022, where the ILI counts increased substantially, the time-series pattern points toward continued growth in activity. The substantial rise from 1166 (Week15) to 1474 (Week16) reflects intensifying transmission closer to Week21. Based on this trend, the time-series forecasting model anticipates a moderate continuation of this upward trend, resulting in a projection of 2058 ILI occurrences for Week21, 2022.
4. Nationwide influenza positivity rates in clinical labs increased steadily across the timeline: 6.5% in Week12, 8.3% in Week13, 8.4% in Week14, 8.9% in Week15, and 7.8% in Week16. This sustained high positivity rate, particularly driven by Influenza A(H3N2), highlights ongoing transmission (Week12, 2022 #2; Week13, 2022 #2; Week14, 2022 #2; Week15, 2022 #2; Week16, 2022 #1, #2).
5. Respiratory visits associated with ILI have gradually increased, ending at 2.1% in Week16, still below baseline but showing steady growth since Week12 (1.8%). The increasing outpatient activity across regions and age groups signals expanding influenza activity at community levels (Week12, 2022 #4; Week13, 2022 #4; Week14, 2022 #4; Week15, 2022 #4; Week16, 2022 #6, #9).
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, are a significant confounder, with 5.0%-5.4% of tested specimens positive for both influenza and COVID-19 across Weeks12-16. This overlap may complicate attribution but underscores a rising burden of respiratory illness amidst increasing hospitalization rates (Week12, 2022 #9; Week13, 2022 #13; Week14, 2022 #9; Week15, 2022 #11; Week16, 2022 #9).
7. Considering a consistent upward trend in positivity rates and respiratory visits, the rising burden of Influenza A(H3N2), and a time-series model projecting moderate continuation of this trend, the forecast of 2058 ILI occurrences for Week21, 2022 is justified despite its occurrence in the off-season.
