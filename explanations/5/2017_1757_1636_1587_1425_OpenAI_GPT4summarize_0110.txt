1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week21 to Week25, 2024 are 2017, 1757, 1636, 1587, and 1425. There is a clear downward trend, with consistent week-to-week decreases in occurrence. This pattern reflects a seasonal decline without any significant spikes, which is typical for influenza activity during later stages of the off-season.
2. Based on historical seasonality in the U.S., Week30, 2024 falls within the off-season, characterized by low ILI activity and minimal virus transmission. This classification aligns with the declining trends in both ILI activity and influenza positivity rates observed in the preceding weeks.
3. From the time-series perspective, the ongoing decline in ILI occurrences suggests a steady decrease in cases as the off-season progresses. The projection for 1469 occurrences in Week30, 2024 reflects a consistent extrapolation of this downward trend, assuming no sudden deviations or external disruptions.
4. Influenza positivity rates remain extremely low across Weeks21-25, 2024, declining from 1.7% to 1.1% (Week21, 2024 #1; Week25, 2024 #1). This reinforces the anticipated minimal ILI activity in Week30, 2024.
5. Circulating virus strains match the current vaccine components, with no significant antiviral resistance observed (Week21, 2024 #10, #11; Week25, 2024 #8). This compatibility likely reduces community transmission and mitigates future surges.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 contribute to multifactorial ILI trends (Week21, 2024 #12; Week25, 2024 #10) but remain stable without driving any notable increases in ILI activity.
7. Considering the steady downward trend in ILI counts, the off-season timing of Week30, 2024, the low influenza positivity rates, effective vaccine-virus match, limited antiviral resistance, and stable co-circulation dynamics, the projected ILI occurrence of 1469 aligns with expectations for the period.
