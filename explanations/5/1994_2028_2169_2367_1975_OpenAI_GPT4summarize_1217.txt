1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed fluctuating trends, with values of ['1994', '2028', '2169', '2367', '1975']. An initial increase was observed from 1994 (Week51, 2020) to 2367 (Week53, 2020), followed by a significant decrease to 1975 (Week2, 2021). While high variability exists, the downward trend in Week2, 2021 signifies a possible reduction in ILI activity toward the end of the period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is less evident due to the mixed pattern in past data. The decrease in Week2, 2021 from earlier peaks (Week53, 2020) contrasts with the future reported count of 1503 occurrences (Week7, 2021). This suggests a delayed or non-linear reflection of earlier higher periods, indicating possible external influencing factors.
3. Most ILI outpatient visit percentages remained stable or declined, reporting 1.6% for Weeks51-53, 2020 and a drop to 1.4% by Week2, 2021, consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%. This stability highlights a minimal direct contribution of outpatient ILI visits to the future ILI surge, potentially indicating external influences. Influenza positivity rates were exceptionally low throughout the period, with clinical positivity ranging from 0.1% to 0.4%, showing minimal influenza spread. Public health lab contributions were similarly negligible, with only sparse positive detections. PIC mortality remained significantly above epidemic thresholds, peaking at 17.2% in Week1, 2021, predominantly due to COVID-19, reflecting the ongoing respiratory disease burden.
4. Reduced influenza-associated hospitalization rates were evident (e.g., 101 cases by Week52, 2020, increasing to 129 by Week1, 2021), alongside unusual trends tied to low influenza transmission. This factor, combined with fewer lab-confirmed cases, aligns with an atypical season potentially influenced by pandemic pressures rather than pure influenza trends.
5. In summary, the reported 1503 future ILI occurrences (Week7, 2021) appear influenced by the mixed past trends, minimal influenza positivity, and pandemic-related behavioral changes affecting surveillance and reporting. The stability in outpatient ILI percentages and persistently high PIC mortality mirror the sustained respiratory illness burden, albeit with deviations from traditional influenza-driven patterns. These dynamics together underscore the complex origins of reported future ILI totals amidst an atypical respiratory season.
