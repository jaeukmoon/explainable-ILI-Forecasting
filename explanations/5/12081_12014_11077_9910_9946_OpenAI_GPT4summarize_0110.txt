1. The reported ILI counts from Week21 to Week25, 2024, are 12081, 12014, 11077, 9910, and 9946. Overall, the trend exhibits a clear decline from Week21 to Week24, dropping from 12081 (Week21) to 9910 (Week24), followed by a slight increase to 9946 in Week25. This indicates a decreasing trend with some stabilization at lower activity levels toward Week25.
2. Forecasting for the target week (Week30, 2024) places it within the off-season. Based on background knowledge, the U.S. off-season generally spans from approximately Week9 to Week30 before the typical peak-onset season begins. Low influenza activity observed in Weeks21–25, 2024 (e.g., low positivity, low hospitalizations, and stable deaths) further corroborates that Week30, 2024, belongs to the off-season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the declining trend in ILI occurrences with stabilization toward Week25 suggests the future trajectory will remain stable or slightly lower. This aligns with typical off-season patterns where influenza activity stays minimal. Projecting forward from Week25, the model anticipates that ILI occurrences will normalize at around 10818 by Week30, 2024.
4. Influenza test positivity in clinical labs decreased steadily from 1.7% (Week21, 2024) to 1.1% (Week25, 2024), with all values remaining below the epidemic threshold and indicating low nationwide influenza activity.
5. Currently circulating influenza viruses closely match vaccine components, with high antigenic similarity and low antiviral resistance (Week21, 2024 #10; Week24, 2024 #3; Week25, 2024 #8). This suggests effective vaccine-mediated control during the off-season.
6. Multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., COVID-19, RSV, influenza) continue co-circulating, contributing to ILI trends (Week21, 2024 #12; Week23, 2024 #9; Week25, 2024 #10). However, their cumulative impact remains low, with no evidence of surges in overall respiratory illnesses.
7. In summary, the off-season classification for Week30, 2024, the declining yet stabilizing trend in ILI occurrences, effective vaccine matching, and the low flu activity observed nationally support the prediction of 10818 ILI occurrences for Week30, 2024.
