1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating but overall decreasing trend, with values of ['1878', '1787', '1719', '1761', '1721']. The initial decline from 1878 (Week26, 2023) to 1719 (Week28, 2023) was followed by a slight increase to 1761 (Week29, 2023), but a subsequent drop to 1721 (Week30, 2023) marked the end of the series. This pattern reflects an overall reduction in ILI activity over the observed weeks, without significant volatility.
2. A negative correlation is apparent between past and future ILI occurrences. The past period's downward trend in ILI values (Weeks26–30, 2023), coupled with minimal activity reported in the summarized data, contrasts with the spike to 3153 occurrences after 5 weeks, indicating an abrupt resurgence or external contributing factors beyond the documented period.
3. Hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed influenza varied minimally over the 5 weeks, from 807 (Week26, 2023) to 573 (Week29, 2023) and 649 (Week30, 2023). Although hospitalizations reflect reduced activity, the sudden rise to 3153 may signal delayed case recognition or an increase due to other circulating pathogens, such as RSV or SARS-CoV-2.
4. Nationwide outpatient visits for ILI consistently accounted for 1.4% (Week26, 2023) to 1.1% (Week29, 2023) of patient visits, remaining below the national baseline. However, specific age groups, such as children under 5 years, showed higher visit rates (4.5%–4.2%), suggesting a vulnerable population driving future cases.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 were consistently emphasized across Week26–Week30, potentially exacerbating ILI activity. These additional pathogens could significantly contribute to the sudden escalation in future ILI occurrences, alongside minimal immunity from influenza exposure due to low flu activity.
6. In summary, the reported 3153 future ILI occurrences (Week35, 2023) likely result from the overall decline in Weeks26–30, 2023, sharp age-specific outpatient vulnerabilities (particularly pediatric), consistent co-circulation of respiratory pathogens (RSV and SARS-CoV-2), and external resurgence factors such as delayed recognition, vaccination gaps, or regional influenza variability unaccounted for during the past 5-week period.
