1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1729', '1931', '1902', '1977', '2104']. There was an initial increase from 1729 (Week 11, 2022) to 1931 (Week 12, 2022), followed by a slight dip to 1902 in Week 13, 2022, and then a steady rise over the next two weeks, peaking at 2104 in Week 15, 2022. This pattern reflects escalating ILI activity throughout the observed period.
2. A strong correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the rising trend in the past weeks (Weeks 14–15, 2022) aligns with the reported jump to 3625 future occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 20, 2022). The consecutive increases in the latter half of the 5 weeks indicate momentum in transmission, leading to the substantial rise in future occurrences.
3. Rising outpatient visits for ILI were consistently showcased in the reports, climbing from 1.8% (Week 11, 2022) to 2.1% (Week 15, 2022). These sustained increases suggest growing healthcare-seeking behavior tied to respiratory illnesses, contributing directly to the amplified future ILI levels.
4. Persistent increases in influenza hospitalizations were evident, with rates moving from 6.5 per 100,000 (Week 11, 2022) to 9.8 per 100,000 (Week 15, 2022), reflecting heightened severe illness levels. This trend aligns with the observed surge in ILI occurrences as hospital data often mirrors larger population-level respiratory trends.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, like COVID-19 and influenza A(H3N2), was noted weekly, with testing positivity for influenza rising from 7.7% (Week 11, 2022) to 8.9% (Week 15, 2022). This dual-virus activity, combined with co-infection rates of around 5%, indicates compounded effects likely elevating ILI numbers in the future timeline.
6. In summary, the rise of future ILI occurrences to 3625 (Week 20, 2022) is attributed to the observable upward trend in past data, increasing outpatient ILI visits, escalating hospitalization rates, and intensified co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, all of which signaled heightened transmission and symptomatic illnesses in the population over time.
