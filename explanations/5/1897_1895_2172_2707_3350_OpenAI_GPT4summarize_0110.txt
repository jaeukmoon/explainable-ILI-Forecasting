1. The reported ILI counts from Week42, 2023 to Week46, 2023 are 1897, 1895, 2172, 2707, and 3350. The data demonstrates a consistent upward trend, with noticeable increases each week, particularly from Week43 (1895) to Week46 (3350). The trajectory reflects a steady and accelerating rise in ILI occurrences, indicating growing influenza activity leading into the peak season.
2. Forecasting the target week, Week51, 2023, aligns with being in the peak season. Typically, the U.S. peak season spans from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the following year. The current trend of increasing positivity rates and ILI activity confirms that Week51, 2023 falls within this window of maximum influenza activity.
3. The correlation analysis suggests that the consistent growth in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks, particularly sharp increases in Week45 and Week46, is predictive of further increases. Extending this rising pattern forward by five weeks projects continued growth in influenza activity, reflected in the elevated occurrence forecast for Week51, 2023 (5807).
4. A. National ILI positivity rates showed a dramatic rise, increasing from 1.7% in Week42 to 4.9% in Week46, accompanied by higher outpatient respiratory illness visits (Week42 #5; Week43 #3; Week44 #8; Week45 #3; Week46 #3). This surge in positivity indicates heightened transmissibility and severity of influenza.
5. B. Cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza have risen sharply, from 0.5 per 100,000 in Week42 to 2.6 per 100,000 in Week46, marking the second-highest hospitalization rates for Week46 since 2010. This trend (Week42 #3; Week43 #4; Week44 #3; Week45 #4; Week46 #4) underscores severe disease impact and supports predictions of elevated ILI occurrences in Week51, 2023.
6. C. Increasing co-circulation of respiratory viruses, particularly COVID-19 and RSV, contributes to the higher proportion of respiratory visits and complicates ILI trends (Week42 #8; Week43 #7; Week44 #10; Week45 #10; Week46 #9). This interplay intensifies the ILI caseload, magnifying the projected Week51, 2023 value.
5. The observed trends in increasing ILI counts, hospitalizations, and positivity rates characterize Week51, 2023 as a period of widespread and intense influenza transmission during the peak season. Given these factors, the projected value of 5807 reflects the anticipated progression of current influenza activity and its convergence with seasonal dynamics, supported by rising outpatient activity and co-circulating respiratory viruses.
