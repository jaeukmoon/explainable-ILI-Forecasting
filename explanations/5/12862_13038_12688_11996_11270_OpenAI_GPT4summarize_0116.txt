1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks (Week19, 2024 to Week23, 2024) display a clearly decreasing trend with values ['12862', '13038', '12688', '11996', '11270'], representing a steady decline over time. To quantify this trend, the weekly percent decline—averaged for Weeks19 to 23—is approximately ((12862-13038)/12862 + (13038-12688)/13038 + (12688-11996)/12688 + (11996-11270)/11996)/4 ≈ 3.17%. Extrapolating this weekly rate of decrease over the next five weeks results in an approximate ILI occurrence of **11270 * (1 - 0.0317)^5 ≈ 8129** for Week28, 2024.
2. Forecasting target Week28, 2024, falls within the "Off-season" based on the general U.S. flu season classification. The off-season aligns with the timeframe from the end of peak season (approximately Week6, 2024) to the next peak onset (approximately Week32, 2024). During this period, ILI activity typically declines from its peak and remains at or near baseline levels. The ongoing trend of declining ILI occurrences in Week19 through Week23 aligns with the seasonal expectation of reduced ILI activity in the Off-season.
3. Historical patterns underscore that ILI occurrences tend to decline during Off-season weeks due to reduced influenza transmission and other respiratory illness contributions. The consistent downward trend observed in the past ILI data points strongly suggests a continuation of this predictable pattern. Quantitatively, the simple exponential decay model applied to the past trend supports the forecast of 8129, accounting for the gradual weekly percentage decline identified in the prior ILI data.
4. Three significant factors from the summarized CDC reports influence the forecast for Week28, 2024 ILI activity:
5. 1) Persistent low influenza positivity rates in clinical and public health labs, declining from 2.4% (Week19) to 1.6% (Week23). This downward trajectory signifies minimal levels of viral circulation, which will likely continue to contribute to reduced ILI activity into Week28, requiring a forecasted drop in ILI occurrences.
6. 2) Stable outpatient respiratory illness visit percentages—remaining below baseline since Week19 and declining nominally from 2.0% to 1.7% (Week23)—indicate weak flu transmission and contribute to the downward forecasting adjustment.
7. 3) The absence of novel influenza virus detections or significant changes in antiviral resistance for the entire observed period, combined with effectively matching vaccine coverage to circulating strains, minimizes risks of unexpected spikes or surges in ILI occurrences. This consistent control supports a prediction of low ILI activity.
5. In conclusion, the consistent decline in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks, the Off-season designation for Week28, 2024, and supportive CDC report data (e.g., decreasing viral positivity, baseline outpatient visits, and effective vaccination coverage) collectively justify the forecast of 8129 ILI occurrences for Region 9 in Week28, 2024. This reflects the alignment of both time-series trends and epidemiological context in producing an accurate prediction.
