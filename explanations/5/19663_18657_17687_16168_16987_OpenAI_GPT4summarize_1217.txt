1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a gradual decline starting from 19663 (Week3, 2024) to 16168 (Week6, 2024), followed by a slight rebound in the last week, reaching 16987 (Week7, 2024). This pattern suggests a decreasing trend in ILI activity over the initial weeks, with minor resurgence toward the end of the observed period.
2. A correlation between the decreasing trend of past ILI occurrences and the lower future value of 14964 (predicted for Week12, 2024) is evident. The gradual decline followed by low stabilization in past weeks is consistent with the observed decrease in projected ILI cases, indicating continuity in reduced transmission dynamics.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained above the national baseline but exhibited stability, fluctuating between 4.3%-4.5% over Weeks3–7, 2024. This persistent yet non-increasing ILI activity aligns with the decrease in ILI occurrences reported for Week12, 2024.
4. The cumulative hospitalization rates showed a declining trend, rising modestly (43.3 per 100,000 in Week3, 2024, to 58.2 in Week7, 2024) but with stabilization by Week6 and Week7. Hospitalizations predominantly due to Influenza A (approximately 88%) reflect control over influenza-associated severe cases, supporting the reduction in ILI cases in Week12, 2024.
5. Mortality due to influenza steadily decreased over the 5-week period, from 1.1% in Week3, 2024, to 0.8% in Week7, 2024. This contraction in influenza-related deaths indicates a decreasing burden of illness, correlating with the reduced future ILI occurrences.
6. Despite sustained influenza positivity rates (ranging from 14.2% in Week3, 2024, to 15.7% in Week6, 2024), the relatively stable subtype distributions (dominance of A(H1N1)pdm09) combined with increasing vaccination uptake may have mitigated further transmission, contributing to the decline observed in Week12, 2024.
7. In summary, the decrease to 14964 occurrences (Week12, 2024) can be attributed to the overall declining trend in ILI cases across the observed weeks, consistent outpatient visit rates, reduced hospitalization and mortality rates, stable influenza positivity with vaccination efforts, and limited indication of escalating respiratory co-infections.
