1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show moderate fluctuation, with values ['1706', '1484', '1623', '1558', '1873']. There was a decline from 1706 (Week 41, 2020) to 1484 (Week 42, 2020), followed by a rise to 1623 (Week 43, 2020), a slight decrease to 1558 (Week 44, 2020), and then a noticeable increase to 1873 (Week 45, 2020), the highest in the observed period. This indicates a recent acceleration in ILI case activity by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A clear positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the sharp increase in Week 45, 2020, closely precedes the reported spike to 2222 future occurrences. The pronounced growth from Week 44 to Week 45 likely signals sustained momentum leading to the observed rise after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually climbed from 1.2% (Week 41, 2020) to 1.5% (Week 45, 2020), reflecting a steady growth in healthcare utilization for respiratory illnesses. This increase suggests higher ILI activity, which aligns with the future surge.
4. Mortality due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, rising from 7.2% (Week 41, 2020) to 8.9% (Week 45, 2020). The persistently high PIC deaths reflect escalating respiratory illness, acting as a precursor to the jump in future ILI occurrences.
5. With minimal flu detection rates (e.g., 0.3% in Week 41, 2020, and 0.2% in Week 45, 2020), non-influenza respiratory illnesses likely contributed substantially to ILI counts. Compounded by healthcare disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, delayed or redirected care-seeking may have further amplified future ILI activity.
6. In summary, the reported 2222 future ILI occurrences (Week 50, 2020) can be attributed to the upward trends in Weeks 45, increasing outpatient ILI visits, persistently high PIC mortality rates above epidemic thresholds, and compounded pandemic-related healthcare behavior changes affecting surveillance metrics.
