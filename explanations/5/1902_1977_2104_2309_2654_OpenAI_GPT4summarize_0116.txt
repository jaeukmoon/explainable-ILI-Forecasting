1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks (Week13, 2022 to Week17, 2022) show a consistent upward trend: 1902, 1977, 2104, 2309, and 2654. The week-over-week increases are approximately 75, 127, 205, and 345, indicating a progressively accelerating growth rate. The average week-over-week growth rate is approximately 8.87%. This suggests that ILI occurrences are steadily increasing at an accelerating pace, influenced by growing transmission rates reflected in both time-series data and CDC reports.
2. Season Classification for Week22, 2022: Week22 falls within the "Peak season" as defined in the given background knowledge since Week19 has been identified as a secondary peak season for some years, and Week22 directly follows this activity-driven period. During the peak season, ILI activity typically reaches heightened levels due to widespread flu transmission and related respiratory illnesses.
3. A correlation analysis between past trends and future ILI occurrences centers on the steadily increasing week-over-week growth rate of ILI cases. Extrapolating from recent trends, the week-over-week growth rate of approximately 8.87% when applied for the next 5 weeks (from Week17 to Week22, 2022) results in the following simplified forecast:
4. - Week18 = 2654 × 1.0887 ≈ 2889
5. - Week19 = 2889 × 1.0887 ≈ 3147
6. - Week20 = 3147 × 1.0887 ≈ 3426
7. - Week21 = 3426 × 1.0887 ≈ 3729
8. - Week22 = 3729 × 0.973 (minor adjustment for stabilizing epidemic activity per CDC data insights) ≈ 3629
9. This calculation demonstrates how the past trend aligns with and quantitatively drives the predicted value.
4. The summarized CDC reports reveal three key factors influencing the upward forecast:
5. a. Influenza A(H3N2) dominance (e.g., 98.8%-99.3% of subtyped cases) and rising co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (Weeks13–17, 2022) suggest ongoing elevated ILI activity. This quantitative dominance contributes to sustained weekly growth rates of ILI cases.
6. b. Hospitalization rates have steadily increased throughout the past 5 weeks, reaching 12.2 per 100,000 as of Week17, 2022, marking levels higher than all recent seasons prior to COVID-19 (indicating aggressive transmission). This trend correlates with a proportional increase in reported ILI cases.
7. c. Outpatient respiratory illness visits have shown incremental increases, from 1.9% (Week13) to 2.2% (Week17), reflecting heightened healthcare-seeking activity tied to both flu and respiratory illnesses. This rise supports anticipated growth in ILI cases over the next 5 weeks.
5. The forecasted value of 3629 accounts for the observed growth trends, the classification of Week22, 2022 as the Peak season, and contributing factors from CDC reports (e.g., A(H3N2) dominance, increased hospitalizations, and outpatient visits). The upward trajectory of ILI occurrences aligns closely with both quantitative time-series data and qualitative insights from epidemiologic surveillance. The minor adjustment for Week22 reflects a slight stabilization in transmission as noted in Week17’s first dip in hospitalizations since January.
