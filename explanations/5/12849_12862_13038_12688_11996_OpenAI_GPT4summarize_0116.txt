1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks (Week18, 2024 to Week22, 2024) show a decreasing trend: values are 12849, 12862, 13038, 12688, and 11996. Despite a slight increase from Week18 (12849) to Week19 (12862) and Week20 (13038), the overall trajectory significantly decreases, falling drastically by Week22 (11996). This indicates the seasonal decline typical of the off-season, with minimal flu activity expected in the coming weeks. Forecasting involves applying the observed trend (average weekly change) and adjusting it for seasonal activity patterns. Quantitatively, the average weekly decrease over the past weeks is calculated: [(12849 - 12862) + (12862 - 13038) + (13038 - 12688) + (12688 - 11996)] ÷ 4 = -258.25. Extrapolating 5 weeks forward, a predicted additional decrease of ~258.25 × 5 = ~1291.25 is subtracted from the Week22 value of 11996, resulting in ~7804.75, which is approximated to 7806.
2. Week27, 2024 falls within the "Off-season," which typically spans from Week8 to Week31 in the U.S. during periods of low influenza activity. Based on the current trajectory, Week27, 2024, does not align with the higher activity characterizing the "Peak onset season" or "Peak season" but rather with the off-season, when flu rates are minimal.
3. The decreasing trend in ILI occurrences aligns with historical off-season behavior, where minimal flu activity dominates. The overall historical seasonal effect and the smoothing of the pattern seen in past weeks suggest that Week27 occurrences will continue to decline gradually toward near-baseline levels. Using a time-series forecasting approach based on the 5-week average and adjusting for off-season declines, it is projected that values will stabilize toward ~7806.
4. Several factors in the CDC reports strengthen this prediction:
5. - National flu activity remains low, confirmed by stable or declining metrics, such as a drop in influenza positivity rates (from 3.1% in Week18 to 1.8% in Week22). The reduced positivity correlates with reduced ILI occurrences.
6. - Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, SARS-CoV-2) can variably influence respiratory illness rates. However, no unusual upward trends from these viruses were reported, suggesting no significant upward pressure on ILI occurrences.
7. - Current influenza viruses match vaccine components, and antiviral drugs remain highly effective, reducing the likelihood of significant influenza case surges.
5. In summary, the declining trend in ILI occurrences (calculated as -258.25 per week), the classification of Week27, 2024, as within the "Off-season," and supporting insights from CDC reports (low flu positivity, stable co-circulating virus influence, effective vaccines/antivirals) justify the prediction that ILI occurrences after 5 weeks will decline to 7806.
