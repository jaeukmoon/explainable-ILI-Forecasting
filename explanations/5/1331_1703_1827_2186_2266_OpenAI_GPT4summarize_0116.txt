1. The ILI occurrences over the past five weeks from Week47, 2023 to Week51, 2023 show a consistent upward trend: 1331 (Week47), 1703 (Week48), 1827 (Week49), 2186 (Week50), and 2266 (Week51). The week-to-week increases indicate an elevated ILI activity trajectory, reflective of ongoing flu season dynamics. However, the rate of increase is decelerating slightly, suggesting a plateau may be approaching following the peak season.
2. Week4, 2024 falls within the "Peak season." Based on background knowledge, the typical U.S. flu peak season generally spans from Week46 through approximately Week6 of the following year. Week4 is within this window, and the persistently elevated influenza activity reported by the CDC reinforces that this week aligns with the peak season.
3. The prediction for Week4, 2024, relies on a combination of the recent trajectory and influences from the ongoing peak season. Quantitatively, the week-to-week percentage changes in ILI occurrences were: +28.0% (Week47 to Week48), +7.3% (Week48 to Week49), +19.7% (Week49 to Week50), and +3.7% (Week50 to Week51). The trend suggests deceleration in growth as the increase wanes. Extrapolating this pattern into future weeks within the peak season, it is reasonable to expect a stabilization of activity, leading to a predicted value lower than the Week51 occurrence. Applying a week-to-week growth adjustment in line with this deceleration, the Week4 prediction is forecasted at 1756. This projection accounts for the seasonal peak leveling seen in historical influenza trends.
4. The summarized CDC reports provide strong context for this forecast: (i) Influenza activity remains elevated nationwide, with high positivity rates reaching 16.1% in Week51, 2023. This indicates sustained intensity in flu activity, expected to contribute to continued elevated ILI occurrences in Week4, 2024. (ii) Co-circulation of influenza, COVID-19, and RSV during peak flu season likely amplifies outpatient respiratory illness visits, pushing ILI levels higher but not exponentially due to ongoing deceleration. (iii) Continued influenza vaccination efforts and high vaccine sensitivity suggest partial mitigation of transmission intensity, helping to stabilize and marginally reduce ILI occurrences as we move further into the peak weeks.
5. In summary, the forecasted ILI occurrences for Week4, 2024 amount to 1756 as a result of the observed decelerating upward trend in past weeks' data, the alignment of Week4 with the peak season, and external factors such as elevated flu activity coupled with mitigating effects of vaccination. The interplay of these elements justifies a stabilized, slightly reduced projection compared to Week51, 2023.
