1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences for Region 3 over the past 5 weeks (Week52, 2023 to Week4, 2024) show a consistent decreasing trend: 17430 → 13366 → 10877 → 8551 → 9246. This trend represents a decline of 23.3% (Week52 to Week1), 18.6% (Week1 to Week2), 21.4% (Week2 to Week3), and a slight increase of 8.1% (Week3 to Week4). The observed reduction until Week3 suggests waning peak activity, followed by a potential stabilization or post-peak uptick in Week4. Using this trend, we forecast Week9 by applying time-series analysis: the pattern suggests a gradual tapering of the decline and likely stabilization approaching baseline levels.
2. Week9, 2024 belongs to the **Off-season**. From Background Knowledge, U.S. Peak season generally ends around Week6 each year, transitioning into Off-season from Week7 or Week9. Week9 lies within this timeframe, and the general drop in activity from Week52 to Week4, alongside CDC reports predicting declines post-winter holidays, confirms that Week9 is part of the Off-season.
3. Correlation analysis of historical patterns suggests that ILI occurrences in Week9, 2024 will stabilize marginally above baseline levels. A weighted average rate of change from the past 5 weeks gives an approximate stabilization forecast. By calculating the average week-to-week percentage change from Week52 to Week4 (-23.3%, -18.6%, -21.4%, +8.1%), the average rate is approximately -13.8%. Applying this reduced rate of change to Week4’s value (9246) suggests a potential stabilization near 11183, factoring in seasonal adjustments for Off-season dynamics.
4. At least three distinct factors from CDC reports support this forecast:
1. Elevated influenza activity driven by Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (78.9%-89.2% of viruses in Weeks52-4). Although activity is decreasing, A(H1N1)’s dominance and ongoing regional positivity (16.2%) imply residual levels in Week9. This supports moderate activity, aligning with Off-season stabilization.
2. Vaccination trends and effectiveness remain robust, with consistent CDC outreach encouraging late-season vaccinations. Vaccines’ genetic consistency with A(H1N1)pdm09 improves immunity levels, contributing to reduced ILI cases but preventing a dramatic return to baseline. This aligns with a predicted tapering to ~11183.
3. Post-holiday resurgence potential flagged in Week2 CDC reports and the contribution of co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, RSV). These factors could elevate ILI cases slightly above baseline, especially in regions with higher positivity (Region 3).
5. Combining the decreasing trend in ILI occurrences, seasonal classification (Off-season), and CDC-report factors (dominant subtype A(H1N1), vaccination efforts, co-circulating respiratory viruses), the ILI occurrences for Week9, 2024 are forecasted to be **11183**. These factors and time-series patterns justify the moderate stabilization with minor residual elevation during the Off-season.
