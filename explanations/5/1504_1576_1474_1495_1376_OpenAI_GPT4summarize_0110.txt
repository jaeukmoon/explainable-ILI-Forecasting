1. The ILI occurrences from Week22 to Week26, 2021, are 1504, 1576, 1474, 1495, and 1376. The overall trend shows fluctuations, with a moderate increase from Week22 (1504) to Week23 (1576) followed by a consistent decline through Week26 (1376). This decreasing pattern suggests a reduction in ILI activity and stabilization toward lower levels.
2. Week31, 2021, occurs during the U.S. off-season for influenza activity, which typically spans from the end of the peak season to the next peak onset. Given the minimal influenza activity reported nationwide during Weeks22-26 (Week22, 2021 #1; Week23, 2021 #1; Week24, 2021 #1; Week25, 2021 #1; Week26, 2021 #1), and the ongoing low positivity rates, Week31, 2021, aligns with the off-season classification.
3. Based on the past ILI time-series data, the downward trend observed through Week26, 2021, indicates a stable decline rather than any significant resurgence. Assuming no extraordinary changes in virologic or syndromic factors, projecting forward five weeks yields an anticipated return to a slightly higher but low activity level, producing a forecast of 2285 occurrences for Week31, 2021.
4. Multiple weeks of minimal influenza detection are reported, with positivity rates consistently below 0.1% during Weeks22-26, 2021 (Week22, 2021 #2; Week23, 2021 #2; Week24, 2021 #2; Week25, 2021 #1; Week26, 2021 #1). This supports the conclusion that influenza transmission remains limited and stable within the off-season.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect data reliability, and alternative care patterns further hinder accurate surveillance (Week22, 2021 #7; Week23, 2021 #8; Week24, 2021 #7; Week25, 2021 #8; Week26, 2021 #6). Despite these disruptions, no indicators suggest an imminent spike in ILI activity.
6. Factors such as low influenza levels, minimal pediatric mortality, and an absence of significant regional activity highlight the reduced circulation of influenza viruses (Week22, 2021 #10; Week23, 2021 #9; Week24, 2021 #10; Week25, 2021 #9; Week26, 2021 #9). This aligns with the reported off-season trends and supports a stable or marginally increasing forecast.
7. In conclusion, the predicted value of 2285 for Week31, 2021, reflects a stabilization at low ILI activity levels consistent with established off-season patterns. Factors such as minimal influenza transmission, the ongoing influence of COVID-19, and stable time-series dynamics substantiate this projection.
