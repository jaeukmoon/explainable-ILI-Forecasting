1. The ILI occurrences from Week48 to Week52, 2021 are 2084, 2117, 2313, 2550, and 3231, reflecting a steadily increasing trend across the weeks. This rise indicates expanding influenza activity, particularly evident in the sharp spike from Week51 (2550) to Week52 (3231), consistent with a peak season trajectory.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans Week46 through Week6 of the following year. Given that Week52, 2021 lies in the peak season and the ILI occurrences are markedly climbing, Week5, 2022 also falls into the same peak season. Activity levels likely maintain some residual intensity during this window, albeit with potential declining trends as the season progresses.
3. The observed upward trajectory in ILI occurrences aligns with typical seasonal patterns. Based on time-series forecasting, after a peak in Week52, 2021 at 3231, a gradual decline is projected over the next five weeks, accounting for natural reduction phases post-peak season. The ILI count prediction of 1125 for Week5, 2022 reflects this expected downtrend, anticipating moderate activity levels consistent with typical seasonal tapering.
4. The primary factor influencing projections is the predominance of Influenza A(H3N2), constituting 98-99% of positive specimens across clinical and public health labs (Week48, 2021 #9; Week50, 2021 #2; Week52, 2021 #3). This strain has been driving the outbreak in the peak season.
5. Ongoing low levels of flu vaccine uptake compared to prior seasons (Week48, 2021 #7; Week50, 2021 #7; Week52, 2021 #6) further sustain higher-than-normal transmission rates, though the vaccine offers some protection against circulating strains.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, complicates respiratory illness reporting and could contribute to an elevated baseline of ILI occurrences (Week49, 2021 #10; Week51, 2021 #4; Week52, 2021 #10).
7. Based on the weekly upward trend of ILI occurrences, the current peak season classification, and the influence of Influenza A(H3N2) coupled with vaccine and virus co-circulation dynamics, the projection of 1125 ILI occurrences for Week5, 2022 reflects a gradual decline from peak activity as the influenza season wanes.
