1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks (Week49, 2021 to Week1, 2022) in Region 7 follow a fluctuating trend: ['1772', '1874', '2104', '2919', '2533']. Week-by-week, an increase is observed from Week49 to Week52, peaking at 2919, followed by a slight decline in Week1, 2022 (2533). This suggests that ILI activity might have reached its maximum (Peak season) in Week52 and is now beginning to contract.
2. Forecasting target week (Week6, 2022) belongs to the Off-season. According to background knowledge, the U.S. flu season typically peaks from Week46 to about Week6 of the following year. The slight decline in Week1, 2022 indicates the subsiding phase as Week6 transitions toward the Off-season, characterized by lower ILI activity after the peak transmission period.
3. A combination of statistical and trend analysis demonstrates the projected decrease in ILI occurrences. To predict occurrences for Week6, 2022, a linear decrease from the observed peak in Week52 (2919) and Week1, 2022 (2533) is modeled. This decline reflects a typical tapering pattern post-peak season. Using the observed 5-week trend, the average weekly decrease from Week52 to Week1 is calculated:
4. - Weekly decrease from Week52 (2919) to Week1 (2533) = (2919 - 2533) = 386. Assuming this consistent rate of decline persists into Week6, 2022:
5. - Projected value for Week6, 2022 = 2533 - (386 × 4 weeks) = 888. Hence, the declining trend aligns with the Off-season expectations.
4. Three distinct CDC report factors significantly influence this forecast:
5. i. Lower vaccination uptake: Reports from Week49 to Week1 indicate vaccination uptake remains lower compared to previous seasons. A reduced vaccination rate corresponds to higher susceptibility initially (Week49-Week52), but as flu season subsides toward the Off-season, collective immunity and reduced transmission yield lower ILI occurrences. Adjusting for reduced vaccination effectiveness, this factor stabilizes ILI values closer to baseline.
6. ii. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses: CDC summaries emphasize the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. While these viruses elevated ILI data during peak season (Weeks49-52), as respiratory viruses naturally decline due to seasonal factors (e.g., temperature, mitigation behavior), their overall impact decreases in the Off-season, further lowering ILI values.
7. iii. Influenza A(H3N2) dominance and antigenic evolution: Influenza A(H3N2) remained dominant with significant but stable hospitalization rates. However, the antigenic differences described in Week49 to Week1 indicate a trend toward adapted immunity, which aligns with reduced ILI circulation post-peak. Week-by-week, A(H3N2) occurrences trend down, reflecting diminished influenza-related activity in the forecast period.
5. In summary, the forecast of 888 for Week6, 2022 aligns with the transition to the Off-season. The observed peak and current decline in ILI occurrences, coupled with reduced vaccination rates, co-circulating virus tapering, and naturally contracting A(H3N2) dominance, support this quantitative prediction. Statistical modeling of weekly declines and CDC report insights converge to form this evidence-based estimate.
