1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a notable declining trend, starting with 16585 (Week8, 2023) and progressively decreasing to 14594 (Week11, 2023), before slightly increasing to 14942 (Week12, 2023). This general downward trajectory, with mild fluctuations, highlights a tapering pattern of ILI activity during this timeframe.
2. A clear correlation is visible between past and future ILI occurrences, as the declining trend during Weeks8–11, 2023, combined with the slight uptick in Week12, suggests stabilization in ILI activity. This plateauing movement aligns with the reported future value of 13026 (Week17, 2023), which reflects moderated ILI occurrence levels following the observed gradual reduction.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI expressed a decline over the observed period, dropping from 2.6% in Week8, 2023, to 2.3% in Week12, 2023. This reduction, along with visits consistently holding below the national baseline (2.5%), indicates decreased influenza-related healthcare encounters, contributing to the lower future ILI value of 13026.
4. PIC mortality, while consistently above the epidemic threshold, demonstrated a declining trend from 9.2% (Week8, 2023) to 8.3% (Week12, 2023). This reduction in respiratory-related deaths correlates with lessened disease severity and indirectly supports the lower future ILI occurrence.
5. Stable hospitalization rates (e.g., 60.6 per 100,000 in Week11, 2023, rising marginally to 60.8 in Week12, 2023) and continued low influenza activity, paired with antigenically matched vaccines and robust antiviral effectiveness, further minimized severe ILI outcomes. These factors collectively forecast a subdued ILI pattern, aligning with the reduction to 13026 occurrences (Week17, 2023).
6. In summary, the reported future ILI value of 13026 (Week17, 2023) is explained by the observed declining trend in past ILI occurrences, decreased outpatient visits and PIC mortality, stabilization in hospitalizations, and low influenza activity combined with effective preventive measures during Weeks8–12, 2023.
