1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week37 to Week41, 2021 are 1243, 1309, 1140, 1250, and 1279. While there is a slight increase from Week37 (1243) to Week38 (1309), this is followed by a notable dip in Week39 (1140) and then a resurgence through Week40 (1250) and Week41 (1279). This overall trend suggests a fluctuating pattern rather than clear growth or decline, with ILI activity stabilizing near Week41.
2. Based on the background knowledge, Week46, 2021 aligns with the beginning of the peak season. While current influenza activity levels remain low (Week37, 2021 #1; Week41, 2021 #1), indications of stability or early increases near Week41 align with the typical rise in ILI during peak seasons. Hence, Week46, 2021 belongs to the peak onset season.
3. The fluctuating pattern in past ILI occurrences, with stabilization near Week41 (1279 occurrences), suggests a likelihood of marginal increases as the season transitions toward a peak. Projecting forward with these fluctuations in a time-series model, the ILI occurrence in Week46 is anticipated to approach 1223, reflecting a moderated stabilization of ILI activity as seasonal factors take hold.
4. The presence of Influenza A and Influenza B is reported at minimal levels, with low testing positivity nationwide and limited transmission (Week37, 2021 #6; Week40, 2021 #1; Week41, 2021 #1, #2). This controlled circulation is contributing to stable, low-level ILI counts.
5. COVID-19 remains the dominant driver of pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC)-related deaths, which account for over 17% during the most recent period (Week37, 2021 #3; Week40, 2021 #6; Week41, 2021 #5). This ongoing impact of COVID-19 affects healthcare demands and data interpretation but does not directly correlate with substantial rises in ILI caused by influenza.
6. Influenza vaccination efforts have continued, with the CDC strongly recommending vaccinations by the end of October (Week40, 2021 #8; Week41, 2021 #8). These campaigns reduce the likelihood of severe spikes in ILI due to seasonal influenza, reinforcing the expectation of moderated ILI activity near Week46.
7. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrence of 1223 for Week46, 2021 is justified by the observed stabilization of ILI trends, ongoing minimal influenza virus circulation, subdued influenza activity due to vaccination efforts, and the transition into the peak onset season. This combination of factors maintains ILI activity near the current levels, reflecting gradual seasonal growth without significant accelerations.
