1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week30 to Week34, 2024 are 10818, 10927, 11143, 11971, and 14072. The trend shows a gradual increase from Week30 to Week33 and a notable spike between Week33 (11971) and Week34 (14072). This sharp rise suggests a transition toward heightened flu activity, indicating an upward trajectory.
2. Based on the U.S. season classification, Week39, 2024 falls within the Peak onset season, spanning from Week32 to Week46 each year. The increasing activity during Week34, 2024 aligns with this seasonal rise in ILI occurrences during the Peak onset season.
3. From a correlation analysis perspective, historical patterns show that ILI activity typically increases during the Peak onset season. The past week's sharp growth in ILI occurrences and the steady upward trend suggest that future occurrences will likely continue to rise in the short term, consistent with the seasonal progression toward higher activity.
4. Influenza activity remains low as of Week34, 2024, with only 0.4% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza. However, a co-circulation of Influenza A subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) and B/Victoria lineage, as well as other respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2, signals conditions conducive to rising ILI counts (Week30-Week34, 2024 #1, #9, and #11).
5. Outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses, including ILI, have remained below the national baseline but exhibited slight increases in pediatric age groups during Week34, 2024. This uptick in children aged 0-4 and 5-24 years highlights potential contributors to future ILI growth (Week34, 2024 #4).
6. Genetic and antigenic testing confirmed that circulating influenza strains are largely antigenically similar to vaccine strains, yet vaccination rates showed no significant improvement from Week30 to Week34, 2024. The low vaccine uptake could lead to increased transmission risks in vulnerable groups, contributing to the forecasted increase in ILI counts (Week32-Week34, 2024 #9, #10, and #11).
7. In conclusion, the forecast for Week39, 2024, at 13346 ILI occurrences, is supported by the observed upward trend in ILI activity from Week30 to Week34, the seasonality of Week39 falling in the Peak onset season, and contributing factors such as rising outpatient respiratory visits, co-circulating viruses, and limited vaccine uptake. These combined dynamics align with the expected continuation of increasing ILI reports into the Peak onset season.
