1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited moderate fluctuations, with values of ['1226', '1256', '1154', '1212', '1308']. After a marginal increase from 1226 (Week 6, 2023) to 1256 (Week 7, 2023), a drop to 1154 (Week 8, 2023) was observed, followed by a resurgence to 1212 (Week 9, 2023) and peaking at 1308 (Week 10, 2023). This overall upward trend by Week 10 suggests increasing ILI activity, setting the stage for subsequent declines reflected in future occurrences.
2. There is a negative correlation between the past upward trend of ILI occurrences, reaching 1308 by Week 10, 2023, and the decrease to 895 future occurrences (Week 15, 2023). The significant drop could be explained by the national decrease in influenza activity during the subsequent weeks, as supported by stable or declining ILI-related indicators during Weeks 6–10, 2023.
3. Weekly hospitalizations for influenza demonstrated a progressive decline from 1992 (Week 6, 2023) to 1387 (Week 10, 2023), mirroring the anticipated decrease in flu-related healthcare burden in subsequent weeks. Outpatient visits for ILI also remained stable or declined, with Week 10 showing 2.4%, a drop below the national baseline of 2.5%, likely contributing to reduced ILI occurrences after 5 weeks. Additionally, the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza consistently remained low (1.4% in Week 6, 2023, to 1.0% in Week 10), underscoring diminished flu activity influencing future ILI.
4. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza, while high at 60.4 per 100,000 by Week 10, 2023, showed stability and no alarming increase. This indicates diminished strain on healthcare systems, reflective of the potential decrease in ILI activity reflected in the Week 15 data. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) also exhibited minor but consistent declines (from 9.4% in Week 6, 2023, to 8.6% in Week 10), further suggesting a downturn in disease severity, possibly leading to future reduced occurrences.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 895 (Week 15, 2023) result from the stabilization and subsequent easing of ILI activity observed in Week 10, 2023, such as declining hospitalizations, reduced outpatient visits, and low influenza positivity rates. These factors, combined with sustained PIC mortality rates below critical thresholds and the absence of significant flu risks, collectively influenced the observed drop in cases.
