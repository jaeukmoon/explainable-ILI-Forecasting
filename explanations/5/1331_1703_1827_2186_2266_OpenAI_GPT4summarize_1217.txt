1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent upward trajectory, starting from 1331 in Week47, 2023, and peaking at 2266 in Week51, 2023. Week47–Week49 showed a more moderate rise (1331 to 1827), while a sharper increase occurred in Week50–Week51 (2186 to 2266). This pattern reflects intensifying ILI activity over the 5-week period.
2. The positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The steep climb in Weeks 50–51, 2023, suggests a continuation of elevated activity, aligning with the slightly reduced ILI occurrence of 1756 observed 5 weeks later (Week5, 2024). This suggests that while ILI activity slightly subsided, the prior upward trend influenced the reported value.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently increased, from 3.9% (Week47, 2023) to 6.1% (Week51, 2023), staying significantly above the national baseline of 2.9%. This continuous expansion in ILI activity across all regions reflects heightened respiratory illness severity, directly correlating to the substantial future ILI occurrence.
4. The cumulative hospitalization rate rose sharply, from 3.7 per 100,000 (Week47, 2023) to 15.4 per 100,000 (Week51, 2023), reflecting a significant increase in severe cases. This rise, coupled with elevated outpatient visits, mirrors the persistence of flu cases leading to the reported 1756 ILI occurrences.
5. Influenza positivity rates rapidly climbed from 6.2% (Week47, 2023) to 16.1% (Week51, 2023), sustained by the predominance of Influenza A(H1N1) and regional surges. This heightened transmission intensity, alongside co-circulation of RSV and COVID-19, likely contributed to elevated ILI rates observed in future data.
6. Overall, the future ILI occurrence of 1756 (Week5, 2024) can be attributed to the observed sharp increase in ILI occurrences in Weeks50–51, 2023, the nationwide rise in outpatient visits and hospitalization rates, and significant positivity rates for influenza. These factors collectively sustained higher-than-baseline ILI activity, even 5 weeks later.
