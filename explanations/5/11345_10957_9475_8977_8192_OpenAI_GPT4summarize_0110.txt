1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week5 to Week9, 2024 are 11345, 10957, 9475, 8977, and 8192. A clear declining trend is observed over these weeks, with ILI counts decreasing steadily from Week5 (11345) to Week9 (8192). The rate of decline is particularly steep between Week5 and Week7, while the decrease becomes more gradual between Week7 and Week9. This consistent decrease suggests a tapering off of ILI activity over these weeks.
2. In the U.S., the off-season typically spans from the end of the peak season to the next peak onset season (Week9 through Week30). Since the forecasted Week14, 2024 falls well after the peak season, during a period when ILI occurrences are declining steadily and below peak weeks' intensities, it aligns with the off-season. Thus, Week14, 2024 is classified as belonging to the off-season.
3. The time-series analysis indicates that the declining trend seen from Week5 to Week9, 2024 is likely to continue due to the approaching off-season period. The consistent decrease suggests that ILI occurrences are stabilizing towards lower off-season levels. By projecting forward five weeks, the model anticipates continued reductions in ILI activity, resulting in the forecasted count of 4433 in Week14, 2024.
4. The predominance of Influenza A/H1N1pdm09 during Week5 to Week9, 2024, combined with stable changes in Influenza B activity, suggests a declining overall burden. Although Influenza B activity increased slightly in certain regions (Week5, 2024 #9; Week6, 2024 #10; Week7, 2024 #8), its lesser contribution compared to Influenza A (Week8, 2024 #3) supports a decreasing ILI trend nationwide.
5. The cumulative hospitalizations reflect a steady or slightly declining pattern (Week5, 2024 #4; Week6, 2024 #5; Week7, 2024 #5; Week8, 2024 #5; Week9, 2024 #4). This aligns with the tapering of ILI activity heading into the off-season and supports a continued reduction in occurrences.
6. The persistent recommendation for influenza vaccination despite being late in the season indicates some ongoing susceptibility to infections (Week5, 2024 #7; Week6, 2024 #7; Week7, 2024 #7; Week8, 2024 #8; Week9, 2024 #8). However, no aggressive flu resurgence is predicted due to vaccination protective benefits against circulating strains, contributing to the expected decline.
7. The forecast of 4433 occurrences in Week14, 2024 is supported by the observed steady decline in ILI cases, alignment of the week with the off-season, and stabilized influenza trends marked by a decreasing hospitalization burden and a predominantly Influenza A-driven activity. Together, these factors justify the continued reduction in ILI counts.
