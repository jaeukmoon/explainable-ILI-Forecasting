1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a sustained increase, with values of ['11664', '9785', '11429', '13019', '16110']. After an initial dip from 11664 (Week 2, 2024) to 9785 (Week 3, 2024), there was a sharp and consistent rise, culminating in Week 6, 2024, with 16110, the highest in the period. This overall upward trend highlights escalating ILI activity across this timeline, particularly in later weeks.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the steep increase observed in Weeks 5 and 6, 2024, aligns with the elevated value of 14164 after 5 weeks (Week 11, 2024). The peaking activity in Week 6 especially signals high ILI occurrences driving the future reported level.
3. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza steadily ranged from 13.7% (Week 2, 2024) to 15.7% (Week 6, 2024), remaining elevated, further supporting the growing ILI burden and subsequent future rise. Concurrently, cumulative hospitalization rates also climbed from 37.3 per 100,000 (Week 2, 2024) to 54.9 per 100,000 (Week 6, 2024), indicating sustained severe flu activity impacting overall ILI levels. Additionally, co-circulation of respiratory viruses like RSV and COVID-19 complicated surveillance while ensuring persistent elevated ILI activity contributing to the future occurrences.
4. Influenza positivity remained high across clinical specimens (16.2% in Week 4, 2024) and public health lab specimens (76.9% Influenza A in Week 6, 2024), particularly dominated by A(H1N1)pdm09, a severe subtype linked to high hospitalization and mortality risks. This severe strain dominance, combined with predictions of continued activity in regions where Influenza B was spiking, aligns with the elevated post-5-week ILI value.
5. In summary, the 14164 future ILI occurrences after Week 6, 2024, are driven by the persistently rising trend of past data, increased influenza positivity, heightened respiratory virus co-circulation, severe subtype dominance of A(H1N1)pdm09, and corresponding elevated hospitalization rates. These factors, alongside regional increases, created a sustained burden reflected in future data.
