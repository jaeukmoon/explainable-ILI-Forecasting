1. The past ILI occurrences from Week4 to Week8, 2022 show a fluctuating trend, with counts of 1998, 1551, 1757, 1933, and 1816. After a sharp decline from Week4 (1998) to Week5 (1551), there was a gradual recovery in Week6 (1757) and Week7 (1933), followed by a slight dip in Week8 (1816). These variations suggest a fluctuating but generally low ILI activity level during these weeks, without a consistent upward or downward trend.
2. Forecasting that Week13, 2022 belongs to the off-season aligns with the observed sporadic influenza activity and low positivity rates reported in CDC summaries for Weeks4 to Week8, 2022. Off-season timing is consistent with Week13, 2022 falling outside the peak or peak onset periods.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the fluctuating but low ILI occurrences from Week4 to Week8, 2022 indicate ILI activity stabilizing at relatively low levels. Projecting this forward to Week13, 2022, the gradual recovery followed by a slight dip suggests that ILI counts may increase slightly, reaching the forecasted value of 3793 due to anticipated variability in influenza positivity and other influencing factors noted in reports.
4. The following factors from the summarized CDC reports strongly influence the forecasted value: (1) A progressive increase in influenza positivity in Weeks6 to Week8, 2022 (Week6 #1, Week7 #1, Week8 #1) indicates a developing trend toward higher activity. (2) Continued low flu vaccination coverage, especially lower compared to the previous season, reduces population immunity and increases susceptibility (Week4 #6, Week5 #8, Week6 #8, Week7 #8, Week8 #8). (3) Sporadic activity with increasing Influenza A(H3N2) dominance and antigenic variability may result in uneven regional flu activity and slightly higher ILI occurrences (Week6 #2, Week7 #2, Week8 #2, #10).
5. The overall trajectory from Week4 to Week8, 2022, combined with report trends, suggests increasing ILI positivity and hospitalizations, although activity remains sporadic. Micro-trends toward higher ILI cases, compounded by low vaccination coverage and evolving Influenza A(H3N2) strains, support the projection of 3793 ILI occurrences in Week13, 2022.
