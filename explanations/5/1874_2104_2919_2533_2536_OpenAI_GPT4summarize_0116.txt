1. The ILI occurrences over the past five weeks (Week50, 2021 to Week2, 2022) are as follows: 1874, 2104, 2919, 2533, and 2536. The trend shows a notable increase from Week50 (1874) to Week52 (2919), followed by stabilization in Week1 and Week2, but at elevated levels (2533 and 2536). While the growth peaked in Week52, the activity plateaued rather than declining significantly after that.
2. For Week7, 2022, this period corresponds to the "Off-season" based on the typical influenza seasonality in the United States. The off-season generally follows the end of the peak season (ending around Week6) and precedes the peak onset season. Given that influenza typically subsides after the peak season, Week7 is classified as part of the off-season, which is typically characterized by decreasing or lower baseline ILI activity.
3. A time-series-based correlation forecast can be applied here. Observing the past 5-week trend, ILI occurrences shifted from an increasing phase (Week50 to Week52) to stabilization (Week1 and Week2). Since Week7 belongs to the off-season, a significant decline in ILI activity is expected, as off-season periods typically reflect gradual waning of transmission. To forecast the value for Week7, we consider the historical pattern of ILI occurrences during the off-season, typically 60%-80% lower than peak activity (Week52 here at 2919). Using the time-series data, we calculate 70% of the stabilization level found in Weeks 1 and 2 (average of 2533 and 2536 = 2534.5), which yields an expected value of approximately 1774. However, adjustments are made below based on CDC factors.
4. The following CDC-reported factors strengthen the projection of a more substantial ILI decline during Week7, 2022:
5. a. The positivity rate for influenza decreased from 6.2% in Week51 (2021) to 2.2% in Week1 (2022) and remained low at 2.2% in Week2 (2022). This declining positivity rate suggests subsiding influenza transmission.
6. b. Vaccination coverage, while reported lower this season, combined with decreasing levels of Influenza A(H3N2)'s antigenic alignment differences (remaining genetically similar to vaccine strains), contributes to reducing the impact of influenza outbreaks in subsequent weeks.
7. c. Healthcare-associated behavior reflects reduced outpatient respiratory illness visits (4.3% in Week1 to 3.5% in Week2) and declining activity across regions, signaling diminishing influenza spread. Region7, with its similarity to national patterns, is expected to follow this downward trend.
5. Combining time-series calculations and CDC report observations, we apply an additional seasonal adjustment for the off-season period and the predicted steep decline in ILI activity. A further 55% reduction from the calculated baseline (1774) leads to a final forecasted value of approximately 803 for Week7, 2022. This reduction accounts for off-season characteristics and slowing transmission dynamics specific to Region7.
