1. The ILI occurrences from Week10 to Week14, 2022 show a steady upward trend: 1295, 1522, 1964, 2612, and 3382. This consistent increase indicates a significant rise in influenza-like activity, revealing no fluctuations or stabilization but rather a strong sustained growth pattern week by week.
2. Based on U.S. seasonality, Week19, 2022 is categorized as part of the off-season. However, given that the CDC reports indicate increasing flu activity and rising ILI positivity through Week14, 2022 with strong regional influenza activity (Week14, 2022 #1, #13), localized peak-like behaviors are still possible during the non-traditional peak window.
3. Correlation analysis suggests that the observed steady rise in ILI counts will likely continue beyond Week14, 2022. This upward trajectory aligns with time-series patterns where sustained increases often lead to higher values over subsequent weeks, projecting the occurrence at 4327 by Week19, 2022.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) dominance, accounting for 99.9% of subtyped samples (Week14, 2022 #3), aligns with increasing transmission due to genetic mismatch with any vaccine strains (Week14, 2022 #8). This mismatch likely contributes to reduced population immunity, causing continued ILI rises.
5. Influenza vaccination uptake remains suboptimal, with no significant reports of increased coverage or impact on ILI occurrences (Week10, 2022 #10; Week11, 2022 #9; Week12, 2022 #8; Week13, 2022 #9; Week14, 2022 #8). Reduced effectiveness of influenza interventions supports higher ILI prevalence forecasts.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (Week10, 2022 #12; Week11, 2022 #8; Week13, 2022 #14; Week14, 2022 #12), adds complexity and drives overall respiratory illness visits, indirectly contributing to ILI occurrence increases.
7. The sustained growth in ILI, driven by vaccine mismatch, suboptimal vaccination uptake, significant A(H3N2) activity, co-circulating viruses, and consistent upward trends in prior weeks, justifies a projected ILI occurrence of 4327 for Week19, 2022.
