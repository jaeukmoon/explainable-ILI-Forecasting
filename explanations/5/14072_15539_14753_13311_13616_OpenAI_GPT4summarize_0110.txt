1. The reported ILI counts from Week34 to Week38, 2024 are 14072, 15539, 14753, 13311, and 13616. The trend exhibits an initial increase from Week34 (14072) to Week35 (15539), followed by a moderate decline through Week38 (13616). Overall, this indicates a slightly fluctuating trend with no major sustained increase or spike.
2. Week43, 2024 falls under the Peak onset season. Historically, the Peak onset season spans from Week32 to Week46, marking the period where influenza activity begins rising toward the peak. While influenza positivity (0.4%) remains below baseline during the past five weeks (Week34-Week38, 2024), stable increases in outpatient visits among younger age groups (Week37-Week38, 2024 #4, #10) and co-circulating respiratory viruses (Week34-Week38, 2024 #10) align with the typical initial phases of Peak onset season activity.
3. Projecting forward from the past five weeks’ fluctuating yet overall stable ILI activity trends, a time-series analysis anticipates minor increases consistent with patterns observed during the Peak onset season. Historical patterns suggest an equilibrium between slow increases and stable trends, leading to a forecast of 15631 occurrences in Week43, 2024.
4. Influenza activity remains nationally low, with 0.4% positivity in respiratory specimens across Week34-Week38, 2024. However, ongoing co-circulation of Influenza A, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 (Week34-Week38, 2024 #11) can subtly contribute to incremental outpatient visit increases for respiratory illnesses.
5. Antigenic similarity remains high (>95%) between circulating strains and vaccines (Week34 #8, Week38 #8), but vaccination coverage has not shown significant improvement during the past five weeks (Week34-Week38, 2024 #10). This may reduce the effectiveness in buffering ILI occurrences during the approaching Peak onset season.
6. CDC predictive reports suggest steady but low influenza activity trends (Week34, Week36, Week38 #11). However, the subtle rise in outpatient visits for respiratory symptoms, particularly among younger populations (Week37-Week38, 2024 #3, #10), can lead to gradual growth in ILI occurrences over time.
7. In summary, the projected ILI occurrence of 15631 for Week43, 2024 reflects the interplay of stable yet slightly rising trends during the Peak onset season, the co-circulation effects of multiple respiratory viruses, and moderate vaccination influences. Incremental increases align with historical patterns and CDC expectations during this transition phase toward higher seasonal activity.
