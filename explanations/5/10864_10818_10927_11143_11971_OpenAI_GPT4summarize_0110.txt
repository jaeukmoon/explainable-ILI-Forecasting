1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week29 to Week33, 2024 are 10864, 10818, 10927, 11143, and 11971. This data indicates an upward trend with a gradual increase from Week29 (10864) to Week33 (11971). Notably, there is a sharper rise between Week32 (11143) and Week33 (11971), suggesting an acceleration in ILI activity as the weeks progress.
2. Based on the U.S. seasonality, Week38, 2024 falls within the peak onset season, as it typically spans from Week32 or Week35 through Week46. This aligns with the increasing ILI activity observed in recent weeks (Week32 to Week33), indicating the initial phase of ILI activity's rise toward its peak.
3. Time-series analysis of the past five weeks shows a steady increase in occurrences, particularly a noticeable spike in Week32 to Week33. Projecting this trend forward, the acceleration of ILI activity is expected to continue over the next five weeks, coinciding with the progression of the peak onset season. A forecast of 13616 ILI occurrences by Week38 reflects a continued upward trajectory.
4. Influenza activity remains low nationally, but the co-circulation of H1N1, H3N2, and B viruses, along with novel variant cases (Week29 #6, Week33 #7), poses risks for increased ILI occurrences.
5. Outpatient visits for ILI remain below baseline but are stable at 1.5% from Week30 to Week33 (Week30 #3, Week33 #4), suggesting potential for gradual growth as seasonal influenza activity typically escalates during this period.
6. Most tested strains are well-matched to the vaccine, and antiviral resistance is low (Week29 #9, Week32 #9, Week33 #8), reducing severe outcomes but not preventing mild to moderate flu activity expansion.
7. Considering the upward trajectory of ILI occurrences, the seasonal classification of Week38, 2024 as peak onset, the co-circulation of multiple viral strains (including zoonotic risks), stable below-baseline outpatient visits, and increasing activity trends in prior weeks, the forecasted ILI occurrences of 13616 are justified as part of continued seasonal escalation.
