1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1006', '1121', '996', '978', '856']. The peak occurred in Week22, 2023, with a value of 1121, followed by a notable decrease to 856 in Week26, 2023, the lowest in the observed period. This decline reflects reduced ILI activity over the 5-week span.
2. A negative correlation is discernible between past and future ILI occurrences, as the steady decline in past data (Weeks 22–26, 2023) contrasts with the reported future ILI occurrences of 678 after 5 weeks. The continuous decrease suggests a gradual tapering of ILI activity leading up to the lower reported future value.
3. Outpatient ILI visits decreased from 1.9% (Week22, 2023) to 1.4% (Week26, 2023), consistently remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%. This steady decline in patient visits for ILI indicates stabilizing or decreasing levels of respiratory illness, correlating with the future ILI reduction.
4. Hospitalizations for influenza also showed a downward trend, from 953 (Week22, 2023) to 807 (Week26, 2023), reflecting reduced severe influenza cases. Alongside other declining metrics, this trend supports the future drop in ILI occurrences.
5. Minimal influenza positivity rates across weeks remained stable, ranging between 1.0%–1.2%, with co-circulation of non-influenza respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and RSV. This low influenza activity suggests a minor contribution from influenza to the reported ILI data, aligning with the reduced future value.
6. In summary, the reported 678 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks can be attributed to the consistent decline in ILI trends (Weeks 22–26, 2023), low influenza positivity and hospitalization rates, and reduced outpatient ILI visits. The sustained minimal influenza activity reinforces the observed drop in ILI occurrences.
