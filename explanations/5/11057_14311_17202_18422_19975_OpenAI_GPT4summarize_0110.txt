1. The ILI occurrences reported for Week28 through Week32 in 2021 are 11057, 14311, 17202, 18422, and 19975. The data shows a steady and significant rise in ILI counts over these five weeks, reflecting a consistent upward trajectory. This pattern indicates increasing activity without fluctuation or decline, suggesting the onset of broader respiratory illness transmission.
2. Forecasting target week (Week37, 2021) belongs to Peak onset season. Based on historical seasonality, the peak onset season typically starts between Week32 and Week35 each year, progressing up to higher activity levels around Week46. By Week37, 2021, the observed increasing ILI trends and reports of non-flu respiratory virus activity confirm its inclusion in this transitional phase.
3. From the time-series perspective, the steady and significant rise in reported occurrences over five weeks suggests a continuation of the upward momentum. The growth trajectory from 11057 in Week28 to 19975 in Week32 provides a foundation for projecting future occurrences forward. Given a consistent rate of increase, Week37 is anticipated to sustain elevated levels with occurrences nearing 12979, reflecting a slowing growth following an initial acceleration phase.
4. ILI activity trends recorded in the CDC reports indicate continuous increases in outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses across all age groups over the five-week period, driven by non-influenza viruses like SARS-CoV-2 rather than influenza (Week28 #3, Week32 #1, #3).
5. The majority of virologic surveillance shows minimal influenza activity but rising transmission of other respiratory pathogens, alongside two novel Influenza A(H1N2)v cases linked to animal exposure (Week32 #2, #7, #9). While these variants lack human-to-human transmission, their emergence may signal an evolving respiratory landscape.
6. The ongoing pandemic-driven changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors, especially alternative care pathways, continue to impact ILI reporting and data interpretation, complicating surveillance accuracy (Week28 #6, Week30 #8, Week32 #8).
7. In summary, consistently rising ILI trends, low but evolving respiratory virus prevalence, pandemic-related changes in healthcare patterns, and the seasonal shift into the Peak onset phase justify the prediction of 12979 occurrences in Week37, 2021.
