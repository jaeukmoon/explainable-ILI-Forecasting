1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating but upward trend, with values of ['1490', '1558', '1486', '1598', '1645']. There was an initial increase from 1490 (Week 16, 2021) to 1558 (Week 17, 2021), followed by a slight dip to 1486 (Week 18, 2021). However, the subsequent weeks saw a steady increase, reaching 1598 (Week 19, 2021) and peaking at 1645 (Week 20, 2021). This overall upward trajectory suggests heightened ILI reports during the observed period.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the steady rise in Weeks 19 and 20, 2021, acts as a precursor to the reported 1495 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 25, 2021). While the reported future value is slightly lower than Week 20’s peak, such fluctuations are consistent with the historical variability observed in the past ILI data over Weeks 16–20, 2021.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI, although below the national baseline, showed a marginal increase from 1.1% (Week 16, 2021) to 1.3% (Week 20, 2021). This slow but steady rise in healthcare interactions for ILI reflects a broader trend of increasing respiratory illness activity, contributing to the observed future ILI occurrences.

4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, although declining slightly from 11.8% (Week 16, 2021) to 9.5% (Week 20, 2021). This sustained correlation between respiratory mortality indicators and ILI activity suggests overlapping drivers of illness, potentially influencing the reported future ILI value.

5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and disruptions in ILI data collection due to COVID-19, as emphasized in all weekly reports, likely contributed to irregularities in data interpretation and reporting. Such systemic factors may underestimate or delay ILI trends, resulting in the similar magnitude between past occurrences and the future value.

6. Despite exceptionally low influenza virus activity (e.g., 0.1% positivity rate for respiratory specimens in Weeks 16–20, 2021), the increasing trend in ILI occurrences likely stems from non-influenza respiratory illnesses or other underlying contributors, amplified by the ongoing impact of the pandemic on healthcare dynamics and illness behaviors.

7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1495 (Week 25, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks 19–20, 2021, slight increases in ILI-related outpatient visits, sustained elevated PIC mortality, pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare and data interpretation, and non-influenza respiratory illness drivers amidst minimal influenza virus activity.
