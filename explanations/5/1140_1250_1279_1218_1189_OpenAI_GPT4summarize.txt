1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Week 39–Week 43, 2021) displayed a fluctuating but slightly declining trend, with values of ['1140', '1250', '1279', '1218', '1189']. An initial increase from 1140 (Week 39, 2021) to 1279 (Week 41, 2021) was followed by a decrease to 1218 in Week 42, 2021, and further to 1189 in Week 43, 2021. This mixed trend, with a slight downward trajectory toward the end, reflects stabilized ILI occurrences within this period, but with relatively higher values overall compared to the beginning.

2. A positive correlation is observed between the past time-series ILI occurrences and the future occurrences (1408 in Week 48, 2021). Despite the slight decline seen at the end of the 5-week period, the higher ILI activity across Weeks 40–42, 2021, likely set a baseline for the eventual increase after 5 weeks. The fluctuations and stabilization observed during Week 39–Week 43, 2021, acted as precursors to the subsequent spike in ILI cases.

3. The summarized CDC reports reveal multiple contributing factors to the future increase in ILI occurrences:  
   - Outpatient visits for ILI were reported at 1.9% for Weeks 39 and 43, and 1.8% for Weeks 41 and 42, 2021, consistently below the national baseline but stable over most weeks. This stable ILI activity among outpatients likely contributed to maintaining a reservoir of cases that eventually escalated.  
   - Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained elevated, though steadily declining from 18.7% (Week 39, 2021) to 15.6% (Week 43, 2021). Even as these percentages decreased, they exceeded the epidemic threshold, suggesting persistent respiratory illness activity, which may have contributed to the future rise in ILI occurrences.  
   - Reports consistently noted minimal influenza activity across Weeks 39–43, 2021, with positivity rates increasing slightly from 0.1% to 0.2% by Week 43. The gradual increase in lab-confirmed influenza cases (e.g., 35 public health specimens in Week 43) suggests that influenza circulation could have begun gaining momentum, potentially contributing to the sharper rise observed after 5 weeks.

4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1408 (Week 48, 2021) can be explained by the stabilized but relatively high ILI activity observed over Weeks 39–43, 2021, the slight increase in influenza virus positivity rates, persistent PIC-related mortality above epidemic thresholds, and the consistent outpatient ILI visit percentages. These factors, combined with shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, created conditions for a delayed amplification of ILI occurrences.
