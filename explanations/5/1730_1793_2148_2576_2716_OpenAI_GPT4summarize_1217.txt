1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a clear upward trend, with values rising steadily from 1730 in Week42, 2020 to 2716 in Week46, 2020. Significant increases are observed between Weeks44 and 46 (2148 to 2576 and then 2716), highlighting a sharp rise in ILI occurrences by the end of the observed period.
2. A positive correlation exists between the steady increase in past ILI occurrences (1730 to 2716 from Week42 to Week46, 2020) and the future ILI value of 1396 (Week51, 2020). The declining ILI after Week46 likely reflects the stabilization of trends following this sharp rise, influenced by seasonal illness patterns transitioning into post-peak reductions.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently increased over the observed weeks, rising from 1.2% in Week42 to 1.5% in Week46, 2020. This gradual but sustained growth in healthcare encounters for respiratory illnesses aligns with rising ILI occurrences and likely contributed to the initial surge, followed by stabilization in Week51, 2020.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained above epidemic thresholds, rising from 7.6% in Week42 to 10.7% in Week46, 2020. This reflects heightened concurrent respiratory illness activity, which likely contributed to higher ILI levels during Weeks42 to 46, translating into subsequent stabilization by Week51, 2020.
5. Ongoing disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted in all CDC weekly summaries, created challenges in ILI surveillance. These shifts likely resulted in delayed reporting and fluctuations in traditional ILI tracking, contributing to inconsistent patterns and the eventual decline to 1396 in Week51, 2020 despite the previous surge.
6. In summary, the reported 1396 future ILI occurrences (Week51, 2020) can be attributed to the sharp upward trend observed in Weeks42 to 46, 2020, increasing outpatient ILI visits, persistently high PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior and surveillance systems, which collectively influenced the observed stabilization in ILI activity post-Week46, 2020.
