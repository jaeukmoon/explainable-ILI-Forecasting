1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week23, 2024 to Week27, 2024) show a consistent downward trend: 11270 → 10231 → 9807 → 9192 → 7806. This represents a week-over-week percentage decrease of approximately 9.23%, 4.15%, 6.27%, and 15.08%, respectively. The rate of decline suggests that influenza-like illness activity is progressively reducing, aligning with typical patterns observed during the off-season when ILI occurrences return to baseline levels.
2. Season classification for Week32, 2024: Week32, 2024 falls within the "Peak onset season" based on the U.S. flu season cycle. The Peak onset season typically starts from Week32 or later, as outlined in the guidelines, marking the beginning of a slow resurgence of ILI activity as the flu season approaches. Historical patterns confirm that ILI activity in this season remains low but begins to stabilize or slightly increase in anticipation of the next peak.
3. A correlation analysis of past trends and future data suggests that using a time-series forecasting approach (such as simple exponential smoothing) is appropriate to predict Week32 ILI occurrences. To forecast Week32:
4. - The week-over-week percentage change averaged across the past five weeks is approximately -8.68%.
5. - Applying this rate to Week27 (7806 × 0.9132 ≈ 7131), we forecast a continued decline.
6. - Adjusting for seasonal factors (beginning of Peak onset season, where the downward momentum typically slows), this leads to the forecasted result: 7091 for Week32, 2024.
4. Three significant factors from the CDC reports influence the prediction:
5. 1) National influenza activity remains low across the past five weeks, with respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza consistently declining from 1.6% (Week23) to 0.9% (Week27). Minimal influenza positivity correlates with reduced ILI occurrences.
6. 2) Co-circulation of influenza viruses with other respiratory pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, is noted but shows no surges. Stable co-circulation detracts from potential spikes in ILI occurrences caused by flu-like illnesses.
7. 3) Vaccination updates indicate no significant increase in uptake, but the antigenic similarity of circulating strains to vaccine strains (Weeks24–27) suggests that current vaccinations are effective, maintaining low flu activity and constraining ILI occurrences.
5. In summary, the downward trend in past ILI occurrences, coupled with the low influenza activity reported nationally, consistent off-season characteristics transitioning into a Peak onset season, and contributing factors such as effective vaccination coverage, supports the forecast of 7091 ILI occurrences in Week32, 2024. The projected activity aligns with historical patterns and CDC data, reflecting stabilization at lower levels typical of the Peak onset season after a prolonged decline.
