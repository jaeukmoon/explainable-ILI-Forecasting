1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a progressive decline, with values of ['2087', '1956', '1924', '1816', '1843']. Starting at 2087 (Week 14, 2021), there was a steady descent to 1816 (Week 17, 2021), followed by a slight increase to 1843 (Week 18, 2021). This overall downward trajectory reflects subdued ILI activity during this period, likely influenced by external factors such as pandemic mitigation measures.
2. A weak yet noticeable negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences can be inferred. Although the observed past data portrays an overall descending trend during Weeks 14–18, 2021, the future ILI occurrences (1929 for Week 23, 2021) depict a minor resurgence above the levels of Week 17 (1843). This suggests external influences or changes in dynamics that slightly reversed the declining trend from earlier weeks.
3. Consistently low respiratory specimen positivity rates for influenza across Weeks 14–18, 2021 (e.g., 0.1%) point to minimal flu spread during this period. This stable minimal activity aligns with the relatively low but slightly increased future ILI occurrences (1929). Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at 1.1%-1.2% during Weeks 14–18, 2021, hinting at a plateau rather than a sharp decline in overall respiratory illness presentations. Persistent reporting of PIC deaths above epidemic thresholds (e.g., 11.2% in Week 14 to 10.9% in Week 18, 2021) underscores residual respiratory burden, possibly from COVID-19 or other non-influenza respiratory pathogens contributing to future ILI levels. Age-specific fluctuations, such as a slight increase in ILI activity among the 0–4 years age group, reported by Week 18, 2021, may reflect nascent increases in certain subpopulations, influencing the modest rise to 1929 future occurrences.
4. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during Weeks 14–18, 2021, as reiterated in the CDC reports, likely played a role. During this time, disruptions to ILI surveillance systems due to alternate care-seeking behaviors and overlapping COVID-19 trends rendered detection and reporting of ILI occurrences complex. A delayed or dispersed recognition of cases during the reporting period might have contributed to the mild resurgence observed in Week 23, 2021.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence (1929 at Week 23, 2021) is explained by the overall downward trend in Weeks 14–18, 2021, stabilization in outpatient ILI visit rates, persistently high PIC death contributions, minor ILI increases among younger populations, and COVID-19-driven disruptions in healthcare utilization and data representation, which likely masked or delayed transient respiratory illness activity during the observed period.
