1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating pattern with values of ['1064', '975', '1124', '1063', '969']. There was a decrease from 1064 (Week 38, 2021) to 975 (Week 39, 2021), followed by an increase to 1124 (Week 40, 2021). Subsequently, a decline occurred, reaching 969 (Week 42, 2021). This mixed trend reflects an inconsistent trajectory in ILI activity over the observed weeks.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the highest value (1124 in Week 40, 2021) and fluctuations in the past data align with the observed increase in future occurrences to 1216 by Week 47, 2021. Despite the decline observed in the latter weeks, the earlier surge potentially foreshadows increased respiratory illness activity after 5 weeks.
3. PIC mortality percentages consistently remained above epidemic thresholds, dropping from 20.9% (Week 38, 2021) to 16.5% (Week 42, 2021). High levels of PIC-related deaths, driven by COVID-19, signify persistent respiratory illness activity that could contribute to higher ILI occurrences in the future. Stable or declining ILI percentages below baseline (e.g., 1.9% in Week 38 and 1.8% in Week 42, 2021) reflect limited flu activity but suggest contributions from other respiratory pathogens influencing future increases in ILI. Shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors, documented throughout the reports, complicate ILI data interpretation but might amplify delayed recognition and non-specific respiratory illness reporting, impacting future rates.
4. Though influenza positivity remained minimal (e.g., 0.1% in Week 40 and Week 42, 2021), other circulating respiratory viruses likely contributed to outpatient respiratory illness activity. For example, the concurrent presence of SARS-CoV-2 and changes in the healthcare system during the pandemic could indirectly elevate ILI occurrences.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1216 (Week 47, 2021) can be attributed to fluctuations in past ILI trends, stable PIC activity exceeding epidemic thresholds, the influence of non-influenza respiratory pathogens, and pandemic-related disruptions to healthcare behaviors and surveillance.
