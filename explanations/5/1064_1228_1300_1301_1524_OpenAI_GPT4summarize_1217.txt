1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trajectory, with values ['1064', '1228', '1300', '1301', '1524']. This rise began from 1064 in Week 34, 2023, and peaked at 1524 in Week 38, 2023, marking a steady increase throughout this period, indicative of escalating ILI activity.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences. The consistent upward trend in ILI cases during the observed 5-week period (Week 34–38, 2023) culminates in a significant increase to 1895 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 43, 2023). This sustained rise in past trends mirrors and foreshadows the future spike in ILI numbers.
3. Outpatient visit percentages for ILI increased incrementally, from 1.7% in Week 34, 2023, to a stable 2.0% between Weeks 36–38, 2023. Notably, children aged 0-4 years displayed disproportionately high ILI visit rates, peaking at 6.8% in Week 38. This rise in healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory illness supports higher future occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, from 6.5% in Week 34, 2023, to 7.2% in Week 38, 2023, reflecting sustained respiratory illness activity. This elevated mortality aligns with increasing ILI cases.
5. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, reported consistently in Weeks 34–38, 2023, contributed to heightened ILI activity. This overlapping viral activity likely played a cumulative role in the rise to 1895 future occurrences by Week 43, 2023.
6. In summary, the reported 1895 future ILI occurrences (Week 43, 2023) are attributed to the clear upward trajectory in past occurrences, increasing outpatient ILI visits, elevated PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and compounded effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses throughout the 5-week analysis period.
