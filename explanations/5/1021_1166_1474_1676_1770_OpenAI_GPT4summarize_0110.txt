1. The ILI occurrences from Week14 to Week18, 2022 are 1021, 1166, 1474, 1676, and 1770, indicating a consistently increasing trend over the five weeks. This steady upward pattern reflects a significant rise in influenza activity, with no signs of stabilization or decline during this period.
2. Week23, 2022 falls within the off-season (post-Week 19), based on the typical U.S. influenza activity pattern. Despite the increased activity observed in the prior weeks, Week23 remains within the off-season window, when ILI levels traditionally decline or stabilize.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistently rising counts from Week14 to Week18 indicate an upward trajectory. Extrapolating this trend out five weeks, the forecast accounts for a moderate leveling-off effect as the ILI activity transitions into the off-season, resulting in a projected future occurrence of 1595.
4. Influenza activity trends are regionally variable, with a dominant presence of A(H3N2), accounting for over 99% of cases, and positivity rates ranging from 7.8% to 8.9% during this period (Week14, 2022 #1, #2; Week18, 2022 #1, #6). This predominance of A(H3N2) suggests a predictable yet high-baseline trend for ILI occurrences.
5. Hospitalization rates increased steadily, reaching 13.4 per 100,000 by Week18, while deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 remained near epidemic thresholds, primarily due to COVID-19 (Week14, 2022 #5, #6; Week17, 2022 #4, #6; Week18, 2022 #3, #4). Although hospitalization trends suggest continued activity, their declining growth rate signals a potential plateau in ILI-related cases.
6. Vaccination efforts persist but show antigenic mismatch for A(H3N2), which may partially reduce vaccine effectiveness in controlling the rise in ILI occurrences (Week14, 2022 #8; Week17, 2022 #8; Week18, 2022 #8). Additionally, co-circulation with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses complicates influenza dynamics but does not lead to dramatic shifts in ILI activity nationwide (Week14, 2022 #9, #12; Week18, 2022 #7, #10).
7. Combining the consistently rising ILI counts, the off-season period of Week23, 2022, the dominant influence of A(H3N2), the steady hospitalization trends, and the antigenic mismatch affecting vaccine effectiveness, the gradual tapering-off of ILI growth is expected after Week18. These factors collectively justify the forecast of 1595 ILI occurrences in Week23, 2022.
