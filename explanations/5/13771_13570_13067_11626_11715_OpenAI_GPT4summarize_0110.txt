1. The reported ILI counts from Week28 to Week32, 2022 are 13771, 13570, 13067, 11626, and 11715. The trend shows a consistent decrease in occurrences, particularly from Week28 (13771) to Week31 (11626), followed by a very slight increase in Week32 (11715). This decline highlights a downward trajectory overall with no significant spikes or substantial fluctuation.
2. Week37, 2022 is within the peak onset season based on U.S. seasonality patterns, as it typically spans Week32 to Week46 before transitioning to the peak season. The data suggest that influenza activity may start increasing in line with seasonal expectations, given the proximity to peak onset timing and slight stabilization at Week32.
3. The declining ILI counts from Week28 to Week32 (2022) suggest reduced influenza activity in the forecast baseline. However, since Week37 aligns with the typical peak onset season, projecting forward using time-series trends anticipates a modest increase from the recent low levels, driven by seasonal progression and potential ramp-up in activity. This leads to a projection of 15046 occurrences for Week37, representing the expected rise in ILI as the peak onset season advances.
4. First, influenza activity remains low nationwide with minimal positivity rates (Week28, 2022 #1; Week29, 2022 #1; Week32, 2022 #1). However, historical seasonality trends indicate rising activity during the peak onset season, which correlates with the timing of Week37, 2022. Second, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, particularly SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, complicates ILI assessments but contributes incrementally to ILI visits (Week28, 2022 #8; Week30, 2022 #10; Week32, 2022 #11). Third, reports of novel influenza infections, such as H3N2v and H1N2v, suggest the presence of isolated cases and highlight surveillance importance as the season progresses (Week30, 2022 #7; Week31, 2022 #4; Week32, 2022 #4).
5. Despite currently low influenza positivity and declining past trends, the alignment with the typical peak onset season (Week32 to Week46), co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens, and sporadic novel influenza cases contribute to the forecasted increase to 15046 ILI occurrences in Week37, 2022.
