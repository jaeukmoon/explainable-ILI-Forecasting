1. The ILI occurrences over the past five weeks (Week11, 2022 to Week15, 2022) show a consistent upward trend: 1940 (Week11), 2032 (Week12), 2021 (Week13), 2096 (Week14), and 2181 (Week15). This represents an overall increase, with an average weekly growth of approximately 60.25 cases [(2181 - 1940)/4], despite a minor fluctuation in Week13. This upward trend indicates a steady rise in respiratory illness activity.
2. Season Classification for Week20, 2022: According to Background Knowledge, Week20 falls into the **Peak season** since flu activity in the U.S. often experiences a secondary peak in Week19 or Week20. This is corroborated by the CDC reports highlighting increasing transmission potential and rising influenza activity in most U.S. regions leading up to Week15, 2022.
3. Historical correlation and time-series forecasting: The linear growth trend seen in the past five weeks was used to forecast ILI occurrences for Week20. Using a continuation of the average weekly growth rate (approximately 60.25 cases per week), the predicted ILI occurrence is:
4. 2181 (Week15 value) + 5 weeks × 60.25 (weekly growth rate) ≈ 2211. This straightforward time-series projection accounts for the stable upward trajectory in ILI occurrences. Minor variability (e.g., fluctuation in Week13) and potential seasonal intensification (e.g., due to Peak season dynamics) align with this prediction.
4. CDC factors influencing the forecast:
5. 1) **Predominance of Influenza A(H3N2):** Across all five weeks, Influenza A(H3N2) constituted nearly 100% of subtyped cases (e.g., 99.9% in Week15), and its antigenic differences and partial mismatch with vaccines suggest high transmissibility and ongoing circulation into Week20. This likely fuels the continual increase in ILI occurrences.
6. 2) **Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (including SARS-CoV-2):** Over the weeks, the co-circulation of influenza and other respiratory viruses (e.g., 5.0% SARS-CoV-2 coinfection in Week15) adds complexity to the ILI trend. This amplifies outpatient visits for respiratory issues and supports steady increases in ILI cases.
7. 3) **Seasonal escalation and regional variability:** CDC reports highlighted increasing influenza activity nationally and regionally in the northeast and mountain areas (Week15). The intensification of activity in these regions aligns with the historical secondary peak in Week19/Week20, contributing to the Week20 projection.
5. In summary, the prediction of 2211 ILI occurrences for Week20, 2022 is based on a steady upward trend in ILI cases from Week11–Week15, a forecasted weekly growth rate of 60.25 cases, and the Peak season categorization with elevated transmission of Influenza A(H3N2). Additional factors, including regional intensification, co-circulating viruses, and viral evolution, strongly align with this continued growth trend.
