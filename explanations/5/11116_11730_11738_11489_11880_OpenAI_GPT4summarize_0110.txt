1. The reported ILI occurrences for Week39 to Week43, 2021 are 11116, 11730, 11738, 11489, and 11880. Over these five weeks, ILI activity shows a moderate, fluctuating upward trend, with slight increases interrupted by a minor dip in Week42 (11489). This indicates stable, gradually rising ILI trends rather than sharp peaks or declines.
2. Based on U.S. seasonality patterns, Week48, 2021 aligns with the peak season, which spans from Week46 of one year to around Week6 of the following year. This is supported by the upward ILI trend and the CDC's anticipation of potential influenza increases (Week43, 2021 #10).
3. From a time-series perspective, the observed fluctuations suggest a stable upward trend in ILI activity. Projecting this forward, combined with seasonal impacts and CDC warnings of potential increases, aligns with Week48, 2021 showing a rise in ILI counts to 17928, consistent with seasonal dynamics during the peak period.
4. Recent weeks indicate a gradual rise in positive influenza cases, from 0.1% positivity (Week39, 2021 #5; Week40, 2021 #1; Week41, 2021 #1) to 0.2% positivity in Week43, 2021 (Week43, 2021 #1). The upward trends in confirmed Influenza A detections (Week43, 2021 #2, #3) reinforce expectations of increasing ILI.
5. Vaccination efforts remain active but lack significant coverage data (Week39, 2021 #8; Week40, 2021 #8; Week41, 2021 #8; Week42, 2021 #8; Week43, 2021 #8). With recommendations to vaccinate by late October and no strong uptake trends, prevention efforts might underperform.
6. The presence of co-circulating respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, contributes to rising respiratory illnesses (Week39, 2021 #2, #10; Week40, 2021 #10; Week41, 2021 #10; Week42, 2021 #10; Week43, 2021 #10). This amplifies ILI as the flu season intensifies during the peak period.
7. Combining the steady rise in ILI activity across Week39 to Week43, the onset of the peak season, rising influenza detection rates, stable vaccination trends, and overlapping respiratory viral activity, the predicted ILI occurrence of 17928 for Week48, 2021 aligns with time-series forecasts and CDC projections for increasing flu activity during this period.
