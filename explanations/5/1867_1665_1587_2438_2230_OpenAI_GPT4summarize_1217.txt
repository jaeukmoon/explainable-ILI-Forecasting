1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed significant fluctuations, with values ['1867', '1665', '1587', '2438', '2230']. There was a decline from 1867 (Week37, 2021) to 1587 (Week39, 2021), followed by a sharp increase to 2438 (Week40, 2021) and a slight decrease to 2230 (Week41, 2021). This pattern demonstrates variability but with an overall increase in the latter part of the 5-week period.
2. The correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the sharp rise during Week40 and Week41, 2021, signals intensifying respiratory illness activity. This uptick aligns closely with the increase to 2626 occurrences after 5 weeks, indicating a continuation and amplification of the observed upward trend.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained low but shifted gradually, from 2.1% (Week37, 2021) to 1.8% (Week41, 2021), consistently staying below the national baseline. However, increases in non-influenza respiratory illnesses (e.g., driven by other respiratory pathogens) were noted, contributing to the rising ILI trend.
4. PIC-associated mortality consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, ranging from 21.1% in Week37, 2021, to 17.5% in Week41, 2021, primarily driven by COVID-19. This heightened mortality reflects significant respiratory illness presence contributing to future ILI case counts.
5. Limited influenza activity was reported during the 5-week period, with positivity rates at clinical labs between 0.1% and 0.2%, indicating minimal direct influenza contributions. However, overlapping impacts of non-influenza respiratory viruses, behavioral shifts in healthcare-seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic, and surveillance challenges likely amplified ILI trends, culminating in the future rise to 2626 occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2626 (Week46, 2021) are attributable to the sharp rise in Weeks 40–41, 2021, shifts in outpatient visit trends driven by other respiratory illnesses, persistently high PIC-related mortality, and pandemic-induced disruptions impacting ILI surveillance interpretations.
