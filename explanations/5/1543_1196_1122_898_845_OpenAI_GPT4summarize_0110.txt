1. The reported ILI counts from Week25 to Week29, 2022 are 1543, 1196, 1122, 898, and 845. The trend shows a consistent week-over-week decrease in ILI occurrences. This steady decline provides evidence of waning influenza activity during these weeks, without any significant spikes or fluctuations.
2. Week34, 2022 falls within the U.S. off-season, which spans from after the peak season (typically ending by Week6) through to the next peak onset season (beginning around Week32-35). Coupled with the declining trends in ILI activity up to Week29, 2022 and low ILI positivity rates, Week34 aligns with the off-season classification.
3. From a time-series perspective, the downward trend observed in Week25-Week29 suggests continued low activity. Projecting forward, the trend indicates further stabilization at minimal levels. The forecast for Week34, 2022 reflects this pattern, anticipating ILI occurrences to stabilize at a lower baseline, hence the prediction of 679 cases.
4. Influenza activity remained low nationwide, with positivity rates declining steadily over the weeks (Week25 #1, Week26 #1, Week27 #1, Week28 #1, Week29 #1). This consistent low level of detection supports the forecast of reduced occurrences.
5. COVID-19 significantly drives respiratory illness trends (Week26 #6, Week27 #6, Week28 #4, Week29 #5). With the majority of deaths and a substantial proportion of PIC indicators linked to COVID-19 rather than influenza, this limits the expected impact of pure influenza-driven ILI activity during the forecast period.
6. Vaccination trends, though unhighlighted during these weeks, remain subdued. Coupled with co-circulation of other respiratory viruses (Week28 #8, Week29 #10), these factors maintain minimal influenza-specific contributions to ILI counts.
7. The consistent decrease in ILI counts, off-season timing of Week34, diminished influenza activity due to low positivity rates, and confounding impact from non-influenza respiratory illnesses together justify the prediction of 679 occurrences. This aligns with the observed waning trend and off-season stability.
