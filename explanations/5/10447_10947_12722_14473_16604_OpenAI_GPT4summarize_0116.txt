1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from Week48, 2023 (10447) to Week52, 2023 (16604) exhibit a consistent increasing trend. Over the 5 weeks, the weekly growth rates are roughly +4.8%, +16.2%, +13.8%, and +14.8%, indicating a sustained rise in influenza-like illness activity. The projected ILI occurrences for Week5, 2024 are derived using this growth trend. Calculating the average growth rate across these weeks yields approximately 12.4%. Applying this average growth to Week52's value (16604) gives: 16604 / (1 + 12.4%) ≈ **13019** as the expected Week5 value, assuming this period marks the end of a seasonal peak decline.
2. Forecasting target week (Week5, 2024) belongs to the "Peak season" since historical and CDC data indicate the flu season in the U.S. typically spans from Week48 through about Week6, with sustained high activity levels. Week5 falls firmly within this period of elevated activity, characterized by increased ILI outpatient visits, hospitalization rates, and influenza positivity rates in clinical specimens across the U.S.
3. Correlation analysis of past trends supports this prediction. The consistent growth across the weeks suggests that Week52, 2023 might mark or near the seasonal peak, after which a mild decline is expected. Historical seasonal patterns show that ILI occurrences during the latter part of peak season start decreasing due to factors such as gradually reduced transmission and improved immunization coverage. Applying this understanding, the drop in expected cases reflects the typical late-peak trend while maintaining higher-than-baseline activity levels. The projected value (13019) incorporates a deceleration of growth from the maximum value recorded in Week52, 2023 (16604).
4. Three key factors from the CDC reports that quantitatively support the prediction are:
5. (1) **Virus activity trends**: Week52, 2023 reports 17.5% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, up from 6.8% in Week48. This sharp increase indicates peak season intensity, but the gradual weekly rises suggest declining acceleration as the peak approaches. Factored into the projection, this slowing positivity supports the predicted downturn after Week52.
6. (2) **Vaccination and antiviral treatment**: The CDC repeatedly emphasized ongoing and widespread vaccination campaigns and antiviral availability, which help reduce transmission rates. With increasing late-season vaccinations and treatments, a moderated decline in occurrences aligns with the emphasis on control efforts. This is reflected in the projected Week5, 2024 value being lower than the Week52 peak.
7. (3) **Co-circulation of respiratory viruses**: Week52, 2023 data identifies the simultaneous spread of influenza, RSV, and COVID-19, contributing to complex ILI dynamics. However, no novel influenza mutations were reported, and antiviral susceptibility remained high, limiting potential exacerbation of cases. This suggests a primary reliance on standard seasonal progression for forecasting the expected decline in activity.
5. In summary, the projected ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week5, 2024) are 13019, reflecting a slight reduction from the Week52, 2023 peak activity (16604). This prediction is supported by (1) the historical trend of slowing growth during late-peak periods, (2) classification of Week5, 2024 within the peak season, (3) consistent influenza positivity and hospitalization trends, alongside vaccination efforts, and (4) absence of novel ILI variants. These factors collectively suggest a deceleration in ILI growth while maintaining relatively high activity typical of the peak season.
