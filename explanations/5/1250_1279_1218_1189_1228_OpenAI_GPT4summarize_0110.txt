1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week40, 2021 to Week44, 2021 were 1250, 1279, 1218, 1189, and 1228, showing a slightly fluctuating trend with no consistent increase or decrease over the period. While the counts fell slightly from Week41 to Week43, there was a modest increase from 1189 in Week43 to 1228 in Week44, suggesting near-stable activity within a relatively low range.
2. Forecasting Week49, 2021 aligns this period with the peak season. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans from Week46 of one year through Week6 of the next. By Week44, 2021, influenza activity indicators, including increasing positive test results (Week44, 2021 #1), point to the developing peak season. Hence, it is reasonable to classify Week49, 2021 as part of the peak season, as activity is expected to rise further.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the slightly fluctuating yet stable ILI counts between Week40 and Week44 suggest minimal deviations in the near term. However, given that Week49, 2021 is projected to fall in the peak season, a slight increase in ILI occurrences is expected. Combining the stable past pattern with the anticipated seasonal uptick, the forecasted value of 1325 reflects this trend.
4. Public health labs and clinical labs show increasingly positive influenza tests (Week44, 2021 #1, #2), with Influenza A(H3N2) comprising the vast majority of cases (Week44, 2021 #3). The concentration of cases in certain regions (Week44, 2021 #11) suggests localized transmission contributing to increased activity as the season progresses.
5. The CDC has distributed 158.7M influenza vaccine doses thus far, promoting vaccination for individuals 6 months and older (Week44, 2021 #9). However, no significant vaccination coverage updates have been reported, and vaccination uptake may lag, potentially limiting its immediate impact on reducing ILI occurrences.
6. Multiple respiratory viruses, including Influenza A(H3N2), are co-circulating, particularly affecting younger age groups such as 5–24-year-olds (Week44, 2021 #10, #11). This, combined with changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and delayed reporting due to COVID-19 impacts (Week44, 2021 #11, #13), complicates surveillance and suggests increasing activity during the peak season.
7. Given the slightly fluctuating past ILI trend, classification of Week49, 2021 as part of the peak season, increasing positivity in surveillance data, suboptimal vaccination impact, and the influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses, the projected ILI occurrence of 1325 for Week49, 2021 reflects a moderate seasonal rise consistent with ongoing trends.
