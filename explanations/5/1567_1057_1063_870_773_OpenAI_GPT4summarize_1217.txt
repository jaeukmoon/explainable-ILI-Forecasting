1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values of ['1567', '1057', '1063', '870', '773']. The highest value occurred in Week 4, 2022, at 1567, followed by a sharp drop to 1057 in Week 5, 2022, and further reductions to 773 by Week 8, 2022, the lowest in this period. This clear downward trend indicates a reduction in ILI activity during these weeks.
2. A negative correlation is observed between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the continuous decrease in ILI activity over Weeks 4–8, 2022, does not directly align with the reported future increase to 1117 after 5 weeks. The sharp reduction in Weeks 7 and 8, 2022, does not predict the subsequent rise, suggesting external factors may have influenced this change.
3. Increasing influenza positivity rates were observed, climbing from 1.7% in Week 4, 2022, to 4.1% in Week 8, 2022, despite overall sporadic activity. This suggests that underlying flu activity was intensifying in certain areas, contributing to the rise in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks. Continuously low flu vaccination rates documented throughout Weeks 4–8, 2022, may have further exacerbated susceptibility to ILI during the future period. The steady rise in hospitalization rates, increasing over four consecutive weeks from 4.4 per 100,000 in Week 4, 2022, to 5.2 per 100,000 in Week 8, 2022, reflects escalating severe respiratory cases that could drive higher ILI reporting.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, persisted throughout Weeks 4–8, 2022, with co-infection rates between 5.7% and 6.1% of influenza cases. This overlapping respiratory activity likely contributed to the reported future undifferentiated ILI cases, emphasizing the interaction between pathogens during this period.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1117 (Week 13, 2022) are explained by the increasing influenza positivity rates, low vaccination coverage, rising hospitalization trends, and the co-circulation of respiratory viruses despite the downward trajectory in past ILI data. These factors collectively point to a rebound in ILI activity influenced by epidemiological and healthcare variables.
