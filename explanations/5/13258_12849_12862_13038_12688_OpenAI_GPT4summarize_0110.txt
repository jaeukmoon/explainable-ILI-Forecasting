1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week17 to Week21, 2024, were 13258, 12849, 12862, 13038, and 12688, respectively. This data indicates a declining trend overall, with a small rebound during Week20 (13038), followed by a continued decline in Week21 (12688). The pattern reflects a general decrease with minor fluctuations, consistent with waning flu activity.
2. Week26, 2024, falls within the off-season, as the typical peak season in the U.S. ranges from Week46, 2023, to Week6, 2024. The low positivity rates, declining ILI counts, and reduced flu activity in Weeks17–21, 2024, support this classification, indicating continued low activity typical of the off-season.
3. Historical ILI trends show noticeable declines over the past 5 weeks, with stabilization around the current low values. The pattern indicates a stable or slightly declining trajectory, consistent with off-season expectations. Forecasting to Week26, 2024, aligns with this gradual decline, projecting a reduced ILI occurrence of 9192 due to continued low activity trends.
4. Influenza activity has been low across the U.S., with clinical specimen positivity declining from 3.9% in Week17, 2024, to 1.7% in Week21, 2024, and all regions reporting activity below baseline. This steady reduction reflects diminishing community transmission and supports a lower projection for Week26, 2024.
5. The effectiveness of vaccination remains evident as genetic characterization shows circulating viruses matching current vaccine components. Stable antiviral susceptibility and sustained vaccination encouragement further limit significant influenza spread.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, continue to contribute to respiratory illness trends but have not induced a notable spike in ILI occurrences. Moreover, sporadic avian influenza cases like A(H5) (Week20, 2024; Week21, 2024) do not indicate widespread transmission driving higher ILI counts.
7. In conclusion, the projection of 9192 ILI occurrences for Week26, 2024, accurately reflects the ongoing decline from Week17–21, 2024, the seasonality of the off-season, the effect of effective vaccination and antiviral measures, and low influenza positivity across regions, all sustaining reduced flu activity.
