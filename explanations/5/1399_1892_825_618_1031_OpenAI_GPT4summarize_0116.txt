1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences for Region 6 over the past 5 weeks show a fluctuating pattern: Week4 (1399), Week5 (1892), Week6 (825), Week7 (618), and Week8 (1031). The values demonstrate a significant drop after Week5, reaching a low point in Week7, followed by a modest increase in Week8. This trend indicates a volatile but slightly stabilizing pattern with no consistent growth or decline.
2. Week13, 2021 belongs to the "Off-season" as it falls well past the typical "Peak season" (Week46, 2020 to Week6, 2021) and does not align with the onset of increased flu activity (Peak onset season). During off-seasons, ILI occurrences generally remain at or near baseline levels, reflecting minimal influenza activity influenced by external factors like healthcare dynamics and vaccination trends.
3. To forecast ILI occurrences for Week13, 2021, a blend of quantitative methods and contextual adjustments is applied. First, we calculate the average of the past 5 weeks: (1399 + 1892 + 825 + 618 + 1031) / 5 = 1153. This average serves as a base prediction. Adjustments are then made based on season classification. As Week13, 2021 falls in the off-season, a slight upward adjustment of 2% (reflecting the modest rebound observed between Week7 and Week8) is applied to account for potential fluctuations without significant outbreaks. Thus, 1153 * 1.02 ≈ 1176.
4. Three key factors from CDC reports influence the forecast:
5. a. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is noted to have disrupted healthcare trends, reducing ILI-related healthcare visits and complicating traditional surveillance methods. This influences the prediction by maintaining lower-than-expected ILI values, limiting drastic upward movements.
6. b. Influenza activity remains unusually low nationwide, with only 0.1% positive influenza detection rates reported (Week4-Week8). The lack of significant influenza transmission supports a stabilization of ILI occurrences, aligning with minimal changes in values.
7. c. The predominance of Influenza B detections (e.g., 85.7% in Week6 clinical specimens) and the absence of severe flu outbreaks further suppress growth expectations. This sustains the off-season adjustment since no significant virological threats are emerging.
5. The forecast for Week13, 2021 is 1176, reflecting a combination of the slightly increasing trend (Week7 to Week8), seasonal classification (off-season), and the impact of external factors, including atypical flu patterns and COVID-19 pandemic disruptions. The quantitative calculation adjusts the historical average slightly upward to reflect minor fluctuations while accounting for the context of the off-season.
