1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent and significant upward trend, with values rising from 10447 (Week 48, 2023) to 16604 (Week 52, 2023). The week-over-week increases between Weeks 48 and 52 were steady, with particularly strong growth in the last two weeks, jumping from 14473 (Week 50, 2023) to 16604 (Week 52, 2023), indicating an accelerating trend in ILI activity.
2. There is a strong positive correlation between the observed increase in the past 5 weeks of ILI occurrences and the reported future ILI occurrences of 13019 (Week 5, 2024). While the trajectory peaked at 16604 in Week 52, 2023, the future figure likely reflects a stabilization or slight decrease following the peak, in line with historical influenza activity patterns around this time of year.
3. Multiple factors from the summarized reports align with the observed and projected ILI patterns: (1) the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza rose significantly, from 6.8% (Week 48, 2023) to 17.5% (Week 52, 2023), with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 consistently dominating; (2) outpatient visits for ILI increased each week, rising sharply from 4.0% (Week 48, 2023) to 6.9% (Week 52, 2023); (3) cumulative influenza-associated hospitalizations climbed steeply from 5.5 per 100,000 population in Week 48, 2023, to 22.3 per 100,000 in Week 52, 2023, reflecting rising severe outcomes in parallel with increasing cases.
4. Co-circulation of influenza, COVID-19, and RSV contributed to elevated respiratory illness activity, as noted every week in the reports. This co-circulation likely fueled increases in ILI occurrences by diversifying the causes of respiratory illness, amplifying overall case numbers.
5. In summary, the reported 13019 future ILI occurrences (Week 5, 2024) can be attributed to the strong upward trend observed in Weeks 48 to 52, 2023, the increasing positivity rates and outpatient ILI visits, rising hospitalizations, and the co-circulation of respiratory viruses. These factors suggest an expected peak followed by a moderation, consistent with seasonal trends.
