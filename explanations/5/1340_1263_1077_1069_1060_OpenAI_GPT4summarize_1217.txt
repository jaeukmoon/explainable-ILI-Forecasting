1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a clear downward trend, with values decreasing from 1340 (Week49, 2020) to 1263 (Week50, 2020), 1077 (Week51, 2020), 1069 (Week52, 2020), and finally 1060 (Week53, 2020). This overall reduction suggests sustained low flu activity during these weeks, potentially linked to external influences such as concurrent health events or preventive measures.
2. A negative correlation is evident between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the consistent decline in Weeks 49 to 53, 2020, contrasts with the sharp reduction to 586 future occurrences observed after 5 weeks. The declining trajectory during the past period appears to forecast the continued drop in ILI activity in subsequent weeks, reflecting suppressed influenza activity across the monitored period.
3. Virologic surveillance showed minimal influenza positivity rates, ranging from 0.2% (Week49, 2020) to 0.1% (Week53, 2020), signaling atypically low influenza circulation. This aligns with the sharp decrease in future ILI occurrences. Outpatient visits for ILI remained steady at 1.6% throughout all weeks, consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%, indicating stable yet below-average respiratory illness activity. PIC mortality rates exceeded epidemic thresholds throughout Weeks 49 to 53, 2020, but were primarily attributed to COVID-19 rather than influenza. These factors collectively support the decline in ILI activities.
4. Influenza vaccination recommendations persisted each week, but no specific vaccination uptake data was reported. However, reduced influenza virus circulation, changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic, and limited hospitalizations (118 confirmed flu hospitalizations by Week53, 2020) contributed to an atypical flu season, suppressing ILI occurrences further.
5. In summary, the future decrease to 586 ILI occurrences is attributed to the declining past trend from Week49 to Week53, 2020, coupled with persistently low influenza positivity rates, stable but below-baseline outpatient ILI visits, COVID-19-induced surveillance disruptions, and minimal influenza-associated hospitalizations. These factors collectively reflect an atypically low and suppressed flu season during the concurrent pandemic.
