1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a steady upward trend, with values of ['1230', '1477', '1504', '1541', '1543']. Beginning with 1230 in Week29, 2021, there was a consistent increase over the period, reaching 1543 in Week33, 2021, which was the highest value recorded during this interval. This pattern indicates progressive growth in ILI activity over the observed weeks.
2. A strong positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the consistent upward trend in past occurrences from Week29 through Week33, 2021, aligns with the further increase to 1889 ILI occurrences 5 weeks later (Week38, 2021). The steady rise observed during the final weeks of the past time-series points to escalating respiratory illness activity that culminates in the reported future value.
3. Outpatient ILI visits exhibited a gradual increase, rising from 1.7% in Week29 to 2.2% in Week33, 2021, though still below the national baseline of 2.6%. This sustained upward movement indicates higher transmission of respiratory illnesses, likely contributing to the future rise in ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exhibited a marked increase, climbing from 7.4% in Week29 to 17.2% in Week33, 2021, consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds. This trend signifies heightened respiratory disease activity, correlating with the subsequent rise to 1889 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
5. Changing healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic were repeatedly highlighted across summarized reports, impacting ILI data interpretation and surveillance systems throughout Week29 to Week33, 2021. These disruptions likely led to accumulated demand or reporting inconsistencies, which could explain the significant rise to 1889 occurrences by Week38, 2021.
6. Continued low influenza activity, with minimal laboratory detections (e.g., no significant findings in Weeks29–33, 2021), alongside the observed increase in ILI trends, suggests non-influenza respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, as major contributors to the rise in future occurrences. This aligns with additional respiratory pathogens driving the reported trends during the pandemic.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1889 in Week38, 2021, are explained by the steady increase in ILI occurrences across Weeks29–33, rising outpatient ILI visits remaining below baseline, PIC-related mortality consistently exceeding thresholds, pandemic-altered healthcare-seeking behaviors, and non-influenza respiratory illnesses contributing to the observed trends.
