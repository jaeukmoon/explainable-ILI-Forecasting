1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a predominantly increasing trend, with values of ['1046', '965', '1107', '1072', '1230']. While Week25, 2021 saw a dip to 965 from 1046 (Week24, 2021), subsequent weeks showed consistent increases, peaking at 1230 (Week29, 2021). This overall upward trajectory indicates growing respiratory illness activity during the observed period.
2. The positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the consistent increase from Week26, 2021 to Week29, 2021 aligns with the reported jump to 1531 future occurrences by Week34, 2021. The gradual escalation in Weeks28 and 29, 2021, acts as a precursor to the future ILI surge.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI saw slight but consistent increases, rising from 1.2% in Week25, 2021 to 1.3% in Week28, 2021, and further to 1.7% in Week29, 2021. This gradual rise in medical consultations for ILI contributed to the observed future increase in total ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, with percentages rising from 6.6% in Week25, 2021 to 7.4% in Week29, 2021. Despite COVID-19 being the dominant contributor, this elevated PIC mortality reflects increased respiratory illness activity, corresponding to the future ILI rise.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted ILI data accuracy throughout all weeks, with alternative care settings and concurrent surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 complicating influenza trend assessments. These factors likely contributed to an apparent increase in future ILI reporting to 1531 occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 1531 future ILI occurrences (Week34, 2021) stem from the observed upward trend in Weeks28 and 29, 2021, increasing outpatient visits for ILI, elevated PIC mortality consistently above epidemic thresholds, and the compounded effects of pandemic-related disruptions to surveillance and healthcare-seeking patterns.
