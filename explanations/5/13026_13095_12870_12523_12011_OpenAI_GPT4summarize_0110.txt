1. The reported ILI counts from Week17 to Week21, 2023 are 13026, 13095, 12870, 12523, and 12011. The trend shows a gradual decline over the five weeks, with a consistent reduction in ILI occurrences from Week17 (13026) to Week21 (12011). This suggests a downward trajectory rather than fluctuations or stabilization.
2. Week26, 2023, falls within the off-season based on typical ILI seasonality patterns in the U.S., where the off-season spans from Week1 to approximately Week31 each year. Recent CDC reports indicate low viral activity and positivity rates, further supporting the classification of Week26, 2023, as part of the off-season.
3. Extrapolating from the time-series data, the substantial decline across the weeks suggests that ILI occurrences might continue to decrease slightly, with a slower rate of decline toward stabilization. Historical patterns during the off-season generally align with minimal activity, leading to a projected value of 8099 for Week26, 2023.
4. Nationwide influenza positivity remains low, ranging between 0.9% and 1.2% in clinical specimens across Week17 to Week21, 2023. This reflects limited transmission and supports reduced ILI predictions (Week17, 2023 #1; Week18, 2023 #1; Week21, 2023 #1).
5. Reports confirm that the circulating influenza strains are antigenically similar to the vaccine, and susceptibility to antivirals remains high, minimizing the likelihood of a sustained resurgence (Week17, 2023 #7; Week18, 2023 #9; Week19, 2023 #7; Week20, 2023 #7). Influenza-associated pediatric fatality counts and PIC-associated deaths have remained stable or declined (Week17, 2023 #5; Week18, 2023 #5; Week19, 2023 #6; Week20, 2023 #6; Week21, 2023 #6).
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV continues to influence ILI trends, but no evidence suggests a major spike associated with influenza (Week17, 2023 #10; Week18, 2023 #11; Week19, 2023 #9; Week20, 2023 #10; Week21, 2023 #8).
7. In summary, the projected value of 8099 ILI occurrences in Week26, 2023, is justified by the consistent decline in ILI counts, the classification of the week within the off-season, the low influenza positivity and activity levels, vaccine efficacy against circulating strains, and the minor influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses. These combined factors indicate stable, reduced ILI activity typical of the off-season.
