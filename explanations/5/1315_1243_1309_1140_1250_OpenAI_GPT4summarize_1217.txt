1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but overall downward trend, with values of ['1315', '1243', '1309', '1140', '1250']. After an initial decline from 1315 (Week36, 2021) to 1243 (Week37, 2021), the values briefly rose to 1309 (Week38, 2021), followed by a significant drop to 1140 (Week39, 2021). However, Week40, 2021 saw an increase to 1250. This variation indicates unstable but declining ILI activity, with a moderate recovery in the final week.
2. A positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident despite fluctuations in the past data, as the decrease observed in Week39, 2021 aligns with the reduction to 1203 occurrences by Week45, 2021. The moderate rebound in Week40, 2021 suggests a partial recovery, but the overall declining trend influences the lower future ILI activity.
3. Consistent low outpatient visits for ILI, reported at 2.3% during Week36, 2021 and then steadily decreasing to 1.9% by Week40, 2021 (below the 2.6% national baseline), reflect low ILI-related healthcare encounters. This steady decline corresponds with the lower future ILI occurrences.
4. High percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) were consistently recorded, with Week36, 2021 at 21.0% declining to 18.0% by Week40, 2021, yet remaining well above the epidemic thresholds throughout. This sustained PIC mortality, driven primarily by COVID-19, underscores high respiratory illness activity, indirectly suppressing influenza-specific trends and lowering future occurrences.
5. The impact of shifts in healthcare behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as detailed in each CDC report, disrupted traditional ILI surveillance. This has likely resulted in underrepresentation of true trends and contributed to the moderate decline to 1203 occurrences after 5 weeks.
6. Minimal influenza virus circulation was reported consistently, with clinical lab positivity rates remaining at 0.1%, and public health labs showing limited detection. The absence of notable influenza activity during Weeks36 to Week40, 2021 correlates directly with lower future ILI occurrences, as non-influenza pathogens dominated.
7. In summary, the reported 1203 future ILI occurrences (Week45, 2021) can be attributed to the overall declining trend in past ILI data, steady reductions in outpatient ILI visits and PIC mortality percentages, healthcare-seeking behavior shifts impacting surveillance systems, and minimal influenza virus circulation over the observed period.
