1. The reported ILI counts from Week47 to Week51, 2020 are 1464, 1472, 1695, 1661, and 1621, respectively. ILI occurrences initially increased steadily from Week47 (1464) to Week49 (1695). However, a slight decline followed from Week50 (1661) to Week51 (1621). This pattern reflects a mild fluctuation—an initial rise followed by stabilization and a small dip—indicating no consistent upward trend as of Week51, 2020.
2. The target week, Week3, 2021, falls within the traditional peak season (Week46 to Week6) as per historical influenza activity patterns in the U.S. However, the substantially reduced ILI levels, lack of a significant upward trajectory in recent weeks, and low influenza positivity rates reported from Week47 to Week51, 2020 suggest a subdued peak season this year.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the recent mild rise, followed by minor declines in ILI occurrences, indicates a stabilization rather than a noticeable surge. Given the drop from Week49 to Week51, 2020, and the unusually low influenza activity, projecting forward suggests a steady decrease in ILI occurrences, leading to a forecast of 1042 for Week3, 2021.
4. Influenza positivity rates across Weeks47-51, 2020 remained exceptionally low, ranging from 0.1% to 0.3%, much lower than typical seasonal levels. This indicates reduced influenza transmission and supports a prediction of lower ILI counts after five weeks (e.g., Week3, 2021 should reflect this reduction in flu activity).
5. Vaccination was consistently emphasized in reports for Weeks47-51, 2020 as a preventative measure. Although specific uptake trends were undisclosed, increased vaccine encouragement may have contributed to mitigating influenza spread, indirectly impacting ILI levels by reducing potential infections or severe flu cases.
6. Continued COVID-19 mitigation measures (masking, social distancing), reported weekly from Week47 to Week51, 2020, likely suppressed flu transmission, as evidenced by the remarkable decline in influenza positivity rates and lower-than-expected hospitalization rates.
7. A combination of recent stable-to-declining ILI activity, suboptimal influenza transmission trends, high vaccination recommendations, and the indirect effect of COVID-19 mitigation measures justifies the projected future ILI count of 1042 for Week3, 2021 during a muted peak season.
