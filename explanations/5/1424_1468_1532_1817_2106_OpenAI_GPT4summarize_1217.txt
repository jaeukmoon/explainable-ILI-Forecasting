1. The past time-series ILI occurrences exhibited a consistent upward trend over the 5 weeks, starting at 1424 (Week 29, 2023) and rising steadily to 2106 (Week 33, 2023). This continuous growth, marked by notable increases such as from 1532 (Week 31, 2023) to 1817 (Week 32, 2023), indicates a sustained escalation in ILI activity during this period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the increasing ILI occurrences in the past data and the reported heightened future occurrence of 3069 (Week 38, 2023). The steady rise in Weeks 31–33, 2023, particularly from 1817 to 2106, serves as a precursor to the subsequent amplified ILI activity observed 5 weeks later.
3. Hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed influenza consistently rose, from 573 admissions in Week 29, 2023, to 677 in Week 32, 2023, reflecting increasing severity of ILI cases. This likely contributed to the observed future surge of 3069 in Week 38, 2023.
4. Concurrent increases in PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) mortality rates, exceeding epidemic thresholds throughout the period, rose from 5.6% (Week 29, 2023) to 10.0% (Week 33, 2023). This steady elevation in respiratory-related deaths aligns with higher ILI trends.
5. Outpatient visits for ILI climbed incrementally, from 1.1% in Week 29, 2023, to 1.5% in Week 33, 2023, with the highest contributions from children under 5. This growth in ILI-related healthcare interactions signals rising respiratory illness activity.
6. Increased co-circulation of respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2, consistently highlighted in the CDC reports, likely acted as an additive driver for the future rise in ILI cases.
4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 3069 (Week 38, 2023) can be attributed to the consistent upward trend in past ILI occurrences during Weeks 29–33, 2023; rising hospitalizations and PIC mortality rates exceeding epidemic thresholds; increasing outpatient visits for ILI; and the additive impacts of co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors collectively reflect an intensified ILI burden that transitions into heightened activity in the future.
