1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week40, 2021 to Week44, 2021 show a mostly stable trend with a significant increase in Week44. The counts were 11730, 11738, 11489, 11880, and 13895, respectively. Weeks40 to Week43 exhibited small fluctuations, but Week44 saw a sharp rise of over 17% compared to Week43, reflecting an upward trajectory in the latest week.
2. Based on U.S. influenza patterns, Week49, 2021 aligns with the peak season, typically spanning Week46 through Week6 of the following year. The sharp increase in Week44, along with the expected progression toward peak flu activity, confirms that Week49, 2021 belongs to the peak season.
3. Time-series analysis indicates that the Week44 surge aligns with the onset of peak activity. Considering the trend (11730 to 13895), the ongoing rise in influenza positivity rates, and the expectation of increased flu activity during peak flu season, a continued upward trajectory is anticipated, projecting 18608 occurrences five weeks after Week44, 2021.
4. Influenza positivity rates observed in Week43, 2021 (0.2%) and Week44, 2021 (0.3%) show a steady increase compared to Weeks40–42, suggesting a growing prevalence of influenza viruses moving into peak season. This increase aligns with the rising ILI occurrences.
5. Age-specific outbreaks, such as reports of a significant cluster in those aged 5-24 in Michigan during Week44, 2021, suggest localized high-transmission areas driving numbers upward. Such outbreaks likely contribute to national increases (Week44, 2021 #5, #11).
6. CDC promotion of vaccination efforts remains strong as of Week44, 2021, but with no significant trends in vaccination uptake reported and ongoing challenges in healthcare behaviors affected by overlapping SARS-CoV-2 trends (Week44, 2021 #7, #8, #12), community-level protection may remain suboptimal.
7. In summary, the steady upward ILI count trend, confirmed by rising influenza positivity and increased localized outbreak activity, combined with the expectation of peak season onset by Week49, 2021, justifies the forecast of 18608 occurrences.
