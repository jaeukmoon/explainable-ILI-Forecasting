1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 28–32, 2021) depicted a consistent upward trend, starting from 1072 in Week 28, increasing steadily to 1541 in Week 32. The week-on-week growth, though incremental, highlighted rising respiratory illness activity throughout this period, culminating at the highest value (1541) in Week 32, 2021.

2. A strong positive correlation is observed between the rising past occurrences and the future ILI occurrence of 1887 (Week 37, 2021). The steady trajectory of increasing ILI occurrences through Weeks 28–32 serves as a precursor to the higher level seen after 5 weeks. The continued upward momentum suggests that the trend persisted, resulting in the increase to 1887.

3. Factors from the summarized reports that correlate with the future ILI occurrences include:
   - Outpatient ILI visit percentages rose from 1.3% in Week 28, 2021, to 2.1% in Week 32, 2021. This consistent increase across age groups highlights rising respiratory illness activity, strongly aligning with the future ILI spike.
   - PIC mortality rates exceeded epidemic thresholds throughout (e.g., 7.1% in Week 28 to 14.6% in Week 32), primarily driven by COVID-19 but reflective of heightened respiratory morbidity that likely influenced ILI trends.
   - The increasing spread of other respiratory viruses, as noted in Weeks 30–32, 2021, alongside reports of localized rises in ILI activity, suggests non-influenza pathogens contributed to the elevated future ILI occurrences.

4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1887 in Week 37, 2021, can be explained by the consistent upward trend observed over Weeks 28–32 (2021), increasing outpatient ILI visits across all age groups, persistently high PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, and the concurrent spread of non-influenza respiratory pathogens.
