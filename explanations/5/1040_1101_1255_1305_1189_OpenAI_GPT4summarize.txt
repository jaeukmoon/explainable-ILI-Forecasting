1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating but overall downward trend, with values of ['1040', '1101', '1255', '1305', '1189']. There was an increase from 1040 (Week 33, 2021) to 1305 (Week 36, 2021), followed by a decline to 1189 in Week 37, 2021. The decreasing trajectory by Week 37 suggests a reduction in ILI activity heading into subsequent weeks.

2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the decrease observed in Week 37, 2021, aligns with the reported drop to 969 future occurrences by Week 42, 2021. The decline in Week 37 serves as an indicator of reduced ILI activity influencing the future period.

3. Clinical lab reports consistently indicated minimal influenza virus circulation, with positivity rates as low as 0.1% (Weeks 34–36, 2021). Additionally, non-influenza respiratory viruses, particularly COVID-19, were identified as primary contributors to ILI visits. This dominance of non-influenza respiratory illnesses reduced the ILI activity attributed to influenza, aligning with the future decline.

4. A high proportion of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) was consistently reported, peaking at 21.1% (Week 37, 2021). However, these deaths were primarily driven by COVID-19, with minimal influenza involvement. This trend reinforces the notion of limited influenza-driven ILI activity contributing to lower future ILI levels.

5. Shifts in healthcare-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, as documented throughout Weeks 33–37, 2021, disrupted ILI surveillance. These changes likely influenced the interpretation of trends, potentially contributing to the reported decline to 969 occurrences due to reduced underlying influenza burden.

6. In summary, the reported 969 future ILI occurrences (Week 42, 2021) can be explained by the downward trend in Week 37, minimal influenza circulation coupled with dominance of non-influenza respiratory viruses, substantial PIC mortality primarily driven by COVID-19, and pandemic-induced challenges in ILI surveillance and reporting.
