1. The reported ILI counts from Week36 to Week40, 2023 are 1300, 1301, 1524, 1503, and 1464. A steady low count persisted in Week36 (1300) through Week37 (1301), followed by a sharp increase in Week38 (1524), and a slight decline in Week39 (1503) and Week40 (1464). This pattern suggests an early upward trend during the Peak onset season, with a slight stabilization afterward, aligning with typical seasonal expectations during this period.
2. Based on U.S. seasonality, Week45, 2023 occurs during the Peak onset season, as it falls just prior to the conventional peak season (Week46 onward). Week45 represents a phase where ILI activity starts climbing steadily but has not yet reached its highest intensity.
3. Projecting from the time series, the increase observed in Week38 (1524) signifies growing ILI activity characteristic of transitioning into the Peak onset season. Although stabilization occurred during Weeks39 and 40, the general upward trajectory during the past weeks combined with historical seasonality (Peak onset patterns) suggests a continued rise leading to the forecasted ILI occurrence of 2707 for Week45.
4. The positivity rate for influenza has exhibited slight increases over the 5 weeks (Week36: 0.7%, Week37: 0.8%, Week38: 0.9%, Week39: 1.0%, Week40: 1.1%). This slow rise aligns with expected ILI growth leading into the Peak onset season when viral activity begins to increase (Week36 #1, Week37 #1, Week38 #1, Week39 #1, Week40 #1).
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses—specifically SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and influenza—is contributing to elevated ILI levels, with consistent effects across all regions. This co-circulation, noted repeatedly across CDC reports (Week36 #9, Week37 #9, Week38 #8, Week39 #7, Week40 #6), plays a significant role in driving ILI fluctuations.
6. Outpatient respiratory visits plateaued at higher-than-baseline rates (Week36 2.0%, Week37 2.0%, Week38 2.0%, Week39 2.1%, Week40 2.2%), driven by age-related variations (notably 0–4 years). A consistent rise, particularly in young children, strongly correlates with anticipated increases in Week45 (Week36 #4, Week37 #6, Week38 #3, Week39 #3, Week40 #8).
7. The forecast of 2707 ILI occurrences for Week45, 2023 is justified by observed time-series trends (gradual increase); seasonality (Week45 as part of the Peak onset season); rising positivity rates, amplified outpatient visits, and co-circulation of respiratory viruses. These combined factors underscore an ongoing escalation in ILI activity leading toward the peak season.
