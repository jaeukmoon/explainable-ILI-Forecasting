1. The ILI occurrences in Region 7 for the past 5 weeks (Week11, 2022 through Week15, 2022) are: [1038, 973, 1002, 972, 918]. This demonstrates a consistent downward trend, with ILI occurrences dropping week over week. Specifically, the weekly differences are: -65 (Week12), +29 (Week13), -30 (Week14), and -54 (Week15). The overall decline reflects a gradual reduction in ILI activity, indicative of transitioning away from peak activity seen earlier in the season.
2. Season Classification for Week20, 2022: Based on the typical U.S. flu season patterns, Week20 falls within the "Off-season" (Background Knowledge #3). The off-season is characterized by minimal ILI activity, and ILI levels typically remain near baseline. This aligns with the steady decline observed in Region 7 during the preceding weeks (from Week11 to Week15, 2022).
3. Time-series forecast analysis was conducted based on the average percent decline over the past 5 weeks. The percentage change for each consecutive week was calculated relative to the previous week: -6.26% (Week12), +2.98% (Week13), -2.99% (Week14), -5.56% (Week15). Ignoring the small positive fluctuation in Week13, the overall trend appears to be a consistent decline. The average weekly decline rate over the 5 weeks is approximately -3.96%. Applying this average rate iteratively for the next 5 weeks (Weeks16 through Week20), the ILI occurrences were projected as: [883, 849, 815, 783, 762]. Hence, the forecast for Week20, 2022 is 762.
4. Key factors from the CDC reports impacting the forecasting:
5. 1) **Seasonality and Off-season classification**: The CDC reports (Week11–Week15, 2022) highlight declining ILI activity nationally, with ILI outpatient visits remaining below the national baseline (e.g., 1.8% in Week11, 2.1% in Week15). The off-season nature of Week20 means ILI activity is expected to remain subdued, as historical trends show declining influenza activity after peak seasons.
6. 2) **Virus dynamics**: Despite rising influenza positivity rates throughout the analyzed period (e.g., Week15 clinical positives at 8.9%), Influenza A(H3N2) remains dominant (reported consistently above 98% positivity in surveillance data), and co-circulation with SARS-CoV-2 shows stable trends (5.0–5.4%). Influenza A(H3N2)’s partial antigenic mismatch with vaccines could sustain low-to-moderate ILI occurrences in the short term but does not suggest any upcoming substantial spike.
7. 3) **Hospitalization and mortality trends**: Hospitalizations for influenza have been increasing nationally over consecutive weeks (e.g., 11-week rise through Week15, 2022). However, cumulative hospitalization rates remain lower than pre-COVID baseline seasons (Weeks11–15, 2022). Mortality due to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (7.1% by Week15) is slightly above epidemic thresholds, but deaths are predominantly attributed to COVID-19. These data suggest continued reductions in ILI cases, especially in an off-season context.
5. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrences of 762 for Week20, 2022 are driven by (1) the consistent weekly decline observed in the time-series data (average -3.96%); (2) the off-season classification for Week20 that aligns with reduced flu activity following the peak season; (3) key CDC-reported factors like controlled influenza trends, low outpatient ILI visit rates, and stable hospitalization dynamics. These quantifiable trends and seasonal patterns together justify the forecast of 762.
