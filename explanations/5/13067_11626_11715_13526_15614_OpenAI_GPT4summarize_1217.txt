1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5-week period showed a fluctuating but overall upward trend: ['13067' (Week30, 2022), '11626' (Week31, 2022), '11715' (Week32, 2022), '13526' (Week33, 2022), '15614' (Week34, 2022)]. After a decrease from Week30 to Week31, ILI counts steadily increased in the latter weeks, with Week34 recording the highest value. This trajectory indicates rising ILI activity toward the end of the observed period.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 17337 (Week39, 2022) follows the upward trend observed during Weeks32–34, 2022. The consistent increases in Weeks33 and 34 suggest accumulation of respiratory illness cases, correlating with the reported elevated ILI activity after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient ILI visit percentages, while low nationwide, showed gradual increases, especially in children aged 0-4 years: 1.6% (Week30), 1.5% (Week31), 1.4% (Week32), 1.5% (Week33), 1.8% (Week34), with the age group 0-4 years reporting the highest rates (e.g., 7.0% in Week34). This upward trend in symptomatic cases aligns with the observed rise in ILI occurrences.
4. Despite low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.5%-0.4% nationally), pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC)-related deaths remained high, at or above 9.2%, throughout the period. This persistent PIC activity, mainly driven by COVID-19 with minor influenza contributions, indicates robust respiratory illness circulation, correlating with future ILI increases.
5. Surveillance challenges and variable healthcare-seeking behaviors post-pandemic (as noted by the CDC in all weeks) contributed to underreporting and evolving patterns of ILI data. This instability in detection potentially masked respiratory illness trends, amplifying the abrupt rise to 17337 future occurrences.
6. In summary, the observed 5-week trajectory of increasing ILI instances (Weeks32–34, 2022), higher outpatient ILI rates (especially in children), sustained PIC mortality levels, and post-pandemic disruptions to respiratory illness reporting collectively explain the reported 17337 future ILI occurrences in Week39, 2022.
