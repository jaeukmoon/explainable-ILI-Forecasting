1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week12, 2024 to Week16, 2024 are 12267, 11544, 9899, 8238, and 6649. This data demonstrates a consistent and sharp decline in ILI activity across the five-week period. The trend suggests significant decreases in weekly ILI occurrences, moving from elevated levels toward baseline, with no fluctuations or rebounds observed.
2. Considering the timing, Week21, 2024 falls within the off-season for influenza activity, as it occurs well after the typical peak season (Week46 to Week6) and during a period characterized by reduced ILI prevalence. This classification aligns with the observed national declines in positivity rates, hospitalizations, and deaths from Week12, 2024 to Week16, 2024.
3. From the time-series perspective, the sharp and consistent weekly declines signal that influenza activity is receding. Projecting this trend forward, ILI occurrences are expected to continue decreasing but at a diminishing rate as activity approaches baseline levels. Week21, 2024, consequently, reflects the trailing end of this pattern, estimating ILI occurrences at 3826 as part of a continuing downtrend.
4. Nationwide clinical positivity rates fell steadily from 10.5% in Week12, 2024 to 4.8% in Week16, 2024. This steady decline across weeks supports expectations of overall reduced ILI activity by Week21, 2024, consistent with broader influenza trends in the off-season.
5. Influenza vaccines showed strong alignment with circulating strains, maintaining effectiveness (Week14, 2024 #7; Week15, 2024 #7; Week16, 2024 #9). Additionally, low antiviral resistance and stable genetic characteristics provide sustained protection (Week12, 2024 #10; Week13, 2024 #10; Week16, 2024 #9). These factors continue to contribute to reduced transmission downstream.
6. Despite co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like RSV and COVID-19 (Week12, 2024 #8; Week13, 2024 #11; Week14, 2024 #8; Week15, 2024 #8; Week16, 2024 #10), influenza-specific activity continues declining. No evidence of novel influenza virus emergence was detected (Week12, 2024 #6; Week16, 2024 #8), further ensuring reduced overall ILI counts.
7. Given the steady declines in ILI occurrences, the off-season timing of Week21, 2024, well-matched vaccines, low antiviral resistance, and waning co-circulation, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 3826 is justified as part of the continuing downward trend toward baseline levels.
