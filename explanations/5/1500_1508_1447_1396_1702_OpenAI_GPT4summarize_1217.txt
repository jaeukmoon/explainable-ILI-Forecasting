1. The past time-series ILI occurrences demonstrated fluctuating activity with an overall upward trend by the end of the 5-week period. The values progressed as ['1500' (Week 40, 2023), '1508' (Week 41, 2023), '1447' (Week 42, 2023), '1396' (Week 43, 2023), '1702' (Week 44, 2023)], showing a decline between Weeks 41 and 43, followed by a significant rise to 1702 in Week 44. This indicates escalating ILI activity in the most recent week of the observed period.
2. There is a strong positive correlation between the observed upward shift in Week 44 (1702, the highest in the 5-week period) and the significantly higher future occurrence of 2854 after 5 weeks. The sharp increase in Week 44 serves as an early indicator and precursor to the amplified ILI activity reflected in the future data (Week 49, 2023).
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed consistent increases over 5 weeks, from 2.2% (Week 40, 2023) to 2.9% (Week 44, 2023), reaching the national baseline in the final week. This alignment with the baseline threshold suggests rising symptomatic respiratory illness activity, contributing to the future ILI spike.
4. Hospitalizations showed a noteworthy rise, with cumulative rates progressing from 0.1 per 100,000 (Week 40, 2023) to 1.2 per 100,000 (Week 44, 2023), the second-highest rate at this stage of the season since 2010. Increased hospitalizations indicate heightened respiratory severity, favoring the surge in future ILI occurrences.
5. Regional influenza activity trends, as noted in the CDC reports, reflected increasing virologic positivity and outpatient visits in regions with moderate to high activity (e.g., Southeast, South Central, and West Coast by Week 44, 2023). These regional increases signal rising transmission dynamics, aligning with the future rise to 2854 occurrences.
6. In summary, the future occurrence of 2854 ILI cases (Week 49, 2023) stems from the upward trend in Week 44, 2023, increasing ILI-related outpatient visits reaching the national baseline, rising hospitalization rates, and escalating regional influenza activity. These combined factors provide a comprehensive explanation of the observed future ILI surge.
