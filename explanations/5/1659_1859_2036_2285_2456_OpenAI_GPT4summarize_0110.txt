1. The reported ILI counts from Week28 to Week32, 2021 are 1659, 1859, 2036, 2285, and 2456. This demonstrates a consistent upward trend in ILI occurrences, with weekly increases averaging approximately 9.4%. The steady rise suggests early activity increases entering a seasonal phase rather than random fluctuations or spikes.
2. Forecasting target week (Week37, 2021) belongs to the Peak onset season. This classification aligns with Week32, 2021's upward trend in respiratory illness cases seen nationwide, typically indicative of the early weeks of the onset phase (Week32–Week46 in historical U.S. data).
3. From the time-series perspective, the increasing trend observed over the past five weeks indicates continued upward momentum in ILI occurrences. Projecting forward using trends from Week28 to Week32, 2021, the model anticipates significant growth through Week37, 2021, resulting in 3091 cases. This forecast reflects a mathematical progression of the observed weekly increase rates.
4. Outpatient ILI visits increased consistently over the five weeks, reaching 2.1% by Week32, 2021, though still below the national baseline of 2.6%. This rise is driven largely by other respiratory illnesses or viral activity, with limited influenza involvement, as noted in all summarized reports. (Week28, 2021 #3, Week29, 2021 #2, Week31, 2021 #3, Week32, 2021 #3).
5. Two cases of a novel Influenza A(H1N2)v virus were reported in Week32, 2021, potentially signaling localized impacts, though no evidence of human transmission was detected. Such novel strains, even in isolated settings, may contribute to broader respiratory illness patterns and uncertainties in forecasting (Week32, 2021 #2).
6. The healthcare-seeking behavior alterations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continue to complicate accurate ILI surveillance. The overlap of COVID-19 symptoms and other non-ILI respiratory pathogens creates complexities, as seen in all reports (Week28, 2021 #6, Week30, 2021 #8, Week31, 2021 #8, Week32, 2021 #8). This factor likely contributes to gradual increases in reported ILI counts.
7. The predicted ILI occurrence of 3091 results from the observed linear growth pattern over the past weeks, the alignment with the historic Peak onset period, increasing outpatient ILI trends across all age groups, and the influence of respiratory viruses other than influenza. Together, these suggest continued steady growth entering Week37, 2021.
