1. The reported ILI counts from Week11 to Week15, 2024 are 15334, 14964, 13834, 13338, and 13604. The data shows a consistent decline from Week11 (15334) to Week14 (13338), followed by a slight increase in Week15 (13604). This trend indicates an overall decrease in ILI activity with minor week-to-week fluctuations, implying that ILI cases are tapering as the season progresses.
2. In the U.S., Week20, 2024 falls well within the off-season period, following the peak season that typically concludes by Week6. The declining ILI activity (Week11, 2024 #6; Week12, 2024 #5; Week13, 2024 #7; Week14, 2024 #3; Week15, 2024 #3) and positivity rates (Week11, 2024 #2, #3; Week12, 2024 #1, #7; Week13, 2024 #1, #2; Week14, 2024 #1; Week15, 2024 #1) further support this classification.
3. The time-series data reveals a steady reduction in ILI cases with occasional fluctuations. Given this trend and the seasonal shift to off-season as of Week20, 2024, ILI activity is expected to continue declining over the next five weeks, stabilizing at a lower level around 13038 occurrences. Historical patterns of tapering ILI activity from previous off-season periods align with this projection.
4. Vaccination rates and efficacy remain a key factor in mitigating ILI activity (Week11, 2024 #8; Week12, 2024 #9; Week13, 2024 #9; Week14, 2024 #7; Week15, 2024 #6). The matching of vaccine components to circulating strains has contributed to overall control of the season’s influenza trends and fewer severe cases as the season wanes.
5. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and RSV adds complexity but does not significantly amplify ILI occurrences (Week11, 2024 #10; Week12, 2024 #8; Week13, 2024 #11; Week14, 2024 #8; Week15, 2024 #8). These overlapping activity levels contribute to a stable, non-spiking ILI forecast for Week20, 2024.
6. Declining hospitalization rates (Week11, 2024 #4; Week12, 2024 #3; Week13, 2024 #5; Week14, 2024 #4; Week15, 2024 #4) and reduced testing positivity (Week11, 2024 #2; Week12, 2024 #1; Week13, 2024 #1; Week14, 2024 #1; Week15, 2024 #1) indicate sustained lower transmission levels. This suggests that ILI cases will continue stabilizing toward the 13038 level during the off-season.
7. In conclusion, the projected ILI occurrences of 13038 for Week20, 2024 are justified by the overall declining time-series trend, alignment with off-season characteristics, vaccination effectiveness, stable co-circulation influences, and ongoing reductions in hospitalization and positivity rates. These factors collectively indicate minimal resurgence and continued decline in ILI activity.
