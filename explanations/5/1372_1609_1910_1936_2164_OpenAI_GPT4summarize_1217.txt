1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1372', '1609', '1910', '1936', '2164']. Starting at 1372 in Week29, 2021, there was an increase to 1609 in Week30, 2021, followed by sustained growth to 1910 in Week31, 2021, then reaching 2164 in Week33, 2021. This consistent upward trajectory indicates a progressively increasing respiratory illness activity throughout the observed period.
2. There is a clear positive correlation between the past time-series ILI data and the future occurrence of 1665 in Week38, 2021. The increasing trend in Weeks29–33, 2021, reflects heightened respiratory illness transitions during the previous weeks, which then plateaued or slightly declined by the future period. This partial decline aligns with temporal respiratory illness patterns influenced by external factors such as seasonality and interventions.
3. Rising outpatient ILI visits were observed over consecutive weeks, increasing nationally from 1.7% (Week29, 2021) to 2.2% (Week33, 2021), with notable surges across age groups like 0–4 and 5–24 years during Week32, 2021. These increases were attributed to heightened respiratory illness transmission, reflecting an upward trend in ILI occurrences, which subsequently contributed to the future ILI value.
4. Elevated PIC mortality consistently occurred throughout Weeks29–33, 2021, ranging from 7.4% (Week29) to 17.2% (Week33), significantly exceeding the epidemic thresholds. Continued dominance of COVID-19 as the primary cause of PIC deaths, alongside minimal influenza activity, indicates overlapping influences on respiratory illness trends, contributing to overall ILI occurrences seen after Week33.
5. Ongoing disruptions in healthcare-seeking and reporting behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with altered surveillance metrics affecting ILI data capture, were reported consistently from Week29 through Week33, 2021. These disruptions likely caused variabilities in ILI interpretation and reporting, influencing the calculated future ILI data, such as the 1665 in Week38, 2021.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 1665 (Week38, 2021) is explained by the steady upward trend in past ILI occurrences (Weeks29–33, 2021), increased ILI-related outpatient visits, consistently elevated PIC mortality well beyond epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-related disruptions to ILI reporting and healthcare behaviors. This combination of factors underscores the observed patterns in future respiratory illness activity.
