1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, with reported values of ['1517', '1585', '1673', '1893', '1956']. The rise from 1517 in Week9, 2021, to 1956 in Week13, 2021, represents a steady increase in ILI activity. This continuous escalation throughout all observed weeks signals a growing trend in respiratory illness activity.
2. The upward trajectory in the past ILI occurrences strongly correlates with the future ILI increase to 2022 after 5 weeks. The steady rise from Week9 through Week13, 2021, implies continued growth in ILI cases culminating in a higher future value.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI edged upward, from 0.8% (Week9, 2021) to 1.0% (Week13, 2021), suggesting slight but escalating healthcare encounters for influenza-like illnesses, aligning with the observed future increase in occurrences to 2022.
4. Despite low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% continuously across Week9 to Week13, 2021), persistent PIC mortality far above epidemic thresholds (e.g., 14.6% in Week9 to 11.4% in Week13, 2021) indicates ongoing significant respiratory health burdens, likely contributing to the elevated future ILI outcomes.
5. Behavioral changes in seeking healthcare due to the COVID-19 pandemic and overlapping symptomatology disrupted traditional ILI surveillance, potentially centralizing and amplifying non-specific respiratory illness reports in future weeks, leading to a rise to 2022 cases.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2022 can be attributed to the observed steady upward trend in ILI activity over the 5 weeks (Week9–Week13, 2021), correlating outpatient visit increases, the persistence of PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-related surveillance disruptions.
