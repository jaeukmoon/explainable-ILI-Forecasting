1. The reported ILI counts from Week46, 2023 to Week50, 2023 are 1403, 1331, 1703, 1827, and 2186. The trend demonstrates a significant upward trajectory, especially from Week47, 2023 (1331) to Week50, 2023 (2186), with consistent increases in ILI occurrences week-over-week. This steep rise aligns with heightened influenza activity, characteristic of the peak season period.
2. Forecasting target week (Week3, 2024) belongs to the peak season. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans from Week46 to Week6 of the following year. Given that Week3, 2024 falls within this window, it aligns with peak season characteristics, marked by elevated community spread and ILI activity trends observed in the preceding weeks.
3. From the time-series perspective, the sharp increases observed from Week47, 2023 to Week50, 2023 strongly suggest that ILI occurrences are likely to peak shortly and then begin to stabilize toward Week3, 2024. Projecting forward five weeks, ILI reports are anticipated to decline slightly yet remain elevated. Thus, the model predicts 1470 ILI occurrences as an outcome of subsiding peak intensity.
4. Increasing respiratory positivity rates: Week46, 2023 reports 4.9% of respiratory specimens testing positive, which rises sharply to 12.8% by Week50, 2023. This continuing positivity suggests sustained illness transmission well into Week3, 2024.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses: The ongoing activity of influenza (especially Influenza A), SARS-CoV-2, and RSV contributes to the elevated healthcare burden and overlapping impacts on respiratory illness, as highlighted in Week46, 2023 #9; Week48, 2023 #9; Week49, 2023 #9; Week50, 2023 #8.
6. Vaccination trends and antiviral availability: By Week50, 2023, flu vaccination campaigns remain ongoing without notable antiviral resistance (#8, #10). While vaccination efforts reduce overall illness intensity population-wide, the time factor limits immediate protection for the entire unvaccinated population five weeks forward.
7. In conclusion, the sharp growth in ILI occurrences between Week46, 2023 and Week50, 2023, the peak season timeline (covering Week3, 2024), and strong influencing factors like heightened virus positivity, co-circulating respiratory pathogens, and delayed vaccination uptake combine to justify the ILI forecast of 1470 for Week3, 2024.
