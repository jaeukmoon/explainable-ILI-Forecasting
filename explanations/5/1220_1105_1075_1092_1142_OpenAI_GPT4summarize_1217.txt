1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating pattern with a downward trend at first followed by a slight increase, with values of ['1220', '1105', '1075', '1092', '1142']. There was an initial decline from 1220 (Week26, 2023) to 1075 (Week28, 2023), which was followed by a gradual recovery to 1142 in Week30, 2023, suggesting some resurgence in ILI activity toward the end of the observed period.
2. A positive correlation is evident between past and future ILI occurrences. The minor increase during Weeks 29-30, 2023, after the previous decline implies trends of gradual rise, which potentially culminated in the slightly higher future occurrences of 1208 reported 5 weeks later.
3. Week30, 2023, respiratory illnesses co-circulating with influenza-like symptoms, such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2, continued to impact disease surveillance and possibly drove increased ILI activity. Weekly outpatient visits for ILI consistently showed slightly elevated levels among younger age groups, specifically 4.2% in children under 5 in both Weeks 29 and 30, 2023. Despite low flu activity, transmission of Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 reported in Weeks 27-30, 2023, reflected a potential driver for sustained occurrences over the season. Increased PIC-related deaths (5.6% to 5.7%) in Weeks 29 and 30, 2023, compared to earlier periods also align with persistence of respiratory illnesses.
4. Incremental changes in hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed influenza were documented late in the observed period, from 573 in Week29, 2023, to 649 in Week30, 2023. This uptick in hospitalizations, although modest, reflects ongoing circulation of influenza and respiratory viruses, which would contribute to sustained or increased ILI future occurrences.
5. In summary, the reported 1208 future ILI occurrences (5 weeks post-Week30, 2023) can be attributed to the slight resurgence in ILI trends observed during Weeks 29-30, 2023, continued impact of co-circulating respiratory pathogens, higher ILI rates among specific age groups, increased PIC mortality rates surpassing thresholds, and rising hospitalization data toward the end of the observation period.
