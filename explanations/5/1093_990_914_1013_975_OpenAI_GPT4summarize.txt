1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but generally stable trend, with values of ['1093', '990', '914', '1013', '975']. While there was an initial decline from 1093 (Week 5, 2021) to 914 (Week 7, 2021), a modest recovery occurred in subsequent weeks, peaking at 1013 (Week 8, 2021) before slightly dropping again to 975 (Week 9, 2021). This pattern suggests no significant sustained increase or decrease in ILI activity during the observed weeks.

2. A moderate positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. Although the past data remained relatively stable, the slight recovery toward Weeks 8 and 9, 2021, aligns with the higher future occurrences of 1496 after 5 weeks (Week 14, 2021). This suggests that the minor upward movement toward the later weeks may have contributed to the eventual surge.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI reflected minimal activity, remaining consistently below the baseline (2.6%) throughout Weeks 5–9, 2021, with figures like 1.1% (Weeks 5–6, 2021), 1.0% (Week 7, 2021), 0.9% (Week 8, 2021), and 0.8% (Week 9, 2021). This declining trend in outpatient visits may reflect under-reporting or delayed healthcare-seeking behavior, but the slight uptick in later weeks could indicate latent respiratory illness activity preceding the observed future rise.

4. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza remained historically low (e.g., 0.6–0.7 per 100,000 population across Weeks 5–9, 2021), while deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) were significantly above epidemic thresholds, ranging from 25.0% in Week 5, 2021, to 14.6% in Week 9, 2021. Although PIC mortality was primarily driven by COVID-19, these elevated proportions indicate a background of respiratory-related illness activity that could have contributed to the subsequent increase in ILI cases.

5. Healthcare disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic were consistently reported, including altered healthcare-seeking behaviors and challenges in traditional ILI surveillance. These factors likely masked early indicators of increasing respiratory illness activity and may have delayed recognition of cases, contributing to the observed future surge to 1496 occurrences.

6. Despite consistently low influenza activity (e.g., 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive across all 5 weeks), the future increase may reflect the role of non-influenza respiratory illnesses, as pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare systems and surveillance likely amplified the classification of broader respiratory symptoms as ILI.

7. In summary, the reported 1496 future ILI occurrences (Week 14, 2021) can be explained by the stabilization and modest recovery of past ILI trends, diminishing outpatient visits underscoring possible under-reporting, persistently elevated respiratory-related PIC mortality, and the compounded effects of pandemic-induced surveillance and healthcare-seeking challenges. Combined, these factors likely set the stage for the future ILI surge.
