1. The ILI occurrences between Week21 and Week25, 2023, exhibit an overall decreasing trend: 2047 (Week21), 2368 (Week22), 1667 (Week23), 1600 (Week24), and 1467 (Week25). While Week22 saw a temporary spike (2368), the following weeks consistently declined, culminating in 1467 by Week25. This downward trajectory suggests a steady reduction in ILI activity.
2. Based on historical seasonality patterns in the U.S., Week30, 2023, falls within the off-season, spanning from Week01 to approximately Week31 each year. The low ILI positivity rates and declining trends up to Week25, 2023, further confirm that Week30, 2023, is within the off-season.
3. The past occurrences show a progressive decline in ILI numbers after Week22, indicating stabilization well below baseline levels by Week25 (1467). Projecting this pattern forward five weeks suggests a continuation of this trend, with minimal fluctuations, leading to an anticipated value near or slightly above 1468 for Week30, 2023.
4. Influenza activity has remained minimal, with test positivity rates consistently near 1.0%-1.2%, and influenza makes up a small share of co-circulating respiratory illnesses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (Week21-Week25, 2023 #1, #9, #10).
5. Outpatient visits for ILI declined to 1.4% in Week25 from 1.9% in Week22, staying below the national baseline of 2.6% (Week22-Week25, 2023 #4). Regional and age-based variations in respiratory illness contributions have not caused notable spikes.
6. Flu vaccination trends and vaccine coverage were not specifically updated in the reports, leaving no major influence from increased vaccination rates. However, widespread protection against transitional outbreaks, combined with reduced flu positivity, supports low future ILI activity (Week21-Week25, 2023 #9).
7. Declining influenza positivity rates, minimal viral circulation, falling outpatient ILI visits, and Week30’s alignment with the off-season collectively support the projection of 1468 ILI occurrences, mirroring ongoing reductions in respiratory illness activity trends.
