1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrate a generally decreasing trend, followed by a slight rebound in the final week, with values of ['1263', '1077', '1069', '1060', '1115']. The data show a decline from 1263 (Week 50, 2020) to 1060 (Week 53, 2020), with a minor increase to 1115 in Week 1, 2021. This pattern suggests an overall reduction in ILI activity, interrupted by a modest resurgence in the final week.
2. There is a negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences, as the declining trajectory in the past weeks (especially Weeks 50–53, 2020) contrasts with the sharp drop to 522 future occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 6, 2021). This suggests that the continued decrease in the observed trend signals a sustained reduction in ILI activity over time.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently stable at 1.6% across Weeks 50–53, 2020, and increased only slightly to 1.7% in Week 1, 2021, staying significantly below the national baseline of 2.6%. This low rate of healthcare encounters supports the observed decline in future ILI occurrences due to minimal respiratory illness activity during the past weeks.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) peaked at 17.2% (Week 1, 2021), exceeding epidemic thresholds but primarily driven by COVID-19 rather than influenza. These disruptions, coupled with minimal influenza activity reported (e.g., 0.4% positivity in Week 1, 2021), reflect suppressed flu transmission, which likely contributed to the diminished future ILI cases.
5. COVID-19-related changes in healthcare-seeking behavior, documented in every week’s report, likely disrupted traditional ILI surveillance and limited the detection of influenza or other respiratory illnesses. The competing dominance of COVID-19, suppression of other respiratory diseases, and atypical seasonal patterns align with the decline to 522 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
6. Influenza activity remained unusually low nationwide, with clinical labs reporting minimal positivity rates (e.g., 0.3%–0.4% across Weeks 50, 2020, to Week 1, 2021). Coupled with low hospitalization rates (e.g., 129 total cases by Week 1, 2021), this minimal transmission supports the ongoing decline and significantly reduced future ILI occurrence.
7. In summary, the drop to 522 future ILI occurrences (Week 6, 2021) can be attributed to the consistent downward trend in past weeks, low outpatient ILI visit rates, PIC mortality driven primarily by COVID-19, suppressed flu activity, minimal influenza positivity/hospitalization trends, and pandemic-driven changes in healthcare behavior impacting respiratory illness patterns.
