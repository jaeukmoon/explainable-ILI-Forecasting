1. The reported ILI counts from Week9 to Week13, 2022 are 1512, 1701, 1940, 2032, and 2021 respectively. The data reveals a consistent upward trend from Week9 (1512) to Week12 (2032), followed by a slight dip in Week13 (2021). This reflects sustained growth over four weeks with only a minor decline at the end, signaling a predominantly increasing trajectory.
2. Forecasting the target week (Week18, 2022) aligns with the off-season category. According to U.S. influenza season classifications, this week falls after the general peak season and remains outside the defined peak onset season. Additionally, available CDC data (Week13, 2022 #1, #4, #5) indicate low outpatient ILI visits and a downward trend in specific regions, consistent with off-season activity.
3. The time-series data shows an increasing pattern transitioning into stability with a slight dip by Week13, 2022, resembling off-season behavior. Projecting the observed upward momentum forward five weeks involves moderate growth, stabilized by emerging off-season characteristics, converging at the predicted ILI occurrence of 2529.
4. Influenza positivity increased substantially over the five weeks, rising from 5.8% in Week9, 2022 to 8.3% in Week13, 2022 (Week9, 2022 #2; Week13, 2022 #2), suggesting heightened transmission, primarily driven by Influenza A(H3N2).
5. Despite vaccination availability, antigenic differences in the dominant H3N2 strain relative to the vaccine strain (Week9, 2022 #5; Week10, 2022 #9; Week13, 2022 #9) indicate reduced vaccine effectiveness, likely contributing to continued ILI growth in the near term.
6. The simultaneous co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 with influenza (Week9, 2022 #9; Week12, 2022 #9; Week13, 2022 #13), exerts a compounding effect on respiratory illness visits, supporting an elevated baseline ILI occurrence.
7. In summary, the forecasted value of 2529 for Week18, 2022 is justified by the historical upward trajectory, off-season classification with modestly increasing trends, persistent Influenza A(H3N2) activity, reduced vaccine efficacy, and augmented transmission due to co-circulating respiratory viruses. These combined factors align with the projected ILI count.
