1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week14, 2021 to Week18, 2021) show a relatively stable but fluctuating pattern, with occurrences of ['2003', '2066', '1968', '2118', '2022']. The values vary within a narrow range, indicating low variability around an average level. Using statistical measures, the simple average over these 5 weeks equals \( (2003 + 2066 + 1968 + 2118 + 2022)/5 = 2035.4 \). The recent activity shows minor fluctuations without any sharp increase or decline, suggesting stability.
2. Week23, 2021 falls within the "Off-season." By definition and based on seasonal patterns in the U.S. provided, the Off-season spans from just after the Peak season (approximately Week7) until the Peak onset season (approximately Week32). Minimal ILI occurrences and suppressed flu activity, as reported by the CDC in summarized reports, further confirm this classification.
3. Examining the correlation between historical trends and future projections, the stable pattern observed in the past 5 weeks reflects low fluctuations in ILI. The occurrence values hover around the calculated average (2035.4), with no significant upward or downward momentum. Considering Week23, 2021 occurs in the Off-season when activity remains subdued, we expect occurrences near or slightly below the average value, given minimal seasonal drive. We apply a slight adjustment down from the average for Week23, 2021, reflecting the trend toward stability and Off-season effects (\(-5\% \) decrease), yielding \( 2035.4 \times 0.95 = 1933.63 \approx 1934 \).
4. Three key factors from the summarized CDC reports strongly influence the forecast:
5. Persistently low influenza activity: Reports from Week14 to Week18 highlight 0.1% positivity rates for influenza in clinical labs, showing extremely low disease spread. This unusual suppression, likely influenced by COVID-19 precautions, reduces influenza activity.
6. COVID-19 influence: Public health surveillance and healthcare accessibility changes complicate ILI data while simultaneously limiting flu transmission as seen in historically low hospitalization rates (0.8 per 100,000, consistently below prior seasons).
7. Stable outpatient ILI visits and vaccination effects: Outpatient respiratory visits for ILI remained consistent at 1.1%-1.2%, well below the 2.6% baseline. Additionally, the CDC encourages vaccination, which may further dampen flu cases. These factors collectively point to stable or slightly declining ILI activity.
5. Bringing these observations together, the ILI occurrences for Week23, 2021 are predicted as 1934. This considers the consistently low levels of ILI activity, classification of the target week in the Off-season, and the stable trend reflected in both the time-series data and CDC surveillance reports. Quantitatively, the prediction integrates the historical average (2035) with a modest seasonal adjustment (\(-5\%\)), leading to a stable projection reflective of minimal influenza prevalence.
