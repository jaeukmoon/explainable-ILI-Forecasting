1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating yet slightly rising trend, with values of ['10087', '9782', '10762', '10864', '10818']. The data showed a decline from 10087 (Week26, 2024) to 9782 (Week27, 2024), followed by an increase to 10762 (Week28, 2024). The highest value was 10864 in Week29, 2024, with a slight dip to 10818 in Week30, 2024. This pattern indicates a general stabilization and mild upward trajectory toward the end of the observed period.
2. The gradual upward trend in past ILI occurrences correlates with the future increase to 15539 occurrences, as observed five weeks later (Week35, 2024). The peak values reached during Weeks28–30, 2024, suggest a precursor to heightened ILI activity in subsequent weeks, particularly given the relatively stable baseline that hints at rising undetected respiratory illnesses.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently at or slightly below 1.4% (Week26–Week29, 2024), rising marginally to 1.5% (Week30, 2024). Although below baseline, this gradual increase aligns with escalating ILI trends, reflecting higher healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory illnesses that may contribute to future surges.
4. The co-circulation of influenza, RSV, COVID-19, and other respiratory viruses was persistently reported across Week26 to Week30, 2024. This dynamic could amplify ILI reporting and contribute to the future surge in cases, particularly through overlapping symptoms and testing.
5. Reports of isolated avian influenza A(H5N1) cases and zoonotic risk (Week26–Week29, 2024) highlight additional influenza-related risks that could contribute to heightened ILI vigilance and amplified reporting in the future. Although these incidents were monitored, they underscore viral evolution risks.
6. Despite persistent low respiratory specimen positivity for influenza (0.7–1.0%, Week26–Week30, 2024), genetic variations and minimal antiviral resistance patterns noted in circulating strains (e.g., A(H1N1), A(H3N2)) suggest the potential for sudden shifts in ILI trends or diagnostic attention, contributing to the reported rise in future cases.
7. In summary, the reported 15539 future ILI occurrences (Week35, 2024) reflect the stabilization and mild upward trend in Weeks28–30, 2024, increasing healthcare visits for ILI, the co-circulation of respiratory viruses, risks associated with isolated zoonotic influenza cases, and evolving viral characteristics.
