1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from Week4, 2022 to Week8, 2022 show a clear decreasing trend: 13413 → 10333 → 9072 → 9072 → 9028. From Week4 to Week5, there is a significant drop (13413 to 10333, a decrease of ~22.9%). From Week5 onward, the decreases are smaller: Week6 maintains stability from Week5 (9072 → 9072), and Week8 shows a small decline (9072 → 9028, a decrease of ~0.5%). This pattern indicates stabilization at the end of this 5-week period, suggesting that ILI levels are approaching a baseline level. This stabilization provides a base for extrapolating future occurrences.
2. Week13, 2022 corresponds to the "Off-season," as per background knowledge. The U.S. off-season typically spans from Week9 to Week31 after the peak season ends. During this period, ILI activity is typically low, remaining near baseline levels. The decreasing trend observed in Weeks 4–8 further supports the classification of the forecasted target as being in an off-season period, which influences the prediction (i.e., ILI occurrences are likely to stabilize or gradually rise toward baseline instead of sharply fluctuating).
3. Correlation Analysis: The observed pattern suggests mild stabilization, following the sharper declines in earlier weeks. Extrapolating based on recent data, we calculate the weekly average percentage decrease from Weeks4–8 as follows:
4. - Week4 to Week5: ((13413 - 10333) / 13413) × 100 = ~22.9% decrease
5. - Week5 to Week6: ((10333 - 9072) / 10333) × 100 = ~12.2% decrease
6. - Week6 to Week7: ((9072 - 9072) / 9072) × 100 = 0.0% (stabilization)
7. - Week7 to Week8: ((9072 - 9028) / 9072) × 100 = ~0.5% decrease
8. Averaging these values: (-22.9% -12.2% + 0.0% - 0.5%) / 4 = ~ -8.9% average weekly decrease. Using this, we forecast Week9 with the same rate of decline: 9028 × (1 - 0.089) = ~8211. Repeating this weekly projection from Week9 to Week13:
9. - Week10: 8211 × (1 - 0.089) = ~7473
10. - Week11: 7473 × (1 - 0.089) = ~6810
11. - Week12: 6810 × (1 - 0.089) = ~6203
12. - Week13: 6203 × (1 - 0.089) = ~5674
4. However, several factors from the CDC reports indicate that the ILI levels will rebound slightly toward baseline rather than follow the strict downward extrapolation:
5. - Some regions (e.g., Week8) report increasing influenza activity, evidenced by a rise in flu positivity rates (from 1.7% in Week4 to 4.1% in Week8), suggesting a slight upward correction beginning from Week9 on.
6. - Hospitalization rates have consistently risen over the weeks (e.g., ~4.4 per 100,000 in Week4 to 5.2 per 100,000 in Week8). Although flu-related PIC deaths remain low, waning vaccination rates, antigenic differences in Influenza A(H3N2) viruses, and concurrent respiratory virus circulation (6% co-infection with SARS-CoV-2) suggest ongoing uneven ILI contributions. These act as potential amplifiers for ILI occurrences.
7. - Low vaccination rates compared to the previous season reduce population immunity, increasing the likelihood of slight rebounds in ILI activity, albeit not at peak levels due to the ongoing off-season classification.
5. To account for these external factors and adjust the model's purely statistical projection (~5674 occurrences without adjustments), we add a correction for the expected rebound based on influenza positivity rate increases (averaging +1.4% weekly, Weeks4–8) and the observed hospitalization rise. Assuming this correction translates to an average weekly rise in ILI occurrences by ~10% from Week9 to Week13, we calculate:
6. - Week9 correction: 8211 × 1.1 = ~9032
7. - Week10 correction: ~9032 × 1.1 = ~9935
8. - Week11 correction: ~9935 × 1.05 = ~10432 (adjusted for gradual stabilization in the off-season)
9. - Week12 correction: ~10432 × 1.03 = ~10745
10. - Week13 correction: ~10745 × 1.0 = ~10080
11. Thus, the final projection for Week13, 2022 is **10080**, reflecting a slight rebound toward baseline influenced by external factors.
