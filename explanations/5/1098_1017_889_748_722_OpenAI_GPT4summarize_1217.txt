1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent downward trend with values of ['1098', '1017', '889', '748', '722']. This represents a steady decline in ILI activity from Week 23, 2023, to Week 27, 2023, reaching the lowest value of 722 in Week 27, 2023. The sustained decrease indicates diminishing ILI activity leading up to the future period.
2. A negative correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences. The consistent decline in ILI numbers from 1098 (Week 23, 2023) to 722 (Week 27, 2023) corresponds to lower future activity, as the projected occurrence of 719 after 5 weeks (Week 32, 2023) reflects a continuation of this downward trend, albeit stabilizing at a lower level.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline, declining slightly from 1.6% (Week 23, 2023) to 1.3% (Week 27, 2023). This consistent low level of outpatient activity suggests that the lower ILI occurrence after 5 weeks aligns with minimal healthcare-seeking behavior for ILI symptoms.
4. Hospitalization numbers for laboratory-confirmed influenza also declined steadily, from 850 (Week 23, 2023) to 641 (Week 27, 2023). The reduction in severe respiratory cases often correlates with lower overall ILI occurrences in subsequent weeks.
5. Minimal ILI activity was reported nationwide throughout all jurisdictions, with 51 states/jurisdictions indicating "minimal" activity in Week 23, 2023, and similar trends in Week 27, 2023, reflecting an ongoing decline in influenza spread and related ILI activity, contributing to the reduction in future occurrences.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, were consistently noted in CDC reports as complicating the interpretation of ILI data. Despite their presence, the overall declining trend in ILI metrics suggests a reduced contribution of these viruses to sustained ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 719 future ILI occurrences (Week 32, 2023) align with the consistent downward trend observed in Weeks 23 to 27, 2023. This outcome can be attributed to declining outpatient visits for ILI, reduced hospitalizations for influenza, minimal nationwide ILI activity levels, and limited impact despite co-circulating respiratory viruses.
