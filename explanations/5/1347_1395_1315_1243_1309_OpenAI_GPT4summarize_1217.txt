1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating yet overall declining trend, with values of ['1347', '1395', '1315', '1243', '1309']. After a peak at 1395 (Week 34, 2021), there was a noticeable decline to 1243 (Week 37, 2021) before a small rebound to 1309 (Week 38, 2021). This suggests a general decrease in ILI activity despite minor fluctuations.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the gradual decline in ILI values over the past weeks aligns with the reduction to 1189 future occurrences (Week 43, 2021). The trend in Weeks 34–38, 2021, reflects tapering activity that mirrors the lower reported ILI occurrences 5 weeks later.
3. Nationwide outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below the national baseline, ranging from 2.2% (Week 34, 2021) to 1.9% (Week 38, 2021). This sustained low rate reflects minimal influenza activity and supports the reduced future ILI occurrences of 1189.
4. The percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained elevated, peaking at 21.1% (Week 37, 2021) and 20.9% (Week 38, 2021), primarily driven by COVID-19. This highlights that most respiratory illnesses were likely non-influenza-related, contributing to the lower flu-specific ILI activity in Week 43, 2021.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to COVID-19, as reported consistently across Weeks 34–38, 2021, disrupted traditional ILI surveillance and likely led to underreporting, further contributing to the reduced future ILI occurrences of 1189.
6. Despite minimal influenza virus circulation (e.g., 0.1% positivity across clinical labs throughout Weeks 34–38, 2021) and limited lab detections, other respiratory viruses likely played a dominant role in ILI activity. This reinforces the subdued future ILI values as flu-specific contributions remained limited.
7. In summary, the reported lower future ILI occurrences of 1189 (Week 43, 2021) can be attributed to the overall declining trend in past weeks, consistently low outpatient ILI visits below the national baseline, elevated PIC mortality primarily due to COVID-19, pandemic-induced healthcare-seeking challenges, and minimal influenza virus activity documented in surveillance data.
