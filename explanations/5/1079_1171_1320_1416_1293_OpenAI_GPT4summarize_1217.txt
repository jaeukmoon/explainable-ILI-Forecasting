1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating trend with an initial rise, reaching a peak, and then decreasing. The values were ['1079', '1171', '1320', '1416', '1293'], showing an increase from 1079 (Week43, 2020) to 1416 (Week46, 2020), followed by a decline to 1293 (Week47, 2020). This indicates a short-term peak in ILI activity before subsiding slightly by the end of the observed period.
2. A positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences. The progression from 1079 in Week43, 2020 to 1416 in Week46, 2020, shows a significant rise, with Weeks44–46 demonstrating consistent elevation. The marginal decline in Week47 still reflects heightened activity, correlating with the continuation of moderately high levels resulting in 1069 future occurrences after 5 weeks (Week52, 2020).
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily increased from 1.2% (Week43, 2020) to 1.5% (Weeks45–46, 2020) and stabilized at 1.6% in Week47, 2020. Although these rates were below the national baseline of 2.6%, the consistent rise highlights the growing trend of respiratory illnesses, correlating with elevated ILI occurrences in both the past 5 weeks and in the future.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded epidemic thresholds every week, rising from 8.2% in Week43, 2020 to 11.3% in Week47, 2020. This increase in PIC-associated mortality reflects sustained respiratory-related illness activity, which likely influenced the future ILI occurrences of 1069 in Week52, 2020.
5. Reporting challenges during the overlap of COVID-19 and influenza activity were consistently mentioned in the summarized reports. Unreliable ILI surveillance due to changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and data collection likely obscured true trends, potentially inflating or misinterpreting reported ILI data.
6. Despite low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.2% in Week43 and Week47, 2020) and minimal lab detections, the observed ILI increases were likely impacted by non-specific respiratory symptoms, behavioral changes, or co-circulating pathogens, contributing to sustained or delayed case reporting reflected in future data.
7. In summary, the reported 1069 future ILI occurrences (Week52, 2020) can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks43–46, 2020, the rise in outpatient visits for ILI, persistently elevated PIC-associated mortality above epidemic thresholds, and the impacts of pandemic-related disruptions to ILI surveillance systems.
