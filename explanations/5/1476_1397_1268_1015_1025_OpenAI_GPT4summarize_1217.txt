1. The past time-series ILI occurrences from Week 24, 2024, to Week 28, 2024, show a consistent decline over the 5 weeks, with values of ['1476', '1397', '1268', '1015', '1025']. There was an initial sharp drop from 1476 (Week 24, 2024) to 1397 (Week 25, 2024), followed by further decreases to 1268 (Week 26, 2024) and 1015 (Week 27, 2024). A slight increase to 1025 in Week 28, 2024, suggests a potential stabilization or minor rebound of ILI activity. This indicates that overall ILI activity was decreasing but leveled off by the end of the observed period.
2. The correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent as the consistent decrease in past ILI occurrences aligns with the reported even lower future occurrence of 811 (Week 33, 2024). This continuation of the downward trend reflects an additional decline beyond the observed 5-week period. The trend suggests minimal drivers for renewed increases in ILI activity.
3. Minimal ILI outpatient visits remained consistently below baseline (1.6% in Week 24, 2024, decreasing to 1.4% in Weeks 27 and 28, 2024). This persistence of low outpatient ILI activity is linked to the future reduction in occurrences.
4. Hospitalization rates for influenza remained extremely low, from 0.1 per 100,000 in Week 24, 2024, to 0.1 in Week 28, 2024, with cumulative totals increasing marginally. The absence of significant increases in hospitalization reflects stable or declining severity of respiratory illnesses, aligning with reduced ILI occurrences in the future week.
5. Influenza positivity rates steadily declined in clinical lab testing (1.4% in Week 24, 2024, to 0.8% in Week 28, 2024). This decrease in lab-confirmed influenza activity, paired with low resistance to antivirals and vaccine strain similarity, aligns with the reduced ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
6. In summary, the future occurrence of 811 (Week 33, 2024) is attributed to the sharp and sustained decline in past ILI occurrences, consistently low outpatient ILI activity and hospitalization rates, and decreasing influenza positivity across laboratory tests, reflecting stable or diminishing influenza and other respiratory virus activity.
