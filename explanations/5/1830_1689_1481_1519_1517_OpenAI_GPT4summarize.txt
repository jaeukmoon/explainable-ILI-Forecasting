1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a generally downward trend with some fluctuation, transitioning from 1830 (Week 5, 2021) to 1517 (Week 9, 2021). There was a steady decrease from 1830 to 1481 by Week 7, 2021, followed by minor fluctuations at 1519 (Week 8, 2021) and settling at 1517 (Week 9, 2021). This overall decline reflects historically low influenza activity, consistent with CDC reporting.  

2. Despite the downward trend in past ILI occurrences, the future ILI occurrence after 5 weeks increased to 2003. This suggests a shift in activity that aligns with specific patterns noted in the summarized CDC reports, such as increased ILI among children aged 0–4 years and the unpredictable nature of ILI trends due to pandemic disruptions. The deviation from the past trend highlights the impact of other external factors.  

3. Insights from summarized CDC reports point to several factors correlating with the rise in future ILI occurrences:  
   a. Slight increasing trends in ILI were observed among children aged 0–4 years over the past 8 weeks, while older age groups reported consistent or declining ILI rates. This age-specific increase may contribute to the upward adjustment in future ILI occurrences.  
   b. Altered healthcare-seeking behaviors and COVID-19-related disruptions in surveillance significantly influenced the reliability and interpretation of ILI data, potentially underestimating activity during the observed weeks and amplifying reported future numbers.  
   c. Ongoing COVID-19 activity skewed PIC death percentages (e.g., 14.6% in Week 9, 2021) and healthcare engagement, indicating complex overlap with influenza-like illnesses, which may inflate future ILI data.  

4. In summary, the reported 2003 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks can be attributed to the observed age-specific increases in ILI activity among young children, the disruptions in traditional surveillance and healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the evolving nature of respiratory illness activity. Despite the declining trend in past data, these underlying dynamics contributed to the observed rise in future ILI occurrences.
