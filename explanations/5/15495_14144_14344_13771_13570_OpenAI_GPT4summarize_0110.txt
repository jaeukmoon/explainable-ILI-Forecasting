1. The reported ILI counts from Week25 to Week29, 2022 are 15495, 14144, 14344, 13771, and 13570. The trend demonstrates a consistent decline from Week25 to Week29, indicating a moderate but steady reduction in ILI occurrences during this time frame. This pattern suggests a low flu activity period with no signs of an impending surge.
2. Week34, 2022 corresponds to the Peak onset season, based on U.S. seasonality patterns where Peak onset typically spans from Week32 to Week46. Despite current low activity, this period aligns with the seasonal timing when ILI occurrences begin to increase towards their eventual peak.
3. From the time-series perspective, the steady reduction in ILI counts through Week29, 2022, indicates that ILI activity is currently subdued. However, given that Week34, 2022 belongs to the Peak onset season, historical data suggests a potential moderate increase after Week29 as flu activity usually rises during this time. The forecast of 15614 reflects the expected upward shift influenced by seasonal trends while accounting for the subdued preceding levels.
4. Clinical and public health lab data indicate that influenza activity remains low, with minimal positivity rates of ≤1.8% from Week25 to Week29, 2022 (Week25, 2022 #1-#3; Week26, 2022 #1-#2; Week27, 2022 #1-#3; Week28, 2022 #1-#2; Week29, 2022 #1-#2). However, the co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and RSV complicates predictions due to their effect on healthcare-seeking behavior and respiratory illness trends (Week27, 2022 #10; Week28, 2022 #8; Week29, 2022 #10).
5. Outpatient respiratory illness visits for ILI remained below the baseline (1.6%-1.8%) through Week29, 2022, with mild fluctuations but consistently low overall activity (Week25, 2022 #4; Week26, 2022 #3; Week27, 2022 #4; Week28, 2022 #3; Week29, 2022 #3). This supports the view that ILI occurrences are not rapidly rising but might experience seasonal increases over the next five weeks.
6. The CDC's outlook based on historical patterns and ongoing surveillance aligns with gradual increases in flu activity heading into the Peak onset season. While recent minimal positivity rates and reduced hospitalization levels (Week28, 2022 #5; Week29, 2022 #4) reflect low current impact, the seasonal timing indicates that increased transmission is likely in Week34, 2022 (Week28, 2022 #10; Week29, 2022 #11).
7. Given the declining past ILI trend through Week29, 2022, the timing of Week34, 2022 within the Peak onset season, the low but gradually increasing outpatient visits and hospitalization rates, and seasonal expectations of rising spread, the forecasted occurrence of 15614 reflects a seasonally appropriate moderate increase.
