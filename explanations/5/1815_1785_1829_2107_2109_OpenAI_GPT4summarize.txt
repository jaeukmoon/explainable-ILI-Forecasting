1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but slightly upward trend, starting at 1815 (Week 41, 2021), dropping slightly to 1785 (Week 42, 2021), and subsequently increasing to 1829 (Week 43, 2021) before rising significantly to 2107 (Week 44, 2021) and 2109 (Week 45, 2021). The consistent increase in Weeks 43–45 indicates growing ILI activity as the weeks progressed toward the end of the observed period.  

2. A positive correlation is evident between the past ILI occurrences and the future data. The rise in Weeks 43–45, 2021, reaching 2109 in Week 45, aligns with the reported future increase to 2313 after 5 weeks (Week 50, 2021). This steady rise in past data likely acted as a precursor to elevated ILI activity reflected in the future data.  

3. Public health indicators showed multiple contributing factors to the future increase in ILI occurrences:  

   - The proportion of outpatient visits for ILI steadily rose from 1.8% (Week 41, 2021) to 2.1% (Week 45, 2021), reflecting increasing respiratory illness activity that aligns with the eventual rise to 2313 future occurrences.  
   - Influenza test positivity rates increased from 0.1% (Week 41, 2021) to 0.7% (Week 45, 2021), alongside a sharp rise in Influenza A(H3N2) detections, particularly in younger populations (ages 5–24), which played a significant role in the observed ILI elevation.
   - Deaths from pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold across all observed weeks, though COVID-19 remained the dominant driver. Persistent respiratory illness-related mortality is indicative of ongoing high activity affecting ILI trends.  

4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2313 (Week 50, 2021) stemmed from the upward trend observed toward the latter weeks of the past data (Weeks 43–45), rising outpatient ILI visits, increased influenza positivity rates dominated by A(H3N2), and amplifying respiratory illness activity indicated by sustained PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds. These factors collectively contributed to the observed surge in future ILI data.
