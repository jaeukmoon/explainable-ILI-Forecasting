1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a significant decreasing trend, starting from 17430 in Week 52, 2023, down to 8551 in Week 2, 2024. However, a slight rebound was observed in Week 3, 2024, increasing to 9246. This pattern suggests an overall decline in ILI activity, followed by a minor resurgence toward the end of the observed period.
2. Despite the declining trend in past ILI occurrence data, the increase to 11183 future ILI occurrences by Week 8, 2024, correlates with the slight rebound in Week 3, 2024 (9246). This resurgence might indicate a plateau or beginning of an upward trend, which could predict a measured rise in future occurrences.
3. Elevated outpatient ILI visits above the national baseline are consistent throughout the summarized reports (6.9% in Week 52, 2023, decreasing to 4.3% by Week 4, 2024). Although declining, these rates signal persistent respiratory illness activity that supports the reported future ILI rise.
4. Increasing influenza-associated hospitalizations (e.g., 22.3 per 100,000 in Week 52, 2023, to 47.8 per 100,000 in Week 4, 2024) contribute to the future ILI occurrences. Even though hospital admissions declined in later weeks, the cumulative rate remains historically high, reflecting continued ILI burden.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including RSV and COVID-19, documented across all weeks, is a compounding factor for elevated ILI trends. This dynamic likely influenced the uptick in ILI cases to 11183 after Week 5, 2024.
6. Continued influenza vaccinations and circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, which is antigenically consistent with vaccines, likely moderated the overall severity of future ILI occurrences. However, vaccine uptake might not have been sufficient to entirely suppress the observed rise.
7. In summary, the reported 11183 future ILI occurrences (Week 8, 2024) can be attributed to the declining trend stabilizing with a rebound in Week 3, 2024, persistent outpatient ILI visits above baseline, elevated cumulative hospitalization rates, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and partial vaccine impact.
