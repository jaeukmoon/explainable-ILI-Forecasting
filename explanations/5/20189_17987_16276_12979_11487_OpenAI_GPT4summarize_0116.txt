1. The ILI occurrences in the past 5 weeks (Week34, 2021 to Week38, 2021) show a steadily declining trend: 20189 ➞ 17987 ➞ 16276 ➞ 12979 ➞ 11487. The decreases are consistent, with an average weekly reduction of approximately 2188 cases, calculated as [(20189-17987) + (17987-16276) + (16276-12979) + (12979-11487)] ÷ 4 ≈ 2188. This indicates a trend of decreasing ILI activity over the past 5 weeks.
2. Season classification for Week43, 2021: Week43 falls within the "Peak onset season," as it is the transition period from minimal flu activity (Off-season) towards the ramp-up of ILI activity in fall and early winter. Historically, ILI activity gradually begins to rise from Week32 to Week46, as indicated in Background Knowledge.
3. Based on the trend from past ILI data, the weekly decrease in ILI occurrences is slowing down incrementally over time. The week-over-week reductions are 2202 (20189 to 17987), 1711 (17987 to 16276), 3297 (16276 to 12979), and 1492 (12979 to 11487). The decreasing magnitude suggests a flattening pattern as Region 4 transitions into the Peak onset season. If this slower reduction is modeled using a time-series projection, the expected value in Week43 will reflect a stabilization or minimal decline. Applying the average decrement of the two most recent weeks (3297 and 1492) results in around 11880 for Week43.
4. Three factors from the CDC reports strongly influence the prediction:
5. 1) Minimal influenza virus circulation: Reports from Week34 to Week38 indicate low positivity rates for influenza (<0.1%), with ILI increases attributed to non-influenza viruses or behavioral dynamics during the pandemic. This low influenza activity is consistent with limited ILI rise in the coming weeks.
6. 2) COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses: The dominance of COVID-19 in driving PIC (Pneumonia, Influenza, COVID-19) continues to displace influenza-driven ILI activity. Reports from Week34 to Week38 confirm that non-influenza respiratory infections constitute most recent ILI trends, mitigating immediate spikes in flu-related outpatient visits.
7. 3) Healthcare-seeking behavior and vaccination trends: Consistent promotion of vaccination, combined with altered healthcare-seeking behavior during the pandemic, is suppressing influenza transmission. However, due to limited vaccination data and unclear trends, a slow initial rise in ILI during the Peak onset season is predicted.
5. Considering the historical trend of steady decline, seasonality transitioning into Peak onset season, and influencing factors from CDC reports (low influenza activity, dominance of non-influenza viruses, and gradual vaccination impact), the predicted ILI occurrences for Week43, 2021 in Region 4 stabilize at 11880. This reflects a flattening of the decline as Region 4 transitions into the phase of initial slow ILI increases anticipated in the Peak onset season.
