1. The recorded ILI occurrences from Week38, 2021 to Week42, 2021 are 11487, 11116, 11730, 11738, and 11489. The trend appears largely stable with minor fluctuations, peaking at Week41 (11738) before slightly dropping at Week42 (11489). There were no significant spikes or prolonged declines, indicating steady activity during this period.
2. In the U.S., the peak onset season typically transitions into peak season starting around Week46 of each year. Given that the target week (Week47, 2021) falls within the expected peak season timeframe and considering the gradual upward movement in ILI cases leading into Week42, 2021, Week47, 2021 aligns with the peak season.
3. The stable yet slightly upward trend observed in the past five weeks suggests escalating flu activity. The mild increases over Week40 and Week41 align with the seasonal rise in ILI cases leading into the peak season. A time-series forecasting model projecting this trend forward five weeks anticipates a higher value, consistent with the reported 15058 occurrences for Week47, 2021.
4. Influenza activity, although low, is beginning to show upward trends. Clinical labs reported increases in influenza positivity, with Influenza A (H3N2) being slightly dominant (Week40, 2021 #2, #3; Week42, 2021 #2, #3).
5. Vaccination efforts are ongoing, but no significant vaccination coverage changes have been reported (Week38, 2021 #6; Week40, 2021 #8; Week42, 2021 #8), which might leave a portion of the population more susceptible to influenza as peak activity nears.
6. Concurrent respiratory pathogens, notably COVID-19, are influencing overall PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19)-related deaths and healthcare-seeking behaviors (Week38, 2021 #3, #8, #10; Week42, 2021 #6, #10). Such overlaps can mask or amplify ILI trends.
7. The slight rise in ILI occurrences leading into Week42, alongside the onset of peak season (Week47, 2021), the presence of circulating influenza viruses (predominantly Influenza A H3N2), and moderate vaccination progress, validates the projected 15058 cases. These factors collectively indicate the expected seasonal rise without unprecedented spikes.
