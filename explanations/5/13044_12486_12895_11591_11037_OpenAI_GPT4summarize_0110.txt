1. The ILI counts from Week4 to Week8, 2024 exhibit a decreasing trend, starting at 13044 (Week4, 2024) and progressively reducing to 11037 (Week8, 2024). Although fluctuations are observed between Week5 (12486) and Week6 (12895), the overall decline suggests diminishing influenza activity over this period.
2. Week13, 2024 is forecasted to fall within the off-season. Historically, in the U.S., the off-season extends from approximately Week9 through Week30 following the peak season (Week4 to Week8, 2024). The downward trajectory of ILI occurrences and reduced positivity rates toward Week8, 2024 also supports classification within the off-season.
3. Using the time-series perspective, the steady decline in ILI counts over five weeks (Week4 to Week8, 2024) indicates a waning trend in influenza activity. Projecting this pattern forward aligns with reduced occurrences, stabilizing at a lower baseline of 9079 by Week13, 2024.
4. Decreasing influenza positivity rates from 16.2% (Week4, 2024) to 14.2% (Week8, 2024) reflect a consistent reduction in influenza prevalence. While Influenza A(H1N1) remains the predominant strain, increased activity of Influenza B (41% in Week8, 2024) has not counteracted the overall divisional decline in positivity rates.
5. Cumulative hospitalization rates rose modestly from 47.8 per 100,000 (Week4, 2024) to 61.5 per 100,000 (Week8, 2024), but stabilization in absolute weekly hospitalizations (e.g., 10,148 in Week8, 2024) indicates a slowing rate of severe cases. This trend correlates to a reduced burden on healthcare systems in subsequent weeks.
6. Vaccination rates and outreach efforts, emphasized during the peak season, likely contributed to controlled spread by late-season weeks. No significant novel influenza variants or antiviral resistance were reported during Week4 to Week8, 2024, enabling effective prevention and treatment measures.
7. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and RSV continues to contribute to respiratory illness trends but has not caused additional sharp spikes in ILI. With regions showing variation but no widespread escalation (e.g., activity declines in multiple jurisdictions noted by Week8, 2024), these factors collectively justify a projection of reduced ILI occurrences to 9079 by Week13, 2024.
