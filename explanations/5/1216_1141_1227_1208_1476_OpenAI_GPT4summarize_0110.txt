1. The reported ILI counts from Week32 to Week36, 2023 are 1216, 1141, 1227, 1208, and 1476. Initially, ILI occurrences remained stable between Week32 (1216) and Week35 (1208), with only mild fluctuations. However, there was a significant increase in Week36 (1476), reflecting a potential upward trend. This shift suggests that ILI occurrences could continue to rise in the coming weeks, partially driven by seasonality and increasing respiratory virus co-circulation.
2. Week41, 2023 belongs to the peak onset season, as it falls within the historical period between Week35 to Week46 when ILI activity generally starts climbing from baseline levels toward peak intensity. The increasing trend in ILI activity (Week36, 2023) further supports this classification.
3. From a time-series perspective, the stable to slightly rising pattern from Week32 to Week35, 2023, followed by an increase in Week36, indicates transitionary growth in ILI cases as the system moves into the peak onset season. Based on this historical trend and a moderately rising trajectory, a time-series forecasting model projects Week41, 2023 to have 2168 occurrences, consistent with seasonal expectations.
4. Key factors influencing this prediction include:
5. 1) Influenza activity remains low nationwide but has shown a rise in outpatient ILI visits from 1.3% (Week32) to 2.0% (Week36), with children aged 0–4 years representing the highest rates (Week33 #4, Week36 #4).
6. 2) PIC deaths remain consistently above the epidemic threshold, reflecting ongoing impacts of respiratory co-circulation involving influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV (Week32 #6, Week34 #6, Week36 #5). This co-circulation likely contributes to reported increases in ILI.
7. 3) Despite low overall vaccination updates, altered healthcare-seeking patterns due to cumulative respiratory virus effects (Week33 #9, Week35 #10) suggest underreporting and potential heightened activity in impacted age groups.
5. Nationwide, influenza positivity has shown minor increases (Week32 #1, Week36 #1), with Influenza A continuing to dominate. Shifts toward increased respiratory co-circulation observed in recent weeks (Week34 #9, Week36 #9) coincide with rising outpatient visits, underscoring growth in ILI.
6. Vaccine uptake has not significantly changed during the reporting period, and the protected population remains uncertain (Week32 #10, Week36 #10). This contributes to an environment conducive to viral spread as activity transitions into the peak onset season.
7. Given the recent ILI increase (Week36, 2023), historical patterns during peak onset seasons, co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, elevated PIC deaths, and rising outpatient visits, the projected ILI occurrence of 2168 for Week41, 2023 aligns with expectations of moderate growth.
