1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week34 to Week38, 2023, were 1064, 1228, 1300, 1301, and 1524. This indicates a clear upward trend, with a consistent rise in cases over the five weeks. The increase from Week37 to Week38 (1524 from 1301) is particularly notable, suggesting an accelerating trend as the season progresses.
2. Based on the typical seasonality of influenza in the U.S., Week43, 2023, falls within the Peak onset season (Week35 to Week46). The steady increase in ILI activity leading up to this week aligns with the expected gradual build-up of cases during this phase.
3. Historical patterns reveal that when ILI counts trend consistently upward during the Peak onset season, this momentum tends to persist unless significantly countered by novel interventions. The ongoing rise from Week34 to Week38 suggests likely continued growth, leading to the forecasted value of 1895 for Week43, 2023.
4. Weekly CDC reports indicate that Influenza A remains dominant (Week34, 2023 #2; Week35, 2023 #2; Week38, 2023 #1), which historically correlates with higher ILI activity compared to Influenza B during the Peak onset season. This dominance, especially with H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes (Week35, 2023 #2; Week37, 2023 #2), contributes to the increased cases observed.
5. Outpatient ILI visits have risen steadily, from 1.7% of all visits in Week34 to 2.0% by Week38 (Week34, 2023 #5; Week38, 2023 #3), particularly among children aged 0–4 years. This key demographic consistently reflects and amplifies broader community transmission trends.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses (SARS-CoV-2, RSV) continue to play a role in driving overall ILI metrics (Week36, 2023 #9; Week37, 2023 #9; Week38, 2023 #8). However, their contribution is not expected to overshadow the steady growth of influenza-related cases as reported in recent weeks.
7. Synthesizing these factors—ongoing case growth, alignment with the Peak onset season, historically driven patterns of continued increase in this phase, Influenza A dominance, rising outpatient ILI visits, and co-circulating respiratory viruses—the forecast for Week43 is justified at 1895, reflecting steady momentum in ILI occurrences driven by seasonal and epidemiological dynamics.
