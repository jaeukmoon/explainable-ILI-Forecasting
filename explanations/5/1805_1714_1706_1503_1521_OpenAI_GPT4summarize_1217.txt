1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating yet slightly declining trend, with values of ['1805', '1714', '1706', '1503', '1521']. There was a significant drop from 1805 (Week 4, 2021) to 1503 (Week 7, 2021), followed by a minor increase to 1521 (Week 8, 2021). This overall decline suggests minimal flu-related activity and a stabilized trend toward the end of the observed period.
2. A weak correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences. Despite the declining trend in past weeks, the reported future ILI occurrence of 1977 indicates a resurgence. This is likely influenced by external factors beyond the short-term decline in past weeks, reflecting the unpredictability highlighted in CDC reports.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently low, at around 1.1% (Weeks 4-7, 2021) and 0.9% (Week 8, 2021), far below the national baseline of 2.6%. This stable trend in low outpatient activity aligns with the minimal flu cases reported but contrasts with the observed rise in future occurrences.
4. Influenza positivity rates hovered at an unusually low 0.1% across clinical labs (Weeks 4-8, 2021), and hospitalization rates were at historic lows, e.g., 0.6 per 100,000 by Week 7, 2021. These indicators reaffirm minimal flu activity, yet continued disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior and COVID-19's impact could mask actual ILI trends and precipitate the observed future spike.
5. COVID-19-driven disruptions impacted healthcare-seeking patterns, ILI surveillance reliability, and flu vaccination trends as reported by the CDC in all relevant weeks. This impact likely suppressed traditional flu activity data while creating conditions for abrupt reporting rebounds, contributing to the 1977 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
6. Nationwide surveillance documented persistent minimal ILI activity across jurisdictions, with slight increases in children aged 0–4 years over six weeks (Weeks 3-8, 2021) even as older groups exhibited declines. This demographic-specific pattern may partially explain a later increase in overall ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 1977 future ILI occurrences (Week 13, 2021) can be attributed to weak correlations between past and future trends, persistently minimal activity in ILI-related indicators, pandemic-related surveillance disruptions, emergent demographic-specific activity shifts, and latent impacts of underreported cases driven by healthcare changes during COVID-19.
