1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week15 to Week19, 2022, show an increasing trend: 2104 (Week15), 2309 (Week16), 2654 (Week17), 2895 (Week18), and 3134 (Week19). The consistent upward trajectory reflects a notable rise in ILI activity over these five weeks, suggesting growing transmission and community spread.
2. Week24, 2022, belongs to the off-season. The typical peak season for ILI in the U.S. stretches from late fall to early winter (Week46 to Week06), and Week24 falls outside this window. Additionally, despite elevated activity in recent weeks, overall influenza positivity and ILI measures remain below peak-season thresholds, aligning with off-season classification for Week24.
3. The consistent rise across the past five weeks suggests ongoing but decelerating ILI growth. A time-series forecasting model would extrapolate this trend, anticipating a slight decline or stabilization after Week19. This aligns with the predicted value (2906), as the growth diminishes moving into Week24, indicative of post-peak seasonal waning.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) dominated in clinical and public health reports, accounting for over 98% of positive cases each week (Week15 to Week19). This strain showed antigenic differences from vaccine viruses in Week15 and Week18, potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness and sustaining higher ILI activity into the off-season.
5. Vaccination trends remained stable but lacked widespread uptake increases from Week15 to Week19. Antigenic differences in H3N2 identified in Weeks15 and Week18 may have further reduced vaccine impact, contributing to sustained transmission levels.
6. Co-circulation with SARS-CoV-2 persisted throughout the analysis period, as reflected in Weeks15 to Week19 reports where approximately 4.5%-5.0% of influenza-positive specimens were co-infected. This added complexity in respiratory illness trends and moderate viral overlap likely sustained ILI reports.
7. The forecasted ILI occurrence of 2906 for Week24, 2022, reflects a combination of the decelerating upward trend in ILI cases, off-season timing, H3N2 vaccine mismatch, co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, and insufficient vaccination uptake. The continued influence of these factors into the off-season contributes to the anticipated slowdown in activity while maintaining moderate ILI levels.
