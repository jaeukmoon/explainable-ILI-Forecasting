1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a slightly fluctuating but overall upward trend, with values of ['1474', '1495', '1376', '1469', '1659']. While there was a minor drop from 1495 in Week 24, 2021, to 1376 in Week 25, 2021, subsequent weeks showed a consistent rise, culminating in 1659 by Week 28, 2021. This increase in ILI activity during the later weeks indicates a potential precursor to the higher future ILI occurrences.
2. A positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the increasing trend observed in Weeks 27–28, 2021, aligns with the future rise to 2751 after 5 weeks (Week 33, 2021). The consistent increase during the latter weeks suggests building respiratory illness activity likely carried over into the subsequent period.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a gradual rise from 1.2% during Weeks 24–26, 2021, to 1.3% during Weeks 27–28, 2021. This increase, especially noted among younger age groups during Week 28, signals heightened respiratory illness activity, contributing to the observed spike in future ILI occurrences.
4. Elevated PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) mortality percentages surpassed the epidemic thresholds consistently during Weeks 24–28, 2021, with values ranging from 6.2% to 7.1%. This persistent high PIC activity, mostly driven by COVID-19, underlines increasing respiratory illness trends that correlate with the surge in ILI numbers.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior disruptions due to COVID-19 and alternative care settings, as documented across Week 24–28 CDC reports, undermined traditional surveillance accuracy. These disruptions likely masked real-time ILI activity and concentrated case reporting in later weeks, leading to a sharp rise in future ILI occurrences.
6. Despite minimal influenza virus circulation and positivity rates remaining below 0.1%, trends in concurrent respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19, coupled with pandemic-driven behavioral changes, likely amplified ILI reporting and accounted for the rise to 2751 occurrences.
7. In summary, the escalation to 2751 future occurrences (Week 33, 2021) is primarily driven by the consistent upward trend in Weeks 27–28, 2021, increased ILI outpatient visits, elevated and sustained PIC-associated mortality, and pandemic-related healthcare-seeking and reporting challenges, despite negligible direct influenza activity.
