1. The past time-series ILI occurrences showed a consistent decline over the 5-week period, with values of ['1492', '1367', '1119', '924', '879']. This decline indicates a decreasing trend in ILI activity, moving from 1492 in Week21, 2024, to 879 in Week25, 2024. The steady reduction reflects a decrease in acute respiratory activity during this time frame.
2. There is a notable negative correlation between past ILI trends and future occurrences, as the continuous decline over the past 5 weeks does not correspond to the relatively high future occurrence value of 778 after Week30, 2024. This discrepancy suggests other external or latent factors contributed to the stabilization of ILI activity in the future rather than a direct continuity of the decreasing trend.
3. Other factors from the summarized CDC reports contributing to the 778 occurrences include:
4. - Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (including influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV) consistently reported between Week21–Week25, 2024, which may lead to underestimation of ILI contributions from influenza alone and more diversified etiologies for respiratory illnesses (e.g., Week22, Point 10, and Week24, Point 10).
5. - Stable antiviral resistance trends, with minimal reduced susceptibility identified across influenza samples (Week21, Point 11; Week24, Point 7), ensuring the relative effectiveness of treatments, potentially influencing the manageable uptick observed.
6. - Regional variability in ILI activity (Week22, Point 14; Week25, Point 10), suggesting local rebounds in respiratory illnesses, which are not evident in the national declining trend but may contribute to stabilizing ILI reports.
4. The relatively higher future ILI occurrence of 778 after a sustained past decline reflects the influence of external contributors such as co-circulating viruses, minimal antiviral resistance ensuring stable treatment outcomes, and regional variability influencing localized trends, despite the nationally observed downturn. This underscores the multifactorial and region-specific nature of ILI trends beyond just linear extrapolation of past data trends.
