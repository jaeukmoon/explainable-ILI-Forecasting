1. The reported ILI counts from Week8 to Week12, 2024 are 11000, 11183, 9994, 8296, and 7671. This data reveals a consistent decline in occurrences over the five-week period, with a steady downward trend following a peak at Week9 (11183). The decrease becomes more pronounced from Week10 to Week12, indicating a tapering trend in ILI activity.
2. Forecasting Week17, 2024, places it in the off-season. Historically, the off-season in the U.S. spans from shortly after the peak season (Week9, 2024 this year) until the next peak onset season (approximately Week32, 2024). The declining ILI trends and low overall positivity rates for Week12, 2024 align with off-season characteristics, indicating reduced overall influenza activity.
3. From the time-series perspective, the consistent decline in ILI counts from Week8 to Week12, 2024 suggests that the trend will continue over the following weeks, albeit potentially at a slower rate. By projecting this pattern forward to Week17, 2024, it is reasonable to expect the ILI occurrences to stabilize at a lower value, settling around 4753 based on the current trajectory.
4. Nationwide influenza activity shows marked decreases in positivity from 14.2% in Week8, 2024, to 10.5% by Week12, 2024, reflecting a declining trajectory in flu transmission and aligning with the taper in ILI occurrences over this timeframe (Week8, 2024 #1; Week11, 2024 #1; Week12, 2024 #1). This declining positivity rate correlates with the anticipated drop in ILI counts by Week17, 2024.
5. Vaccination effectiveness and recommendations remain consistent, with vaccines continuing to match circulating strains this season (Week8, 2024 #8; Week9, 2024 #8; Week10, 2024 #10; Week11, 2024 #8; Week12, 2024 #9). However, no new increases in vaccination uptake are noted, and the protective barrier is considered steady but not expanding, contributing to gradually reduced ILI counts.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including RSV and COVID-19, are highlighted across reports, complicating interpretation of ILI trends and potentially slowing the decrease in ILI (Week8, 2024 #10; Week10, 2024 #11; Week12, 2024 #8). However, no significant surges in these other viruses are reported, diminishing their impact on forecasts for Week17, 2024.
7. Summing up, the steady decline in ILI activity, classification as off-season, the drop in positivity rates, stable but not heightened vaccination trends, and co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens all point toward lower ILI occurrences by Week17, 2024. These factors justify the prediction of 4753 occurrences during that timeframe.
