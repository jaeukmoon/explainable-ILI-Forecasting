1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent decline, with values of ['16091', '15163', '14138', '13960', '13498']. This clear downward trend, from Week13 (2024) to Week17 (2024), reflects a continuous reduction in ILI activity, with the largest week-to-week drop observed between Weeks14 (15163) and 15 (14138), indicating a significant decrease in respiratory illness activity.
2. A negative correlation is evident between the past and future ILI occurrences. The notable decline in Week17 (13498) is consistent with the decreased future ILI activity, which drops further to 11077 by Week22 (2024). The sustained downward trend across the past weeks directly precedes the continued decline suggested in future ILI occurrences.
3. Test positivity rates for influenza consistently diminished, from 7.7% (Week14, 2024) to 3.1% (Week18, 2024). This decrease highlights waning influenza transmission, correlating with the drop in ILI occurrences.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently fell below the national baseline, declining from 2.8% (Week14, 2024) to 2.1% (Week18, 2024). This points to lower healthcare-seeking for ILI and aligns with the observed reduction in future ILI occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, further declined, with no significant novel virus detections. This decline in co-circulating respiratory pathogens likely contributed to the lower future ILI numbers.
6. Cumulative hospitalization rates remained high but showed a plateau, from 77.5 per 100,000 (Week15, 2024) to 80.3 per 100,000 (Week18, 2024), with decreasing weekly influenza-associated deaths, from 0.4% (Week14, 2024) to 0.2% (Week17 and Week18, 2024). These indicators reflect reduced severity and transmission, correlating with future declines.
7. In summary, the reported future occurrences of 11077 (Week22, 2024) are explained by the consistent downward trend in past ILI occurrences, significant reductions in influenza positivity and outpatient visits, reduced impact of co-circulating pathogens, and stabilized hospitalization and mortality rates, reflecting an overall waning of influenza and respiratory illness activity.
