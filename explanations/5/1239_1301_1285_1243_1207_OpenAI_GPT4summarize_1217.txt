1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks revealed a declining trend, with values of ['1239', '1301', '1285', '1243', '1207']. Week29, 2022, began with 1239, which increased to 1301 in Week30, 2022, before gradually decreasing to 1207 by Week33, 2022. This downward trend indicates a reduction in ILI activity during this period.
2. Despite the declining trend in past ILI occurrences, the future surge to 2171 indicates a weak negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences. The sharp increase beyond Week38, 2022, may reflect factors beyond immediate trends, such as delayed onset of respiratory illnesses and co-circulation effects captured in past weeks' reports.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently ranged from 1.6% in Week29, 2022, to 1.4% in Week32, 2022, before stabilizing at 1.5% in Week33, 2022. This persistent baseline of healthcare-seeking behavior for ILI suggests ongoing respiratory activity, setting the stage for a subsequent rise in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained consistently above the epidemic threshold, ranging from 9.8% (Week29, 2022) to 10.0% (Week33, 2022). Though primarily driven by COVID-19, this elevated mortality reflects the sustained burden of respiratory illnesses, potentially contributing to future ILI increases.
5. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including influenza, COVID-19, and RSV, alongside shifting healthcare-seeking behaviors, was documented throughout the reports. These dynamics amplify ILI reporting and lead to sharp spikes in occurrences, as highlighted in the Week38, 2022, data.
6. Despite low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.7% in Week29, 2022, and 0.5% in Week33, 2022), other respiratory viruses and disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors likely escalated ILI activity. Novel cases of Influenza A(H3N2)v and Influenza A(H1N2)v further underscore the unpredictability of virus circulation trends influencing future ILI surges.
7. In summary, the reported 2171 future ILI occurrences (Week38, 2022) can be attributed to persistent baseline respiratory activity despite a declining trend in past occurrences, stable ILI outpatient visits, elevated PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, diversified respiratory virus co-circulation, and changing healthcare behaviors that fueled a sharp rise beyond Week33, 2022.
