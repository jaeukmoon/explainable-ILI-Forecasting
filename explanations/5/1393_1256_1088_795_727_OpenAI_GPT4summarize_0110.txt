1. The reported ILI counts from Week15, 2024 to Week19, 2024 show a clear decreasing trend: 1393 (Week15), 1256 (Week16), 1088 (Week17), 795 (Week18), and 727 (Week19). This consistent decline is indicative of waning influenza activity, without any major fluctuations or spikes.
2. In the U.S., the off-season typically spans from Week9 to Week31. Given that Week24, 2024 falls within this range and that national influenza positivity and outpatient visits consistently remain below the baseline (Week15 #3; Week16 #3; Week17 #5; Week18 #3; Week19 #4), Week24, 2024 is forecasted to be in the off-season.
3. The time-series data show a steadily declining trend in ILI activity over the past weeks, with no evidence of a reversal or sudden increases. Extrapolating this trend using time-series forecasting methods suggests that ILI activity will reach a significantly reduced level by Week24, 2024, leading to the prediction of 430 occurrences.
4. Influenza positivity rates have been consistently declining across Week15-Week19, 2024 (Week15 #1: 5.9%; Week16 #1: 4.8%; Week17 #1: 3.9%; Week18 #1: 3.1%; Week19 #1: 2.4%), with no indication of a resurgence. This aligns with reduced ILI occurrences forecasted for Week24, 2024.
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV remains present but has not significantly elevated respiratory illness activity (Week15 #8; Week17 #7; Week18 #10; Week19 #9). This stable trend supports the prediction of low ILI occurrences.
6. Vaccination efforts continue to mitigate seasonal influenza spread, with circulating strains generally well-matched to the vaccine (Week15 #9; Week17 #6; Week18 #8). This reduces the likelihood of sudden spikes in ILI activity despite co-circulating viruses.
7. Based on the consistent decline in ILI occurrences, off-season timing, declining influenza positivity, co-circulating virus stability, and the protective effect of vaccination, the prediction of reduced ILI activity at 430 occurrences by Week24, 2024 is justified.
