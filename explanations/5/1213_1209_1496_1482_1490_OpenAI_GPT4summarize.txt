1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a mixed trend, with values of ['1213', '1209', '1496', '1482', '1490']. There was a significant rise from 1209 (Week 13, 2021) to 1496 (Week 14, 2021), followed by a slight decrease to 1482 (Week 15, 2021) and a subsequent minimal increase to 1490 (Week 16, 2021). This pattern suggests an overall slightly upward movement in ILI occurrences by the end of the 5-week period.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the elevated values observed during Weeks 14–16, 2021, align with the reported increase to 1383 future occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 21, 2021). The higher baseline in the final weeks of the past time series serves as an indicator of sustained ILI activity leading into the future period.

3. The summarized CDC reports highlighted several contributory factors linked with the future ILI occurrences:
   - Outpatient visits for ILI showed stability at 1.1% during Weeks 14–16, 2021, though still below the 2.6% national baseline. This steady reporting of ILI-related healthcare encounters indicates a consistent level of respiratory illness activity during this period, potentially supporting continuity into Week 21, 2021.
   - Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, accounting for 11.2%, 12.4%, and 11.8% of deaths in Weeks 14, 15, and 16, 2021, respectively. These persistent elevated PIC mortality rates reflect continued respiratory illness activity contributing to future ILI occurrences.
   - The impact of altered healthcare behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional surveillance and reporting systems. This likely influenced delayed recognition or underreporting of ILI cases during the observed weeks, which could contribute to higher reported cases in the future due to eventual normalization or adjustments in data interpretation.

4. In summary, the reported 1383 future ILI occurrences (Week 21, 2021) can be attributed to the mild upward trend in ILI occurrences observed in Weeks 14–16, 2021, stable outpatient ILI visit rates, persistently elevated PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the ongoing complexities introduced by pandemic-altered healthcare-seeking behavior and surveillance adjustments during the observed period.
