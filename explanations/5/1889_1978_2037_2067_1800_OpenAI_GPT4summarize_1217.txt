1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating pattern with an early increase from 1889 (Week 38, 2021) to 2067 (Week 41, 2021), followed by a decline to 1800 (Week 42, 2021). Although there was an initial rise, the decrease in Week 42 suggests a brief drop in respiratory illness activity by the end of the observed period without a clear sustained upward or downward trend.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is noticeable, as the initial rise in Week 38–41, 2021, aligns with the jump to 2589 future occurrences in Week 47, 2021. The fluctuation and eventual decline in Week 42 do not preclude the larger resurgence in future weeks, likely influenced by delayed or compounding factors.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline but showed a stable to slightly declining trend during Week 38–42, 2021 (1.9% to 1.8%). Despite this, future data likely reflect an increase tied to other respiratory pathogens contributing to ILI rather than influenza.
4. PIC mortality rates, driven mostly by COVID-19, remained significantly above epidemic thresholds (20.9% in Week 38 to 16.5% in Week 42, 2021), reflecting ongoing acute respiratory illness trends that likely impacted ILI occurrences.
5. Shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic continued to complicate accurate ILI reporting throughout Week 38–42, 2021, suggesting an underestimation during this period but a subsequent reflection in higher future occurrences.
6. Despite low reported influenza positivity in clinical and public health labs (ranging from 0.1% in Week 40–42, 2021), increases in non-influenza respiratory pathogens and their contribution to ILI were noted, further explaining the disproportionally higher future values.
7. In summary, the reported 2589 future ILI occurrences (Week 47, 2021) can be attributed to the fluctuating past trend, the delayed impact of respiratory illness activity reflected in outpatient and PIC data, compounded shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors, and the influence of non-influenza pathogens.
