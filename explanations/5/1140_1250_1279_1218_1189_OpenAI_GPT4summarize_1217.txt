1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed minor fluctuations but trended downward overall, with values ['1140', '1250', '1279', '1218', '1189']. While there was an initial increase from 1140 (Week39, 2021) to 1279 (Week41, 2021), subsequent weeks exhibited a consistent decline, reaching 1189 in Week43, 2021. This pattern reflects stabilizing or reducing ILI activity toward the end of the 5-week period.
2. The future increase to 1408 occurrences (Week48, 2021) contrasts with the gradually declining trend observed in the past 5 weeks. However, fluctuations in the initial weeks of the observed period (e.g., the peak at 1279 in Week41, 2021) suggest potential instability. This, coupled with the rise in influenza positivity rates in Week43, 2021, foreshadows a subsequent increase in ILI activity after Week43, 2021, consistent with the future spike.
3. Virologic data show an increasing influenza positivity rate from 0.1% (Weeks39–42, 2021) to 0.2% by Week43, 2021, along with rising public health lab reports of positive specimens (e.g., 8 specimens in Week42, 2021, to 35 specimens in Week43, 2021, with most being Influenza A). This indicates heightened viral circulation by the end of the period that may underpin the jump to 1408 future occurrences.
4. Respiratory illness trends, including ILI-related outpatient visits, stabilized, staying at 1.9% in Week43, 2021. However, increasing reports of respiratory illness and steady detection of non-flu respiratory pathogens might have been precursors to broader illness activity contributing to the future ILI increase.
5. Shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, as highlighted across all five summarized reports, continue to impact data accuracy and surveillance sensitivity. These disruptions may have masked earlier indications of rising activity, amplifying delayed case detection visible in the Week48, 2021, surge.
6. In summary, the reported 1408 future ILI occurrences (Week48, 2021) are explained by rising influenza circulation, as reflected in increasing lab detections and positivity rates in Week43, 2021, coupled with stabilized respiratory illness trends, shifts in data interpretation due to COVID-19, and the delayed detection of broader illness activity.
