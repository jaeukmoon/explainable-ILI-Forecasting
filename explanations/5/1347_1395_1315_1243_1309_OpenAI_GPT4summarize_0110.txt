1. The reported ILI counts from Week34 to Week38, 2021 are 1347, 1395, 1315, 1243, and 1309. The trend primarily reflects a mild fluctuation with an initial rise from Week34 (1347) to Week35 (1395), followed by a general decline through Week38 (1309). Thus, the short-term trend displays a slight decrease during the observed weeks, remaining relatively stable without extreme spikes or dips.
2. Based on U.S. seasonality, Week43, 2021 falls within the peak onset season, as it precedes the typical peak season spanning Week46 to Week6 of the following year. The ongoing minimal influenza activity and slight fluctuations in ILI counts are consistent with the onset phase, where seasonal ILI activity may begin to rise gradually without reaching peak levels.
3. From the time-series analysis, the fluctuating but declining trend over the five weeks suggests a continued mild reduction in ILI occurrences at this stage. However, as Week43, 2021 corresponds to the peak onset season, the introduction of other influencing factors (e.g., co-circulation of respiratory viruses) might slow the rate of decline or stabilize the trend, projecting ILI occurrences to settle at 1189, which aligns with observed seasonal dynamics.
4. Influenza virus circulation remains low, with positivity rates at or below 0.1% across clinical and public health labs in all five weeks (Week34, 2021 #1; Week35, 2021 #1; Week36, 2021 #3; Week37, 2021 #6; Week38, 2021 #2). This indicates a reduced presence of influenza as a driver of ILI activity, keeping overall counts low.
5. The persistent influence of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses contributes significantly to ILI trends (Week34, 2021 #4, #6, #10; Week37, 2021 #5; Week38, 2021 #8). As non-influenza respiratory illnesses dominate, ILI fluctuations are more attributable to these competing pathogens than seasonal influenza, dampening the likelihood of a sharp increase.
6. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic persistently impact ILI surveillance accuracy and interpretation, creating variability in reported data (Week34, 2021 #8; Week36, 2021 #9; Week37, 2021 #9; Week38, 2021 #7). This factor contributes to challenges in detecting significant trend shifts, leading to a conservative projection of ILI activity.
7. Given the observed decline in ILI counts, the minimal influenza circulation, dominant influence of non-influenza respiratory viruses, and ongoing pandemic-driven disruptions in ILI reporting, the forecasted 1189 occurrences for Week43, 2021 reflect stability within the low range typical of the peak onset season.
