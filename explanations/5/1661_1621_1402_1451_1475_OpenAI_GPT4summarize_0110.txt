1. The reported ILI counts from Week50, 2020 to Week1, 2021 are 1661, 1621, 1402, 1451, and 1475. The trend shows an initial decrease from Week50, 2020 (1661) to Week52, 2020 (1402), followed by a slight increase in Week1, 2021 (1475). This pattern indicates an overall decline with a minor upward fluctuation at the end of the period.
2. Forecasting the target Week6, 2021 suggests that it belongs to the peak season. In the U.S., the peak season typically extends from approximately Week46 of one year to Week6 of the following year. Week6, 2021 aligns with this classification as flu activity could rise slightly despite remaining below historical levels.
3. From a time-series perspective, the preliminary decline in ILI occurrences suggests reduced transmission, while the slight rebound in Week1, 2021 indicates minor fluctuations. Given suppressed influenza activity due to external factors (e.g., COVID-19), the projection of 684 occurrences in Week6, 2021 reflects a continuation of declining trends with lower-than-typical ILI levels.
4. Influenza activity across the U.S. remains unusually low, as less than 0.4% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza in early 2021 (Week50, 2020 #1, Week52, 2020 #1, Week1, 2021 #1). Despite consistent surveillance and stable outpatient ILI visits (Week51, 2020 #4, Week1, 2021 #4), the overall positivity rate has not risen significantly.
5. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt healthcare-seeking behaviors, influenza transmission patterns, and surveillance reliability (Week50, 2020 #10, Week52, 2020 #9, Week1, 2021 #9). This significantly lowers ILI-related reporting and reduces traditional flu activity projections, contributing to the suppressed ILI counts.
6. Changes in dominant circulating strains, with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 now predominant (Week53, 2020 #3, Week1, 2021 #3), suggest some potential for activity increases. However, minimal strain diversity and the absence of widespread outbreaks indicate reduced transmissibility during this period.
7. In summary, the ILI count of 684 in Week6, 2021 is driven by low influenza activity sustained by COVID-19 impacts, altered healthcare-seeking behaviors, and stable outpatient reporting. While Week6 typically falls within the peak season, suppressed activity due to external factors explains the lower-than-usual projections.
