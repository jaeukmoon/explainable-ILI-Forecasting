1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week21, 2023 (12011) to Week25, 2023 (8606) demonstrate a steady decline in activity over the five weeks, with values decreasing sequentially: Week21 (12011), Week22 (12674), Week23 (10638), Week24 (9416), and Week25 (8606). This consistent drop aligns with the seasonal decline in influenza activity, reflecting a tapering period during the off-season.
2. Forecasting Week30, 2023 is consistent with the off-season classification, as it falls between Week1, 2023 and Week31, 2023. Influenza activity during this timeframe typically remains low with reduced transmission indicators, as per historical trends and summarized CDC data.
3. From the time-series analysis, the consistent week-over-week decline in ILI cases indicates a stable trend during the off-season. The reduction from 12011 in Week21 to 8606 in Week25 suggests further moderate decline for subsequent weeks, with Week30 projecting near 8705 due to baseline fluctuations often occurring during the off-season. This projection aligns with prior off-season patterns and overall diminishing ILI activity.
4. Influenza activity remains minimal with low positivity rates, declining from 1.2% in Week21 to 1.0% in Week25 for tested specimens (Week21 #1; Week22 #1; Week23 #1; Week24 #1; Week25 #1). This declining positivity suggests a continuing reduction in community circulation, influencing future ILI occurrences.
5. Outpatient visits for ILI have steadily decreased, from 1.9% in Week21 to 1.4% in Week25, remaining well below the national baseline (Week21 #4; Week22 #4; Week23 #4; Week24 #5; Week25 #3). This decline further supports low future influenza activity during Week30, 2023.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and others continues to marginally contribute to respiratory illness trends but has not caused an uptick in ILI activity. These co-circulating viruses are complicating precise forecasting without significantly impacting influenza-specific indicators (Week21 #8; Week22 #9; Week23 #10; Week24 #9; Week25 #10).
7. Given the declining ILI trends, off-season timing for Week30, 2023, low positivity and outpatient visit rates, and stable co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, the projected ILI occurrences of 8705 reflect a continuation of reduced influenza activity and seasonal lows, consistent with historical patterns during off-season periods.
