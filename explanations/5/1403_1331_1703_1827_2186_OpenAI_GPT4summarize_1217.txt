1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1403', '1331', '1703', '1827', '2186']. Starting with a slight decrease from 1403 in Week 46, 2023, to 1331 in Week 47, 2023, the trend swiftly reversed, displaying steady increases over the subsequent weeks and reaching a peak of 2186 in Week 50, 2023. This pattern highlights increasing ILI activity over this 5-week period.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 1470 (Week 5, 2024) correlates with the observed peak in the past data (Week 50, 2023). After steadily rising for four weeks, the sharp increase to 2186 in Week 50 suggests a delayed peak of flu activity, followed by an expected tapering of cases indicated by the lower future value of 1470, reflecting seasonal progression and mitigation efforts.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI rose significantly from 3.7% in Week 46, 2023, to 5.1% in Week 50, 2023, consistently exceeding the national baseline of 2.9%. This steady increase signals elevated community transmission and healthcare encounters, directly contributing to future ILI occurrences.
4. Positivity rates for influenza specimens surged from 4.9% in Week 46, 2023, to 12.8% in Week 50, 2023. The sustained rise in virus positivity rates aligns with intensified viral activity and heightened respiratory illness, projecting potential continued transmission into Week 5, 2024.
5. Cumulative influenza hospitalizations, reflecting severe cases, increased during this period, growing from a rate of 2.6 per 100,000 (Week 46, 2023) to 11.3 per 100,000 (Week 50, 2023). The sharp rise in hospital burden and regional variances in activity underscore the need for adjustments in projections as healthcare systems handle peak influenza cases.
6. In summary, the reported decline to 1470 future ILI occurrences (Week 5, 2024) follows the peak ILI activity observed in Week 50, 2023. This result is attributed to escalating outpatient visits, positivity rates, and cumulative hospitalizations during the observed period, with future levels reflecting the seasonal decline expected after the peak.
