1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week17 to Week21, 2024, are 13960, 13498, 12644, 12615, and 12081, showing a consistent decline week by week. This downward trend indicates reduced influenza transmission, aligning with weakening flu activity. The absence of significant spikes or variations suggests stabilization at progressively lower levels.
2. Forecasting for Week26, 2024, categorizes it as belonging to the off-season. Given that Week26 falls far outside the typical peak or peak onset season and aligns with historically low activity during this time (referencing Week17 to Week21, 2024, with low positivity rates and below-baseline outpatient visits), it is consistent with the off-season period.
3. The time-series trend of steady declines in ILI occurrences from Week17 to Week21, 2024, correlates with projections of a continued decrease over the coming weeks. The rate of decline suggests a softer landing at baseline or near-baseline levels by five weeks forward, resulting in the estimated ILI occurrence of 10087 for Week26, 2024.
4. Influenza activity is declining nationwide, evidenced by a reduction in weekly respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, from 3.9% in Week17 to 1.7% in Week21, 2024. This indicates low levels of active transmission projected to persist (Week17, 2024 #1; Week21, 2024 #1).
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2, remain significant contributors but do not show signs of driving an influenza surge (Week17, 2024 #7; Week21, 2024 #12).
6. Vaccination rates have not demonstrated significant increases or changes, though current circulating viruses match the vaccine composition (Week21, 2024 #9; Week21, 2024 #10).
7. Considering the observed declining trend in ILI reports (Week17–Week21, 2024), the off-season classification expected for Week26, 2024, and the influence of low influenza activity, vaccine effectiveness, and co-circulating viruses without significant upticks, the projected ILI occurrence of 10087 is reasonable and reflects the stabilizing pattern and reduced disease spread.
