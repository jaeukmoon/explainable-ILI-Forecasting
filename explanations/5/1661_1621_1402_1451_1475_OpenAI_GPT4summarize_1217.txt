1. The past time-series ILI occurrences during the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating yet stabilized trend, with values of ['1661', '1621', '1402', '1451', '1475']. After an initial decline from 1661 (Week 50, 2020) to 1402 (Week 52, 2020), there was a slight rebound to 1475 by Week 1, 2021. This stabilization suggests suppressed overall ILI activity with minor variations throughout this period.
2. A negative correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences, as the declining and stabilized trend during Weeks 50, 2020–Week 1, 2021, contrasts sharply with the drop to 684 future ILI occurrences, indicating suppressed respiratory illnesses influencing the decrease in future activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained stable at approximately 1.6%-1.7% during Weeks 50, 2020–Week 1, 2021, well below the national baseline of 2.6%. This stable and significantly low trend reflects reduced healthcare encounters and aligns with the sharp decline in ILI occurrences reported after 5 weeks.
4. Laboratory-confirmed influenza positivity rates were exceptionally low, from 0.3% (Week 50, 2020) to 0.1% (Week 53, 2020), indicating limited circulation of influenza viruses. The sustained minimal lab positivity throughout this period supports the decline in future ILI cases, as a lack of influenza spread reduces the overall ILI burden.
5. Pandemic-driven healthcare-seeking changes and overlapping COVID-19 surveillance challenges disrupted traditional ILI reporting and care trends. These disruptions likely suppressed overall ILI activity, contributing to the considerably lower figure of 684 future ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 684 future ILI occurrences (Week 6, 2021) can primarily be attributed to the stable and low trend in past ILI occurrences, minimal outpatient visit activity, extremely low laboratory-confirmed influenza positivity, and the continued influence of COVID-19 conditions on healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance systems. This combination of factors resulted in a significant suppression of ILI activity in future weeks.
