1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week18, 2022 to Week22, 2022 are 15796, 18790, 21269, 23786, and 23985. ILI counts consistently increased week over week during this period, reflecting a clear upward trend. The peak rise occurred between Week18 and Week22, with a substantial increase of 8199 cases, suggesting that ILI activity was gaining momentum.
2. Forecasting target Week27, 2022 most likely belongs to the off-season. The typical off-season spans from Week1 to Week31, and while ILI activity displays signs of regional variability and late-season influenza dynamics, Week27 falls before the expected peak onset and remains aligned with the off-season classification.
3. Correlation analysis shows that the upward trend in the past five weeks exhibits a consistent escalation in reported cases. This sustained increase suggests a lagging residual effect of the late-season activity seen in 2022. Based on this projected trajectory, with some likely deceleration in growth within five weeks, the forecast of 14344 ILI occurrences reflects a slight tapering off from the sharper weekly increases observed earlier.
4. Influenza positivity among specimens has declined slightly (Week18: 8.6%, Week22: 5.9%). Despite this, localized high activity in specific regions (Week22 #2, #3) continues to elevate ILI counts in certain jurisdictions beyond the national baseline. Regional variability remains a significant driver.
5. The circulating Influenza A(H3N2) strain shows antigenic differences from cell-based vaccines, potentially impacting population immunity and extending late-season ILI contributions (Week19 #9, Week20 #7, Week22 #8). This factor, while declining, sustains a minimal but notable increase in activity.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and others, contributes to lingering outpatient visits and hospitalizations (Week21 #11, Week22 #9). These mixed viral dynamics reinforce the persistence of ILI occurrences during this off-season period.
7. The combination of a clear yet decelerating ILI trend (Week18 to Week22), off-season timing with regional surges (Week22 #2), vaccine mismatch (Week20 #7, Week22 #8), and co-circulation of respiratory viruses (Week21 #11) supports the forecast of 14344 ILI occurrences for Week27, 2022. These factors collectively justify the expected value, reflecting a decline from accelerated activity but remaining above minimal thresholds for off-season estimates.
