1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, increasing from 11429 (Week 4, 2024) to 18059 (Week 8, 2024). This progression illustrates a steady escalation in ILI activity, with a notable increase between Week 5 (13019) and Week 6 (16110) and further growth to Week 8. This trend signifies a heightened trajectory in flu-related illnesses during this period.
2. Positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed as the sustained upward trend through Week 8, 2024 (18059 occurrences), aligns with the high future value of 11544 (by Week 13, 2024). Although there is a decline in future values compared to Week 8, the elevated levels of ILI activity in past weeks contribute to the subsequent residual illness burden seen in the future data.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained well above the 2.9% baseline, rising from 4.3% (Week 4, 2024) to 4.5% (Week 7, 2024) and settling at 4.4% (Week 8, 2024). This persistent elevation reflects consistent healthcare encounters for respiratory illnesses, directly correlating with sustained ILI cases after 5 weeks.
4. Cumulative hospitalization rates steadily increased from 47.8 per 100,000 (Week 4, 2024) to 61.5 per 100,000 (Week 8, 2024), with adults aged 65+ disproportionately affected. High hospitalization rates signal severe illness cases that often lead to continued outpatient visits and overall illnesses detected in future ILI reporting.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, were consistently highlighted, with substantial co-infection and complications evident in Weeks 4–8, 2024. These interactions likely contributed to sustained ILI activity, complicating the downward trajectory despite Influenza A positivity rates decreasing by Week 8.
6. In summary, the reported 11544 future ILI occurrences (Week 13, 2024) are attributed to the escalating trend in past ILI occurrences through Week 8, 2024, the consistently above-baseline ILI outpatient visits, increasing hospitalization rates noted in past weeks, and the amplifying effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses impacting overall respiratory illness trends.
