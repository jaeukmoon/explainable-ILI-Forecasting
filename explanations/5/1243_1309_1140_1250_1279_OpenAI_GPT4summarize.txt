1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed fluctuating but moderately elevated activity, with values of ['1243', '1309', '1140', '1250', '1279']. An initial increase from 1243 (Week 37, 2021) to 1309 (Week 38, 2021) was followed by a decline to 1140 (Week 39, 2021). However, Weeks 40 and 41, 2021, showed subsequent increases to 1250 and 1279, indicating a general stabilization at slightly higher levels by the end of the observed period.

2. A slight positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the stabilization of ILI levels in Weeks 40–41, 2021, aligns with the reported 1223 occurrences in Week 46, 2021. The fluctuations in ILI data during the 5-week period suggest a leveling-off trend, consistent with moderate levels of ILI activity persisting into the future.

3. Across the summarized CDC reports, several factors have high correlations with the future ILI occurrences:  
   - Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline, but with trends of stabilization or minor declines (e.g., 2.1% in Week 37, 1.9% in Weeks 38–40, 1.8% in Week 41). These trends indicate sustained low but stable respiratory illness activity.  
   - PIC mortality remained considerably elevated above the epidemic threshold (e.g., 21.1% in Week 37, declining to 17.5% in Week 41), primarily driven by COVID-19. These consistently high respiratory-related mortalities align with ongoing illness activity affecting healthcare systems.  
   - Shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacted data collection and interpretation, potentially leading to underreporting or concentration of ILI cases in this period. These disruptions may explain the sustained moderate ILI levels into future weeks.  

4. In summary, the reported 1223 ILI occurrences (Week 46, 2021) can be attributed to the slightly elevated but stabilizing ILI trends in Weeks 40–41, 2021, the steady outpatient visit rates for respiratory illnesses, persistently high PIC-related deaths driven by overlapping respiratory pathogens, and the compounding effects of pandemic-induced disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors impacting surveillance and reporting.
