1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, with occurrences starting at 1504 in Week32, 2024, and steadily increasing to 1849 in Week36, 2024. This unbroken rise indicates escalating respiratory illness activity, culminating in the highest value of 1849 in the observed period.
2. A strong positive correlation is observed between the steady past increase in ILI occurrences across Weeks 32–36, 2024, and the rise to 2645 future occurrences by Week41, 2024. The continuous upward trajectory aligns with a substantial increase in respiratory illness activity after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI exhibited slight increases, climbing from 1.5% in Week32, 2024, to 1.8% in Week36, 2024. This steady growth reflects increasing illness acuity, potentially contributing to the reported rise in ILI occurrences.
4. Persistent co-circulation of influenza with other respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, highlighted across all weeks, likely contributed to heightening respiratory symptomatology and reporting trends. This co-circulation acted as a reinforcing factor for the future ILI increase.
5. Stably low but continual detection of influenza positivity (0.4% across all weeks), predominantly of Influenza A, aligns with minimal, yet consistent, seasonal transmission trends. Despite low levels, this activity, combined with co-circulating pathogens, may have added to future respiratory illness spikes.
6. The consistent involvement of novel influenza variants and zoonotic spillover cases (e.g., A(H5), A(H1N1)v) documented by CDC during Weeks32–36, 2024, serves as an early warning of potential localized outbreaks or heightened illness burdens that could amplify ILI occurrences by Week41, 2024.
7. In summary, the increase to 2645 future ILI occurrences (Week41, 2024) is driven by the sustained upward trend in Weeks 32–36, reported outpatient ILI visit growth, co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, seasonal positivity stabilization, and the sporadic detection of novel influenza variants. These combined factors underpin the observed escalation in respiratory illness activity after 5 weeks.
