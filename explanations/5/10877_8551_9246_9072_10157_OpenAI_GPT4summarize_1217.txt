1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating trend with a general decline. The values were ['10877', '8551', '9246', '9072', '10157'], beginning with a peak of 10877 in Week 1, 2024, followed by a significant drop to 8551 in Week 2, 2024, and then fluctuating between 9246 and 10157 over Weeks 3–5, 2024. Although Week 5 showed a slight rise compared to Week 2, the overall trajectory suggests variability without consistent growth.
2. The drop in future ILI occurrences to 8296 (Week 11, 2024) is consistent with the overall declining and stabilizing pattern observed in the latter weeks of the past data, specifically from Week 3 to Week 5, 2024. The absence of a continued upward trajectory implies stabilization and subsequent reduction in ILI activity after 5 weeks.
3. Despite elevated influenza positivity rates reported across Weeks 2–6, 2024 (e.g., 13.7% in Week 2 and 15.7% in Week 6), outpatient visits for ILI demonstrated a slight downward trend, decreasing from 4.7% in Week 2, 2024, to 4.3% in Week 4, 2024, suggesting diminishing healthcare-seeking behaviors for ILI. This gradual decline precedes the future drop to 8296.
4. The cumulative hospitalization rate increased from 37.3 per 100,000 in Week 2, 2024, to 54.9 per 100,000 in Week 6, 2024, signaling high severity in specific subpopulations. However, declining weekly hospital admissions and decreasing influenza-related mortality (Week 2: 1.2%, Week 6: 0.7%) indicate an overall stabilization of influenza impact, aligning with the reduced occurrence of 8296.
5. Regional variations in influenza activity, particularly increasing trends of Influenza B alongside Influenza A in later weeks, and continued co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2, likely triggered non-specific respiratory complications. The broader respiratory burden may have led to reporting fluctuations, dampening future ILI occurrences to 8296.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 8296 (Week 11, 2024) can be explained by the fluctuating but declining ILI trend in Weeks 3–5, 2024, reduced outpatient visits for ILI, decreasing influenza-related mortality, stabilization of hospitalizations, and contributions from respiratory virus dynamics affecting overall reporting.
