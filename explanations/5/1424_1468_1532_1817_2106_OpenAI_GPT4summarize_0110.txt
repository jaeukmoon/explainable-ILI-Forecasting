1. The reported ILI counts from Week29 to Week33, 2023 are 1424, 1468, 1532, 1817, and 2106. This indicates a clear upward trend in ILI occurrences, with ILI counts increasing steadily every week. Notably, the sharpest rise was from Week31 (1532) to Week32 (1817) and Week32 to Week33 (2106), reflecting accelerating growth in ILI activity. This overall pattern suggests an upward trajectory in ILI trends during this period, indicative of entering a busier ILI phase.
2. Week38, 2023 falls within the peak onset season as per U.S. influenza seasonality since this period spans Week32 to Week46, leading up to the peak season. The rising patterns in ILI occurrences and increasing national indicators further confirm this classification.
3. From the time-series perspective, the recent continuous rise in ILI counts demonstrates a strong upward momentum. Projecting this trend forward, it is consistent to expect ongoing increases in ILI activity around the target week. Based on the historical time-series pattern and the seasonal context, the sharp growth between Week30 and Week33 points towards elevated activity near Week38, aligning with the prediction of 3069 ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza positivity increased slightly by Week33, 2023, with 0.5% of respiratory specimens testing positive, up from 0.8% in Week32, 2023, which reflects rising infection trends and ongoing higher ILI patterns associated with co-circulating pathogens (Week30, #8; Week32, #11; Week33, #10).
5. There is increased co-circulation of respiratory viruses, like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, contributing to respiratory illness visits (Week29, #8; Week32, #11; Week33, #4). These additional drivers could sustain upward trends in ILI percentages in outpatient visits as noted in Week33, 2023 (1.5%).
6. Regional variations in children aged 0-4 years show the highest outpatient visit percentage (6.3%), with significant pediatric vulnerabilities (Week30, #3; Week33, #4) supporting the prediction of rising numbers such as 3069.
7. Elevated PIC deaths (10.0% in Week33) exceeding epidemic thresholds (Week29, #6; Week33, #5) and increased hospitalizations (Week32, #4; Week33, #8) underscore an uptrend in overall respiratory illnesses. This, combined with the peak onset season classification and increasingly high ILI patterns, justifies the predicted occurrence of 3069 cases for Week38, 2023.
