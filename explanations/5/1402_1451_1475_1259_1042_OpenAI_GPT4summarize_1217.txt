1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks indicate a clear downward trend, with values of ['1402', '1451', '1475', '1259', '1042']. The data begins at 1402 (Week48, 2020) and peaks at 1475 (Week50, 2020), followed by a sharp decline to 1259 (Week51, 2020) and further to 1042 (Week52, 2020), the lowest point in the series. This steady decline in the latter weeks suggests decreasing ILI activity during this period.
2. A notable inverse correlation is observed between the past and future ILI occurrences. Despite the declining trend in the past 5 weeks (Weeks48–52, 2020), the ILI activity sharply increases to 641 by Week8, 2021. This divergence highlights a potential decoupling of past-week trends and future activity, likely influenced by external factors.
3. Continued low outpatient ILI visits, consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%, were observed (1.6%–1.3% across Weeks48–52, 2020). Despite this apparent stability or slight reduction, regional upticks in certain areas during Week53, 2020, may be contributing to the future surge.
4. Respiratory specimen positivity for influenza remained unusually low (0.3%–0.1%, Weeks48–52, 2020), coupled with suppressed influenza hospitalizations and reduced ILI rates. However, PIC deaths exceeded epidemic thresholds (13.6%–17.2%, Weeks48–52, 2020), primarily driven by COVID-19, which reflects ongoing respiratory illness burdens that might reemerge as ILI cases.
5. COVID-19 pandemic impacts, such as changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and disruptions to ILI surveillance systems, further obfuscated clear patterns, delaying the apparent ILI activity rebound. These factors likely contributed to the observed spike to 641 cases by Week8, 2021.
6. In summary, the increase to 641 ILI occurrences (Week8, 2021) can be attributed to seasonal variability not evident in the declining past trends, regional activity shifts not captured in nationwide suppression, elevated PIC mortality reflecting ongoing respiratory illness burdens, and pandemic-driven healthcare access disruptions delaying ILI case upticks.
