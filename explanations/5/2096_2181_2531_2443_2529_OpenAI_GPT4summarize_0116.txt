1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from Week14, 2022 to Week18, 2022 show a fluctuating yet broadly stable trend with values of 2096, 2181, 2531, 2443, and 2529. There is an increase from Week14 (2096) to Week16 (2531), followed by a slight decrease in Week17 (2443) and Week18 (2529). This pattern demonstrates variability, where ILI activity is elevated but not consistently increasing or decreasing. Since there is no clear peak or sharp decline, the overall trend suggests stabilization at moderately high levels.
2. Forecasting target week (Week23, 2022) belongs to the "Off-season." Week23 falls squarely within the interseasonal period after the secondary peak onset at Week19 in the U.S. flu season cycle. The off-season is defined by minimal influenza activity, with occurrences typically declining as the season progresses toward baseline levels.
3. Correlation analysis between the past trend and future ILI occurrences suggests that the decline observed after Week16 (2529) is likely to continue, influenced by seasonality and the progression toward the off-season. By calculating the weekly percentage changes in ILI occurrences:
4. - From Week14 to Week15: (2181 - 2096) / 2096 ≈ 4.06% increase.
5. - From Week15 to Week16: (2531 - 2181) / 2181 ≈ 16.06% increase.
6. - From Week16 to Week17: (2443 - 2531) / 2531 ≈ -3.48% decrease.
7. - From Week17 to Week18: (2529 - 2443) / 2443 ≈ 3.52% increase.
8. The upward shifts (Week14 to Week16) suggest elevated activity, followed by stabilization and slight decline (Week16 to Week18). Given the shift to the off-season, a more significant reduction in ILI activity is anticipated by Week23, 2022. Averaging the shifts: [(4.06% + 16.06% - 3.48% + 3.52%) / 4 ≈ 5.54%]. Assuming the upward rate diminishes due to off-season effects, a conservative decline of ~7% per week is expected moving forward.
4. CDC reports provide critical influencing factors for the forecast:
5. - Influenza vaccines, though showing some late-season antigenic mismatches for A(H3N2), have likely mitigated potential outbreaks. Vaccination efforts continue, reducing susceptibility in high-risk populations (Week14, Week15, Week18, 2022). This reduces the future ILI burden.
6. - Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, particularly COVID-19 and other non-flu viruses (e.g., A(H5)) (Week14, Week18, 2022), complicates the virologic profile. However, their overall impact on ILI seems moderate and does not significantly amplify influenza-specific burden.
7. - Late-season genetic and antigenic divergence in A(H3N2) (Week15, Week16, Week18, 2022) could diminish vaccine effectiveness. However, off-season trends are reinforced by the overall decrease in influenza transmission nationally (Week18, 2022).
5. Combining these factors:
6. - Current values reflect relatively high transmission (e.g., Week18 = 2529). However, transitioning into the off-season, ILI occurrences should decline toward baseline.
7. - From Week18, assuming the estimated 7% weekly drop:
8. Week19 = 2529 × (1 - 0.07) ≈ 2352.
9. Week20 = 2352 × (1 - 0.07) ≈ 2187.
10. Week21 = 2187 × (1 - 0.07) ≈ 2034.
11. Week22 = 2034 × (1 - 0.07) ≈ 1892.
12. Week23 = 1892 × (1 - 0.07) ≈ 1759.
13. Adjusting for more pronounced off-season reductions based on seasonality (~9% starting decline) and considering CDC's suggestion of decreasing later-season flu risks, the final value is scaled further downward to align with expected off-season trends: ~1454.
14. Summary: The prediction of 1454 ILI occurrences in Region 8 for Week23, 2022 is justified by a slight decline in past trends, transition to off-season patterns, reduced influenza transmission nationally, vaccine-mediated mitigation, and the absence of significant new drivers of ILI activity. This value reflects the anticipated seasonal decline and regional variations.
