1. The past 5 weeks of time-series ILI occurrences exhibit a clear downward trend, starting from 19975 (Week 32, 2021) and progressively declining through 21495 (Week 33), 20189 (Week 34), 17987 (Week 35), and 16276 (Week 36). This consistent decline suggests reduced respiratory illness activity during the observation period.

2. A negative correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences. The steady decrease in values during Weeks 32–36, 2021, contrasts with the reported future occurrence of 11738 (Week 41, 2021), representing a continued downward trajectory consistent with the prior trend.

3. Respiratory illnesses driven by non-influenza viruses like SARS-CoV-2 remain predominant, with ILI percentages below the national baseline of 2.6% across all weeks (e.g., 2.1% in Week 32, 2.2% in Weeks 33–34, 0.9% in Week 35, and 2.3% in Week 36). COVID-19's dominant role in PIC mortality (e.g., 14.6% in Week 32, 21.0% in Week 36) further illustrates limited influenza activity, reinforcing the extended decline in ILI occurrences.  
4. Minimal influenza circulation is evident, as clinical specimens testing positive for influenza remain negligible throughout the period (e.g., 0.1% positivity rates in Weeks 34–36), limiting influenza's contribution to ILI trends.  
5. Altered healthcare-seeking behaviors influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted ILI-related reporting and surveillance. These disruptions are emphasized in every week’s report, likely contributing to variability in observed and projected ILI occurrences.  

4. In summary, the observed future ILI occurrence of 11738 (Week 41, 2021) aligns with the downward trend in past data (Weeks 32–36, 2021), impacted primarily by suppressed influenza activity, non-influenza respiratory illnesses, disrupted healthcare-seeking behaviors, and significantly higher COVID-19-driven PIC mortality. These factors collectively reinforce the overall decline in ILI occurrences over time.
