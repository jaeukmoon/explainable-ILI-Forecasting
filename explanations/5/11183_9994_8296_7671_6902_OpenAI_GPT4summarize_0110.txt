1. The ILI occurrences from Week9, 2024 to Week13, 2024 are 11183, 9994, 8296, 7671, and 6902. A clear decreasing trend is observed during these weeks, with ILI counts steadily declining week by week, indicative of the waning phase of the influenza season. This consistent decline suggests a continued downturn heading into the forecasted period.
2. Based on the timeline, Week18, 2024 falls within the off-season. In the U.S., the off-season typically spans from the end of the peak season (Week 6) to the next peak onset season (starting around Week32-35) each year. The decreasing influenza activity and the positioning of Week18 fit well within this seasonal classification.
3. The time-series analysis shows a consistent decreasing pattern in ILI counts over the past five weeks. Extrapolating this trajectory forward using a time-series forecasting model results in a projected ILI occurrence of 4713 for Week18, 2024, reflecting a continued declining pattern consistent with off-season trends.
4. CDC reports from Week9, 2024 to Week13, 2024 indicate several relevant factors influencing the forecast:
5. - Influenza activity is elevated but has been steadily declining nationwide, with positivity rates dropping from 13.9% (Week9, 2024) to 9.1% (Week13, 2024), reflecting a continuous decrease in transmission.
6. - Outpatient visits for ILI have consistently declined from 4.1% (Week9, 2024) to 3.0% (Week13, 2024), with values just slightly above baseline and following a downward trend.
7. - Seasonal vaccinations remain well-matched to circulating strains, with no significant rise in antiviral resistance. Vaccination effectiveness contributes to the declining influenza burden.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including RSV and COVID-19, are affecting ILI trends, but no sharp surges in overall respiratory illnesses have been reported in recent weeks.
6. Regional variations show localized increases in a few areas (e.g., Week11, 2024 in the Pacific Northwest), but overall national trends continue to decline, and hospitalizations and deaths are decreasing or remaining stable (e.g., Week12, 2024 and Week13, 2024).
7. In summary, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 4713 in Week18, 2024 aligns with declining trends in ILI activity, off-season classification, vaccination effectiveness, and stable viral co-circulation. The continued decline in influenza positivity, outpatient visits, and hospitalizations supports this projection for a low but consistent level of ILI cases.
