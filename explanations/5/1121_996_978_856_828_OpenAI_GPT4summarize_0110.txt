1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week23 to Week27, 2023 were 1121, 996, 978, 856, and 828. This demonstrates a consistent declining trend across the five weeks, indicative of tapering ILI activity without any significant spikes or fluctuations.
2. Week32, 2023 falls within the Peak onset season, as per the standard classification for influenza seasons in the U.S. (Week32 to Week46). A gradual increase in ILI activity may initiate toward peak levels during this period, but current conditions indicate it would remain in the early stages of buildup.
3. The consistent decline in ILI occurrences from Week23 to Week27, 2023 suggests that activity remains low. Considering this time-series behavior, a time-series forecasting model would anticipate that the activity level stays subdued for a few more weeks before beginning a modest increase in the Peak onset season starting around Week32, 2023. The projected value of 739 aligns with the mathematical extension of this decreasing trend, with slight upward movement expected as the Peak onset season begins.
4. Virologic surveillance indicates low levels of influenza positivity during the past five weeks (1.0%-1.2% of respiratory specimens tested positive for Weeks23-26 and further declined to 0.8% in Week27), reflecting minimal ILI activity (Week23, 2023 #1; Week24, 2023 #1; Week25, 2023 #1; Week26, 2023 #1; Week27, 2023 #1). This sustained low positivity rates imply continued low ILI prevalence but with eventual increases as seasonal transitions occur.
5. Outpatient respiratory illness visits for ILI have consistently been below the national baseline (1.3%-1.6%) for the past five weeks, with the highest affected group being young children under age five. This supports the ongoing minimal activity phase (Week23, 2023 #4; Week24, 2023 #5; Week25, 2023 #3; Week26, 2023 #4; Week27, 2023 #4), aligning with the off-season trend transitioning into the Peak onset season during Week32.
6. Co-circulation of non-influenza respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, has influenced ILI trends but not caused significant disruptions (Week23, 2023 #10; Week24, 2023 #9; Week25, 2023 #10; Week26, 2023 #9; Week27, 2023 #10). These competing respiratory viruses will continue affecting ILI interpretations and trends, though without triggering substantial spikes.
7. With the observed steady decline in ILI occurrences, the prolonged period of minimal flu activity, and the anticipated seasonal shift into the Peak onset phase, the projected value of 739 for Week32, 2023 is justified. Minor increases in ILI activity are expected as the Peak onset season progresses, though overall activity remains subdued due to low positivity rates and marginal co-influences from other respiratory viruses.
