1. The reported ILI counts from Week52, 2023 to Week4, 2024 were 17430, 13366, 10877, 8551, and 9246. This demonstrates a clear downward trend in reported ILI occurrences through Week3, 2024, from a noticeable peak in Week52, 2023 (17430 ILI occurrences) to a low in Week3, 2024 (8551). However, Week4, 2024 (9246) reveals a slight rebound, suggesting stabilization or potential fluctuation around this level in subsequent weeks.
2. In the U.S., the off-season typically spans from Week9 of one year to Week31 of the same year, with influenza activity significantly decreasing after the peak season (Weeks46–6). Given current trends and Week9, 2024’s position on the calendar, it is anticipated that it falls within the off-season. ILI activity is expected to remain below peak levels with a reduced intensity of transmission.
3. Based on the time-series data, the significant decline in ILI counts from Week52, 2023 to Week3, 2024 is indicative of the tail end of peak activity. The slight rebound in Week4, 2024 further suggests a stabilization before entering the off-season. Projected forward, this pattern implies a steady decrease in ILI counts, with moderate fluctuations as the virus transitions into a seasonal low, resulting in the prediction of 11183 occurrences by Week9, 2024.
4. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 remained the dominant strain in all reporting weeks, with high hospitalization rates among older adults (Week52, 2023 #7; Week1, 2024 #3; Week4, 2024 #4). While A(H1N1) maintains broad susceptibility to antivirals, some limited resistance has been observed, which may sustain ILI activity at moderate levels during the transition into the off-season (Week2, 2024 #10; Week4, 2024 #10). However, vaccine-match efficacy for this strain helps mitigate large surges in cases (Week52, 2023 #13; Week3, 2024 #9).
5. Vaccination efforts continue at national levels, with late-positive impacts emphasized to reduce transmission and severity of ILI cases. Vaccination remains effective against the dominant strains circulating in Weeks52, 2023 through Week4, 2024 (Week1, 2024 #8; Week4, 2024 #7). This sustained vaccination effort helps moderate the risk of a late-season resurgence, promoting a gradual decline following peak impact.
6. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 has complicated the ILI trends in recent weeks, contributing to higher-than-baseline activity and affecting hospitalization rates (Week52, 2023 #10; Week4, 2024 #8). However, declining positivity rates and reported deaths in Week3 and Week4, 2024 (#1, #5) signal that these co-infections are becoming less prevalent, harmonizing with the seasonal reduction trajectory.
7. In conclusion, the forecasted value of 11183 for Week9, 2024 is supported by a clear declining ILI trend towards off-season activity, the dominant strain’s vaccine match and mild antiviral resistance, as well as stabilizing co-infectious factors. These elements indicate moderated future ILI levels as flu activity transitions into the off-season.
