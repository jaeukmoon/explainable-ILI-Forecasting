1. The ILI occurrences from Week25 to Week29, 2022 are as follows: 1623, 1519, 1386, 1170, and 1239. The trend demonstrates a steady decline from Week25 to Week28, descending by approximately 25% over these weeks. However, Week29 exhibits a slight rebound, with occurrences increasing to 1239. Overall, this reflects a predominantly declining trajectory with a minor upturn toward the end of the five-week period.
2. Considering U.S. influenza seasonal patterns, Week34, 2022 falls within the peak onset season, which typically spans from approximately Week32 to Week46 (e.g., Week32, 2022 to Week46, 2022). During this period, ILI activity generally begins to rise as preparations for the influenza peak season unfold. The classification aligns with this timing and the observed preceding trends.
3. Based on time-series forecasting, the declining trend from Week25 to Week28 suggests stabilization below baseline levels, followed by the slight Week29 increase. Projecting forward five weeks, a tempered rebound in ILI occurrences is reasonable, aligning with a transition into peak onset season. This model forecasts 1253 ILI occurrences by Week34, 2022, reflecting a modest increase from Week29 as the onset phase progresses.
4. Nationwide influenza activity remained minimal during the input weeks, with low respiratory specimen positivity rates (e.g., 1.8% in Week25, 1.4% in Week26, and 0.7% from Week27 to Week29). Limited transmission and sustained dominance of Influenza A (H3N2) (e.g., Week25 #2–#3; Week29 #1–#2) indicate minimal immediate risk of widespread infections.
5. Variability in co-circulating viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (e.g., Week28 #8; Week29 #10) and altered healthcare behaviors due to COVID-19 complicate ILI surveillance, potentially masking pure influenza activity. Nearby baseline outpatient ILI visit percentages (e.g., 1.6%-1.7% in Weeks26–29; Week26 #3; Week28 #3) suggest the moderate ILI resurgence predicted aligns with broader trends.
6. Vaccine uptake and vaccination behavior were not elaborated in the input weeks, possibly indicating limited protective effects on ILI dynamics during this period (e.g., Week26 #7, Week28 #9, Week29 #9). This insufficient emphasis on vaccination might marginally contribute to the anticipated Week34 rise.
7. The forecast of 1253 ILI occurrences for Week34, 2022 reflects a stabilization above Week29 (1239), consistent with the peak onset season classification (Week34 #2). Despite low nationwide influenza positivity (Week28 #1) and minimal pediatric mortality (Week29 #6), minor upturns in ILI occurrences (Week29 #3) and seasonality-driven increased exposure support this projection.
