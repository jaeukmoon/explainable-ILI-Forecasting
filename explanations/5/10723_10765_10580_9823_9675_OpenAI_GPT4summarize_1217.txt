1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a steady downward trend, with values decreasing from 10723 (Week11, 2023) to 10765 (Week12, 2023), 10580 (Week13, 2023), 9823 (Week14, 2023), and finally 9675 (Week15, 2023). This consistent decline indicates a reduction in reported ILI activity over the observed weeks, likely influenced by seasonal factors or interventions such as vaccination and public health measures.
2. The correlation between past and future ILI occurrences suggests a continuation of the declining trend observed in Weeks 11–15, 2023, but future occurrences do not decline as sharply, stabilizing at 9285 by Week20, 2023. This implies that while the prior declining trend set the stage, moderating factors such as co-circulation of other respiratory viruses possibly tempered further decreases.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily decreased each week, from 2.4% (Week11, 2023) to 2.0% (Week15, 2023), remaining below the national baseline of 2.5%. This downward pattern supports reduced activity over time, aligning with the lower future ILI occurrences of 9285.
4. While influenza-related hospitalizations decreased, cumulative PIC mortality (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) consistently remained above the epidemic threshold each week, although it declined from 8.7% (Week11, 2023) to 7.5% (Week15, 2023). The elevated PIC mortality reflects the lingering impact of respiratory illnesses, corroborating the steady, albeit reduced, ILI occurrences in Week20, 2023.
5. Low influenza positivity rates across these weeks, with stable percentages ranging from 0.8% to 1.0%, combined with effective vaccination coverage and antiviral susceptibility near 100%, resulted in minimal influenza-driven ILI activity. However, the contribution of co-circulating pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, as reported in all weeks, likely sustained non-influenza respiratory illness activity and led to the observed 9285 occurrences after 5 weeks.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 9285 (Week20, 2023) were driven by the declining trend observed in Weeks 11–15, 2023, decreasing ILI outpatient visits, consistently elevated PIC mortality rates above epidemic thresholds, and the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses that moderated the further decline seen in earlier weeks.
