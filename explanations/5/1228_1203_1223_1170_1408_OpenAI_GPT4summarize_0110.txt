1. The reported ILI counts from Week44 to Week48, 2021 are 1228, 1203, 1223, 1170, and 1408. Initially, a slight fluctuation was observed from Week44 (1228) to Week47 (1170), followed by a significant surge in Week48 (1408). This upward trend indicates the potential onset of a broader ILI increase moving toward peak season activity.
2. Week1, 2022 falls within the peak season for influenza in the U.S. (typically Week46 to Week6 of the following year). As positive influenza cases, ILI outpatient visit trends, and other flu indicators (as of Week48, 2021) are rising, Week1, 2022 is characterized by heightened ILI activity highly reflective of peak season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the sharp increase in Week48, 2021 (1408) suggests rising momentum into future weeks. The aggregated upward trend combined with the seasonal effect of peak activity projects further escalations. Historical patterns in similar years also show a continuous rise during peak season, aligning with the prediction of 3033 cases for Week1, 2022 as a projected continuation of this pattern.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, complicates ILI trends, driving additional respiratory illness and influencing ILI occurrences (Week44, 2021 #10; Week46, 2021 #10; Week48, 2021 #3).
5. Vaccination efforts show potential early declines in uptake compared to previous years, which could reduce population immunity levels (Week48, 2021 #7).
6. Increased influenza positivity and virologic activity in clinical and public health labs, especially from Influenza A(H3N2), dominate ILI cases, with higher circulation among key age demographics (Week45, 2021 #1; Week46, 2021 #2; Week48, 2021 #1, #2).
7. Combining the upward ILI trend observed through Week48, 2021, anticipation of peak-season activity by Week1, 2022, the historical time-series correlation of escalating cases, and influences from rising virologic positivity, vaccination uptake concerns, and co-circulating viruses, the forecasted ILI occurrences increase to 3033 for Week1, 2022.
