1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating trend, with values of ['1063', '870', '773', '893', '1011']. After an initial decline from 1063 (Week6, 2022) to 773 (Week8, 2022), ILI activity rebounded in the subsequent weeks, reaching 1011 by Week10, 2022. This indicates a recovery in ILI levels toward the later weeks of the observed period, suggesting a potential upward trajectory continuing into the future.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 1166 aligns with the upward rebound observed in Weeks9 and 10, 2022. The rise in ILI activity toward the later weeks of the past data (Weeks9–10, 2022), along with the consistent increases in influenza-related hospitalizations and rising flu activity in the subsequent CDC reports, supports a positive correlation between past and future trends, culminating in the elevated future count of 1166.
3. Influenza positivity rates steadily rose through the 5-week period, escalating from 3.0% (Week6, 2022) to 6.8% (Week10, 2022). This growth in laboratory-confirmed influenza cases corresponds with the observed rise in ILI activity and likely contributed to the future surge.
4. Hospitalization rates increased consistently across the 5 weeks, from 4.7 per 100,000 (Week6, 2022) to 5.9 per 100,000 (Week10, 2022), indicating increasing severity of cases. This sustained rise in hospitalizations suggests escalating flu activity, contributing to the future ILI increase to 1166.
5. Antigenic differences in circulating H3N2 strains, as highlighted in Weeks6–10, 2022, potentially reduced vaccine effectiveness, compounding the observed rise in flu activity. Lower vaccination coverage compared to prior seasons, emphasized throughout the reports, further exacerbated the impact of influenza transmission dynamics in driving future ILI counts.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence of 1166 (Week15, 2022) is underpinned by the upward trend observed in Weeks9–10, 2022, rising influenza positivity rates, increasing hospitalization rates, antigenic mismatches in dominant H3N2 strains, and suboptimal vaccination coverage. Together, these factors highlight a confluence of epidemiological conditions fostering the surge.
