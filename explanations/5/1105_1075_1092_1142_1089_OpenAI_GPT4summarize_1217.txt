1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed fluctuating but relatively stable trends, with values of ['1105', '1075', '1092', '1142', '1089']. There was an initial decrease from 1105 (Week27, 2023) to 1075 (Week28, 2023), followed by minor fluctuations: an increase to 1092 (Week29, 2023), then to 1142 (Week30, 2023), before slightly decreasing again to 1089 (Week31, 2023). These variations indicate no sharp escalation or decline in ILI activity during the observed period.
2. While the past ILI occurrences appeared stable, the future ILI occurrence of 1476 suggests a delayed response influenced by the minor uptick seen in Week30, 2023, at 1142. This later surge could be an artifact of lagging indicators or compounding underlying factors missed in the immediate 5-week data.
3. Nationwide outpatient visits for ILI consistently maintained low levels, around 1.1%–1.3% from Week27 to Week31, 2023, which is below the national baseline. However, children under 5 consistently exhibited higher rates (4.0%–4.2%), indicating possible sustained transmission of respiratory illnesses, supporting the increase in future occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) hovered near or exceeded epidemic thresholds consistently (5.5% in Week27 and reaching 5.9% in Week31, 2023). These elevated PIC levels, despite low detected flu activity, suggest other co-circulating respiratory pathogens contributing to the gradual rise in ILI cases.
5. Continued dominance of Influenza A ((H1N1)pdm09) and presence of co-circulating respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, as reported in all weeks, likely contributed to an additive effect on respiratory illnesses. These pathogens combined with regional variation in activity could have elevated the future ILI count.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 1476 is attributed to a stable trend with a minor uptick in past ILI data (Week30, 2023), sustained PIC rates near epidemic thresholds, higher outpatient visits in young children, and the impact of co-circulating respiratory pathogens like RSV and SARS-CoV-2, all of which cumulatively influenced the delayed rise.
