1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating pattern with values of ['1092', '1142', '1089', '1216', '1141']. Despite weekly variations, there was no sustained or dramatic increase; however, the highest value of 1216 in Week32, 2023, indicates a potential peak in the period, followed by a slight decline to 1141 in Week33, 2023. This fluctuation suggests mild respiratory illness activity with no clear declining trend.
2. A positive correlation between the observed data and the reported future ILI occurrence is evident. While past occurrences did not exhibit dramatic spikes, the peak observed in Week32, 2023 (1216), aligns with a subsequent surge to 2035 future occurrences (Week38, 2023). This could imply lagging factors, such as delayed outbreaks or underreported cases in prior weeks, contributed to the rise.
3. The outpatient visits for ILI increased slightly, reaching 1.5% in Week33, 2023, after consistent weekly reports of mild but rising activity from 1.1% in Week29, 2023. This trend in outpatient ILI visits, predominantly in children under 5 years, signals a growing impact on younger populations, feeding into the future increase.
4. Percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) progressively exceeded epidemic thresholds, rising from 5.6% (Week29, 2023) to 10.0% (Week33, 2023). This consistent increase not only reflects worsening respiratory health outcomes but aligns with co-circulating illnesses exacerbating the observed later surge in ILI activity.
5. The impact of novel and co-circulating respiratory viruses—including SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and swine-origin influenza variants—increased across the weeks. For example, Week33, 2023, reported a notable rise in co-circulation, which, combined with disruptions in healthcare utilization and delayed recognition of cases, likely accentuated transmission and future occurrences.
6. In summary, the rise to 2035 ILI occurrences in Week38, 2023, can be explained by the modest peak in past ILI occurrences during Week32, 2023, increasing outpatient respiratory visits, escalating PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, and cumulative impacts of co-circulating respiratory viruses, which contributed to delayed and concentrated respiratory illness trends.
