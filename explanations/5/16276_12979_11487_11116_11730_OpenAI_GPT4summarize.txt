1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall decline followed by a slight rebound. Week-to-week values were ['16276' (Week 36, 2021), '12979' (Week 37, 2021), '11487' (Week 38, 2021), '11116' (Week 39, 2021)], reaching the lowest point at Week 39. However, Week 40, 2021, observed an uptick to '11730', suggesting the possibility of a rebound in ILI activity leading into future weeks. This fluctuating trend highlights a complex epidemiological situation rather than a consistent rise or fall.  

2. The future ILI occurrences of 15312 (Week 45, 2021) signify an increase in activity compared to the end of the 5-week past trend (11730 in Week 40, 2021). This future surge shows a positive association with the rebound observed in Week 40. The increasing trend late in the sequence indicates that the rise in reported ILI cases in Week 45, 2021, was foreshadowed by the slight upturn at the end of the observed series. This connection reflects a delayed effect of influencing factors such as earlier virus dynamics and healthcare-seeking behavior.

3. The summarized CDC reports demonstrate several contributory factors to the future ILI occurrences:  
   - **Continual high percentages of PIC mortality (e.g., 21.0% in Week 36, 18.0% in Week 40)** exceeded epidemic thresholds, predominantly driven by COVID-19. This elevated respiratory illness burden indirectly correlates with future increases in ILI cases.  
   - **Healthcare behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic** distorted surveillance systems, likely underreporting or delaying the recognition of cases during the 5 observed weeks, leading to an eventual surge reflected in Week 45.  
   - **The impact of other respiratory viruses** (non-influenza pathogens) contributing to ILI during Weeks 36–40 was noted consistently. Limited influenza circulation contrasted with increasing respiratory illnesses suggests contributions from other pathogen dynamics to the eventual rise in Week 45 occurrences.

4. In summary, the reported 15312 future ILI occurrences in Week 45, 2021, can be attributed to a rebound in past time-series ILI trends, a delayed correlation between healthcare-seeking behavior changes and reporting, elevated PIC mortality driven by other respiratory illnesses, and non-influenza pathogen dynamics during the 5-week observation period. Together, these factors signal a convergence of influences leading to the observed spike.
