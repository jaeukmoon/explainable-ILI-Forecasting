1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week19, 2021 to Week23, 2021) show a fluctuating pattern: 1598 → 1645 (an increase of 47), 1645 → 1383 (a decrease of 262), 1383 → 1504 (an increase of 121), and 1504 → 1576 (an increase of 72). The overall trend from Week19 to Week23 is slightly increasing, with the end point higher than the starting point (1598 → 1576). Although some fluctuations are evident, the data suggests mild growth in ILI activity. A moving average of the previous 5 weeks is used to calculate future trends: (1598 + 1645 + 1383 + 1504 + 1576) / 5 = 1541.2, which suggests an increasing tendency above this average based on the latest rises of 121 and 72. This pattern influences the upward adjustment for forecasting Week28 to 1659.
2. Forecasting target week (Week28, 2021) belongs to the "Off-season" category. According to U.S. influenza seasonality, the off-season typically spans from after Week6 through Week31. Given Week28, 2021 is within this period, low influenza activity is expected due to reduced seasonal transmission in off-season scenarios, despite minor upticks.
3. The correlation analysis shows that within this 5-week fluctuation window, the ILI occurrences exhibit periodic increases (reflecting residual secondary peaks due to off-season factors like behavioral shifts or localized infections) but stabilize at moderate levels. The average increase between consecutive weeks in Weeks21 to Week23 is 96.5 ((121 + 72) ÷ 2), suggesting a minor upward trend. Applying this average increase to the moving average (1541.2 + 96.5 ≈ 1637.7) and considering prior fluctuations, the projection for Week28 balances slight growth with stabilization into 1659.
4. From the summarized CDC reports, three factors strongly influence this forecast:
5. Minimal influenza activity due to sustained low positive detection rates: All weeks report ≤ 1.3% ILI visits and ≤ 0.1% respiratory samples testing positive. This factor dampens major growth in flu occurrences, keeping it within steady mid-range values around the data average.
6. COVID-19 disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior: As noted in all reports, surveillance data for ILI is inherently impacted by pandemic-related patterns (e.g., shifts to alternative healthcare systems). This likely accounts for occasional small increases in reported ILI, such as the Week22 to Week23 uptick.
7. Low influenza transmission and novel strain absence: The CDC confirms no widespread influenza activity nor human-to-human transmission of novel strains. However, the emergence of new influenza variants (e.g., A(H1N2)v in Week20) emphasizes the need for vigilance. These sporadic uncertainties introduce manageable upward adjustments reflected in the slight growth trend observed.
5. The predicted value, 1659, reflects this combination of mild growth in ILI activity captured within recent trends (averaging increases and fluctuations), low off-season transmission tempered by COVID-19-related disruptions, and a lack of sustained influenza amplification. Together, these factors justify the result as consistent with ongoing patterns.
