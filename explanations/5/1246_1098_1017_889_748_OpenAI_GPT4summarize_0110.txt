1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week22 to Week26, 2023 are 1246, 1098, 1017, 889, and 748. A clear decreasing trend is observed over the five weeks, with a sharp decline from Week22 (1246) to Week26 (748). The reduction in ILI activity reflects a transition into lower activity levels, consistent with the seasonal off-peak period. No notable fluctuations, spikes, or instability are evident during this period, signaling a sustained decline.
2. In the U.S., the off-season typically extends from right after the peak season to the peak onset season (e.g., Week1 to Week31). Given that Week31, 2023 occurs near the end of the off-season and influenza activity indicators (e.g., positivity rates and hospitalization trends) remain low (Week22, 2023 #1; Week23, 2023 #1; Week26, 2023 #1), it is most consistent with off-season classification. Thus, Week31, 2023 belongs to the off-season.
3. A time-series perspective reveals continuous declines in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks, suggesting a steady downward trajectory. Projecting this trend forward to Week31 under the assumption of minimal perturbation (e.g., absence of sudden disease outbreaks or significant epidemiological shifts), a further reduction in ILI to 619 occurrences aligns with observed patterns. Historical data supports gradual declines as influenza and related respiratory illnesses reach seasonal lows.
4. Multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, have been co-circulating alongside influenza across the weeks (Week22, 2023 #9; Week24, 2023 #9; Week26, 2023 #9). These co-circulating viruses contribute to ILI cases but likely at reduced levels, as their seasonal influence wanes.
5. CDC reports consistently anticipate "minimal influenza activity" for the summer season, with outpatient visits remaining well below the national baseline of 2.6% (Week22, 2023 #10; Week23, 2023 #10; Week25, 2023 #3). Influenza positivity rates (roughly 1%-1.2%) and hospitalization rates declined nationwide (Week22, 2023 #1, #5; Week26, 2023 #1, #5), supporting this forecast of low ILI occurrences.
6. Vaccination campaigns for future influenza seasons have been recommended but lack significant updates on uptake (Week22, 2023 #10; Week25, 2023 #9). This absence of new vaccination uptake at this juncture implies no additional factors contributing significantly to lowering ILI numbers during the current period.
7. The continuous decline in ILI occurrences, the alignment of Week31, 2023 with the off-season, the reduction in influenza activity nationwide, and the stable co-circulation of respiratory viruses collectively explain the predicted ILI occurrence of 619. Data trends indicate no sudden resurgence and reflect a steady convergence to minimal activity typical of the off-season.
