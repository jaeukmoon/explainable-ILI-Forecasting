1. The reported ILI counts from Week22 to Week26, 2024 are 1757, 1636, 1587, 1425, and 1405. This demonstrates a consistent decline over the 5-week period, with a noticeable reduction each week. The trend reflects a steady decrease in ILI activity without any significant spikes or plateauing, indicating that overall influenza activity is waning.
2. In the U.S., the off-season generally spans from the end of the peak season to the onset of the next peak onset season, specifically from Week9 to Week30 in 2024. Given that Week31 falls near the transition from off-season to peak onset and the consistently low ILI metrics observed (below baseline levels across all reports), Week31, 2024 is most consistent with the early phase of the peak onset season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the continuous decline in ILI counts over the past 5 weeks suggests that activity has stabilized at a low level. Projecting forward to Week31, 2024, it is reasonable to anticipate that ILI occurrences will begin to increase slightly due to the seasonal shift to peak onset, but not significantly given the present low baseline trends. This results in the forecasted value of 1509 occurrences, reflecting a potential slight uptick from Week26.
4. Influenza activity is low, with lab-positivity rates progressively decreasing from 1.8% in Week22, 2024 to 1.0% in Week26, 2024. This sustained low activity (Week22-Week26) supports the expectation of low ILI occurrences but with potential for slightly increasing activity due to seasonal variation.
5. Vaccination trends and antiviral susceptibility indicate a strong protective effect against influenza. Viral characterization shows a good match between circulating strains and vaccines (Week22 #13; Week26 #9), with minimal resistance to antivirals across both Influenza A and B strains (Week22 #12; Week25 #8). This stability reinforces moderate control over ILI spread.
6. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and influenza has been impacting ILI pathways without causing severe spikes in cases (Week22 #10; Week24 #9). While such interactions are maintained at low levels, their potential influence in Week31 may contribute to a mild increase as activity transitions toward the peak onset period.
7. Based on declining ILI trends from Week22 to Week26, the seasonal timing of Week31 aligning with the peak onset phase, historical time-series patterns of low-to-moderate increases at this time, stable vaccine efficacy and resistance, and co-circulating virus dynamics, the forecasted ILI count of 1509 reflects a slight uptick from recent low activity levels without a major surge.
