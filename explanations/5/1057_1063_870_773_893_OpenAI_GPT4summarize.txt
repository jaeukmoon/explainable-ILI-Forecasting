1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks followed an overall fluctuating yet slightly downward trend, starting at 1057 (Week 5, 2022), peaking at 1063 (Week 6, 2022), and then decreasing to a low of 773 (Week 8, 2022). The final week saw a slight rebound to 893 (Week 9, 2022). However, the relative stabilization in the latter weeks suggests a shift in dynamics that may contribute to an eventual rise in ILI occurrences, given surrounding factors.

2. A correlation between past and future ILI occurrences can be inferred from the rebound in Week 9, 2022 (893) after the decrease in Weeks 7–8, 2022. This recent resurgence aligns with an eventual increase to 1021 future ILI occurrences (Week 14, 2022), suggesting that Week 9 marked a turning point, with factors such as hospitalizations and influenza activity supporting subsequent escalation.

3. Hospitalization rates steadily increased over the weeks, from 4.5 per 100,000 (Week 5, 2022) to 5.5 per 100,000 (Week 9, 2022), indicating a growing severity of respiratory illnesses, including ILI. This trend aligns with rising ILI activity in the future weeks.
 
4. Influenza positivity among clinical lab specimens grew throughout the period, from 2.0% (Week 5, 2022) to 5.8% (Week 9, 2022). The increased influenza circulation, particularly A(H3N2), known for higher transmissibility relative to other strains, likely contributed to the rise in ILI occurrences.
 
5. The co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 with influenza remained a significant factor, with approximately 5.9% of influenza-positive specimens also testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Week 9, 2022). This exacerbated respiratory illnesses, compounding the ILI burden in the affected population.

6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1021 (Week 14, 2022) stem from the progressive rebound observed in Week 9, 2022, underpinned by increasing hospitalization rates, rising influenza positivity (led by A(H3N2)), and the impact of co-circulating SARS-CoV-2. These factors collectively explain the eventual increase in ILI activity.
