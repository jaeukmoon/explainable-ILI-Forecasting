1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a gradual downward trend, with values of ['11581', '11262', '10723', '10765', '10580']. The highest value, 11581, was observed in Week9, 2023, and consistently decreased week by week, reaching 10580 in Week13, 2023. While Week11 experienced a slight increase to 10765, the overall trajectory reflects declining ILI activity during this period.
2. A clear correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, where the consistent decline in past ILI values (Weeks9–13, 2023) aligns with the reported reduction to 9208 occurrences in Week18, 2023. The continued downward trajectory in the past data serves as a precursor to the decrease in future ILI occurrences.
3. Weekly outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline of 2.5% throughout the observation period, showing relatively stable decreases from 2.4% (Week9, 2023) to 2.3% (Week12 and Week13, 2023). These stable yet low levels of ILI-related healthcare engagement correspond to the reduction in future occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) were consistently above the epidemic threshold but exhibited a gradual decrease from 8.9% (Week9, 2023) to 7.9% (Week13, 2023). This decline reflects broader reductions in severe respiratory illness activity and aligns with the downward trend in future ILI occurrences.
5. Despite co-circulating respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and influenza, the stable vaccine effectiveness, low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.9% in Week9, 2023, and Week13, 2023), and lack of novel influenza variants ensured minimal viral disruptions, allowing ILI occurrences to steadily decline toward 9208 in Week18, 2023.
6. In summary, the reported 9208 future ILI occurrences (Week18, 2023) directly correlate with the overall downward trends in past ILI occurrences (Weeks9–13, 2023), declining outpatient visits for ILI, decreasing PIC mortality rates, and minimal viral disruptions due to stable vaccination and antiviral susceptibility. These factors collectively contributed to lower ILI activity in the future.
