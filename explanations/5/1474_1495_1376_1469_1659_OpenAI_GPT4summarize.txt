1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating trend with an overall increase, starting at 1474 (Week 24, 2021), rising to 1495 (Week 25, 2021), dipping to 1376 (Week 26, 2021), and then climbing steadily to 1469 (Week 27, 2021) and 1659 (Week 28, 2021). The notable increase in Week 28 suggests a rising trajectory in ILI activity by the end of the period.

2. A positive correlation is observed between the past and future ILI occurrences. The upward movement in the latter weeks, especially the jump to 1659 in Week 28, 2021, aligns with the substantial rise to 2751 after 5 weeks. This indicates that the increasing trend in the past weeks effectively forecasted the eventual surge in ILI cases.

3. Persistent PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19)-related mortality consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, staying at high levels throughout the 5 weeks, such as 7.1% in Week 24, 6.6% in Week 25, and 7.1% in Week 28. This ongoing respiratory illness burden underscores the broader environment conducive to heightened ILI activity.  
   Slight but consistent increases in outpatient visits for ILI were noted, rising from 1.2% (Weeks 24–26, 2021) to 1.3% (Weeks 27–28, 2021), reflecting increased healthcare encounters for respiratory illnesses, predictive of future case surges.  
   Healthcare-seeking behavior disruptions due to COVID-19 were reported across all weeks, complicating traditional ILI data accuracy and interpretation. These disruptions likely aggregated unreported or delayed cases, contributing to the sharp rise in future occurrences.

4. In summary, the reported 2751 future ILI occurrences (after Week 28, 2021) are attributed to the upward trend in past weeks, demonstrated correlations between rising outpatient ILI visits, persistent PIC-related mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, and the confounding influences of COVID-19 on data collection and healthcare behaviors.
