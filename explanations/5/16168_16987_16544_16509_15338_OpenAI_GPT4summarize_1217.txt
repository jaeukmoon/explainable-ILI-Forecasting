1. The past time-series ILI occurrences exhibited a fluctuating but overall declining trend, with values of ['16168', '16987', '16544', '16509', '15338']. After a peak at 16987 (Week6, 2024), there was a gradual decrease to 16544 (Week7, 2024), followed by a slight decline to 16509 (Week8, 2024) and a sharper decrease to 15338 (Week10, 2024). This pattern reflects diminishing ILI activity across the observed period.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 13604 (Week15, 2024) correlates with the overall decreasing trend seen in the past time-series. The steady decline in values between Weeks 6–10, 2024, suggests that the lower ILI activity towards the end of this period could have set the stage for the reduced future ILI occurrence. This alignment indicates continuity in the decreasing trajectory.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a declining trend over the 5-week period, starting from 4.5% (Week6, 2024), remaining steady in Week7, and then gradually decreasing to 4.4% (Week8, 2024), 4.1% (Week9, 2024), and 3.7% (Week10, 2024). This progressive decrease reflects waning ILI-related healthcare activity, contributing to the subsequent drop in future ILI occurrences.
4. The hospitalization rate for influenza also demonstrated a stabilization and slight decline towards the end of the period, with cumulative rates increasing at a slower pace (from 54.9 per 100,000 in Week6, 2024, to 67.9 per 100,000 in Week10, 2024). This slowing trend in severe flu cases aligns with reduced future ILI activity.
5. Seasonal influenza positivity rates declined from 15.7% (Week6, 2024) to 15.4% (Week10, 2024), with regional variability in activity suggesting mixed flu dynamics. Combined with the stable antiviral susceptibility and the absence of novel influenza viruses, this moderated positivity trend likely underpinned the continued but reduced ILI cases in Week15, 2024.
6. In summary, the reported 13604 future ILI occurrences (Week15, 2024) reflect the observed decline in past time-series ILI occurrences between Weeks 6–10, 2024, a consistent decrease in ILI outpatient visit percentages, slowing hospitalization trends, moderated influenza positivity rates, and the absence of aggressive influenza complications driving sustained but lower ILI activity.
