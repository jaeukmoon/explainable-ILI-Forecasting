1. The past ILI occurrences from Week4, 2022 to Week8, 2022 reveal a clearly decreasing trend: 13413, 10333, 9072, 9072, and 9028. This decline begins steeply from Week4 to Week5 (-3080), followed by a smaller drop between Week5 and Week6 (-1261), and minimally reduces in Week8. The overall trend indicates a consistent reduction in ILI activity without any significant spikes or abrupt fluctuations.
2. Forecasting Week13, 2022 aligns with the off-season of influenza activity, as the week occurs well after the typical peak season (ending approximately by Week6, 2022 based on U.S. seasonality), and overall reports of sporadic and low flu activity support this designation across all CDC summaries.
3. The downward trend in ILI occurrences observed in weeks prior (Week4–Week8, 2022) indicates a gradual stabilization of influenza activity in forthcoming weeks. Minimal positivity rates and below-baseline outpatient visit percentages suggest no immediate upward fluctuations. Projecting this trend forward five weeks to Week13, 2022, leads to an anticipated ILI count of 10080, slightly decreasing relative to the prior seasonal decline.
4. Sporadic influenza activity was consistent throughout Week4–Week8, 2022 (Week4 #10; Week5 #9; Week6 #1; Week7 #1; Week8 #1), with Influenza A(H3N2) dominance but low positivity rates (e.g., Week4, 1.7%; Week5, 2.0%; Week6, 3.0%; Week7, 4.2%; Week8, 4.1%).
5. The consistently lower influenza vaccination coverage compared to previous seasons (Week4 #6; Week5 #8; Week6 #8; Week7 #8; Week8 #8), combined with antigenic mismatches for A(H3N2) viruses, likely exacerbates mild activity persistence into the off-season, slightly influencing ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, with low rates of co-infection (e.g., 5.7%–6.1%), has minimal yet consistent contributions to ILI patterns (Week4 #8; Week5 #7; Week6 #7; Week7 #9; Week8 #6). However, no sustained spikes or disruptions were observed.
7. In conclusion, the forecast of 10080 future ILI occurrences for Week13, 2022 is supported by the consistently decreasing trends in ILI cases, negligible positivity rates, and absence of sharp epidemiological shifts. Off-season timing, reduced vaccination coverage, and co-circulation of minor non-influenza contributors further reinforce this projection.
