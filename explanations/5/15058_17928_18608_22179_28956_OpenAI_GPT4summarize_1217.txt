1. The past time-series ILI occurrences showed a clear and substantial upward trend over five weeks, with values of ['15058', '17928', '18608', '22179', '28956']. From Week47, 2021 (15058), to Week51, 2021 (28956), ILI occurrences nearly doubled, highlighting a rapid and accelerating increase in respiratory illness activity, particularly in the last two weeks.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the upward trend in past ILI occurrences and the reported future value of 13413 (Week6, 2022). The sharp rise from Week49 to Week51, 2021, signals a peak in cases before a subsequent decline, explaining why Week6, 2022, reflects reduced but still elevated activity post-peak. This pattern aligns with known respiratory illness seasonality.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI exceeded the national baseline starting in Week48, 2021 (2.5%), continuing to rise through Week51, 2021 (3.8%). This sustained increase in ILI-related visits coincides with the time-series peak and sets the stage for heightened but decreasing future activity. Clinical lab positivity for influenza steadily increased from 1.5% (Week47, 2021) to 6.2% (Week51, 2021), driven predominantly by Influenza A (H3N2), signaling a surge in influenza virus circulation likely contributing to the ILI trends. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, particularly during Week50 and Week51, 2021, compounded the respiratory illness burden, amplifying initial rises and influencing sustained activity into Week6, 2022.
4. Mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, rising from 15.5% (Week47, 2021) to 19.2% (Week51, 2021). Though predominantly driven by COVID-19, these high PIC mortality rates highlight a broader respiratory illness burden and an ongoing, significant impact of flu and related illnesses, driving future ILI occurrences. Lower flu vaccination uptake compared to previous seasons, as observed weekly, likely exacerbated influenza transmission, further fueling ILI activity.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 13413 (Week6, 2022) result from the rapid and escalating past trend observed through Week51, 2021, influenced by rising outpatient ILI visits exceeding baseline, increasing influenza positivity rates, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and compounded by low vaccination uptake and co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors collectively explain the residual high ILI activity after five weeks, albeit with a reduction from past peak levels.
