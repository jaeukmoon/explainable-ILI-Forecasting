1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed significant fluctuations with values of ['1464', '1435', '1358', '1759', '1626'], showing no consistent upward or downward trend. A notable peak occurred in Week17, 2021, reaching 1759, followed by a slight decline to 1626 in Week18, 2021. These variations indicate dynamic changes in ILI activity without a clear directional pattern during the observed period.
2. A correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is suggested by the Week17 surge (1759) acting as a precursor to the future value of 1748 in Week23, 2021. This alignment reflects a stabilization of ILI activity at elevated levels despite minor declines in Weeks18 and beyond.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at 1.1% for Weeks14–17, 2021, and showed a slight increase to 1.2% in Week18, 2021. Although minimal, this rise in ILI-related visits coincides with the elevated future occurrences, suggesting a delayed but consistent contribution to the observed pattern.
4. Persistent deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded epidemic thresholds, remaining steady between 10.9% and 12.4% across Weeks14–18, 2021. While COVID-19 dominated PIC deaths, such sustained respiratory mortality likely fueled overall ILI activity trends.
5. Disruptions caused by COVID-19, including altered healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI data collection, remained significant during Weeks14–18, 2021. These disruptions may have contributed to underreporting or misclassification of initial cases, inflating future ILI occurrences to 1748 by Week23, 2021.
6. Despite atypically low positivity rates for influenza cases (averaging 0.1% across all weeks), minimal novel virus circulation alongside historically low flu activity may have led other respiratory illnesses to fill the gap, subtly driving reported ILI occurrences upward.
7. In summary, the recorded 1748 future ILI occurrences (Week23, 2021) can be attributed to the fluctuations observed in Weeks17–18, 2021, consistent outpatient ILI visits, respiratory PIC mortality trends, and the compounded effects of pandemic-related disruptions and non-specific respiratory illnesses supplementing traditional ILI activity.
