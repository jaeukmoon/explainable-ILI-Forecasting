1. The reported ILI counts from Week14 to Week18, 2021 are 2087, 1956, 1924, 1816, and 1843. The trend exhibits a notable decline from Week14 (2087) to Week17 (1816), followed by a slight uptick in Week18 (1843). Overall, the pattern represents a gradual decrease over time with minimal recent fluctuation, suggesting a stabilization at lower levels.
2. In the U.S., the off-season typically spans Weeks 1–31. Week23, 2021 falls within this period, characterized by minimal influenza activity and reduced community spread (Week14–Week18, 2021 #5, #8). The ongoing low influenza positivity and reduced ILI percentages confirm that Week23, 2021 aligns with the off-season period for influenza.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent declining trend from Week14 to Week17, stabilized by a minor increase in Week18, suggests a projection of ILI counts continuing at slightly fluctuating but generally stable levels after Week18. Considering minimal indications of a rebound or sharp drop, the time-series model logically forecasts 1929 ILI occurrences for Week23, 2021, fitting the observed mild stabilization trends.
4. Influenza positivity rates remained exceedingly low at 0.1% across Weeks14–18, 2021 (Week14, 2021 #1; Week15, 2021 #1; Week16, 2021 #1; Week17, 2021 #1; Week18, 2021 #1), reflecting negligible community-level virus circulation and limited potential for a significant near-term ILI resurgence.
5. COVID-19's dominance remains a key confounding factor, with changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and overlapping PIC deaths (Week14, 2021 #8; Week15, 2021 #5; Week16, 2021 #6; Week17, 2021 #5; Week18, 2021 #6) influencing ILI surveillance and driving ongoing complexities in seasonal influenza dynamics.
6. Nationwide outpatient ILI visits stayed below the baseline of 2.6% throughout Weeks14–18, 2021 (Week14, 2021 #5; Week15, 2021 #6; Week16, 2021 #3; Week17, 2021 #7; Week18, 2021 #4). This consistent stability in respiratory illness visits strongly supports the projection of a stabilized ILI pattern without sharp fluctuations.
7. The prediction of 1929 ILI occurrences for Week23, 2021 is supported by the declining ILI trend through Week17, the off-season period, low positivity rates, stable outpatient ILI activity, and the confounding impacts of COVID-19 complicating influenza spread. These factors together reinforce the expectation of minimal fluctuations and a stable continuation in ILI counts.
