1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a variable pattern with an upward peak followed by stabilization. The ILI counts rose from 1532 (Week9, 2021) to 2021 (Week11, 2021), then declined slightly and plateaued around 1977–1982 in Weeks12–13, 2021. This pattern indicates fluctuating but relatively high ILI activity leading into Week13, 2021.
2. A moderate correlation exists between these past occurrences and the reported future occurrence of 1843 (Week18, 2021). The consistency of high ILI activity in Weeks11–13, 2021, despite small fluctuations, likely contributed to the sustained level of 1843 observed five weeks later.
3. Outpatient ILI visit percentages remained stable but low (0.8%–1.0%) throughout Weeks9–13, 2021, reflecting steady ILI activity despite being below baseline. This stability likely anchors future ILI trends, supporting the 1843 case count seen in Week18, 2021.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed epidemic thresholds (from 14.6% in Week9 to 11.4% in Week13, 2021), dominated by COVID-19. This elevated respiratory illness burden aligns with continued moderate ILI activity in Week18, 2021.
5. Pediatric ILI trends showed increasing activity among children aged 0–4 years across Weeks9–13, 2021, as emphasized in CDC reports. This subgroup’s rise could have influenced future ILI counts, contributing to the maintenance of high occurrence levels into Week18, 2021.
6. Data collection complexity during the COVID-19 pandemic, consistently mentioned (Weeks9–13, 2021), impacted healthcare-seeking behavior and traditional surveillance systems, potentially distributing ILI occurrences and bolstering non-specific reporting in Week18, 2021.
7. In summary, the observed 1843 future ILI occurrences (Week18, 2021) can be explained by the relatively high plateau of ILI counts in Weeks11–13, 2021, stable outpatient visit rates, elevated PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, the growing pediatric ILI trend, and pandemic-related reporting challenges.
