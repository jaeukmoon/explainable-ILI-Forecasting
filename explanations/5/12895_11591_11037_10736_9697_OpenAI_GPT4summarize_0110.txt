1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week6 to Week10, 2024 are 12895, 11591, 11037, 10736, and 9697, respectively, showing a consistent declining trend over the five weeks. This indicates that influenza activity is subsiding following earlier peak levels during the traditional flu season.
2. Week15, 2024 falls into the off-season category. Typically, this period sees reduced ILI activity as it follows the peak season, which generally ends around Week6. The decreasing trends in positivity and outpatient visits further confirm that Week15 is part of the off-season period.
3. The steady decline from Week6 to Week10 in historical ILI occurrences reflects a downward trajectory with no evidence of resurgence. Projecting this trend using time-series analysis, it is reasonable to expect continued reductions in ILI counts, stabilizing at a lower level around Week15, 2024, aligning with the provided forecast of 7569.
4. Influenza positivity displayed a gradual decrease, dropping from 15.7% in Week6 to 15.4% in Week10, with a mix of Influenza A dominance (varying from 61.8% to 54.4%) and increasing representation of Influenza B. This signals declining transmission intensity. (Week6 #1, #2; Week10 #1, #2)
5. While hospitalization rates remain high, they have stabilized and are slightly declining, from 54.9 per 100,000 in Week6 to 67.9 per 100,000 in Week10. This trend strongly supports lower predicted ILI activity in Week15. (Week6 #5, Week10 #5)
6. Outpatient visits for ILI also dropped gradually from 4.5% in Week6 to 3.7% in Week10, marking a clear decline in active respiratory illness presentations. This suggests a continued decrease in public health burden nearing Week15. (Week6 #4, Week10 #4)
7. The forecasted future ILI occurrence of 7569 for Week15, 2024 is justified by the decreasing trend in historical ILI counts, alignment with the off-season period, declining influenza positivity, stabilizing hospitalization rates, and reduced outpatient visits. As the flu season wanes, these factors collectively contribute to lower activity during the off-season, consistent with the prediction.
