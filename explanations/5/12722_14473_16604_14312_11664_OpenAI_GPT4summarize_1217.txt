1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a clear fluctuating trend with a peak in Week 48, 2023 (16604), followed by a sharp decrease to 11664 in Week 50, 2023. Despite the decline in the final two weeks, the earlier weeks demonstrated a progressive rise from 12722 (Week 46, 2023) to 14473 (Week 47, 2023) and plateaued at 16604 in Week 48. This overall fluctuation reflects both periods of growth and decline in ILI activities.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 16863 in Week 3, 2024, aligns with the impact of the prior trend direction. The increase towards Week 48, 2023, coupled with the subsequent slight decline, suggests a delayed upward rebound, as seasonal influenza trends often exhibit a follow-up resurgence after dips due to sustained viral co-circulation and holiday-related factors in Weeks 51–52, 2023.
3. An increase in outpatient visits for ILI, rising from 5.1% in Week 50, 2023, to 6.9% by Week 52, 2023, signals heightened respiratory illness prevalence toward the latter weeks. This pattern corresponds to the subsequent elevation of ILI occurrences observed after 5 weeks. Hospitalizations with significant peaks in Week 1, 2024 (18,526 hospitalizations), and predictions of post-holiday surges further substantiate the rise in future ILI numbers. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens, including influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 with RSV and SARS-CoV-2, reported consistently from Week 50, 2023, complicates respiratory illness dynamics, contributing to increased ILI burden. The cumulative hospitalization rate reaching 37.3 per 100,000 by Week 2, 2024, among the highest in a decade, supports future projections of high ILI activity.
4. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 16863 (Week 3, 2024) reflects the interplay between fluctuating trends observed in the past time-series data, the seasonal nature of respiratory illness clusters with predictable rebounds, and compounding external factors such as sharp ILI outpatient visit rates, hospitalization peaks, and co-circulating viral activity driving elevated occurrences.
