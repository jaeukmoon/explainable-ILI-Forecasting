1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over 5 weeks showed an overall decreasing trend initially but ended with a slight uptick, with values of ['1074', '899', '795', '742', '834']. After a sharp decline from 1074 in Week4, 2022, to 742 in Week7, 2022, a slight rebound to 834 occurred in Week8, 2022. The shift in trajectory by the end of this period reflects a transition to increased respiratory illness activity.
2. A positive correlation between the resurgence seen in the latter weeks and the future ILI occurrences is apparent. The increase from 742 (Week7, 2022) to 834 (Week8, 2022) serves as an initial marker for the significant jump to 2612 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week13, 2022). This alignment demonstrates the compounding nature of ILI activity following the observed resurgence.
3. Nationwide influenza positivity rates rose from 1.7% (Week4, 2022) to 4.1% (Week8, 2022), indicating a broader circulation of influenza viruses. This rise, concentrated in A(H3N2) strains with some antigenic differences, reflects progressive flu spread, contributing to the future spike.
4. Hospitalization rates showed consistent increases, climbing from 4.4 per 100,000 in Week4, 2022, to 5.2 per 100,000 in Week8, 2022. This steady rise, affecting vulnerable age groups, portrays worsening illness severity, aligning with the reported future ILI surge.
5. Low vaccination rates across all weeks compounded by antigenic evolution in A(H3N2) viruses reduced vaccine effectiveness, as noted in Week8, 2022. This synergistic effect likely contributed to lowered immunity levels and the subsequent rise in ILI occurrences reflected in the future data.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) peaked at 6%-6.1% as of Week8, 2022, potentially exacerbating ILI presentations and amplifying the impact on future occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 2612 future ILI occurrences (Week13, 2022) result from the late resurgence in Weeks7–8, 2022, rising positivity and hospitalization rates, low vaccine uptake, antigenic evolution in A(H3N2) viruses, and the exacerbating role of respiratory co-pathogens.
