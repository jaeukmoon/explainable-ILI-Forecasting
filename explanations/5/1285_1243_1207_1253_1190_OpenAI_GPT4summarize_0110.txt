1. The reported ILI counts from Week31 to Week35, 2022 are 1285, 1243, 1207, 1253, and 1190. These data indicate a generally decreasing trend from Week31 (1285) to Week35 (1190), with minor fluctuations. There was a slight uptick in Week34 (1253) before resuming the decline into Week35 (1190). Overall, this pattern reflects a stable decrease in ILI occurrences, with no major spike or abrupt surges during these weeks.
2. Target Week40, 2022 falls within the peak onset season. According to historical seasonality, the U.S. peak onset season spans Week32/35 through Week46. Low influenza activity was observed during Week31 to Week35, 2022 (#1, #10; Week31–35, 2022), confirming that early signs of the season's buildup align with this forecast classification.
3. From the time-series perspective, the observed ILI counts from Week31 to Week35, 2022 suggest fluctuations accompanying an overall declining trend. By projecting this trajectory forward, compounded by the expected gradual onset of higher ILI activity in the peak onset season, the ILI counts could increase moderately over the coming weeks. This time-series correlation aligns with the forecast of 2575 ILI occurrences in Week40, 2022.
4. Virologic surveillance highlights that influenza positivity remains low (between 0.4% and 0.6%) nationwide from Week31 to Week35, 2022, heavily dominated by Influenza A (or H3N2 subtype) with minimal Influenza B (#1–3; Week31–35, 2022). However, slight increases in positivity (e.g., Week35 at 0.6%) may signal an early seasonal rise.
5. Flu activity expectations from CDC during Week31 to Week35, 2022 remain uncertain. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, SARS-CoV-2) continues to influence ILI patterns, although simultaneous low influenza activity is observed (#9; Week31–35, 2022). Anticipating an eventual seasonal uptick in flu during the peak onset season contributes to the forecast.
6. ILI outpatient visits, especially among children aged 0-4 years, have shown incremental rises from Week31 to Week35, 2022 (e.g., 1.5% in Week31 to 1.9% in Week35; #5; Week31–35, 2022). Patterns of growing outpatient respiratory illnesses, coupled with steady hospitalization trends (e.g., Week35: 509 admissions; #6; Week31–35, 2022), further suggest continued but slow increases in case numbers.
7. The projected ILI value of 2575 aligns with historical trends, the seasonal timing of Week40, 2022 (peak onset season), and CDC's virologic and activity data. Despite current low influenza activity, the gradual increase in influenza positivity, outpatient visits, and hospitalization rates correlates with moderate seasonal growth expected during peak onset transition weeks.
