1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited an overall fluctuating pattern with a gradual increase toward the end. The values ranged from '1539' (Week 4, 2022) to '1111' (Week 6, 2022), followed by steady increases to '1182' (Week 7, 2022) and '1261' (Week 8, 2022). This trajectory indicates an emerging upward trend in ILI activity by the conclusion of the 5-week period.  
2. A strong alignment can be observed between the uptick in ILI occurrences during the final weeks (Weeks 7–8, 2022) and the future occurrence of 2021 ILI cases (after 5 weeks in Week 13, 2022). The steady rise in past occurrences mirrors the elevated ILI activity reflected in the future data, pointing to a continuation and amplification of this trend.  
3. Multiple factors from the CDC reports correlate with the observed future ILI increase. First, the consistent rise in influenza positivity rates (1.7% in Week 4, 2022, increasing to 4.1% by Week 8, 2022) indicates escalating viral activity, predominantly driven by Influenza A(H3N2). Second, the low flu vaccination coverage throughout the period, compounded by antigenic mismatches in the vaccine, likely reduced herd immunity and supported an uptick in flu transmission. Third, the sustained co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (approximately 6% co-infection rate), underscores the compounded risk of respiratory illnesses that may have contributed to the overall rise in ILI occurrences.  
4. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 2021 cases (Week 13, 2022) can be explained by the observed upward trend in ILI cases during Weeks 7–8, 2022, the increasing positivity rates for influenza A(H3N2), low vaccination coverage exacerbated by antigenic mismatches, and the co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens. These factors collectively suggest a continuation of the escalation in ILI activity over the subsequent 5 weeks.
