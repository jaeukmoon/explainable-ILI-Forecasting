1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week36 to Week40, 2023 are 1476, 1629, 2035, 2037, and 2328, showing a consistent upward trend across all weeks. With an increase of 852 cases over five weeks, this pattern suggests building momentum toward higher ILI numbers. No significant fluctuations or dips were observed; the trend indicates steady growth in ILI activity.
2. Week45, 2023 falls within the peak onset season, as it is still before the typical U.S. peak season, which begins around Week46. The observed steady increases in ILI activity and surveillance data suggest this timing is consistent with the upward trajectory typical in the peak onset phase.
3. From a time-series perspective, the regular weekly increases in ILI data indicate a continued upward trajectory. Extrapolating this consistent growth rate forward over five weeks, while accounting for the historical patterns of rising activity during the peak onset phase, supports the forecast value of 3085. Adjustments are likely due to seasonal acceleration.
4. Flu activity positivity rates have steadily risen, increasing from 0.7% of clinical specimens in Week36 to 1.1% in Week40 (Week36, 2023 #1; Week40, 2023 #1). This aligns with a period of gradually intensifying flu transmission.
5. Outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses also increased from 2.0% in Week36 to 2.2% in Week40, with higher-than-average rates in younger demographics (Week36, 2023 #4; Week40, 2023 #8). This reflects broader respiratory illness dynamics, which typically translate into higher ILI occurrences.
6. Hospitalization rates have grown consistently, with reported cases rising from 775 in Week36 to 1,127 in Week40 (Week36, 2023 #7; Week40, 2023 #3). This increase mirrors the upward trend in ILI occurrences and indicates escalating disease pressure, characteristic of the peak onset phase.
7. The increasing rates of flu positivity, outpatient visits, and hospitalizations, alongside the steady upward ILI trend, suggest continued growth leading to Week45. Moderate influenza activity in some jurisdictions (Week39, 2023 #9; Week40, 2023 #9) and the influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses (Week36, 2023 #9; Week40, 2023 #6) further support the projection of 3085 ILI cases.
