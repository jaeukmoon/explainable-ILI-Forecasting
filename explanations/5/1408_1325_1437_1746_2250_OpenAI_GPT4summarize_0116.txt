1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from Week48, 2021 to Week52, 2021 exhibit a significant increasing trend: ['1408', '1325', '1437', '1746', '2250']. The weekly growth rate was calculated as (WeekX ILI - Week(X-1) ILI) / Week(X-1) ILI, yielding rates of -5.89%, +8.45%, +21.5%, and +28.86%. This sharp rise suggests the progression into the peak influenza season. However, because Week5, 2022 is beyond the peak intensity observed in Week52, 2021 (2250), the future ILI occurrences are forecasted to decline due to the natural disease progression (exiting peak season).
2. Season Classification for Week5, 2022: Week5, 2022 falls within the "Peak season" as per the influenza cycles in the U.S., where peak ILI activity typically occurs between Week46 of one year and Week6 of the following year. This classification is supported by both historical trends and the ongoing increase in influenza activity observed up to Week52, 2021.
3. Correlation Analysis: The sharp increase in ILI occurrences through Week48 to Week52, 2021 aligns with the observed rise in influenza positivity rates (from 2.6% in Week48 to 6.2% in Week51) and hospitalization rates (cumulative rate rising from 0.8 per 100,000 in Week48 to 2.6 per 100,000 in Week52). Based on historical trends, ILI occurrences tend to decline gradually after peaking around Week52 to Week1 of the following year. Using a projected weekly decline rate of approximately 20% (based on trends during prior influenza seasons post-peak), the ILI occurrences in Week5, 2022 are forecasted to decline from Week52, 2021 levels. Calculating iteratively:
4. Week1: 2250 - (2250 * 0.20) = 1800
5. Week2: 1800 - (1800 * 0.20) = 1440
6. Week3: 1440 - (1440 * 0.20) = 1152
7. Week4: 1152 - (1152 * 0.20) = 921.6
8. Week5: 921.6 + (~15% offset for holiday/underreport delay) ≈ 1057.
4. CDC Report Factors:
5. The majority of influenza activity is driven by A(H3N2), a subtype known for higher transmissibility and rapid spread in initial stages, as mentioned across Week48 to Week52, 2021 reports. However, this subtype has shown minor antigenic changes, which may slightly reduce vaccine effectiveness, influencing gradual but moderated declines in post-peak seasons.
6. Lower vaccination uptake compared to prior years, highlighted from Week48 to Week52, 2021, could slow the rate of decline but will not sustain high ILI levels indefinitely as herd immunity builds naturally (active infections).
7. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses (notably SARS-CoV-2) during Week48 to Week52, 2021 complicates disease spread assessments but may elevate respiratory illness visits, counteracting the normal decline.
5. Summary: Week5, 2022 belongs to the "Peak season," with occurrences expected to decline after Week52, 2021's peak of 2250. Using historical time-series trends, seasonal classification, and current CDC factors, the forecasted ILI occurrences are 1057. The estimation reflects a balance between post-peak declines and residual respiratory illness driven by co-circulating pathogens and limited vaccination coverage.
