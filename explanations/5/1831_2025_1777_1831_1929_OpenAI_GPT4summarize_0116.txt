1. Explanation:
1. The past 5 weeks of ILI occurrences (from Week19, 2021 to Week23, 2021) show a slightly fluctuating trend: ['1831', '2025', '1777', '1831', '1929']. Starting with a slight increase from 1831 (Week19) to 2025 (Week20), there is a dip to 1777 (Week21), followed by stabilization around 1831 (Week22), and an increase to 1929 (Week23). The general trend indicates mild fluctuations rather than a consistent increase or decrease. When calculating the average over the 5 weeks: (1831 + 2025 + 1777 + 1831 + 1929) / 5 = 1878.6. A slight adjustment is applied due to the mildly upward fluctuation in recent weeks (Weeks22-23) and other report factors, suggesting activity may increase.
2. Week28, 2021 falls under the "Off-season" based on the U.S. influenza season cycle. According to standard flu season patterns, Week28 lies between the previous Peak season (ending Week6, 2021) and the expected Peak onset season (starting approximately Week32, 2021). During this time, ILI activity is typically minimal and close to baseline, with occasional minor increases due to non-influenza respiratory viruses such as COVID-19.
3. Correlation analysis indicates that previous ILI patterns at baseline or during reduced influenza activity (such as during the 2020-21 pandemic) suggest that a modest increase may occur after Week23, 2021. Comparing the recent trend to the historical influenza trend (during the same phase between Weeks23-28), we anticipate a continuation of recent small fluctuations toward a gradual increase. The upward shift seen in the last two weeks suggests approximately a 3%-5% rise per week, modifying the average from 1878.6 by this growth rate: 1878.6 × (1.04^5) = 2280. Applying a small additional adjustment for changes in healthcare-seeking behavior produces the forecast of 2386.
4. Three key CDC-reported factors influencing the prediction are:
5. (1) Minimal influenza circulation: Reports consistently indicate unusually low detection of influenza viruses from Week19 through Week23. Only 0.1% of samples tested positive, and hospitalization rates remained extremely low. This strongly supports continued low flu transmission during the off-season but allows for minor increases due to other respiratory illnesses.
6. (2) Novel influenza variants: The identification of low-risk, non-human-to-human novel strains in Week20 and Week21 underscores the need for ongoing respiratory surveillance but does not suggest a large-scale outbreak. These contribute minimally to expected increases.
7. (3) COVID-19 impact: COVID-19 remains the primary respiratory illness, driving most PIC deaths above threshold levels (Week19-Week23). Altered healthcare-seeking behaviors and dual tracking of ILI and COVID-19 may introduce variability in surveillance, leading to slight overestimation of non-flu-related increases. For Week28, COVID-19 testing and symptomatic overlap may contribute to ILI increases not caused by influenza.
5. In summary, the forecast for ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week28, 2021) is 2386. This is based on (1) a slightly fluctuating upward trend in recent weeks, (2) the designation of Week28 as the off-season with minimal expected flu activity, (3) adjustments for low influenza virus circulation and external COVID-19 impacts, and (4) quantitative modeling reflecting a ~3%-5% weekly rise over the baseline average of 1878.6. These factors collectively justify the predicted value.
