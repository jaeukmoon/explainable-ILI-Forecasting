1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a clear upward trajectory, with values of ['1961', '2458', '2854', '3151', '4023']. Week47, 2023 started with 1961 occurrences, showing a significant and steady increase across the weeks, peaking at 4023 occurrences in Week51, 2023. This consistent rise reflects heightened influenza-like activity throughout the observed period.
2. The pronounced increase in ILI occurrences during the observed 5-week period (Week47–Week51, 2023) correlates positively with the drop to 2855 future occurrences (Week5, 2024). The peak of 4023 occurrences seen in Week51, 2023 was likely followed by declining influenza activity due to seasonal patterns and the waning of co-circulating respiratory illnesses, leading to the reported lower future value of 2855.
3. Weekly outpatient visits for ILI demonstrated a consistent increase, rising from 3.9% in Week47, 2023 to 6.1% in Week51, 2023. Although this trend reflects heightened activity, it can explain the subsequent reduction after Week51 due to the natural peak-and-decline dynamics of influenza circulation.
4. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza climbed sharply from 6.2% in Week47, 2023 to 16.1% in Week51, 2023, indicating widespread flu activity. This steep increase likely contributed to the peak in the past ILI data, followed by a tapering off that aligns with the future reduction to 2855 occurrences.
5. Cumulative influenza hospitalization rates escalated from 3.7 per 100,000 in Week47, 2023 to 15.4 per 100,000 in Week51, 2023. This surge highlights the severe impact of influenza during the weeks prior to Week51, 2023, suggesting that the future decline to 2855 reflects a subsiding phase following the peak of hospitalizations and severe cases.
