1. The ILI occurrences from Week23 to Week27, 2022 showed a noticeable decline from 1454 (Week23) to 711 (Week26), followed by a slight uptick to 900 in Week27. This indicates an overall downward trend with a minor fluctuation in the last week, reflecting reduced intensity but retention of minimal residual ILI activity.
2. Forecasting target Week32, 2022 aligns with the peak onset season. Week32 historically marks the transition from the off-season to a gradual increase in ILI activity leading to the peak season, as residual influenza activity begins to grow slightly.
3. The time-series analysis shows a clear decreasing pattern over the last five weeks with no large deviations or spikes, suggesting a consistent decline, which could give way to slight stabilization or minimal increase in subsequent weeks due to the season shift. This consistency supports forecasting for a reduced but moderate occurrence of 782 in Week32, 2022.
4. Nationwide influenza positivity rates have declined sharply from 3.4% in Week23 to 0.7% in Week27, indicating minimal influenza activity (Week23, 2022 #1; Week27, 2022 #1).
5. Outpatient respiratory ILI visits consistently decreased, stabilizing below the national baseline. For example, visits were at 2.1% in Week23 and reduced to 1.7% in Week27, indicating lower flu burden (Week23, 2022 #3; Week27, 2022 #4).
6. Mixed antigenic match of vaccines with H3N2 strains, alongside changing healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, created a slower return to pre-pandemic baselines, impacting ILI trends slightly (Week23, 2022 #8; Week26, 2022 #10; Week27, 2022 #10).
7. In summary, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 782 for Week32, 2022 reflects a combination of the declining ILI trends from prior weeks, seasonal transition to peak onset, low influenza positivity rates, stable outpatient ILI visits, and lingering disruptions caused by evolving respiratory behaviors during the pandemic.
