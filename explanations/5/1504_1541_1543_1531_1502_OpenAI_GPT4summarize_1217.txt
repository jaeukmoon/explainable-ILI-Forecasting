1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a slight fluctuation but remained relatively steady, with values of ['1504', '1541', '1543', '1531', '1502']. A minor increase was seen from 1504 (Week 31, 2021) to 1543 (Week 33, 2021), followed by a decrease to 1502 (Week 35, 2021). This stable pattern indicates no significant surges in ILI activity but suggests ongoing baseline respiratory illness transmission.
2. A slight correlation can be inferred between the stable past occurrences and the subsequent sharp increase to 2037 after 5 weeks (Week 40, 2021). While the past data does not display an escalating trend, the consistent ILI values likely form a baseline from which external factors (e.g., non-influenza respiratory illnesses and COVID-19 trends) contributed to the future spike.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline, rising from 2.0% in Week 31, 2021, to 2.2% in Week 34 and then dropping to 0.9% in Week 35. This fluctuation aligns with an ongoing rise in respiratory illness activity among particular age groups (e.g., 0–4 years and 5–24 years in Weeks 32–34), influencing the future increase in occurrences.
4. PIC mortality reached and exceeded epidemic thresholds during the 5 weeks, rising from 11.9% (Week 31, 2021) to as high as 19.4% (Week 34, 2021). Although driven primarily by COVID-19, this high mortality rate signals significant respiratory disease circulation, potentially correlating with the sharp rise to 2037 occurrences by Week 40, 2021.
5. Summarized reports highlight limitations in surveillance due to altered healthcare-seeking behaviors and the concurrent impact of COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses. These disruptions likely contributed to underrepresented ILI data in earlier weeks, culminating in a concentrated rise in future reporting variables reflective of a larger epidemiological burden.
6. Minimal influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% in Week 34, 2021, and minimal flu activity across most regions) suggest that the increase in future ILI occurrences could be attributed to non-influenza illnesses (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus and SARS-CoV-2), amplifying respiratory illness metrics by Week 40.
7. In summary, the rise to 2037 ILI occurrences (Week 40, 2021) is attributable to stable past data forming a baseline, correlating with increasing outpatient visits in select age groups, high PIC mortality rates driven by COVID-19, and reporting disruptions. This surge likely reflects a cumulative effect of non-influenza respiratory virus activity and pandemic-related healthcare behavior adaptations.
