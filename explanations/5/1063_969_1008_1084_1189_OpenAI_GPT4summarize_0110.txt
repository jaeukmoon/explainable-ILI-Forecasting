1. The reported ILI counts from Week41 to Week45, 2021 are 1063, 969, 1008, 1084, and 1189. The trend demonstrates a gradual increase from Week42 (969) to Week45 (1189) after a slight dip early in Week42. This indicates sustained growth, reflective of progression toward the peak season, with no significant fluctuations or drops over these weeks.
2. Week50, 2021 falls squarely within the peak season, which typically spans from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the subsequent year in the U.S. The rising trend in ILI counts and increasing influenza positivity rates over the analyzed period strongly suggests Week50 will align with this high-intensity transmission period.
3. Time-series analysis reflects a generally increasing pattern over the last five weeks. Using this trajectory, the future ILI occurrence after five weeks (Week50, 2021) is projected as 1874, representing continued growth during the peak season while accounting for the steady but moderate rising trend observed historically.
4. Laboratory and surveillance data indicate that the proportion of positive influenza specimens increased steadily from Week41 (0.1%) to Week45 (0.7%) (Week41, 2021 #1; Week42, 2021 #1; Week43, 2021 #1; Week44, 2021 #1; Week45, 2021 #1), suggesting ongoing influenza activity acceleration. This upward trajectory supports higher ILI occurrences in Week50, 2021.
5. Influenza A (particularly H3N2) dominance (Week41, 2021 #3; Week43, 2021 #3; Week44, 2021 #3; Week45, 2021 #3) with spread concentrated in younger populations (5–24 years) has also driven case increases, including a localized outbreak in Michigan (Week44, 2021 #5). These outbreaks correlate with higher transmission rates and projected future counts.
6. Despite an aggressive vaccination campaign (Week44, 2021 #9; Week45, 2021 #8), co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses such as COVID-19 and varying healthcare-seeking behaviors (Week41, 2021 #10; Week43, 2021 #10; Week44, 2021 #10; Week45, 2021 #10) continue to complicate influenza prediction accuracy. These factors likely contribute to moderate increases in ILI activity.
7. Based on analyzed trends, timing within the peak season (Week50, 2021), rising influenza positivity, H3N2-driven activity, minimal vaccination impact, and co-circulating respiratory viruses, the projected ILI occurrence of 1874 is consistent with the ongoing observed growth and anticipated peak-season based transmission.
