1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week46 to Week50, 2023 are 18067, 15980, 21189, 22735, and 25895. The trend shows a steady and significant rise, particularly from Week47 onwards, with a sharp increase in Week49 (22735) and Week50 (25895). This upward trajectory indicates rapid escalation in ILI activity during this period.
2. Forecasting target week (Week3, 2024) belongs to the peak season. In the U.S., the peak season generally spans Week46 through about Week6 of the following year, and the escalating ILI counts and increasing flu activity throughout Week50, 2023 align with this classification.
3. The correlation analysis reveals that during past weeks, ILI activity has steadily increased with an almost exponential pattern since Week48, 2023 (6.8% positivity for respiratory specimens) and Week50, 2023 (12.8% positivity). Such patterns often persist during the peak season period, supporting the expectation of elevated occurrences by Week3, 2024.
4. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including Influenza (predominantly A(H1N1)), RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, has compounded the burden of respiratory illnesses nationwide and reflects high ILI activity (Week46 #9, Week47 #9, Week50 #8).
5. Vaccination rates remain below optimal targets, as CDC continues urging vaccinations despite rising flu activity and vaccine availability (Week47 #7, Week48 #8, Week50 #9). Suboptimal coverage is expected to prolong elevated ILI rates during the ongoing peak season.
6. Outpatient respiratory illness visits consistently exceed baseline, climbing to 5.1% in Week50, 2023 (Week46 #3, Week48 #3, Week50 #3). This surge in healthcare visits signals worsening community transmission, correlating with continued high levels of ILI occurrences into Week3, 2024, as no signs of plateauing are evident.
7. The forecast of 19663 ILI occurrences in Week3, 2024 is justified by the ongoing upward trend in ILI cases, classification within the peak season, persistent co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, limited vaccination uptake, and sustained elevated outpatient illness visits. All factors suggest significant activity is likely to continue through the short-term future.
