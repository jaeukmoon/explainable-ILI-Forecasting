1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a generally increasing trend, with values of ['1540', '1679', '1721', '1815', '1785']. The data showed a rise from 1540 (Week 38, 2021) to a peak of 1815 (Week 41, 2021) before a slight dip to 1785 in Week 42, 2021. This pattern indicates an overall escalation in ILI activity, albeit with minor fluctuations toward the end of the observed period.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the upward trajectory seen in the time-series data during Weeks 38–41, 2021, aligns with the rise to 1855 future occurrences by Week 47, 2021. The steady increase during the early weeks serves as an indicator of sustained and slightly intensified respiratory illness activity, mirrored in the future occurrence.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained steady or declined slightly, with percentages of ILI visits at 1.9% in Weeks 38–40, 2021, dropping to 1.8% in Weeks 41–42, 2021, all below the national baseline. However, healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic likely understated actual trends, indirectly contributing to lagged recognition of ILI activity, which became apparent in the future rise to 1855 occurrences.

4. The consistently high percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) across Weeks 38–42, 2021, significantly exceeded epidemic thresholds, decreasing from 20.9% in Week 38 to 16.5% in Week 42. This persistent elevation, primarily driven by COVID-19, reflects heightened respiratory illness activity that may parallel and contribute to increasing ILI cases.

5. Minimal influenza virus circulation was noted, with rates of positive specimens at 0.1% and no significant increases across Weeks 38–42, 2021. However, rising ILI occurrences alongside low influenza positivity suggests contributions from non-specific respiratory illnesses or concurrent pathogens, such as RSV or non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, likely amplifying overall ILI reporting.

6. Shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors, as highlighted in the CDC reports for all weeks, complicated ILI surveillance interpretation. These disruptions likely masked respiratory illness trends in outpatient settings, concentrating recorded cases and contributing to the elevated future occurrences of 1855 (Week 47, 2021).

7. In summary, the reported 1855 future ILI occurrences (Week 47, 2021) can be attributed to the observed upward trend in Weeks 38–41, 2021, persistent PIC mortality well above epidemic thresholds, subdued influenza activity overshadowed by non-influenza respiratory pathogens, and disrupted healthcare-seeking patterns due to the ongoing pandemic, culminating in delayed or aggregated ILI reporting.
