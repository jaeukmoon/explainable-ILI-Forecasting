1. The reported ILI occurrences for Week24 to Week28, 2023 are 1546, 1391, 1220, 1105, and 1075. This reveals a consistent decreasing trend over the five weeks, with a sharper drop from Week24 to Week26 (from 1546 to 1220) and a slower decline from Week27 to Week28 (1105 to 1075). This portrays a steady reduction in influenza-like illness activity, without significant fluctuations or spikes.
2. In the U.S., peak onset season generally begins around Week32 to Week35 and continues to Week46. With Week33, 2023 aligning with this timeline, and ILI activity indicators remaining low but stabilizing heading into this period, it is reasonable to classify Week33, 2023 as the peak onset season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the persistent decline in ILI counts suggests a stabilized pattern as the curve approaches a baseline. The consistent downward trajectory in the prior weeks, coupled with current stabilization, projects slower reduction or leveling in ILI counts leading into Week33, 2023. Forecasting from the observed data, future ILI counts after five weeks are estimated to be 1141, reflecting this pattern.
4. Several CDC-reported factors strongly impact this forecast: 1) Minimal influenza activity continues nationwide, with positivity rates consistently below 1.5% (Week24, 2023 #1; Week25, 2023 #1; Week28, 2023 #1). 2) Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 dominance and lack of novel influenza variant detections signal limited transmission or emergence of new, more infectious strains (Week26, 2023 #3; Week28, 2023 #3; Week27, 2023 #8). 3) Vaccination coverage remains unremarked, suggesting stagnant levels, which aligns with expectations of low infection rates during the off-season (Week24, 2023 #10; Week27, 2023 #9).
5. Overall, influenza activity continues to remain low, consistent with seasonal off-peak activity that transitions into the peak onset season around Week32 or Week35. This is supported by declining positivity rates, minor vaccination changes, and a lack of concerning novel influenza variants. Despite co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., COVID-19 and RSV), this stabilization further emphasizes the reasonably forecasted reduction to 1141 ILI cases in Week33, 2023.
