1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trajectory culminating in an upward trend, with values of ['2037', '2067', '1800', '1802', '2296']. While Weeks 40–42, 2021, exhibited minor fluctuations with relatively stable values ranging from 1800 to 2067, a significant increase occurred by Week 44, 2021, rising to 2296—the highest ILI count in the observed period. This pattern suggests a late-period escalation in ILI activity.
2. A strong positive correlation is noticeable between past and future ILI occurrences. The sharp rise in Week 44, 2021, from 1802 to 2296 aligns with the reported future increase to 4004 occurrences by Week 49, 2021. This sharp late-period upward trend likely acts as a precursor to the significant rise observed after 5 weeks.
3. ILI outpatient visits trended upwards, consistently increasing from 1.8% (Weeks 40–42, 2021) to 2.1% (Week 44, 2021). This steady growth highlights an accumulation of respiratory illness-associated healthcare visits, correlating with the rise in future ILI occurrences.
4. Regional influenza activity showed early signs of intensification, particularly with A(H3N2) dominating in localized outbreaks (e.g., Michigan), as reported by Week 44, 2021. The concentrated impact of such outbreaks in specific regions is a likely contributor to the rise in nationwide ILI activity in subsequent weeks.
5. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, and others) and the rising ILI burden among younger age groups (e.g., 5–24 years) as noted in Week 44, 2021, signal compound drivers for increased ILI occurrences. This is further supported by increasing influenza positivity rates across clinical labs (0.1% in Week 40, 2021, to 0.3% in Week 44, 2021).
6. Shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and overlapping viral trends likely impacted data collection and interpretation. These systemic factors may account for underestimated ILI activity during Weeks 40–44, 2021, but amplified reporting leading into the rise to 4004 in Week 49, 2021.
7. In summary, the reported 4004 future ILI occurrences (Week 49, 2021) can be attributed to the late-period increase in reported ILI cases (Weeks 43–44, 2021), steady growth in ILI-related outpatient visits, localized outbreaks of A(H3N2), compounded effects of respiratory virus co-circulation, and pandemic-driven variations in healthcare usage and data reporting practices.
