1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend with a general decline followed by a slight rebound, with values of ['1679', '1396', '1175', '1271', '1454']. The decrease from 1679 (Week50, 2020) to 1175 (Week52, 2020) was followed by a rebound to 1454 (Week1, 2021). This suggests that ILI occurrences saw a significant reduction initially, but displayed slight recovery towards the end of the 5-week period.
2. A positive correlation can be inferred between the downturn in past ILI occurrences and the lower future ILI activity of 990 after 5 weeks (Week6, 2021). The reduction from 1679 (Week50, 2020) to 1454 (Week1, 2021) aligns with the future ILI occurrences at 990, indicating a broader decline.
3. Persistent low levels of outpatient visits for ILI, remaining stable at 1.6%-1.7% across Week50, 2020 to Week1, 2021, and consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%, suggest sustained minimal respiratory illness activity contributing to the decline in future occurrences.
4. Minimal positivity rates for influenza (0.3%-0.1% across clinical labs from Week50, 2020 to Week53, 2020) and significantly reduced hospitalization rates (e.g., 129 cumulative influenza-associated hospitalizations as of Week1, 2021) reflect suppressed influenza circulation, corresponding to the observed lower ILI activity of 990.
5. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on healthcare-seeking behavior likely disrupted traditional ILI surveillance, leading to atypical seasonality and reduced ILI reporting in the future. Changes in circulation patterns, high PIC mortality dominated by COVID-19 (e.g., 17.2% in Week1, 2021), and continued low influenza prevalence collectively restrained ILI activity, aligning with the decline to 990.
6. In summary, the reported 990 future ILI occurrences (Week6, 2021) can be attributed to the reduction observed in past occurrences, stable and minimal outpatient ILI activity, suppressed influenza positivity and hospitalizations, and ongoing pandemic-driven surveillance and healthcare disruptions.
