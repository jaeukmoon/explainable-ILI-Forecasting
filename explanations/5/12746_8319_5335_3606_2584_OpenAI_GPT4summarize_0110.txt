1. The ILI counts from Week1 to Week5, 2022 show a notable declining trend: 12746, 8319, 5335, 3606, and 2584. Over the five weeks, ILI occurrences exhibit a sharp and consistent decrease, indicative of waning flu activity post-peak season. The lack of any significant spike or reversal during this period suggests a movement towards lower prevalence.
2. Forecasting that Week10, 2022 belongs to the off-season aligns with flu trends. This period historically follows peak season (ending around Week6 annually) and precedes the next peak onset season. The declining activity from Week1 to Week5, 2022 and sporadic influenza reports further confirm this off-season classification.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent week-over-week decline in ILI occurrences (from 12746 to 2584) highlights a diminishing flu burden. Projecting this trajectory forward suggests that the ILI count would stabilize around a low-value baseline within five additional weeks, resulting in the forecasted 2881 occurrences for Week10, 2022.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) remains the predominant virus, with negligible Influenza B presence across Weeks1-5, 2022. Though A(H3N2) circulates, its activity is declining (Week1-5, 2022 #1, #3). Lower levels of influenza positivity (1.7%-2.2% in clinical specimens across Weeks4-5, 2022) reinforce declining ILI activity levels.
5. Vaccination coverage remains lower compared to previous seasons (Week1-5, 2022 #8), which could impact flu trends. However, the combination of declining prevalence and effective antivirals being available (Week1-5, 2022 #9) mitigates the likelihood of any sudden surge.
6. Notably, co-circulating respiratory infections such as COVID-19 and RSV contribute to PIC deaths but minimally affect influenza burden (Weeks1-5, 2022 #6). Their impact remains stable, making a notable influenza resurgence unlikely during this forecast period.
7. In summary, the ILI forecast for Week10, 2022 at 2881 aligns with the observed sharp declining trend from Weeks1-5, 2022, the classification of Week10 as an off-season period, low influenza positivity, declining vaccination rates, and stable co-circulation of respiratory viruses. Together, these factors justify the projected ILI value.
