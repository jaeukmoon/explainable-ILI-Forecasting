1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a continuous and significant upward trend, with values ['13484', '14343', '15796', '18790', '21269']. Starting at 13484 (Week16, 2022), there was a consistent weekly increase that culminated in the highest value of 21269 in Week20, 2022. This steady rise in ILI cases indicates escalating respiratory illness activity during the 5-week period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the sharp and sustained increase observed in values during Weeks16–20, 2022, aligns with the reported decline to 15495 after 5 weeks (Week25, 2022). The consistent escalation in past weeks reflects a peak in ILI activity, with Week20 serving as the zenith, followed by a natural tapering back to Week25.
3. Increased outpatient visits for ILI, which grew modestly from 2.1% (Week16, 2022) to 2.4% (Week20, 2022), reflect a steady upward trend, suggesting heightened healthcare utilization for ILI cases. This increase is indicative of expanding respiratory illness activity, contributing to the observed future ILI level of 15495 in Week25, 2022.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed epidemic thresholds, rising from 6.8% (Week16, 2022) to 8.0% (Week20, 2022). While primarily linked to COVID-19, this indicates increased respiratory illness severity overall, which likely contributed to the sustained future ILI activity in Week25, 2022.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, as emphasized in Weeks18–20, 2022, particularly influenza A(H3N2) alongside SARS-CoV-2, represents a major contributor to elevated respiratory illness cases. This persistent dual burden may explain the high future ILI occurrences in Week25, 2022.
6. Late-season antigenic differences in circulating influenza A(H3N2) viruses, observed in Weeks18–20, 2022, reduced vaccine effectiveness and may have prolonged infection rates. This contributed to sustained respiratory illness activity, influencing the reported future ILI value in Week25, 2022.
7. In summary, the reported 15495 future ILI occurrences (Week25, 2022) stem from the substantial upward trend in ILI cases during Weeks16–20, 2022, heightened outpatient ILI visits, sustained PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, co-circulation of influenza A and SARS-CoV-2, and reduced vaccine effectiveness for influenza A(H3N2) late in the season.
