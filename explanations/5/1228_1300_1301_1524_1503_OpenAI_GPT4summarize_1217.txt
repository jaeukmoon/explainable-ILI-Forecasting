1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall upward trend, with values of ['1228', '1300', '1301', '1524', '1503']. There was a steady increase from 1228 (Week35, 2023) to 1524 (Week38, 2023), peaking at Week38, followed by a slight decline to 1503 in Week39. This trend signifies an escalating ILI burden primarily over the observed timeframe, with minimal variability toward the final week.
2. The trajectory observed in the latter weeks of the data (Week38 and Week39, 2023) correlates with the future surge to 2172 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week44, 2023). The pronounced increase during Week36-Week38 demonstrates an amplifying ILI activity, setting a basis for the elevated future ILI rate.
3. Influenza-related hospitalizations increased steadily from 509 in Week35 to 1040 in Week39, marking a near-doubling trend, indicative of heightened severity and healthcare burden. Outpatient visits for ILI also rose from 1.9% in Week35 to 2.1% in Week39, with the highest proportions among children aged 0-4 years consistently across weeks (7.2%–7.1%), signaling an expanding pool of clinical cases. The percentage of deaths attributable to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, rising from 9.6% (Week35) to 7.3% (Week39) at sustained elevated levels, reflecting widespread respiratory illness activity that parallels the impending increase in ILI cases. Additionally, the recurrence of co-circulation of respiratory viruses (SARS-CoV-2, RSV, influenza) documented across all weeks likely enhanced the burden and clinical recognition of non-specific ILI cases, fueling the observed future rise.
4. In summary, the notable future increase in ILI occurrences to 2172 (Week44, 2023) is underpinned by the steady growth in the past time-series data, increasing hospitalizations and outpatient ILI visits, persistently high PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and exacerbating contributions from co-circulating respiratory pathogens during Weeks35-39.
