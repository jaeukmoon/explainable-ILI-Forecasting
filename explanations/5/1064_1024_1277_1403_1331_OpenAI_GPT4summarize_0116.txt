1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences in the past 5 weeks (from Week43, 2023 to Week47, 2023) exhibit an increasing trend. Starting from 1064 in Week43, the occurrence initially dipped slightly to 1024 in Week44, but then increased steadily over the next weeks to 1277 in Week45, 1403 in Week46, and 1331 in Week47. This upward trend, with a slight fluctuation in Week47, suggests an escalating flu season characteristic of winter months in the U.S. The percentage increase per week over the last two data points has been approximately (1403 - 1277)/1277 ~ 9.89% from Week45 to Week46 and ~(1331 - 1403)/1403 ~ -5.13% from Week46 to Week47, showing some weekly variability.
2. The target week, Week52, 2023, falls within the "Peak season." Based on the background knowledge, the Peak season in the U.S. generally occurs between Week46 and Week6 due to widespread transmission and elevated infection rates. This aligns with the observed increasing flu activity in the CDC reports for the preceding weeks (Week43 to Week47), where flu positivity rates, outpatient ILI visits, and hospitalization data consistently point to a high-intensity flu season.
3. Using a time-series forecasting model, historical patterns suggest a continuation of increasing ILI occurrences. Incorporating a steady upward adjustment reflective of recent changes, we apply an approximate compounded weekly growth rate of ~7.92% calculated for Weeks45 to Week46 by averaging the percent increases (9.89% decrease and -5.13
