1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks indicated a consistent and notable downward trend, starting from 11270 (Week23, 2024) and decreasing continuously to 7806 (Week27, 2024). This decline reflects a steady reduction in influenza activity throughout this period, indicative of potentially decreased transmission and healthcare visits for ILI cases.
2. A significant negative correlation between past time-series ILI occurrences and future ILI occurrences is observed. The marked decrease in ILI cases from Week23 to Week27, 2024, contrasts with the reported future occurrence of 7091, which is slightly above the last recorded value of 7806 in Week27, 2024. This stabilization indicates that the steep decline has plateaued, suggesting a potential baseline level or slight resurgence.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed consistently low levels below baseline nationally, declining from 1.7% in Week23, 2024, to 1.4% in Week27, 2024. This stable or slightly declining outpatient activity aligns with reduced ILI occurrences, although co-circulation of other respiratory viruses may contribute to residual activity in later weeks.
4. Hospitalization rates for influenza remained very low over the past 5 weeks, with values fluctuating between 0.1 and 0.2 per 100,000 population. The low hospitalization rates suggest minimal severe influenza activity, supporting the overall decrease in ILI cases, yet co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses could sustain milder ILI cases contributing to the future value.
5. Antigenic consistency of circulating influenza strains with vaccine strains, alongside minimal antiviral resistance, indicates effective management and controlled influenza spread. However, the presence of co-circulating pathogens like RSV and SARS-CoV-2, coupled with novel virus detections such as A(H5N1) in Week26, 2024, may lead to sustained non-influenza respiratory illnesses, partially influencing the 7091 future occurrences.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 7091 (Week32, 2024) is primarily explained by the slowdown in the decline of past ILI trends, stable yet low outpatient ILI visits, and minimal severe influenza activity as reflected in low hospitalization rates. Contributions from co-circulating respiratory viruses and retained baseline activity further explain the observed value.
