1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a generally stable but fluctuating trend, with values of ['1929', '2198', '2162', '2237', '2197']. There was an increase from 1929 (Week 23, 2021) to 2198 (Week 24, 2021), followed by a slight dip to 2162 (Week 25, 2021). The subsequent weeks displayed a modest recovery, peaking at 2237 (Week 26, 2021) and leveling off at 2197 (Week 27, 2021). This pattern depicts modest volatility but an overall stabilization in ILI occurrences during the observed interval.
2. A correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the relatively stable and slightly fluctuating trend in the past weeks (Weeks 23–27, 2021) prefaced the rise to 3168 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 32, 2021). The maintained levels of ILI activity in the past likely served as a baseline from which the subsequent surge occurred.
3. The percentage of outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained low, ranging from 1.2% (Week 23, 2021) to a slight increase at 1.3% (Week 27, 2021), staying below the national baseline of 2.6%. The gradual increase in outpatient ILI visits might reflect rising respiratory illness trends, aligning with the future spike in ILI cases. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) mortality percentages consistently stayed above epidemic thresholds (e.g., 7.6% in Week 23, 2021, to 6.5% in Week 27, 2021), with COVID-19 identified as the primary driver. This heightened PIC mortality indicates a sustained burden of respiratory diseases that likely contributed to increased ILI occurrences. Limited influenza circulation was confirmed through low positivity rates for tested specimens (e.g., 0.1% across Weeks 24–27, 2021), indicating that observed ILI activity might derive from other non-specific or co-circulating respiratory pathogens influencing the data. Alternative care-seeking behaviors, particularly those induced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, continued to disrupt traditional reporting structures (Weeks 23–27, 2021), complicating data interpretation and possibly masking or delaying recognition of rising ILI activity leading to the reported surge.
4. Overall, the future occurrence of 3168 ILI cases (Week 32, 2021) can be explained by the relatively stable ILI trend in Weeks 23–27, 2021, the uptick in outpatient visits for ILI, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds with a dominant COVID-19 influence, ongoing pandemic-driven changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors, and the likely contribution of non-specific respiratory illnesses or alternative etiologies affecting the ILI data.
