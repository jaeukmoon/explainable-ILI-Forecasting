1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['12486', '12895', '11591', '11037', '10736']. After peaking at 12895 in Week 2, 2024, the occurrences decreased steadily over the next three weeks, reaching 10736 in Week 5, 2024, indicating a declining trajectory during this period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, with the sustained decrease observed in Weeks 3–5, 2024, aligning with the drop to 8352 future occurrences by Week 10, 2024. This downward pattern in the previous trend likely signals an ongoing reduction in flu activity over the subsequent weeks.
3. The decrease in the percentage of positive respiratory specimens from 15.8% in Week 5, 2024, to 13.9% in Week 9, 2024, corresponds with reduced ILI activity, as fewer cases contribute to overall illness trends. Simultaneously, outpatient visits for ILI, though above baseline, decreased from 4.5% in Week 7, 2024, to 4.1% in Week 9, 2024, reflecting declining medical encounters for flu-like symptoms. Additionally, flu hospitalizations in Week 9, 2024, showed a declining trend compared to earlier weeks, with cumulative rates stabilizing relative to prior peaks.
4. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2, reported consistently throughout Weeks 5–9, 2024, potentially influenced ILI cases, complicating trends but aligning with decreasing influenza contributions. Regions with previously elevated Influenza B activity (e.g., regions 5 and 7) showed stabilization or declines in positivity rates, reducing the overall ILI burden nationally.
5. In summary, the reported 8352 future ILI occurrences (Week 10, 2024) can be attributed to the steady decline observed in the past time-series data, lower positive flu test percentages, reduced outpatient visits, stabilizing hospitalization trends, and the diminishing impact of Influenza A and B activity amid co-circulating respiratory viruses.
