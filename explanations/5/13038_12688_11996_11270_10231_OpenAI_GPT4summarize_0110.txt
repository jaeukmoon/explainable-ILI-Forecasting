1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week20 to Week24, 2024, are 13038, 12688, 11996, 11270, and 10231. Over this period, the ILI trend demonstrates a consistent decline with no sharp surges or plateauing, indicating waning community transmission and a steady reduction in respiratory illness visits.
2. Forecasting identifies that Week29, 2024, aligns with the off-season in the U.S., as it falls within the typical timeframe of reduced ILI activity after the peak season (Week6–Week30). Additionally, the consistently low influenza positivity rates and reduced outpatient visits in Weeks20–Week24, 2024, confirm alignment with off-season activity.
3. Correlation analysis suggests that the declining trend visible in past weeks supports the projection of decreased ILI occurrences. The continuous drop in ILI cases (from 13038 in Week20, 2024, down to 10231 in Week24, 2024) implies a predictive trajectory where baseline levels of ILI occurrences will stabilize further over five weeks, resulting in the projected 7586 cases in Week29, 2024. This aligns with the historical tendency for ILI activity to exhibit lower occurrences during the off-season.
4. Outpatient respiratory illness activity remains well below baseline levels across all regions, declining from 2.0% in Week20 to 1.6% in Week24, reflecting minimal ILI activity nationwide (Week20, 2024 #3; Week21, 2024 #5; Week24, 2024 #4). This low activity directly contributes to the forecasting of reduced ILI occurrences.
5. Despite co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, their contribution to ILI trends remains stable or declining (Week20, 2024 #10; Week22, 2024 #10; Week24, 2024 #9), which supports the continued reduction in ILI cases.
6. Vaccination coverage appears adequate to mitigate influenza spread, with circulating strains matching vaccine components (Week21, 2024 #10; Week22, 2024 #13; Week24, 2024 #8). The absence of significant vaccine resistance or novel influenza viruses further supports a forecast of decreased ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the time-series decline in ILI occurrences, the off-season classification of Week29, 2024, and contributory CDC report insights — including decreasing outpatient visit trends, stable co-circulating respiratory viruses, and effective vaccination impact — collectively justify the projected drop to 7586 cases in Week29, 2024.
