1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the observed 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating yet slightly decreasing trend with values ['11077', '9910', '9946', '10087', '9782']. The initial decline from 11077 (Week 23, 2024) to 9910 (Week 24, 2024) was followed by slight variations, eventually reaching the lowest value of 9782 in Week 27, 2024. This indicates a stabilization at lower levels by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A moderate positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is discernible, as the stabilization and slight variations in the latter weeks of the past data (Weeks 26–27, 2024) align with the reported increase to 11143 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 32, 2024). The rebound from the lowest value in Week 27 serves as a prelude to the higher future value seen after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness declined slightly from 1.7% (Week 23, 2024) to 1.4% (Week 27, 2024), remaining below baseline levels. Despite the low percentages, this stabilization at minimal activity may reflect contributions to the moderate future rise in ILI occurrences.
4. The co-circulation of influenza viruses (e.g., A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and B/Victoria) alongside RSV and SARS-CoV-2, along with low antiviral resistance, maintained the potential for respiratory illness activity. This co-circulation was documented consistently across Weeks 23–27, 2024, and could contribute to the observed increase in future ILI occurrences by Week 32, 2024.
5. Public health surveillance emphasized continued vaccination recommendations, although no substantial increases in vaccination uptake were detected (Weeks 23–27, 2024). This limited uptake, combined with ongoing virus co-circulation, may have sustained respiratory illness levels, culminating in the reported rise to 11143 occurrences after 5 weeks.
6. In summary, the reported 11143 future ILI occurrences (Week 32, 2024) can be attributed to the stabilization of ILI activity in Weeks 26–27, 2024, declines in outpatient respiratory illness visits, co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses with low resistance, and modest vaccination participation impacting overall trends.
