1. The reported ILI counts from Week53, 2020 to Week4, 2021 are 1451, 1475, 1259, 1042, and 883, respectively. This reveals a downward trend, with ILI occurrences steadily declining week-to-week from Week53, 2020 through Week4, 2021. The most substantial decrease occurred from Week1, 2021 to Week4, 2021 (from 1475 to 883), indicating significantly reduced influenza activity. The overall trend demonstrates persistently diminishing occurrences rather than any spikes or fluctuations.
2. In the U.S., the peak season generally spans from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the following year, and off-season starts after. Since Week9, 2021 is three weeks after the typical peak season, and ILI activity remains far below baseline levels in recent weeks (e.g., 1.1% outpatient ILI visits in Week4, 2021, compared to the national baseline of 2.6%), it indicates that Week9, 2021 belongs to the off-season.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the ongoing sharp decline in ILI occurrences observed over the past five weeks suggests that the downward trend will likely stabilize at a much lower level within five weeks. Thus, the forecast for Week9, 2021 suggests a continuation of reduced ILI activity, projecting forward from the historically low baseline of Week4, 2021. This aligns with a relatively minimal projected occurrence of 641.
4. Influenza positivity rates in clinical labs remain exceptionally low, ranging from just 0.1% to 0.4% over the past five weeks. These rates are far below seasonal expectations and have not shown signs of increase (Week53, 2020 #1; Week1, 2021 #1; Week4, 2021 #1).
5. Healthcare utilization patterns and ILI surveillance are heavily influenced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, suppressing ILI activity and complicating data interpretation. Outpatient respiratory visits have declined across most jurisdictions (Week53, 2020 #9; Week2, 2021 #9; Week4, 2021 #8).
6. Prolonged low cumulative hospitalization rates, with only 0.5 per 100,000 reported by Week4, 2021, reflect notably minimal severity of influenza during the season. This trend aligns with reduced community transmission of influenza, further supporting the expectation of low ILI occurrences (Week3, 2021 #5; Week4, 2021 #4).
7. The forecast of 641 ILI occurrences for Week9, 2021 is strongly justified by the steep decline observed in past ILI activity, the off-season timing, overwhelming evidence of suppressed influenza transmission (e.g., low lab-positivity rates, ILI visits, and hospitalizations), and the compounded effects of COVID-19 minimizing ILI spread. These factors collectively underline the rationale for projecting minimal ILI activity.
