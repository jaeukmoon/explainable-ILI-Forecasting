1. The reported ILI counts from Week32 to Week36, 2021 are 1022, 1222, 1601, 1783, and 1687. The trend shows a marked increase from Week32 (1022) to Week35 (1783), followed by a slight decline in Week36 (1687). This progression reflects a rising trend with a minor dip towards the end of the series, highlighting increased respiratory illness activity over this period.
2. Forecasting that Week41, 2021 belongs to the peak onset season aligns with this observed upward trend. Historically, the peak onset season typically spans from Week32 to Week46, and the increasing ILI activity within this time frame supports this classification.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the recent upward trend in ILI occurrences suggests that counts will continue to rise gradually, though not at the same steep rate as seen in Weeks32–35, before potentially stabilizing or slightly peaking. By extrapolating this pattern five weeks forward to Week41, 2021, the model predicts an ILI occurrence of 1815.
4. Minimal influenza activity is indicated nationally, with clinical labs reporting low positivity rates for influenza (e.g., 0.1% in Week34 and Week36, 2021). However, the presence of non-influenza viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, continues to drive respiratory illness trends (Week32, 2021 #3; Week34, 2021 #4; Week36, 2021 #2).
5. Healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly influence ILI surveillance. Changes in broader respiratory illness patterns and increased outpatient visits for ILI across multiple age groups have been emphasized in reports (Week32, 2021 #8; Week34, 2021 #9; Week36, 2021 #9).
6. Despite the low influenza positivity, expectations from CDC indicate potential future shifts in flu activity due to parallel circulation of other respiratory viruses. Combined with atypical trends affecting respiratory diseases post-pandemic, the slight increase in ILI counts reflects this dynamic (Week32, 2021 #9; Week33, 2021 #10; Week36, 2021 #10).
7. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrence of 1815 by Week41, 2021 is supported by an overall rising trend in past weeks, classification of the target week within the peak onset season, and the influence of multiple respiratory viruses and changes in healthcare-seeking behavior during the pandemic. This projection reflects continued moderate growth in ILI activity without sharp surges, consistent with historical and current trends.
