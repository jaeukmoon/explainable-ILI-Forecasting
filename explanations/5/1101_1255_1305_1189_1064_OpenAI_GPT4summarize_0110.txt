1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week34 to Week38, 2021 are 1101, 1255, 1305, 1189, and 1064. The data indicates an initial increase from Week34 (1101) through Week36 (1305), followed by a decline in Week37 (1189) and Week38 (1064). This reflects a fluctuating scenario with peaks and subsequent decreases, suggesting no consistent upward or downward trend but rather a marginal oscillatory behavior.
2. Week43, 2021 occurs during the peak onset season, as it falls between Week32 and Week46, a transitional phase leading up to the influenza peak window. Although influenza activity remains low nationwide, this period aligns with historical patterns of increasing flu activity prior to the full peak season.
3. The fluctuating pattern from past ILI occurrences suggests a projected decrease, supported by the downward trend observed in Week37 and Week38. Extrapolating from historical data, the anticipated future value of 1008 aligns with a continuation of this decline, likely influenced by minimal influenza transmission and predominance of non-influenza respiratory illnesses.
4. Influenza virus circulation remains low during this period, with positivity rates consistently around 0.1%, implying limited influenza transmission (Week34, 2021 #1; Week36, 2021 #3; Week38, 2021 #2).
5. Variations in healthcare-seeking behaviors and concurrent respiratory illnesses like COVID-19 dominate the reported PIC-related deaths, affecting ILI visit patterns and complicating traditional trend analysis (Week34, 2021 #8; Week37, 2021 #9; Week38, 2021 #9).
6. Nationwide ILI visits have remained below the baseline of 2.6%, with little change in overall activity, pointing to declining influenza trends consistent with low transmission (Week34, 2021 #2; Week36, 2021 #1; Week38, 2021 #1).
7. Considering the observed trend of declining occurrences, the off-peak nature of Week43, 2021 within the peak onset season, low flu activity with predominance of other respiratory illnesses, and stable ILI visits below baseline, the projection of 1008 ILI occurrences is justified.
