1. The reported ILI counts from Week16 to Week20, 2024 are 1972, 1835, 1887, 1769, and 1635. These numbers demonstrate a clear declining trend in ILI occurrences over the five weeks, with a decrease of 337 cases (1972 to 1635). Notably, no significant spikes or irregular fluctuations were observed during this period, signifying a consistent downward trajectory.
2. Based on historical season classifications and the fact that ILI activity remains below baseline levels consistently over these weeks (Week16, 2024 #3; Week17, 2024 #5; Week18, 2024 #3; Week19, 2024 #4; Week20, 2024 #3), Week25, 2024 falls within the off-season. This matches typical patterns of low ILI activity during such periods.
3. From the time-series forecasting perspective, the progressive declines observed over Weeks16–20, 2024 suggest continuity in reduced ILI counts. With no indicators of a drastic shift in trajectory and the ongoing off-season trends, the model projects further reductions, leading to an anticipated lower count of 879 occurrences in Week25, 2024.
4. Nationwide influenza activity has been continually decreasing (Week16, 2024 #1; Week17, 2024 #1; Week18, 2024 #1; Week19, 2024 #1; Week20, 2024 #1), with percentages of positive influenza tests steadily declining (Week16, 2024 #1; Week17, 2024 #1; Week18, 2024 #1; Week19, 2024 #1; Week20, 2024 #1). This provides strong evidence for consistently declining ILI activity in the subsequent weeks.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, persists (Week16, 2024 #10; Week17, 2024 #7; Week18, 2024 #10; Week19, 2024 #9; Week20, 2024 #10). However, their contribution does not indicate a resurgence in influenza or ILI-specific illnesses, as all regions remain below baseline (Week16, 2024 #3; Week17, 2024 #5; Week18, 2024 #9; Week19, 2024 #4; Week20, 2024 #3).
6. Death and hospitalization rates due to influenza continue to decline (Week16, 2024 #5; Week17, 2024 #4; Week18, 2024 #6; Week19, 2024 #7; Week20, 2024 #6). The cumulative hospitalization rate grew minimally from Week16 to Week20 (79.0 to 80.6 per 100,000), and influenza-attributed deaths dropped to 0.1% by Week20 (Week20, 2024 #6). These trends confirm decreased severity and prevalence of influenza.
7. Given the consistent decline in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks, the ongoing off-season classification for Week25, 2024, the lack of novel influenza virus activity (Week16, 2024 #8; Week20, 2024 #7), and stable co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, the forecasted ILI count of 879 aligns with the projected continuation of reduced influenza activity.
