1. The reported ILI counts from Week41 to Week45, 2021 are 1815, 1785, 1829, 2107, and 2109. The trend indicates a steady and mild increase from Week41 to Week45, most prominent between Week43 (1829) and Week44 (2107), with ILI occurrences stabilizing near Week45 levels (2109). This pattern suggests a gradual escalation in ILI activity entering the forecast period.
2. Week50, 2021 falls within the typical peak season in the U.S., which generally spans from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the next. With signs of increasing activity (Week44-Week45 #1, #2; Week45 #1, #4) and alignment with seasonal expectations, it is forecasted that Week50, 2021 belongs to the peak season.
3. From the time-series perspective, the moderate rise from Week41 to Week45 and stabilization thereafter supports the projection of a continued gradual increase. Considering the past trend and seasonal dynamics, the five-week lead period (Week46 to Week50) may result in heightened but not extreme activity, aligning with the predicted value of 2313 occurrences in Week50, 2021.
4. Surveillance reports indicate a steady increase in positivity rates, from 0.1% in Week41 to 0.7% in Week45 (Week41 #1; Week45 #1), reflecting growing transmission intensity, especially of Influenza A(H3N2).
5. Localized outbreaks, particularly among individuals aged 5–24, contribute significantly to the rise in Influenza A(H3N2) cases (Week44 #5; Week45 #3). Concentrated outbreaks often amplify broader ILI activity in short-term trajectories.
6. Healthcare-seeking behavior remains influenced by co-circulating respiratory viruses and the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, complicating data but suggesting an undercurrent of increased illness visits (Week41 #10; Week43 #10; Week45 #10). Despite complexities, reports project expanding flu activity in the coming weeks (Week43 #10).
7. Aligning the time-series trends, the onset of peak season within Week50, and CDC-reported factors like increasing positivity rates, outbreak-driven activity, and mounting ILI visit percentages, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 2313 appears consistent and justified.
