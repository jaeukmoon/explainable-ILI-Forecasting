1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week36 to Week40, 2023 are 1076, 1184, 1196, 1289, and 1500. Over this period, the data reflects a consistent upward trend, with notable increases toward the later weeks, especially between Week39 (1289) to Week40 (1500), suggesting a progression toward higher ILI activity. This indicates a sustained rise rather than fluctuation or stabilization.
2. In the U.S., the peak onset season typically spans from Week35 to Week46 of the year. The sustained increase in case numbers, aligned with the rising ILI trends in both clinical (Week39, 2023 #3; Week40, 2023 #3) and surveillance data, strongly positions the target week (Week45, 2023) within the peak onset season just before transition into the peak influenza season.
3. Extrapolating from the consistent rise in past occurrences, which averaged an increase of ~106 cases per week from Week36 to Week40, 2023, the data supports a steady upward trajectory influenced by gradual flu activity buildup. Based on this sustained upward trend, the forecast of 1472 ILI occurrences in Week45, 2023, is in line with a moderate continuation of prior increases.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses including influenza, RSV, and COVID-19 has influenced rising ILI activity (Week36, 2023 #9; Week38, 2023 #8; Week40, 2023 #6). This persistent co-circulation significantly elevates ILI figures and increases the likelihood of transmission.
5. The proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza increased steadily from 0.7% in Week36 to 1.1% in Week40 (Week36, 2023 #1; Week40, 2023 #1). This growing positivity rate reflects escalating influenza circulation, amplifying the upward trend in ILI cases over time.
6. Although vaccination rates remain insufficiently detailed, CDC strongly recommends increased adoption by late October to mitigate rising activity (Week37, 2023 #8; Week40, 2023 #7). Modest vaccine uptake during peak onset season could limit the decline in ILI spread, contributing to continued activity until Week45.
7. In summary, the consistent rise in ILI occurrences, the alignment with the peak onset season, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and increasing influenza test positivity collectively underpin the forecast of 1472 ILI occurrences in Week45, 2023. This prediction reflects sustained upward trends and aligns with projected seasonal progression.
