1. The reported ILI counts from Week6 to Week10, 2021 showed a slight fluctuation: a decrease from Week6 (1689) to Week7 (1481), a small increase to Week8 (1519), a stable level in Week9 (1517), and a moderate rise in Week10 (1585). This pattern illustrates small variations with no sharp increase or consistent downward trend, indicating a relatively stable ILI occurrence.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans Week46 to Week6 of the following year. Since Week15, 2021 occurs in mid-April, well past the usual peak activity window, and considering ongoing low influenza positivity rates alongside minimal ILI activity reported (Week6, 2021 #1; Week7, 2021 #1; Week8, 2021 #1), this aligns with the off-season period. Thus, Week15, 2021 is categorized as off-season.
3. The observed fluctuations in ILI occurrences during the prior weeks suggest a generally stable trajectory. Using time-series projection, given the gradual week-to-week changes in ILI rates, a small increase from Week10 to Week15, 2021 is expected due to historical off-season patterns indicating minor rises. Therefore, the 2066 ILI occurrence in Week15, 2021 aligns with these observations.
4. Influenza positivity rates for respiratory specimens remained at a very low level of 0.1% across Week6 to Week10, 2021, with no significant increase reported (Week6, 2021 #1; Week7, 2021 #1; Week8, 2021 #1; Week9, 2021 #1; Week10, 2021 #1). This indicates limited ILI activity nationwide.
5. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza remained markedly low (0.6–0.7 per 100,000) during this period, further confirming minimal flu burden (Week6, 2021 #5; Week7, 2021 #5; Week8, 2021 #6; Week9, 2021 #7; Week10, 2021 #6). This suggests limited severe cases, correlating with reduced community ILI spread.
6. Behavioral changes driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, altering healthcare-seeking patterns and ILI surveillance systems, have influenced the reporting of ILI trends (Week6, 2021 #9; Week7, 2021 #9; Week8, 2021 #10; Week9, 2021 #10; Week10, 2021 #8). While this complicates precise estimation, the continued low influenza presence minimizes significant upward activity.
7. The forecast of 2066 ILI occurrences in Week15, 2021 reflects the slight upward trend observed in Week10, 2021 (1585) combined with ongoing off-season patterns of minor activity. Continuous minimal positivity, low hospitalizations, COVID-19-related disruptions, and stable ILI patterns substantiate this prediction, aligning with historical off-season expectations.
