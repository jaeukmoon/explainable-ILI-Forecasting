1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating trend, with values of ['1124', '1063', '969', '1008', '1084']. The downward shift from 1124 (Week 40, 2021) to 969 (Week 42, 2021) was followed by a slight recovery to 1084 in Week 44, 2021, suggesting a modestly increasing momentum toward the end of the 5-week period.
2. A moderate positive correlation is evident between past and future occurrences. Despite the fluctuations in Weeks 40 to 44, 2021, the gradual rise in Weeks 43 and 44 aligns with the reported increase to 1772 after 5 weeks (Week 49, 2021). The upward shift toward the latter weeks likely signaled forthcoming growth in ILI activities.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased slightly during this period, rising from 1.8% (Week 41, 2021) to 2.1% (Week 44, 2021). Coupled with regional variations where certain regions exceeded baseline thresholds, this steady growth in patient activity correlates with the future rise in ILI occurrences.
4. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) deaths consistently remained above the epidemic threshold throughout the observed period, with values dropping from 18.0% (Week 40, 2021) to 14.1% (Week 44, 2021). Despite the decline, the persistently high PIC mortality highlights ongoing respiratory illness activity, contributing to the anticipated increase in ILI cases.
5. Increasing detections of Influenza A(H3N2), particularly in localized outbreaks (e.g., Michigan), and surging positive test rates in clinical and public health labs (e.g., 0.3% positivity by Week 44, 2021) signify a potential escalation in influenza activity. This emerging activity aligns with the observed jump in future occurrences.
6. Variability in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to COVID-19 disruptions, alongside regional discrepancies in data reporting and respiratory virus co-circulation (including non-influenza pathogens), further complicates ILI data interpretation and contributes to delayed recognition and clustering of ILI cases, explaining the heightened rise to 1772 after 5 weeks.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1772 (Week 49, 2021) can be attributed to the moderate upward trend in Weeks 43–44, 2021, increasing outpatient ILI visits, high but declining PIC mortality, seasonal Influenza A(H3N2) outbreaks, and the compounding effects of COVID-19-driven reporting and data complexities.
