1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating pattern with a minor overall upward trend. Starting at 1644 (Week6, 2022), there was a decrease to 1401 (Week8, 2022), followed by a recovery to 1593 (Week10, 2022). This fluctuation, with a slight net increase by the end, indicates gradual but inconsistent growth in reported ILI activity.
2. The future occurrence of 2104 is positively correlated with the observed pattern in the past 5 weeks of the time-series data. Specifically, the recovery from 1401 (Week8, 2022) to 1593 (Week10, 2022) reflects a resurgence in cases, which aligns with the increase to 2104 occurrences noted after 5 weeks, suggesting a continued trajectory of rising ILI activity.
3. Laboratory positivity rates for Influenza A steadily rose across Weeks 6–10, 2022, from 3.0% to 6.8%, indicating expanding viral circulation that likely contributed to increased future ILI cases.
4. Hospitalization rates consistently rose over the 5-week period, from 4.7 per 100,000 (Week6, 2022) to 5.9 per 100,000 (Week10, 2022), reflecting a growing burden of severe respiratory diseases corresponding to ILI trends.
5. The dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) with antigenic differences not fully aligned to vaccine strains, reported across Weeks 6–10, 2022, likely reduced vaccine efficacy, driving an increase in future cases.
6. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), compounded by low vaccination uptake rates, worsened overall respiratory health outcomes and fueled the observed future ILI spike to 2104 occurrences (Week15, 2022).
7. In summary, the reported 2104 future ILI occurrences (Week15, 2022) resulted from the gradual increase in ILI activity in Weeks 6–10, 2022, rising influenza positivity and hospitalization rates, antigenic mismatches in dominant strains, and co-circulating respiratory pathogens compounding flu season severity.
