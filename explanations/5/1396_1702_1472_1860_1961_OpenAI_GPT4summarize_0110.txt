1. The ILI counts from Week43 to Week47, 2023 are 1396, 1702, 1472, 1860, and 1961. The data reveals a gradual rise in activity, with a sharp increase spanning Week44 (1702) to Week47 (1961) after minor fluctuations in earlier weeks. This pattern suggests a steady upward trend toward heightened ILI activity as the influenza season intensifies.
2. Week52, 2023 falls within the peak season, spanning Week46 of one year through Week6 of the subsequent year. This classification aligns with observed elevated activity during Week46 and Week47, 2023, and the reported indicators from the CDC that suggest continued increases. Hence, Week52 belongs to the peak season.
3. A time-series forecasting model would correlate the steady rise in ILI counts from Week43 to Week47, 2023 with a progression into the peak season. The nearly consistent weekly increases in ILI occurrences and the CDC's anticipated rise in activity suggest a continuation of this pattern. Projecting this trend forward five weeks to Week52, 2023 results in the forecasted value of 4320.
4. The recent increase in influenza positivity rates supports the forecast. In Week43, 2023, only 1.9% of specimens tested positive. By Week47, 2023, positivity rose to 6.2%, with similar increases in outpatient visits for ILI, which rose from 2.7% in Week43 to 3.9% by Week47 (Week43, 2023 #3; Week47, 2023 #5). These data confirm that viral transmission is intensifying.
5. Rising hospitalization rates further validate the projected ILI occurrences. The cumulative flu-related hospitalization rate grew markedly from 0.8 per 100,000 in Week43, 2023 to 3.7 per 100,000 by Week47, 2023 (Week43, 2023 #4; Week47, 2023 #3). This trend reflects heightened severe cases consistent with increasing community spread.
6. CDC anticipates continued increases in flu activity, especially given the ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 (Week43, 2023 #7; Week44, 2023 #9; Week47, 2023 #9). These concurrent infections amplify ILI trends and contribute to the forecasted peak-season surge.
7. In summary, with ILI counts steadily increasing, Week52 belonging to the peak season, and supporting factors such as rising influenza positivity, hospitalization rates, and co-circulating viruses influencing the rapid escalation in cases, the forecasted future ILI occurrences of 4320 in Week52, 2023 is well-justified.
