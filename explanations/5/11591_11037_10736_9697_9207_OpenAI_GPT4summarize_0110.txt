1. The reported ILI counts from Week7 to Week11, 2024 are 11591, 11037, 10736, 9697, and 9207. This indicates a clear downward trend in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks, with weekly decreases in cases. The consistent decline reflects waning influenza activity, marking an end-phase of broader seasonal transmission rather than significant fluctuation or resurgence.
2. Week16, 2024 occurs during the off-season for influenza in the U.S., as it falls after the typical peak season (Week46 through Week6). The combination of declining ILI counts (Week7–Week11, 2024) and a reduction in positivity rates (Week11, 2024 #1) strongly suggests that Week16 aligns with off-season characteristics, associated with reduced influenza activity.
3. Time-series analysis from Week7 to Week11, 2024 demonstrates a steady decrease in ILI occurrences, depicting a highly predictable pattern of declining activity. Projecting this declining trend forward, the five-week forecast leading to Week16, 2024, logically projects a further reduction in ILI occurrences, arriving at a predicted value of 7093.
4. Influenza activity nationally has shown a steady reduction, with clinical positivity rates decreasing from 14.8% in Week7, 2024 to 12.0% in Week11, 2024 (Week7 #2; Week8 #1; Week11 #2). This aligns with the observed downward trend in ILI counts, reinforcing the expectation of reduced activity.
5. Regional influenza activity, while elevated in some areas earlier, has steadily decreased in most regions by Week11, 2024 (Week8 #1; Week11 #11). This broad-based decline supports the forecast of lower ILI occurrences in upcoming weeks.
6. Vaccination efforts have continued throughout the season, with vaccines matching circulating strains effectively, providing protection among remaining at-risk groups (Week7 #7; Week9 #8; Week11 #8). This helps mitigate broader community spread and supports the expected decrease in ILI occurrences moving forward.
7. Taking into consideration the ongoing reductions in national positivity rates, declining hospitalization and outpatient visits for ILI (Week9 #4; Week11 #6), effective vaccination coverage, and the clear seasonal transition into the off-season, the forecast for Week16, 2024, at 7093 ILI occurrences, is a reasonable projection consistent with observed trends.
