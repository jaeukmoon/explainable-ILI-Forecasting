1. The past 5 weeks' ILI occurrences (Week2 to Week6, 2024: 15014, 12554, 13044, 12486, 12895) demonstrate a general decline from Week2 (15014) to Week3 (12554) before slightly fluctuating around lower activity levels. This pattern indicates an overall decrease during the peak season, with slight week-to-week variation but no resurgence or significant upward trend.
2. Based on U.S. epidemiological patterns, Week11, 2024 occurs outside the typical peak season (Week46, 2023 to Week6, 2024) and marks the early stages of the off-season. This aligns with the observed declining trend and reduced, though still elevated, ILI activity near Week6, 2024.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the downward trend suggests ongoing reductions in ILI occurrences as the season transitions into the off-season. Assuming continuity in these historical patterns, the model projects a further decrease due to waning community transmission and a settling of influenza activity.
4. Elevated respiratory virus activity persists nationally, with regional variations (Week6, 2024 #1, #4, #9). However, influenza-related outpatient visits and positivity rates, while still above baseline (Week6, 2024 #4, #1), exhibit stable or declining trends, signaling weakening influenza spread.
5. Approximately 24 million flu illnesses and significant cumulative hospitalizations/deaths have occurred this season (Week6, 2024 #9), yet vaccination coverage continues, and antiviral effectiveness remains high (Week6, 2024 #7, #8). This trend, combined with the absence of novel variants, indicates no unusual surges driving future ILI increases.
6. The season's dominant subtype, Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, remains highly prevalent (Week6, 2024 #2, #3) but demonstrates stable co-circulation trends with Influenza B and other respiratory viruses. Such patterns align with sustained, though diminishing, ILI occurrence during the off-season.
7. In summary, the projected occurrence of 9207 for Week11, 2024 reflects the moving transition into the off-season, characterized by declining ILI trends, waning community transmission, ongoing vaccination/antiviral effectiveness, and stable respiratory virus co-circulation. This prediction aligns with both historical influenza seasonality and current epidemiological indicators.
