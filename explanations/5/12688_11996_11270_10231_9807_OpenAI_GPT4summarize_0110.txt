1. The reported ILI counts from Week21 to Week25, 2024 are 12688, 11996, 11270, 10231, and 9807. This data shows a consistent downward trend in ILI occurrences, with no significant spikes or fluctuations. The steady decline suggests a low transmission rate for this period, aligning with the typical off-season pattern.
2. Week30, 2024 falls in the off-season for ILI activity in the U.S., which generally spans from Week9 to Week30. CDC reports during Week21 to Week25, 2024 confirm low influenza activity nationally, consistent with off-season classification. Influenza positivity, hospitalization, and ILI visit rates have remained below baseline throughout this period.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent decline in ILI trends over the past five weeks indicates a pattern of waning activity that may stabilize near a lower baseline in the coming weeks. Extrapolating this trajectory to Week30, 2024, the model predicts ILI occurrences to continue decreasing, resulting in the forecasted value of 7285.
4. Nationwide, influenza positivity has decreased steadily from 1.7% (Week21, 2024) to 1.1% (Week25, 2024), reflecting a reduced prevalence of the virus. This decline correlates with lower ILI occurrences in subsequent weeks, supporting the projected value for Week30, 2024.
5. The prevalence of co-circulating viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, alongside influenza, remains stable during the forecast period. CDC reports highlight no novel variants or significant resistance trends (Week21 to Week25, 2024), reducing the likelihood of sudden spikes in ILI activity.
6. Vaccine effectiveness has remained high, with circulating influenza virus strains closely matching vaccine components. Low antiviral resistance during Week21 to Week25, 2024 also supports controlled influenza transmission, further reducing ILI occurrences.
7. The consistent decline in ILI counts, off-season timing of Week30, 2024, and supportive factors such as reduced influenza positivity, stable co-circulation trends, and high vaccine effectiveness, collectively justify the forecasted ILI occurrences of 7285.
