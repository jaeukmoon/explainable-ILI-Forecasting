1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1255', '1305', '1189', '1064', '975']. This decline began with 1305 in Week 36, 2021, decreasing to 1189 in Week 37, 2021, and further dropping to 975 by Week 39, 2021. This steady reduction indicates a notable decrease in ILI activity throughout the observed period.
2. Although the historical time-series showed an overall decreasing trend, the future ILI occurrences reported as 1084 suggest a partial rebound. The increase from the final recorded week (Week 39, 2021, with 975) to the future value of 1084 may reflect the influence of offsetting factors, particularly those unrelated to influenza circulation, as observed in Week 38 and Week 39 reports.
3. Non-influenza respiratory viruses were highlighted as a significant contributor to ILI activity, particularly in Weeks 36 and 37, 2021, reflecting increased regional ILI activity unrelated to influenza.
4. Persistent influence of COVID-19 on reported deaths and healthcare-seeking behavior throughout Weeks 35 to 39, 2021, impacted overall surveillance and could contribute indirectly to fluctuations in ILI occurrences, as seen with future data.
5. Variations in data accuracy due to changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and concurrent pandemic disruptions were consistently reported from Weeks 35 through 39, 2021. This likely compounded uncertainties in ILI surveillance and contributed to discrepancies between decreasing trends in historical data and the rebound in future ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 1084 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 44, 2021) can be attributed to the influence of non-influenza respiratory viruses, changes in healthcare-seeking behavior due to COVID-19, and the compounding effects of data surveillance challenges during the pandemic. These variables, combined with other respiratory illness contributions, help explain the divergence from the downward trajectory observed in the prior weeks.
