1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent and significant downward trend, with values of ['1734', '1617', '1448', '1246', '1098']. Starting at 1734 in Week19, 2023, the ILI occurrences decreased progressively each week, reaching 1098 by Week23, 2023. This consistent decline suggests a steady reduction in influenza-like activity over the observed period.
2. The consistent downward trend in past time-series ILI occurrences correlates with the substantial decline observed in future ILI occurrences to 698 after 5 weeks (Week28, 2023). The progressive decrease over time (Weeks19–23, 2023) serves as a strong indicator of the continuation of this declining trajectory, culminating in the lowest reported ILI occurrences in Week28, 2023.
3. Clinical positivity rates for influenza remained minimal across the 5-week period and declined further, from 1.0% in Week19, 2023, to 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.2%, 1.1%, and 1.0% in Week23, 2023, respectively. This low and stable influenza positivity directly aligns with lower respiratory illness activity contributing to reduced ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
4. The outpatient visits for ILI also declined steadily below the national baseline of 2.5%, from 1.9% (Week19, 2023) to 1.6% (Week23, 2023). The downward movement in clinic visits for ILI serves as another indicator of declining respiratory illness activity across time, consistent with the future drop to 698 occurrences.
5. The influence of co-circulating respiratory pathogens remained minimal in activity over the 5 weeks (Weeks19-23, 2023), with reports of stable and low SARS-CoV-2 activity and minimal RSV activity according to the CDC. This lack of significant contribution from other pathogens supports declining trends in ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 698 in Week28, 2023, are driven by the steady and substantial decline in past time-series ILI activity, consistently low influenza positivity rates, a gradual reduction in outpatient visits for ILI below the baseline, and the absence of notable co-circulating pathogens contributing to elevated ILI activity.
