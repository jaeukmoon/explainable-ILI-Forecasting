1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week40, 2020 to Week44, 2020 are 1610, 1911, 1730, 1793, and 2148. A trend of slight but steady increase is observed, with a notable rise between Week43 and Week44 (from 1793 to 2148). This pattern suggests an upward trajectory of ILI occurrences over the five weeks but remains within a relatively moderate range, not reflective of a sharp spike or surge.
2. Based on season classification, Week44, 2020 falls in the Peak onset season. Influenza activity during this time is expected to begin climbing from baseline levels toward higher transmission rates seen in the Peak season. The increase in ILI occurrences aligns well with the characteristics of this period of heightened activity preparation.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent upward trend in ILI counts over the past five weeks indicates continuing growth in activity. The trajectory suggests that moderate increases may persist through the subsequent weeks. Considering the relative stability in ILI drivers, the forecast indicates a gradual adjustment to 1734 occurrences by None, reflecting a slight decline or stabilization after this peak onset trend.
4. Virologic surveillance data from Week40 through Week44, 2020 show minimal influenza specimen positivity (0.21%, 0.3%, 0.3%, 0.2%, and 0.1%). Low positivity rates align with reduced virologic activity at this time (Week40-Week44, 2020 #1, #2), suggesting broader activity may remain constrained.
5. Consistently low outpatient visits for ILI remain below the national baseline (e.g., 1.1% to 1.3% across Week40-Week44, 2020), with slight increases observed. However, levels do not indicate any significant activity resurgence (Week40-Week44, 2020 #4).
6. Reports of combined impacts of COVID-19 and shifting healthcare-seeking behaviors disrupt traditional ILI surveillance reliability and limit the accuracy of ILI activity predictions. This factor, along with low circulation of influenza viruses, influences the future ILI forecast (Week40-Week44, 2020 #9, #10).
7. Given the consistent upward trend in ILI counts during the Peak onset season, low yet slowly rising influenza positivity rates, stability in ILI outpatient visits below the baseline, disruption in traditional surveillance accuracy due to COVID-19, and no evidence of heightened flu activity, the forecasted future ILI occurrence of 1734 likely represents mild fluctuations from recent levels but remains consistent with subdued influenza activity.
