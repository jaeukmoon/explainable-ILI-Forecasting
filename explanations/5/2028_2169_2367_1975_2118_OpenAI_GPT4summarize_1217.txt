1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating pattern with high values, fluctuating between 2028 (Week 52, 2020) and 2118 (Week 3, 2021). An upward trend was observed initially from Week 52, 2020 (2028) to Week 1, 2021 (2367), followed by a drop to 1975 in Week 2, 2021, and a subsequent rebound to 2118 in Week 3, 2021. This irregular pattern highlights both increases and declines but ends with elevated activity compared to the baseline Week 52, 2020.
2. A positive correlation exists between the past and future time-series occurrences, as Weeks 1–3, 2021 showed relatively high values (peaking at 2367 in Week 1, 2021), likely contributing to the reported future ILI occurrences of 1521 after 5 weeks (Week 8, 2021). The consistent elevation in weekly occurrences reflects sustained respiratory illness activity leading to continued cases in future weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline (2.6%) but showed notable trends: Weeks 52, 2020 (1.6%), Week 1, 2021 (1.7%), and Week 2, 2021 (1.4%). Though the proportions decreased in later weeks, regional trends and monitoring disruptions impacted reporting, leaving room for localized growth influencing ILI occurrences.
4. The percentage of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds: 13.6% (Week 52, 2020), 17.2% (Week 1, 2021), and 14.8% (Week 3, 2021), with most attributed to COVID-19. This persistent PIC activity reflects overlapping severe respiratory illness contributing to heightened ILI activity.
5. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic heavily influenced healthcare-seeking behaviors, alternative care settings, and lower influenza-related reporting. Disruptions in surveillance systems, simultaneous influenza suppression, and increased COVID-19-linked respiratory illnesses likely contributed to the high reported future ILI occurrences.
6. Despite anomalously low influenza positivity rates (<0.4% weekly positivity, e.g., 0.1% in Week 2, 2021), high ILI incidence hints at other drivers such as overlapping COVID-19 infections and increased non-specific respiratory illnesses dominating the observed data.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1521 (Week 8, 2021) can be explained by the fluctuating activity seen in the past data, sustained PIC-related mortality above epidemic thresholds, consistently high ILI-related healthcare visits, pandemic-induced reporting issues, and the interplay between non-specific respiratory illness and suppressed influenza viral activity.
