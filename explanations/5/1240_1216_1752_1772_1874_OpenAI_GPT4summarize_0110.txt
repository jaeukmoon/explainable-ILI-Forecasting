1. The reported ILI counts from Week46, 2021 to Week50, 2021 are 1240, 1216, 1752, 1772, and 1874. The trend has shown a consistent increase from Week47, 2021 onwards, starting with 1216 and reaching 1874 in Week50, 2021. This upward trend indicates sustained growth in ILI activity, suggesting escalating transmission during this period.
2. Week3, 2022 falls within the peak season, which typically occurs between Week46 of the prior year and Week6 of the current year in the U.S. The steady rise in ILI activity since Week46, 2021 and continued increases in laboratory detections and hospitalizations as per reported CDC data indicate that Week3, 2022 aligns with the peak season dynamics.
3. From the perspective of a time-series forecasting model, the consistent upward trend in ILI occurrences between Week47, 2021 (1216) and Week50, 2021 (1874) suggests a projecting continuation of this pattern over the next five weeks. Considering the current trajectory, a value of 2084 in Week3, 2022 reflects this sustained increase combined with seasonal intensification.
4. Increasing influenza positivity: The percentage of positive respiratory specimens rose steadily from 1.0% in Week46, 2021 to 5.6% by Week50, 2021 (Week46, 2021 #2 and Week50, 2021 #1). This rise, dominated by Influenza A(H3N2), illustrates increasing virus circulation, contributing to future ILI growth.
5. Outpatient respiratory illness visits: Outpatient visits for ILI increased from 2.2% in Week46, 2021 to 3.1% by Week50, 2021, exceeding the national baseline (Week46, 2021 #4 and Week50, 2021 #5). This trend signals accelerating community-level ILI activity driving higher future incidence.
6. Lower flu vaccination uptake: Vaccination levels in Week48, 2021 and Week50, 2021 are noted as being lower compared to the previous season (Week48, 2021 #7 and Week50, 2021 #7). This reduced coverage potentially fuels the spread of influenza, particularly the highly dominant A(H3N2) subtype.
7. The sharp rise in ILI activity over the past five weeks, the historical seasonality that places Week3, 2022 in the peak season, and the correlation of elevated positive cases, outpatient visits, and reduced vaccine coverage strongly justify the predicted value of 2084 occurring during this peak phase of influenza activity. The ongoing effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses and regional intensifications further reinforce this forecast.
