1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a declining trend, with values of ['1698', '1711', '1731', '1685', '1476']. Despite minor fluctuations from Week 20, 2024, to Week 23, 2024 (e.g., a rise from 1698 to 1731 between Week 20 and Week 22), there was a substantial decline to 1476 by Week 24, 2024, marking the lowest point in the observed period. This consistent decline suggests waning ILI activity leading into Week 24, 2024.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the significant decline in ILI activity through Week 24, 2024, does not align with the reported future decrease to 874 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 29, 2024). The downward trajectory in Weeks 22–24 implies continuing reductions in ILI activity, potentially resulting in the low future ILI value.
3. Weekly outpatient visits for ILI consistently decreased, starting from 2.0% in Week 20, 2024, dropping to 1.6% in Week 24, 2024. This steady decline in healthcare-seeking for ILI aligns with reduced respiratory illness burden and further supports the drop in ILI occurrences to 874.
4. - Laboratory positivity rates for influenza steadily declined, moving from 2.0% in Week 20, 2024, to only 1.4% in Week 24, 2024. This downward progression indicates reduced influenza circulation, contributing to the observed trend in declining future ILI occurrences.
5. - Hospitalization rates for influenza remained minimal throughout the 5 weeks, ranging from 0.2 per 100,000 in Week 20, 2024, to 0.1 per 100,000 in Week 24, 2024. The consistently low hospitalization burden reflects diminished severe illness activity, corresponding with reduced future ILI levels.
6. - Stable mortality rates due to influenza, which remained at 0.1% during Weeks 20–24, 2024, also demonstrate reduced impact of influenza on population-level illness trends, further backing the future decline in ILI occurrences.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and RSV) alongside influenza maintained low but stable ILI activity during the observed period. These multifactorial drivers of respiratory illness, coupled with no novel virus detections or significant antiviral resistance trends, may have moderated ILI dynamics, culminating in the decline to 874 ILI cases after 5 weeks. Robust influenza vaccination coverage and alignment between circulating viruses and vaccine components further contributed to the manageable respiratory illness burden reflected in the future ILI drop.
5. In summary, the future decline in ILI occurrences to 874 (Week 29, 2024) can be attributed to the steady decline in past ILI activity through Weeks 20–24, 2024, reduced outpatient ILI visits and lab positivity, minimal hospitalization and stable mortality rates, and the diminishing impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors collectively indicate a stabilization of respiratory illness trends, reflected in the projected future low ILI occurrences.
