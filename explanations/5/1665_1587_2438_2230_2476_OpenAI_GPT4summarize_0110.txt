1. The reported ILI counts from Week38 to Week42, 2021 are 1665, 1587, 2438, 2230, and 2476. There was an initial dip from Week38 (1665) to Week39 (1587), followed by a sharp rise reaching 2438 in Week40 and a slight drop to 2230 in Week41 before increasing again to 2476 in Week42. Overall, the trend indicates a significant upward trajectory during this period, with a notable spike beginning in Week40. This suggests an increase in ILI occurrence approaching the peak onset season.
2. In the U.S., peak onset season typically starts from Week32 to Week46, leading into the peak season. Week47, 2021 falls in the peak season window. Given the increasing trend of ILI counts (Week38, 2021 to Week42, 2021) and CDC data highlighting potential influenza activity growth, it is forecasted that Week47, 2021 belongs to the peak season.
3. Historical patterns reveal a sharp increase in ILI occurrences from Week39 (1587) to Week42 (2476), suggesting progressive amplification of respiratory virus activity. Projecting this trend forward over five weeks, the model predicts momentum will continue into the peak season, leading to the occurrence of 2652 ILI cases in Week47, 2021.
4. Positive indicators in virologic surveillance, with both clinical and public health labs reporting increasing positivity rates for Influenza A and B in subsequent weeks (Week40 #1, #2; Week41 #2, #3; Week42 #2, #3), strongly correlate with rising ILI cases.
5. Seasonal vaccination efforts remain underway, but data gaps around vaccination uptake are noted (Week38 #6, Week39 #8, Week40 #8, Week41 #8, Week42 #8). This could indicate a delay in achieving robust immunity in the population, contributing to increased case projections.
6. The co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, and healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the pandemic (Week38 #7, Week39 #9, Week40 #9, Week41 #10, Week42 #10) continue to impact ILI trends, likely driving a portion of the increase in reported cases.
7. Based on the upward trend in ILI counts, the seasonal timing aligning with the peak season, rising positivity rates for influenza viruses, potential gaps in vaccination coverage, and ongoing co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, the forecasted Week47, 2021 ILI occurrence of 2652 is justified as a continuation of the intensifying activity observed during the peak season.
