1. The reported ILI counts from Week11 to Week15, 2021 were 1099, 1213, 1209, 1496, and 1482. The trend shows a consistent increase through Week14 (1496), followed by a marginal dip in Week15 (1482). This overall sequence indicates a moderate upward trajectory, with a peak in Week14 before stabilizing slightly.
2. In the U.S., the off-season typically spans the period after Week6 of one year through approximately Week31. Given the persistently low influenza activity across all weeks and Week20, 2021 falling well after the typical influenza peak season window, Week20, 2021 aligns with the off-season period. It is therefore forecasted to belong to the off-season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the moderate upward trend during Weeks11–14, followed by stabilization in Week15, suggests a slight continuation of ILI occurrences near the current levels into the forecast period. Extending these patterns five weeks into Week20, 2021, aligns with projecting the marginally higher occurrences observed in recent data. Thus, 1645 occurrences align with expected minor fluctuations.
4. While influenza activity remains low, positivity rates are consistently 0.1% of respiratory specimens (Week11 #1; Week12 #1; Week13 #1; Week14 #1; Week15 #1), indicating minimal ILI spread but slightly increased outpatient data.
5. Minimal vaccination updates (Week11 #10; Week12 #9; Week13 #7; Week14 #10; Week15 #10) and stable antiviral susceptibility further suggest no significant resurgence in influenza activity in the off-season.
6. COVID-19 adjustments to healthcare behavior continue to influence ILI detection and interpretation, and overlapping pandemic trends contribute to the unusual patterns of minimal ILI activity (Week11 #9; Week13 #8; Week14 #11; Week15 #8).
7. Considering the upward momentum earlier in the series, Week20's placement in the off-season, reduced positivity, steady hospitalizations (0.8 per 100,000; Week13 #4; Week14 #7; Week15 #4), and lack of significant new public health threats, the predicted ILI count stabilizes at 1645.
