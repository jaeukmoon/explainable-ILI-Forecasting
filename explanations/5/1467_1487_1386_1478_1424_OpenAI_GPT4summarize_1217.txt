1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Week25 to Week29, 2023) exhibited fluctuation within a relatively narrow range, with values of ['1467', '1487', '1386', '1478', '1424']. While there was a decline from 1487 (Week26, 2023) to 1386 (Week27, 2023), cases showed a modest rebound to 1478 (Week28, 2023) before declining again to 1424 (Week29, 2023). This erratic pattern suggests relative stability in ILI activity over the observed period, without a definitive upward or downward trend.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 3088 represent a significant increase compared to the past 5-week trend. This indicates a potential delayed impact from preceding factors. Correlation between the Week28 rebound (1478) and the subsequent substantial rise in future occurrences suggests that the Week28–Week29 plateau in lower ILI activity could have masked underlying drivers that later accelerated future ILI cases.
3. The summarized CDC reports highlight several contributors:
4. - Hospitalization remained steady yet considerable, ranging from 768 in Week25 to 573 in Week29, maintaining consistent respiratory-related admissions. This chronic burden aligns with delayed future increases.
5. - Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently bordered or exceeded epidemic thresholds, ranging from 6.2% in Week25 to 5.6% in Week29. This persistence indicates ongoing respiratory illness circulation tied to significant future ILI surges.
6. - Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and influenza was emphasized in all reports, continually complicating ILI trends. These overlapping viral dynamics may amplify base-level ILI activity, contributing to increases in future cases.
7. - Pediatric populations exhibited the highest ILI outpatient visit rates throughout Weeks25-29, with percentages ranging from 4.8% to 4.0% (ages 0–4). This susceptible age group likely played a central role in sustaining and driving future occurrences.
4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 3088 after Week29, 2023, can be attributed to the prolonged yet stable respiratory illness burden seen in hospitalization rates, consistent PIC mortality bordering epidemic thresholds, overlapping circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, and elevated ILI outpatient rates among vulnerable pediatric populations. While the immediate past time-series ILI trend appeared stable, underlying drivers likely converged to produce a marked surge after 5 weeks.
