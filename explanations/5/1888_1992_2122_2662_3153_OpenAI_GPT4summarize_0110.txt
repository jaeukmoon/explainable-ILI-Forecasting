1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week31, 2023 to Week35, 2023 are 1888, 1992, 2122, 2662, and 3153. This data shows a clear upward trend throughout the five weeks, with significant increases between Week33 (2122) and Week35 (3153), particularly during Week34 (2662 to 3153, a jump of 491). This pattern indicates an early rise in influenza activity, suggesting movement toward higher ILI intensity.
2. In the U.S., the peak onset season typically begins in Week35 and spans until Week46. Week40, 2023 aligns with the middle of the peak onset season. The continuous upward trajectory in ILI numbers observed in Weeks31 to Week35 strongly suggests increasing influenza activity heading further into the peak onset season. Thus, Week40, 2023 is forecasted to fall within the peak onset season.
3. The upward trend from the time series data implies a predictable continuation of rising ILI cases in the forecasted period. The increases observed in the past five weeks highlight intensifying flu activity, projecting ILI occurrences to continue increasing toward Week40. By applying time-series forecasting principles, the sharp acceleration seen in recent weeks significantly contributes to the predicted value of 5127 five weeks ahead.
4. Regional influenza positivity is rising slightly but remains low, with specimens testing positive for influenza fluctuating between 0.6% and 1.0%, dominated by Influenza A and the Victoria lineage of Influenza B (Week31-35, 2023 #1, #3).
5. Outpatient visits for ILI have steadily risen from 1.1% (Week31, 2023) to 1.9% (Week35, 2023), with children aged 0-4 consistently demonstrating the highest percentage (Week31-35, 2023 #3, #5). This demographic has already shown increased vulnerability, contributing to the upward forecast trend.
6. The introduction of a novel Influenza A (H1N2)v case reported in Week33, 2023 introduces potential variability, even though no human-to-human transmission has been documented (Week33, 2023 #3). Such rare variants, combined with the general co-circulation of respiratory viruses under altered healthcare dynamics, amplify the overall ILI activity forecast (Week33-35, 2023 #10).
7. Based on the significant rise in ILI cases, the mid-peak onset season classification, and corroborating factors such as rising outpatient visits and potential impacts from novel virus activity, the forecast for 5127 ILI occurrences in Week40, 2023 aligns with historical trends and emerging patterns.
