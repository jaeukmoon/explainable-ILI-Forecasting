1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week4 to Week8, 2022 are 1484, 1114, 888, 803, and 832. These numbers show a pronounced downward trend from Week4 (1484) to Week8 (832). A notable decrease occurred in Week5 (1114) and Week6 (888), followed by relative stabilization during Week7 (803) and Week8 (832). This represents a declining trend with signs of stable, low-level activity in later weeks.
2. Based on U.S. ILI seasonality patterns, the target week (Week13, 2022) falls within the off-season. Typical peak activity concludes by Week6, and Week13 (well beyond the peak season) shows sporadic flu activity and low outpatient respiratory visits (Week7, 2022 #1; Week8, 2022 #3).
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the observed trends suggest a continuation of the declining pattern with stabilization at lower levels by Week8, 2022. Accounting for this stable trajectory and moving five weeks forward, a forecast of 1002 aligns with the ongoing seasonal decline and the absence of indicators pointing to a resurgence.
4. Lower vaccination rates compared to prior seasons contribute to moderating immunity in communities (Week4, 2022 #6; Week5, 2022 #8; Week6, 2022 #8), which may limit rebounds in ILI occurrences, maintaining low activity overall.
5. Influenza A(H3N2) remains dominant, with antigenic evolution noted (Week5, 2022 #10; Week6, 2022 #10; Week7, 2022 #7; Week8, 2022 #8). However, most viruses are genetically related to vaccine strains, which, combined with low baseline activity, tempers the risk of significant outbreaks.
6. Sporadic co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and the declining proportion of positive influenza cases (Week4, 2022 #1, #8; Week7, 2022 #9; Week8, 2022 #6), indicate limited amplification effects from co-infections or novel variants.
7. In conclusion, the ILI prediction for Week13, 2022 (1002) reflects the stabilizing downward trends observed from Week4 to Week8, 2022, classification as off-season timing, low vaccination rates, antigenic stability in circulating strains, and sporadic respiratory co-viral activity—all contributing to continued low ILI occurrences.
