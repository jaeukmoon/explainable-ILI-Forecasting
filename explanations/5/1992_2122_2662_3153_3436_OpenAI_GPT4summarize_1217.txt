1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a steady upward trend, with values of ['1992', '2122', '2662', '3153', '3436']. Starting from 1992 in Week32, 2023, there was consistent weekly growth, culminating in 3436 by Week36, 2023. This continuous rise in ILI occurrences reflects an increasing trajectory in respiratory illness activity during the observed period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the upward momentum in the past data (Week32–Week36, 2023) aligns with the reported 5340 future occurrences by Week41, 2023. This strong growth trajectory in Weeks35–36, 2023, acts as an indicator of the continued rise reflected in the future data.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily increased over the 5-week period, starting from 1.3% (Week32, 2023) and rising gradually to 2.0% (Week36, 2023), with disproportionately high rates among children aged 0–4 years, peaking at 7.2% in Week35, 2023. The sustained rise in ILI-related outpatient encounters suggests growing momentum in ILI activity, contributing to the future spike to 5340. Elevated PIC (pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19) mortality percentages consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, ranging from 6.1% (Week32, 2023) to 7.0% (Week36, 2023). Such persistently high PIC-related mortality across weeks, driven predominantly by COVID-19, indicates wider respiratory illness burdens that likely correlate with the observed future increase in ILI occurrences. Hospitalizations for influenza-related cases increased modestly but steadily, from 677 (Week32, 2023) to 775 (Week36, 2023). This incremental growth in hospital admissions underscores rising respiratory illness severity during the observed period, potentially signaling higher future ILI cases.
4. High pediatric vulnerability was documented across the CDC reports, with children aged 0–4 years consistently demonstrating the highest ILI rates (e.g., 4.4% in Week32, 2023, to 6.5% in Week36, 2023). This heightened pediatric impact hints at a concentrated driver of ILI activity, correlating with the future surge. Increased co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, SARS-CoV-2) concurrently with influenza was emphasized across Weeks32–36, 2023, complicating ILI patterns. This respiratory virus interplay may have amplified the future increase to 5340 cases.
5. In summary, the reported 5340 future ILI occurrences (Week41, 2023) are attributable to the steady upward trend seen in Weeks32–36, 2023, rising ILI-related outpatient visits and hospitalizations, persistently elevated PIC-related mortality, and high pediatric ILI activity. Concurrent co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens further bolstered the observed escalation in future ILI cases.
