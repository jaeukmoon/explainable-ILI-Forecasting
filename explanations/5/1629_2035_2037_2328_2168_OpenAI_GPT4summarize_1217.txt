1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall fluctuating trend, with values of ['1629', '2035', '2037', '2328', '2168']. There was an initial increase from 1629 (Week37, 2023) to 2035 (Week38, 2023), a slight rise to 2037 (Week39, 2023), followed by a peak at 2328 (Week40, 2023), and a slight decline to 2168 (Week41, 2023). This dynamic trend indicates ongoing respiratory illness activity, with moderate increases observed over the 5 weeks.
2. A moderate correlation is evident between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the upward trajectory observed in Weeks 38 to 40, 2023, alongside relatively high values sustained through Week 41, aligns with the reported increase to 3453 future occurrences after 5 weeks. The peaks and sustained activity in Weeks 40 and 41 suggest a foundation for the surge in future ILI activity.
3. Hospitalization rates rose consistently, with 820 admissions in Week37, 880 in Week38, 1040 in Week39, 1127 in Week40, and 1228 in Week41, indicating a steady increase in severity and healthcare burden from respiratory illnesses, which likely contributed to higher future ILI occurrences.
4. Outpatient ILI visits climbed gradually, accounting for 2.0% in Week37, 2023, 2.0% in Week38, 2.1% in Week39, 2.2% in Week40, and 2.3% in Week41, reflecting increasing healthcare engagement for respiratory illnesses, a key driver for the reported spike in future ILI occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, reported consistently across all weeks, added to the respiratory illness burden, fueling the rise in ILI occurrences. The continued low yet increasing influenza positivity rates, from 0.8% in Week37 to 1.3% in Week41, further indicate broad respiratory pathogen activity contributing to the future surge.
6. In summary, the reported 3453 future ILI occurrences (after 5 weeks) can be explained by the sustained dynamic trend in ILI activity over the past 5 weeks, increasing hospitalization and outpatient ILI visit rates, and co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens contributing to heightened respiratory illness intensity.
