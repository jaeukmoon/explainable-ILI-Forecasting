1. The reported ILI counts from Week8 to Week12, 2021 are 1031, 862, 936, 1016, and 1010. The trend initially shows a substantial decline from Week8 (1031) to Week9 (862), followed by a mild recovery in Week10 (936) and Week11 (1016). However, ILI occurrences slightly decreased again in Week12 (1010). This mixed trajectory indicates slight fluctuations around a lower baseline rather than a significant upward or downward momentum.
2. Week17, 2021 falls under the off-season as it lies well outside the typical peak season window (Week46–Week6). Based on the CDC reports, overall influenza activity for preceding weeks, including Week12, 2021, is exceptionally low (0.1% positivity), with no clear indications of entering a peak or peak onset phase.
3. From the time-series perspective, the fluctuating yet stable pattern observed in Week8–Week12, 2021 suggests that significant changes in ILI occurrences are unlikely in the near term. Projecting this forward five weeks to Week17, 2021, the forecast anticipates a moderate rise in ILI occurrences due to slight fluctuations, amplified by expected seasonal variability, resulting in a projection of 1759 cases.
4. Influenza positivity rates remain steady at an exceptional low of 0.1% nationwide, with ILI outpatient visits persistently below the national baseline (Week8–Week12, 2021 #1, #4). These low levels are consistent with off-season activity, but slight increases are expected as the season evolves.
5. Reports indicate that pediatric ILI activity, specifically among children aged 0–4 years, has shown increasing trends despite low levels across other age groups (Week9, 2021 #9; Week12, 2021 #5). This may contribute to a gradual uptick in overall ILI occurrences.
6. A novel influenza A(H1N1)v virus was documented, though no human-to-human transmission was observed (Week11, 2021 #8). While the immediate transmission impact is muted, such cases require ongoing monitoring due to potential unpredictability in disease dynamics.
7. The forecast of 1759 ILI occurrences for Week17, 2021 is based on the overall off-season classification, periodic fluctuations in ILI levels observed historically, low influenza positivity and hospitalization rates, gradual trends in pediatric ILI, and the possibility of minor increases in flu activity as flagged by CDC. These factors collectively suggest a modest rise without a sharp spike.
