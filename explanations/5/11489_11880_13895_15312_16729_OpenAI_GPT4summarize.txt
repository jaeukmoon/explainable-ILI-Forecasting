1. The past time-series ILI occurrences ('11489', '11880', '13895', '15312', '16729') demonstrate a consistent upward trajectory over the 5-week period. Starting at 11489 in Week 42, 2021, the numbers rose to 16729 by Week 46, 2021. This consistent weekly increase in ILI occurrences reflects an accelerating growth pattern in respiratory illness activity leading up to Week 46, 2021.

2. The correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident through the clear upward trend in past weeks, which aligns with the reported future increase to 28956 occurrences observed by Week 51, 2021. The sharp growth in ILI occurrences from Week 45–46, 2021, functions as a strong indicator of an anticipated surge in respiratory illnesses.

3. Several factors from the summarized CDC reports contribute to the observed future increase in ILI occurrences:
   - Outpatient visits for ILI showed a steady increase, rising from 1.8% (Week 42, 2021) to 2.2% (Week 46, 2021). Although still below the national baseline of 2.5%, the continuous growth in ILI-related healthcare utilization highlights a growing burden of respiratory illnesses, likely driving the future surge.
   - Hospitalizations due to influenza incrementally climbed from 288 (Week 42, 2021) to 356 (Week 46, 2021), reflecting increased severe flu activity during this period, particularly among age groups 5–24 years dominated by Influenza A(H3N2) cases.
   - PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) mortality percentages consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, starting at 16.5% in Week 42, 2021, and stabilizing above 14% through Week 46, 2021. These elevated levels indicate heightened respiratory illness impact, with COVID-19 and influenza co-dominance playing a significant role.

4. In summary, the future increase to 28956 ILI occurrences reported for Week 51, 2021, is driven by the consistent upward trend in past ILI occurrences, the growing proportion of ILI outpatient visits, rising influenza-related hospitalizations, and persistently high PIC mortality. The dominance of A(H3N2), localized outbreaks, and healthcare behavior shifts further magnify these patterns, contributing to the observed surge.
