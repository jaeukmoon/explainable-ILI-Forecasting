1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks experienced a consistent and marked upward trend. Beginning at 11738 (Week 41, 2021) and increasing weekly, the data culminated at 15312 (Week 45, 2021). Notable incremental gains were observed from Week 43 to Week 45, with the largest single-week rise occurring from 13895 to 15312 (Week 44 to Week 45). This clear escalation in reported ILI cases suggests accelerating respiratory illness activity as the observed weeks progress.

2. The future ILI occurrence of 22179 (Week 50, 2021) strongly correlates with the significant upward trajectory from mid-to-late period weeks, specifically the sharp rise in Week 44 and Week 45, 2021. The momentum built toward the latter weeks of the past time series is aligned with the future surge, indicating the continuation and amplification of the rising trend observed over this period.

3. Several factors from the CDC summarized reports demonstrate high relevance to the sharp increase seen in future ILI occurrences:  
   - The steady rise in outpatient visits for ILI, climbing from 1.8% (Week 41, 2021) to 2.1% (Week 44 and Week 45, 2021), suggests increasing healthcare encounters for respiratory illnesses, signaling underlying growth in illness activity.  
   - Cases linked to Influenza A(H3N2) were rising, with a notable concentration among ages 5–24 and specific regional outbreaks (e.g., Week 44, 2021). This regional spread likely contributed significantly to heightened ILI activity.  
   - The interplay of multiple respiratory viruses, such as influenza and COVID-19, caused co-circulation complications (Week 44–45, 2021), with COVID-19 dominating PIC-related deaths. These dynamics likely intensified observed ILI trends.  
   - Incremental increases in influenza-positive test proportions, from 0.1% (Week 41, 2021) to 0.7% (Week 45, 2021), indicate rising viral circulation, supporting the jump in future cases.  

4. In summary, the increase to 22179 future ILI occurrences (Week 50, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trend in past ILI data, correlating strongly with rising weekly values, especially in Weeks 44–45, 2021. Supporting factors include increasing ILI outpatient visit percentages, regional Influenza A(H3N2) outbreaks, respiratory virus co-circulation, and pandemic-related surveillance disruptions, all amplifying reported occurrences and fueling the surge.
