1. The past time-series ILI occurrences exhibit a consistent declining trend over the 5-week period, with values of ['15163', '14138', '13960', '13498', '12644']. Starting from 15163 in Week15, 2024, the numbers gradually decreased week by week, reaching a low of 12644 in Week19, 2024. This indicates a steady reduction in ILI activity throughout the observed period.
2. A negative correlation is evident between past and future ILI occurrences, as the continuous decline in ILI cases over the earlier 5-week period foreshadowed a significant drop to 9910 in future occurrences by Week24, 2024. The downward trend from Week15 to Week19 aligns with the lower future value, reflecting a pattern of reductions in ILI activity across time.
3. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza declined steadily from 5.9% in Week15, 2024, to 2.4% in Week19, 2024. This consistent reduction aligns with the observed future drop in ILI cases, as declining flu positivity indicates reduced influenza activity nationally.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline throughout Weeks 15–19, with values consistently decreasing from 2.5% to 2.0%. This trend of lower outpatient ILI activity is mirrored in the significantly reduced future ILI occurrence of 9910.
5. Cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rates recorded only incremental increases during Weeks 15–19, with a minimal net change from 77.5 per 100,000 in Week15 to 80.6 per 100,000 in Week19. This stagnation in growth rates, coupled with declining overall activity, correlates strongly with the diminished future ILI value.
6. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, reported every week from Week15 to Week19, may have influenced ILI trends by reducing the relative contributions of influenza to total respiratory activity. This factor likely contributed to the lower future ILI count.
7. In summary, the reported 9910 future ILI occurrences (Week24, 2024) can be attributed to the consistent decline in ILI cases over Weeks 15–19, reductions in influenza positivity rates and outpatient visits for ILI, stagnating hospitalization rates, and the compounding impact of respiratory virus co-circulation minimizing influenza's role.
