1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating but generally increasing trend, with values of ['1587', '2438', '2230', '2476', '2531']. An initial sharp increase from 1587 (Week 39, 2021) to 2438 (Week 40, 2021) was followed by a moderate decline to 2230 (Week 41, 2021). Subsequently, the values rose sequentially to 2476 (Week 42, 2021) and 2531 (Week 43, 2021), indicating a modest upward trajectory by the end of the observation period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is identifiable, as the overall upward trend in the latter weeks (Weeks 42–43, 2021) transitions into a more pronounced surge of 2971 reported occurrences after 5 weeks. The persistence in the rising pattern acts as a precursor to the significant increase in ILI activity beyond the observed interval.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at 1.9% (Weeks 39 and 40, 2021), showing only a minor decline to 1.8% (Weeks 41 and 42, 2021) before stabilizing again. Minor fluctuations in ILI percentages below the 2.5% national baseline, combined with increasing influenza-positive specimens in Weeks 42 and 43, 2021, suggest a slow but steady buildup of respiratory illness, correlating with the future rise in cases.
4. Influenza-positive specimens from both clinical and public health labs, though initially minimal, demonstrated an upward trend during the last reported weeks. Clinical specimens testing positive increased from 0.1% (Weeks 39–42, 2021) to 0.2% in Week 43, 2021, while public health lab positives rose from 8 in Week 42 to 35 in Week 43, primarily dominated by Influenza A (H3N2). This increasing trend indicates a gradual resurgence of influenza, contributing to future ILI occurrences.
5. Despite low influenza circulation reported early (Weeks 39–41, 2021), co-circulation of non-influenza respiratory viruses and changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to COVID-19 influenced ILI surveillance, complicating data interpretation. The overlapping impact of these respiratory pathogens likely contributed to a latent rise in ILI cases, reflected in the significant spike to 2971 occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 2971 future ILI occurrences (Week 48, 2021) are attributed to the gradual upward trend in ILI activity by Week 43, 2021, the stabilization of outpatient ILI percentages coupled with increasing influenza-positive detections, rising non-specific respiratory illness activity, and the compounding effects of behavioral and surveillance challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.
