1. The ILI occurrences from Week47, 2023 to Week51, 2023 show a consistent upward trend: 1331, 1703, 1827, 2186, 2266. This represents a steady and substantial increase over five weeks, with no interruptions or significant dips, indicating a sustained growth in flu activity during this period.
2. Week4, 2024 falls within the typical U.S. peak season that generally spans from Week46 of one year to about Week6 of the next. The elevated positivity rates, hospitalization rates, and outpatient visits in the preceding weeks support that Week4, 2024 belongs to the peak season, where influenza activity is at its highest intensity.
3. The observed steady rise in ILI cases from Week47, 2023 to Week51, 2023, coupled with increasing outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and positivity rates for influenza, suggests that elevated activity is likely to persist during the peak season. Based on a time-series perspective, the prediction of 1756 cases after 5 weeks can be reasoned as a plateau or slight decrease from current Week51 levels (2266), potentially reflecting the beginning signs of stabilization as flu activity nears its peak.
4. Influenza positivity rates rose from 6.2% in Week47, 2023 to 16.1% in Week51, 2023, indicating a sharp increase in circulation of the virus. This sustained upward trend mirrors the increasing ILI counts, signaling continued elevated activity into early 2024.
5. Although vaccination campaigns are ongoing and recommended, vaccination rates appear insufficient to significantly curb flu activity, especially given the continued co-circulation of COVID-19 and RSV, which may exacerbate ILI trends. This is reflected in the overall high cumulative hospitalization rate (15.4 per 100,000 by Week51, 2023) and elevated outpatient visit levels.
6. Regional variability in activity, particularly high levels in regions like the southeast and south-central U.S., indicates that localized peaks may contribute to nationwide trends. Influenza A(H1N1), the dominant strain, has been historically known to drive heightened activity during peak seasons, consistent with current observations by Week51, 2023.
7. A steady increase in ILI activity nationwide, indicative of a peak season (Week4, 2024), is moderately offset in the projection by stabilizing factors such as partial vaccine effectiveness and susceptibility of circulating strains to antiviral treatments. Co-circulation of multiple viruses remains a complicating factor, but given a slight projected decline from Week51, 2023 levels, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 1756 is plausible as activity begins transitioning toward a plateau phase.
