1. The past time-series ILI occurrences from Week23 to Week27, 2021, displayed a clear upward trend, transitioning from 1748 (Week23, 2021) to 2193 (Week27, 2021). While minor fluctuations occurred between 1807 (Week24, 2021) and 1794 (Week26, 2021), the surge to 2193 in Week27, 2021, represents significant growth in ILI occurrences, indicative of an increasing trajectory in respiratory illness activity during this period.
2. The upward trend observed in the past 5 weeks aligns positively with the future ILI occurrences of 3416 reported 5 weeks later, evidencing a correlation between the consistent increase toward Week27, 2021, and the amplified ILI activity reflected in future data. The sharp rise from 2193 to 3416 underscores this continuity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed slight but steady increases, with a rise from 1.2% (Week23 to Week26, 2021) to 1.3% in Week27, 2021. This marginal upward pattern in ILI-related healthcare encounters potentially forecasts the elevated ILI occurrences reported 5 weeks later, reflecting an ongoing uptick in respiratory health concerns.
4. Elevated percentages of deaths due to Pneumonia, Influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) persisted across Weeks23 to Week27, 2021, surpassing epidemic thresholds, such as 7.6% in Week23 to 6.5% in Week27, 2021. Although primarily attributed to COVID-19, this excess mortality rate mirrors an underlying escalation in respiratory illness activity correlated to the future ILI occurrence rise.
5. Continued disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors and monitoring systems due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as documented in Weeks23 to Week27, 2021, likely distorted traditional ILI detection and reporting, clustering higher occurrences post-observation and amplifying non-specific respiratory illness representation.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 3416 (following Week27, 2021) can be attributed to the observed upward trend in past ILI occurrences, slight but consistent increases in ILI-related outpatient visits, elevated PIC mortality exceeding thresholds, and pandemic-driven disruptions to healthcare-seeking patterns and surveillance systems. This combination of factors aligns with the sharp rise to 3416 occurrences after Week27, 2021.
