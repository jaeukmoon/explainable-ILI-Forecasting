1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks revealed a growing trend, with values of ['10864', '10818', '10927', '11143', '11971']. A slight dip was observed from 10864 (Week29, 2024) to 10818 (Week30, 2024), but this was followed by a consistent rise, peaking at 11971 in Week33, 2024. This demonstrates an overall escalation in ILI activity throughout the observed period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the upward trend in Weeks 31–33, 2024, and the future ILI occurrences at 13616 after 5 weeks. The steady increase towards the end of the 5-week period likely served as an indicator of continued growth in ILI activity, driving the reported future rise.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at 1.5% through Weeks 31–33, 2024 (below baseline), but indicate sustained respiratory illness activity across regions, which could have contributed to the rise. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses like influenza, RSV, and COVID-19 (documented persistently in all 5 weeks) may have further impacted transmission dynamics and ILI cases. Low vaccination uptake and reduced antiviral resistance (observed consistently) suggest increasing case severity or spread despite prevention efforts.
4. Novel variant infections were reported each week, such as influenza A(H5), H3N2v, and others. Zoonotic spillover events (e.g., swine exposure reported in Week33, 2024) indicate a continuing risk of transmission that could amplify ILI occurrences over time. Poor regional containment of such risks could feed into the reported future surge to 13616.
5. In summary, the reported 13616 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks result from the increasing past ILI trend in Weeks 31–33, 2024, stable outpatient ILI data indicating persistent transmission, ongoing co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, and the compounded impact of zoonotic spillover events and low vaccine uptake, which together underline elevated future respiratory illness activity.
