1. The reported ILI counts from Week26 to Week30, 2022 are 14144, 14344, 13771, 13570, and 13067. The data indicates a consistent decline in ILI occurrences, with no significant spikes or increases, showing a steady downward trend overall.
2. Forecasting Week35, 2022 aligns with the peak onset season. Historical patterns in the U.S. indicate that Week35 typically represents the onset phase of increasing activity after the off-season, as it precedes the traditional peak season beginning around Week46. However, current low ILI activity aligns with a slow initial rise during the peak onset season.
3. Given the past trend of declining ILI occurrences across Weeks26-30, 2022, and the transition to the peak onset season, it is expected that ILI occurrences would begin to gradually increase after Week30, 2022. Projected increases over the next five weeks, informed by prior patterns and seasonality, contribute to the prediction of 15856 occurrences by Week35, 2022.
4. Influenza activity has remained low nationally during Weeks26-30, 2022, with minimal positivity rates for influenza testing (Week26 #1, Week27 #1, Week28 #1, Week29 #1, Week30 #1). This low baseline provides minimal upward pressure on ILI counts but leaves room for gradual increases typical of the peak onset season.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (Week26 #10, Week27 #10, Week28 #8, Week29 #10, Week30 #10) complicates ILI trend interpretation, as these viruses contribute to outpatient respiratory visits and hospitalizations. This ongoing factor suggests non-influenza ILI occurrences remain a substantive component.
6. Minimal influenza vaccination updates and altered healthcare-seeking behavior post-pandemic (Week26 #7, Week28 #10, Week30 #10) have impacts on ILI trends, potentially underreporting or delaying influenza-specific contributions while maintaining observed respiratory illness levels.
7. The forecast of 15856 ILI occurrences by Week35, 2022 reflects the currently low baseline ILI activity, gradual seasonal trajectory associated with the peak onset phase, the influence of other respiratory viruses, and historical patterns. This figure represents a slight projected increase from the declining off-season trends as activity slowly begins its seasonal climb.
