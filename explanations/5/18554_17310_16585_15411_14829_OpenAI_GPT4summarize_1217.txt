1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent and significant decline, with values of ['18554', '17310', '16585', '15411', '14829'], corresponding to Weeks 6–10, 2023. This steady decrease in values reflects a persistent downward trend in ILI activity each week, reaching its lowest point of 14829 in Week 10, 2023. Such a contraction indicates waning influenza activity by the end of the observed period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the consistent decline from Week 6 through Week 10, 2023, contrasts with the increase to 13307 future occurrences reported after five weeks. Although past activity decreased, the observed future resurgence likely reflects emerging dynamics not immediately evident in the preceding weeks.
3. Despite low influenza positivity rates across Weeks 6–10, 2023 (e.g., 1.4% in Week 6 and 1.0% in Week 10, 2023), the co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, throughout this period may have influenced ILI trends and contributed to the subsequent rise in Week 15.
4. Persistent regional variability in ILI activity, particularly reports of moderate or high activity in select jurisdictions (e.g., 4 jurisdictions with high activity in Week 7, 2023, and 2 jurisdictions with high activity in Week 10, 2023), suggests localized drivers that may have culminated in the observed increase to 13307 future occurrences.
5. The stability of outpatient ILI visits at or near the national baseline (e.g., 2.6% in Weeks 6 and 7 dropping slightly to 2.4% in Weeks 9 and 10, 2023) despite the overall decline in occurrences indicates a latent respiratory illness burden that could amplify future activity.
6. Mortality from pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) declined slightly but remained above the epidemic threshold (e.g., 9.4% in Week 6 to 8.6% in Week 10, 2023). This indicates sustained respiratory illness severity capable of influencing the observed rebound in ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 13307 future ILI occurrences (Week 15, 2023) can be explained by the interplay of declining past activity, co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, regional variability in ILI trends, stable outpatient visits, and persistently elevated PIC mortality levels. This suggests that latent and localized factors contributed to the resurgence despite the preceding decrease.
