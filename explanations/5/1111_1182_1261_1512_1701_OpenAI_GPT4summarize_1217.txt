1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1111', '1182', '1261', '1512', '1701']. The increase from 1111 in Week6, 2022 to 1701 in Week10, 2022 represents a steady progression, with a pronounced rise in the last two weeks. This regular upward trajectory indicates escalating ILI activity, which aligns with the observed future surge.
2. A strong positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the continuous increase in the last 5 weeks culminates in the reported rise to 2181 by Week15, 2022. The steady climb during Weeks9 and 10, 2022 reflects a robust momentum in activity levels that likely carried forward into the future period.
3. Hospitalizations due to influenza rose for six consecutive weeks, reaching a cumulative rate of 5.9 per 100,000 by Week10, 2022. This sustained increase highlights a growing burden of severe cases, contributing to the future ILI uptick.
4. Influenza positivity rates nearly doubled during the reporting period, from 3.0% in Week6, 2022 to 6.8% in Week10, 2022, indicating expanding transmission that aligns with the future rise in ILI occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, was emphasized in multiple reports, with evidence of virus interactions and co-infections (e.g., 5.9% of influenza-positive cases co-infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Week9, 2022). This additional burden likely fueled higher future ILI activity.
6. Antigenic differences in A(H3N2) strains, despite genetic similarity to the vaccine virus, may have reduced vaccine effectiveness, as documented throughout the period. Combined with low vaccination coverage, this facilitated higher susceptibility and subsequent ILI cases.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2181 (Week15, 2022) are attributable to the steady upward trend in hospitalizations and positivity rates, compounded by antigenic mismatches, low vaccine uptake, and the increasing co-circulation of respiratory pathogens observed in Weeks6-10, 2022. These factors created momentum for continued ILI escalation into the future.
