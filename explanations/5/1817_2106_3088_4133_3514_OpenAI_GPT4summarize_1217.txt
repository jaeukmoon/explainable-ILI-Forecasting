1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating pattern, with values of ['1817', '2106', '3088', '4133', '3514']. There was an initial rise from 1817 (Week 32, 2023) to 3088 (Week 34, 2023), a significant peak at 4133 (Week 35, 2023), and then a slight drop to 3514 (Week 36, 2023). This pattern reveals an overall rising trajectory through Week 35, indicating increasing ILI activity before a slight decrease in the final week.
2. A positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the pronounced rise in Week 35 (4133) followed by persistently high activity (3514 in Week 36) reflects a heightened baseline leading into the subsequent weeks. This sustained increase aligns with the rise to 3964 occurrences after 5 weeks, consistent with the momentum seen in the first 5 weeks.
3. Hospitalizations for influenza display a steady increase, with reported cases rising from 677 (Week 32, 2023) to 775 (Week 36, 2023). This consistent rise in hospitalizations indicates heightened severity of respiratory illnesses, likely contributing to the future ILI peak.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI rose markedly, increasing from 1.3% in Week 32 to 2.0% in Week 36, with children aged 0–4 years consistently experiencing the highest rates during the 5-week period (up to 7.2%). This trend, particularly in vulnerable pediatric populations, suggests broader ILI spread contributing to higher future occurrences.
5. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded the epidemic threshold across all weeks, increasing from 6.1% in Week 32 to 7.0% in Week 36. This consistent excess mortality reflects ongoing respiratory illness activity, correlating with the observed rise to 3964 occurrences in the future weeks.
6. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (influenza, SARS-CoV-2, RSV) highlighted in the CDC reports, along with shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors and disruptions in traditional surveillance, likely amplified ILI reporting. These factors, combined with continued low vaccination uptake, contributed to the observed surge in future ILI activity.
7. In summary, the 3964 future ILI occurrences (5 weeks after Week 36, 2023) can be attributed to the overall rising trajectory in Weeks 32–36, increased ILI-related hospitalizations and outpatient visits, persistently high PIC mortality exceeding thresholds, the co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens, and pandemic-driven shifts in ILI surveillance and healthcare-use patterns.
