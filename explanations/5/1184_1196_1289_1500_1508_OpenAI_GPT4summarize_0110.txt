1. The reported ILI counts from Week37 to Week41, 2023 are 1184, 1196, 1289, 1500, and 1508. This demonstrates a consistent upward trajectory across the five-week period, with notable increases from Week39 (1289) to Week40 (1500) and Week41 (1508), indicating a progressive rise in activity leading toward peak onset. There is no evidence of plateauing or decline in this time frame.
2. Forecasting Week46, 2023 falls within the peak season as it aligns with the historical peak season window (typically spanning Week46 through Week6 of the next year in the U.S.) and the observed rising trend in ILI activity from Week37 to Week41, 2023. Specific indicators such as increasing outpatient respiratory illness visits and growing hospitalization trends also support this forecast.
3. From a time-series perspective, the upward trend from Week37 to Week41, 2023 suggests momentum in ILI occurrences will likely persist into Week46, 2023. Linear extrapolation and seasonal indices indicate that the ongoing rise in ILI activity corresponds to the onset of the peak season, further justifying the forecast of increased ILI occurrences at 1860 for Week46, 2023.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, remains a contributing factor to ILI activity and could mildly augment influenza case counts, as documented in Week40, 2023 #6 and Week41, 2023 #9.
5. Increased outpatient visits for respiratory illness and ILI rates, particularly among children aged 0-4 and 5-24 years, signal higher community spread and potential for further influenza escalation, as noted in Week40, 2023 #8 and Week41, 2023 #4.
6. The slight regional increases in influenza positivity and moderate activity in specific jurisdictions, as reported in Week40, 2023 #9 and Week41, 2023 #10, suggest rising influenza activity nationwide, consistent with the seasonal transition toward higher transmission rates.
7. The projection of 1860 for Week46, 2023 is justified by the continuous rise in ILI counts, the alignment with the peak influenza season, ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses, increasing outpatient ILI rates, and evidence of localized activity increases. These factors collectively support the expected escalation of ILI cases during this period.
