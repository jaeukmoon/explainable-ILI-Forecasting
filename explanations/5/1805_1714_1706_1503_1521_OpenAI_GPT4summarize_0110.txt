1. The past ILI occurrences from Week4 to Week8, 2021 exhibit a declining trend, moving from 1805 in Week4 to a low of 1503 in Week7 before slightly increasing to 1521 in Week8. This indicates a consistent decrease in activity with minor stabilization or slight recovery toward the end of the period. The overall trajectory suggests weak flu activity with no significant spikes.
2. Week13, 2021 belongs to the off-season as it occurs after the typical peak season (Week46, 2020 to Week6, 2021). Both historical patterns and levels of ILI activity mentioned in the reports (well below the baseline) align with off-season indicators.
3. Time-series correlation analysis shows a clear downward trend in ILI records over Weeks4–8, 2021, followed by stabilization. Given this pattern, projecting forward to Week13, a gradual increase in ILI occurrence is plausible, yet overall activity remains subdued, aligning with a predicted value of 1977 ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza activity is exceptionally low nationwide, with minimal outpatient visits for ILI (0.9–1.1%) well below the baseline of 2.6%. The reports consistently indicate reduced virus circulation (Week4 #3; Week6 #4; Week8 #4).
5. ILI trends are notably influenced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which alters healthcare-seeking behavior and skews traditional surveillance data (Week4 #8; Week6 #9; Week8 #10).
6. The cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza remain at historic lows (Week5 #5; Week6 #5; Week8 #6), indicating minimal severity in overall flu burden.
7. Combining the steady decline in past ILI occurrences, the off-season timing of target Week13, persistent low positivity rates, minimal hospitalizations, and altered surveillance trends due to COVID-19 disruption, the forecast of 1977 ILI occurrences accurately reflects the subdued flu activity expected during this period.
