1. The reported ILI counts from Week26 to Week30, 2021 are 1054, 1075, 1331, 1372, and 1609, respectively. This indicates a clear upward trend over the five weeks, with ILI occurrences steadily increasing. The growth is particularly noticeable from Week28 (1331) to Week30 (1609), showing a consistent rise without significant fluctuations or dips. This trend suggests an ongoing buildup of respiratory illness activity.
2. Week35, 2021 aligns with the Peak onset season in the U.S., which typically begins around Week32 to Week35 and continues through Week46. The steady increase in ILI activity, coupled with reports indicating broader respiratory illness spread during Week30, 2021, supports this classification of entering the Peak onset season.
3. Historical time-series data reveal a consistent upward trend across the last five weeks, suggesting continued growth in ILI occurrences. Projecting this pattern forward using a time-series forecasting model, it is reasonable to expect the upward trajectory to persist, leading to the forecasted ILI occurrence of 2388 for Week35, 2021. The steady weekly increment aligns with seasonal escalation patterns typical of transition into the Peak onset season.
4. The summarized CDC reports highlight rising outpatient respiratory illness visits, with ILI percentages progressively increasing from 1.2% in Week26, 2021 to 1.9% in Week30, 2021. This rising trend is particularly observed across multiple age groups.
5. Concurrent circulation of non-influenza respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, further contributes to elevated ILI reports (Week30, 2021 #7). While limited influenza activity is noted, overall respiratory transmissions are increasing as captured in outpatient visits.
6. Potential underreporting or misclassification due to alternative healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic affects ILI data accuracy (Week26, 2021 #6; Week27, 2021 #7; Week30, 2021 #8). However, this does not hinder the observed upward trend.
7. In summary, the five-week trend of steadily increasing ILI occurrences, classification into the Peak onset season, elevated respiratory illness levels across age groups, and the influence of other circulating pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 collectively justify the projected ILI count of 2388 for Week35, 2021. The prediction aligns with the observed trajectory and seasonal dynamics during the transition to heightened activity.
