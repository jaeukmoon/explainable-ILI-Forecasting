1. The ILI occurrences from the past five weeks (Week24, 2023 to Week28, 2023) show a consistently **declining trend**, moving from 1017 in Week24 to 698 in Week28. The drops between consecutive weeks are as follows: Week24 to Week25 (-128), Week25 to Week26 (-141), Week26 to Week27 (-26), and Week27 to Week28 (-24). Despite the initial steep decline, the drop rate appears to be stabilizing in recent weeks, suggesting the trend is approaching a plateau rather than continuing to fall sharply.
2. The target week, Week33, 2023, belongs to the **Off-season**. This classification is based on standard U.S. influenza seasonality (from background knowledge), where the Off-season spans from Week1, 2023 to Week31, 2023. Since Week33 is just outside this span, it is still transitioning toward the Peak onset season. However, the currently minimal national flu activity aligns with Off-season characteristics, corroborating this classification.
3. **Correlation analysis** of past trends and seasonality indicates stability in ILI decline. Forecasting uses smoothing within time-series data to project future numbers. Taking the average week-over-week reduction from earlier weeks (-104.75 = average of -128, -141, -26, -24) and applying it conservatively to the Week28 figure (698), the projected value for Week33 would suggest a minor continuation of the plateau, driven by seasonal inertia. However, external influenza activity factors temper this prediction. As the Off-season often suppresses influenza intensity, it suggests a floor to decline, aligning the projection toward stabilized ILI values nearing 800.
4. Three critical factors from the summarized CDC reports strongly influence the forecast:
5. 1. **Low influenza positivity rates (0.8%-1.2%) and minimal ILI outpatient visits (1.2%-1.5%) in past weeks**: These align with Off-season characteristics and signal low sustained transmission, stabilizing ILI occurrences close to a baseline level.
6. 2. **Circulation dominance of Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and minimal Influenza B activity**: This indicates no novel strain likely to increase ILI cases significantly in upcoming weeks. Continued dominance of a known subtype avoids introducing unpredictable spikes in occurrences.
7. 3. **Co-circulating respiratory viruses (COVID-19, RSV) remain limited**: While multiple viruses contribute to ILI data, no significant outbreaks of non-influenza respiratory viruses or related subtypes have been reported, minimizing disruptions to low transmission rates.
5. **Summary**: The declining trend in ILI occurrences is stabilizing, indicative of a plateau during the Off-season. Historical data trends suggest minimal additional drops, while CDC insights confirm persistently low influenza activity with no indications of an outbreak or systemic pressure from novel viruses. Co-circulating pathogens and consistent influenza patterns stabilize ILI occurrences at 800 for Week33, representing a balance between the decelerating decline from past weeks and the overall minimal flu activity during this Off-season period.
