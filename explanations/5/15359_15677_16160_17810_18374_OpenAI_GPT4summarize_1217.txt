1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks depicted a consistent upward trend, with values of ['15359', '15677', '16160', '17810', '18374']. The data shows a gradual increase from 15359 in Week 37, 2023, to 18374 in Week 41, 2023. The sharpest week-on-week jump occurred between Week 39 and Week 40, when values rose from 16160 to 17810, suggesting escalating ILI activity toward the end of the observed period.
2. This upward trajectory in past ILI occurrences aligns with the sharp rise to 30047 cases after 5 weeks. The continual increase in Weeks 37–41, 2023, reflects underlying conditions contributing to higher future ILI occurrences, mirroring the reported surge in Week 46, 2023.
3. Hospitalizations progressively increased over the past 5 weeks (820 in Week 37, 880 in Week 38, 1040 in Week 39, 1127 in Week 40, and 1228 in Week 41) despite low influenza activity, signaling heightened severity and spread of respiratory illnesses, which correlates with the rise in future cases.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily increased across Weeks 37–41, from 2.0% to 2.3%, with consistently higher rates among younger age groups (e.g., 6.3%–7.1% in 0-4 years). This gradual increase indicates growing community-level illness, contributing to the subsequent rise in ILI occurrences.
5. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza climbed from 0.8% in Week 37 to 1.3% in Week 41. Although low, this marks a consistent rise that, combined with co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, RSV), likely fueled the observed surge in future ILI cases.
6. In summary, the increase to 30047 future ILI occurrences (Week 46, 2023) is a result of the clear upward trend in past occurrences, rising hospitalization rates, higher outpatient ILI visits, and gradual increases in influenza positivity, along with the potential impact of co-circulating respiratory pathogens.
