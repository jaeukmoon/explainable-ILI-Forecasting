1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week39 to Week43, 2023 are 1289, 1500, 1508, 1447, and 1396. The trend shows a moderate increase from Week39 (1289) to Week41 (1508), followed by a slight decline in Week42 (1447) and Week43 (1396), overall reflecting a mild fluctuation with a slightly downward trajectory by the end of the period.
2. Based on the historical season classification, Week48, 2023 falls within the peak season (Week46, 2023 to Week6, 2024). This aligns with CDC's typical peak activity timeframe characterized by elevated influenza transmission and intensified community spread.
3. The historical ILI trend from Week39 to Week43, 2023 shows mild growth followed by a slight reduction, indicating an early phase of increasing activity likely transitioning toward peak season behaviors. Time-series forecasting models project an amplified increase by Week48, 2023, consistent with historical seasonal patterns preceding peak periods.
4. Influenza activity is observing slight increases nationally, as confirmed by increasing outpatient visits for ILI from Week39 (2.1%) to Week43 (2.7%), though still below the national baseline of 2.9% (Week39 #3; Week40 #1; Week41 #4; Week42 #5; Week43 #3).
5. Hospitalization rates are rising, with increasing cumulative hospitalizations from 1,040 in Week39 to 1,607 in Week43 (Week39 #4; Week40 #3; Week41 #5; Week42 #3; Week43 #4), signaling expanding disease burden.
6. CDC anticipates rising flu activity (Week42 #11; Week43 #10), supported by upward trends in positive testing, hospitalization, and regional respiratory illness, particularly with Influenza A(H1N1) predominating (Week43 #6).
7. Considering the historical trend, the typical seasonality of ILI, rising outpatient visits, and hospitalizations, along with CDC's expectations of heightened flu activity, a forecast of 2458 for Week48, 2023 is consistent with anticipated peak season dynamics.
