1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week13 to Week17, 2024 are 2081, 2003, 2143, 1755, and 1808. Initially, the trend shows a moderate decrease from Week13 (2081) to Week14 (2003), followed by a slight rise in Week15 (2143). However, a significant drop occurred in Week16 (1755) and Week17 (1808). This indicates an overall declining trend over the weeks, suggesting reduced ILI activity nationally, consistent with seasonal flu tapering off after its peak.
2. Week22, 2024 occurs after the typical peak season (ending in Week6 annually) and aligns within the off-season (Week9 to Week30 annually). With flu positivity rates and other indicators declining significantly since Week13, 2024, and no signs of resurgence, Week22, 2024 is classified as part of the off-season.
3. A correlation analysis of historical trends suggests that the decreasing pattern in ILI occurrences during Weeks13–17, 2024 (from 2081 to 1808) indicates a continued reduction in the following weeks during the off-season. Given the gradual leveling in ILI counts seen historically during late-season declines and the influence of co-circulating viruses stabilizing without introducing novel challenges, a forecast of 1731 aligns with the observed trajectory.
4. With positivity rates for influenza among respiratory specimens falling from 9.1% in Week13 to 3.9% in Week17, national flu activity indicates a sustained decline, suggesting reducing ILI occurrences (Week13 #1; Week14 #1; Week15 #1; Week16 #1; Week17 #1).
5. Vaccination efforts remain a key stabilizing factor, with vaccine-matched strains noted to be genetically and antigenically similar to circulating viruses, which suppress overall transmission and prevent additional spikes in activity (Week13 #9; Week14 #7; Week15 #9).
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV is stabilizing without significant surges, aiding in the progressive decline in ILI metrics (Week13 #11; Week14 #8; Week16 #10).
7. The anticipated ILI value of 1731 reflects the continued decline consistent with the off-season classification, suppressed viral transmission due to effective vaccination and low antiviral resistance, and no emergence of novel influenza variants or novel co-circulating threats. These factors, alongside a stabilizing national and regional ILI trend, support the forecasted value.
