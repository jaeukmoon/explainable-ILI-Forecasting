1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent downward trend, with values of ['12523', '12011', '12674', '10638', '9416']. After a slight increase from 12011 (Week21, 2023) to 12674 (Week22, 2023), there was a sharp and consistent decline over the next few weeks, culminating in a significant drop to 9416 in Week24, 2023. This reflects diminishing influenza activity during this period.
2. A moderate correlation is observed between the declining past ILI occurrences and the lower future ILI occurrences of 8125 five weeks later. The reduction in past ILI occurrences in Weeks22–24, 2023, aligns with the continued decline in influenza activity reported in CDC summaries, providing a precursor to a further drop in future ILI occurrences.
3. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, RSV) reported consistently across Weeks20–24, 2023, has impacted ILI trends, contributing lingering cases despite declining influenza-specific activity, which aligns with Week29, 2023, occurrences.
4. Hospitalizations for ILI decreased steadily over five weeks, from 939 (Week20) to 779 (Week24, 2023), reinforcing the overall decline in influenza impact and the lower ILI occurrences five weeks later.
5. Minimal outpatient ILI activity, consistently reported across Week20–24, 2023 (1.1% in Week20 to 1.5% in Week24), remained well below the national baseline. This reduced healthcare engagement aligns with the lower future occurrences observed.
6. In summary, the reported 8125 future ILI occurrences (Week29, 2023) can be attributed to the overall downward trend noted in influenza activity and hospitalizations, co-circulating respiratory pathogens sustaining some cases, and persistently minimal ILI activity below baseline levels aligning with the decline in past ILI occurrences.
