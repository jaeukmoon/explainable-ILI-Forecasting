1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall upward trajectory, with values of ['1503', '1464', '1635', '1897', '1895']. After a slight decrease between Week39, 2023 (1503), and Week40, 2023 (1464), a steady increase followed, peaking at 1897 in Week42, 2023, and stabilizing slightly at 1895 in Week43, 2023. This progression suggests elevated ILI activity leading into the subsequent weeks.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is discernible, as the increasing trend observed in Week41 to Week43, 2023 (1635 to 1897 and 1895), aligns with the amplified future ILI activity (3701) after 5 weeks. The gradual rise signifies potential ongoing transmission and spread of respiratory illnesses contributing to the sharp rise.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily increased, climbing from 2.1% (Week39, 2023) to 2.7% (Week43, 2023), indicating growing respiratory illness activity and healthcare-seeking behavior. This continuous growth directly correlates with the subsequent surge in ILI numbers.
4. Hospitalization rates rose consistently, with cumulative rates increasing from 0.1 per 100,000 in Week40, 2023, to 0.8 per 100,000 in Week43, 2023. Weekly flu-related hospitalizations also showed substantial growth, moving from 1,127 in Week40, 2023, to 1,607 in Week43, 2023, reflecting escalating disease severity.
5. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza rose each week, from 1.0% (Week39, 2023) to 1.9% (Week43, 2023). This consistent rise highlights widening influenza transmission and its contribution to ILI occurrences.
6. Moderate to high ILI activity was reported in an increasing number of jurisdictions, escalating from "moderate or high activity in a few areas" (Week39, 2023) to "moderate in 6 and high in 2 jurisdictions" (Week43, 2023). This expansion underscores regional surges aligning with increasing future ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 3701 future ILI occurrences (Week48, 2023) can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks41–43, 2023, increasing ILI-related outpatient visits, rising hospitalization rates, growing influenza positivity rates, and expanding regional activity. These factors collectively illustrate an escalating respiratory illness burden fueling the sharp future increase.
