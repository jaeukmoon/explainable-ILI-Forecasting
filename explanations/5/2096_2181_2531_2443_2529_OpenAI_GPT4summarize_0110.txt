1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week14 to Week18, 2022 are 2096, 2181, 2531, 2443, and 2529. The data shows a consistent upward trend from Week14 (2096) to Week16 (2531), followed by a slight dip in Week17 (2443) and a minor rebound in Week18 (2529). This pattern suggests an overall modestly increasing trajectory with some fluctuations.
2. Based on established U.S. ILI seasonality, Week23, 2022 falls within the off-season for influenza activity, characterized by reduced transmission and lower community spread. This classification aligns with CDC reports indicating an expected decline in flu activity by Week23, outside of the peak or peak onset periods.
3. Time-series analysis demonstrates a predominantly upward trajectory during Week14-Week18, 2022, but with decreasing intensity in later weeks. Projecting this trend into Week23, 2022, suggests reduced ILI occurrences compared to the peak in Week16, driven by seasonal subsidence and vaccination efforts. The forecast of 1454 reflects this gradual decline in ILI activity.
4. Influenza positivity rates peaked around 8.6% in Week18, 2022 (#1), with Influenza A(H3N2) dominance remaining stable, showing no new, highly transmissible strains emerging (#2). This suggests a tapering effect for activity heading into Week23.
5. Vaccination efforts remained ongoing throughout the period (Week14-Week18, 2022 #8, #10), and while antigenic mismatches for A(H3N2) reduced vaccine effectiveness, coverage likely curbed escalating cases across key demographics.
6. Regional influenza trends were relatively contained in certain high or very high activity areas, as reported in Week18, 2022 (#2). Combined with stable outpatient respiratory visits staying below the national baseline (Week14-Week18, 2022 #4, #6), ILI activity appears to stabilize heading toward Week23.
7. The forecast of 1454 ILI occurrences in Week23, 2022, aligns with the observed reduction in ILI activity during the off-season. This projection considers the declining intensity of activity from Week16 onward, the moderating effects of vaccination, and the absence of new influenza variants significantly altering transmission dynamics.
