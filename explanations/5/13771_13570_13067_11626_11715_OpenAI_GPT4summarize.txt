1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 28–32, 2022) demonstrated a steady decline, from 13,771 in Week 28, 2022, down to a low of 11,626 in Week 31, 2022, followed by a slight recovery to 11,715 in Week 32, 2022. This overall downward trend suggests a decreasing flu and respiratory illness impact during this observation period, though the small uptick in Week 32 indicates potential resurgence or stabilizing activity.  

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, with the recovery in Week 32 (11,715) acting as a key turning point. This alignment correlates with the increase in future ILI occurrences, rising to 15,046 after 5 weeks (Week 37, 2022). While the preceding weeks saw declines, the stabilization in Week 32 may anticipate building momentum for the eventual surge observed in the future data.  

3. Nationwide trends in outpatient visits for ILI remained steady at approximately 1.6% between Weeks 28–30, then slightly declined to 1.4% by Week 32. This indicates that healthcare-seeking increases remained subdued but showed variability within vulnerable groups such as children aged 0-4 years, consistently recording the highest rate (6.5% in Week 28 and 5.9% in Week 32). This stable, yet high contribution from pediatric groups might have driven the rebound in weeks following Week 32.  

4. PIC-related mortality consistently surpassed the epidemic threshold across Weeks 28–32, fluctuating between 9.5% and 10.0%. COVID-19 deaths drove most PIC cases, but influenza (while minimal) was a contributing respiratory factor. Persistent respiratory mortality, alongside the flu co-circulation, likely influenced the eventual rise in ILI occurrences observed after 5 weeks.  

5. Co-circulating respiratory pathogens including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, as highlighted across all weeks, complicated the surveillance of baseline influenza activity. These overlapping infections potentially masked pure influenza contributions while amplifying the ILI case counts (which are defined nonspecifically), likely inflating ILI occurrences in the ensuing weeks.  

6. In summary, the reported jump to 15,046 future ILI occurrences (Week 37, 2022) stems from the slight recovery in Week 32, 2022; resilience in outpatient ILI trends led by pediatric contributions; persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds; and the compounding effects of co-circulating respiratory pathogens, despite overall declines in influenza positivity. Together, these factors suggest the delayed but significant resurgence observed in Week 37, 2022.
