1. The reported ILI counts from Week40 to Week44, 2023 are 1464, 1635, 1897, 1895, and 2172. The trend shows a steady increase, particularly significant between Week40 (1464) and Week44 (2172), highlighting a consistent upward trajectory. There is no sign of major fluctuations, indicating a gradual escalation in activities, aligning with the progression toward the influenza peak season.
2. Forecasting target week (Week49, 2023) belongs to the peak season. Based on historical patterns, the U.S. peak season typically occurs between Week46 and Week6 of the following year. The observed increases in ILI occurrences and virologic, outpatient, and hospitalization trends reported through Week44, 2023, strongly suggest the transition into peak influenza activity for the coming weeks, consistent with Week49 belonging to the peak season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent upward trend in the past 5 weeks indicates a continued rise in cases. Projecting this trajectory forward into Week49, 2023, aligns with peak season levels, particularly as historical data suggests that a steady rise toward this level typically transitions into higher ILI occurrences in peak periods.
4. The continued rise in outpatient visits for influenza-like illness from Week40 (2.2%) to Week44 (2.9%, reaching the national baseline) reflects growing seasonal activity (Week40 #1; Week43 #3; Week44 #8). Increasing hospitalization rates, with Week44 reporting the second highest cumulative rate at this stage of the season since 2010 (Week44 #3), further supports this forecast. Influenza positivity rates exhibit a sharp increase from Week40 (1.1%) to Week44 (3.0%) and show gradual shifts toward peak season indicators (Week40 #1; Week44 #1). Additionally, CDC expectations for flu activity to rise with widespread recommendation for antiviral use underscore imminent growth in ILI counts by Week49 (Week44 #9).
5. Regional increases in positivity and respiratory illness impact are notable, particularly in Regions 4, 6, and 9, demonstrating a widening spread of activity (Week42 #9; Week43 #9; Week44 #10). These hotspot regions align with higher outpatient ILI visits and virologic results, correlating with expected peak season activity in these areas.
6. Viral trends in Week44 report that Influenza A (77.1%) continues to predominate nationally, composed mostly of A(H1N1), showing a strong genetic correlation with the current vaccine strains (Week44 #2). This antigenic match between circulating viruses and vaccines higher efficacy, likely reducing severe cases but not preventing overall transmission or ILI occurrences. However, vaccination uptake trends remain steady (Week44 #7), with no significant surge, thus limiting large-scale preventive impacts on total ILI case scenarios.
7. Bringing these factors together, the consistent upward trajectory in ILI trends, alignment with peak season timing, regional virologic and outpatient visit escalations, and growing hospitalization rates provide robust justification for predicting 4188 ILI occurrences in Week49, 2023, as it reflects continued growth patterns progressing into anticipated elevated peak activity.
