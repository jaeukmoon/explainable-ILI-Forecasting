1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1495', '1376', '1469', '1659', '1859']. After a slight drop from 1495 (Week25, 2021) to 1376 (Week26, 2021), there was a steady increase through Week27 (1469), Week28 (1659), and Week29 (1859). This continuous rise in ILI activity by Week29 reflects growing respiratory illness occurrences during this period.
2. A positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the persistent upward trajectory in ILI cases during Weeks27-29, 2021, aligns with a sharper increase to 3178 future occurrences. The sustained growth through the last recorded weeks foreshadows the observed amplification in ILI activity after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased slightly but consistently each week, from 1.2% (Week25 and Week26, 2021) to 1.3% (Week27 and Week28, 2021), reaching 1.7% in Week29, 2021. This gradual rise across weeks, particularly among younger age groups, supports the broader increase in documented respiratory illnesses contributing to the future total of 3178 occurrences.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained above the epidemic thresholds, rising from 6.6% (Week25, 2021) to 7.4% (Week29, 2021). Most deaths were linked to COVID-19, illustrating the elevated baseline respiratory illness burden. This shared burden likely contributed to dampened thresholds for ILI occurrences, matching the future rise in cases.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic complicated data interpretation, as noted throughout all CDC reports. Altered healthcare use patterns and delayed reporting likely led to underestimations of ILI activity that surfaced more prominently in future data, driving the rise to 3178 occurrences after Week29, 2021.
6. Minimal influenza activity and negligible positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% in Week25 and Week27, 2021) show that the ILI rise was primarily driven by non-specific respiratory illnesses and COVID-19 trends documented in simultaneous surveillance assessments. The interplay of these factors amplified ILI counts over time.
7. In summary, the reported 3178 future ILI occurrences (Week34, 2021) result from the consistent upward trend in ILI activity during Weeks27-29, 2021, increasing outpatient ILI visits, persistent PIC mortality above thresholds, shifts in healthcare behavior disrupting reporting, and the impact of non-influenza respiratory illnesses and COVID-19 trends during this period.
