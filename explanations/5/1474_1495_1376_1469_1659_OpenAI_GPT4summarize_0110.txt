1. The reported ILI counts from Week24 to Week28, 2021 are 1474, 1495, 1376, 1469, and 1659. Over these weeks, ILI occurrences showed a stable-to-slightly increasing trend, with minor fluctuations. The counts rose modestly from Week24 (1474) to Week25 (1495), then dipped in Week26 (1376), followed by a steady increase up to Week28 (1659). This incremental rise suggests a transition toward increasing ILI activity.
2. Week33, 2021 falls within the Peak onset season based on the U.S. seasonal patterns, where Peak onset typically spans from Week32 to Week46. During Week28, 2021, low yet slightly rising ILI activity (1.3% outpatient visits) indicates early signs of seasonal buildup, consistent with the beginning of the Peak onset season.
3. Projecting forward from the time-series perspective, the increase in ILI activity observed by Week28 (1659) suggests an ongoing upward momentum influenced by the seasonal shift. Given this historical pattern and the typical onset of higher ILI occurrences during the Peak onset season, a moderate rise is expected over the subsequent five weeks, culminating in the forecasted value of 2751 at Week33, 2021.
4. Nationwide influenza activity was minimal during Week24–Week28, 2021, with positivity rates for respiratory samples below 0.1% (Week24–Week28, 2021 #2). However, slight increases in outpatient visits for ILI across certain age groups (e.g., 5–24 years, Week27, 2021 #3) suggest early signs of activity consistent with seasonal trends.
5. COVID-19 continued to dominate respiratory illness and mortality patterns during Week24–Week28, 2021 (Week24, 2021 #5; Week25, 2021 #5; Week28, 2021 #4). Interactions between co-circulating viruses and shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors attributed to the pandemic complicate data interpretation (Week26, 2021 #6; Week28, 2021 #6). These factors likely contribute indirectly to the observed uptick in ILI activity.
6. Historical influenza trends showed no significant rise in vaccination uptake during Week24–Week28, 2021 (Week25, 2021 #7; Week27, 2021 #8). The absence of substantial vaccination impact alongside low baseline activity supports the gradual rise in ILI occurrences due to the seasonal timeframe and anticipated behavioral shifts during the Peak onset season.
7. In summary, the forecasted 2751 ILI occurrences for Week33, 2021 are justified by a combination of slightly rising historical ILI counts, the seasonal transition into the Peak onset period, the dynamic interplay between influenza and COVID-19, and minimal vaccination coverage effects. These factors collectively align with an expected progressive increase in activity.
