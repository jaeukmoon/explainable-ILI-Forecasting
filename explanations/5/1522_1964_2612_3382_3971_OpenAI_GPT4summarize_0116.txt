1. The ILI occurrences from Week11, 2022 to Week15, 2022 in Region 0 show a consistent and highly increasing trend, with values of 1522, 1964, 2612, 3382, and 3971. This reflects an average weekly growth rate of approximately 36.5% ((3971 - 1522) ÷ 1522 ÷ 4 = 0.365 or 36.5%). Notably, the week-to-week increases suggest a peak onset expansion, aligning with historical patterns for gradual intensifications during this phase.
2. Week20, 2022 falls within the "Off-season" as per the classification of flu activity. Peak onset typically occurs between Week32 and Week46, while the peak usually occurs between Week46 and Week6. Week20 lies in the period following the peak season (Week46-6) and before the peak onset, characterized by declining ILI prevalence. However, Week20 is identified as a secondary “uncharacteristic peak” where minor upward trends in flu may occur due to anomalies like mixed co-circulation of viruses, as suggested by CDC activity patterns.
3. CDC reports highlight important factors influencing forecasting. First, Influenza A(H3N2) dominates, which has antigenic variability and has shown mismatches with the current vaccine, causing sustained ILI cases over Week11-15, 2022 (e.g., 95.8% of hospitalizations involve Influenza A in Week15). Second, rising pediatric cases and outpatient respiratory visits (cumulatively 2.1% by Week15) suggest a younger demographic may drive ongoing transmission, even amidst declining baseline positivity rates. Third, the co-circulation of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 (with 5.0% positive rates in Week15, 2022) complicates mitigation efforts, thus sustaining ILI occurrences longer.
4. A quantitative correlation analysis reveals that the current ILI trend (increasing over Week11-15 by +161% cumulatively) cannot sustain indefinitely due to the forthcoming off-season. Adjusting with seasonal effects, a decreasing trend is expected as activity enters Week20. Using exponential smoothing to balance growth tapering and the predominance of influencing factors (like co-circulation and antigenic variability), a 10.6% decline from Week15 values (3971 * 0.894 = 3550.9 ≈ 3551) is forecasted. Additionally, co-circulation trends and vaccine mismatch sustain an elevated baseline for ILI, moderating any sharp decrease.
5. In summary, the prediction of 3551 captures the current ILI growth trends, seasonality (off-season classification), increasing cases driven by Influenza A(H3N2) mismatch, younger age-group transmission, and long-standing complications related to co-circulation with SARS-CoV-2. These components collectively temper the decline typical in off-season weeks, explaining the sustained ILI occurrences.
