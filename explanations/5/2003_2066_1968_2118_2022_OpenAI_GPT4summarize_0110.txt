1. The ILI occurrences from Week14, 2021 to Week18, 2021 are 2003, 2066, 1968, 2118, and 2022. These show a fluctuating trend, with moderate increases from Week14 (2003) through Week15 (2066), a dip in Week16 (1968), a spike in Week17 (2118), and a slight decline to 2022 in Week18. This pattern indicates no clear sustained upward or downward trajectory, suggesting stable but slightly varying ILI activity during this period.
2. Forecasting the target Week23, 2021, aligns with the off-season. This is because the off-season in the U.S. typically spans well beyond the peak period (Week46 to Week6), including Week23. Additionally, data shows minimal ILI activity (Week14, 2021 #6; Week15, 2021 #9; Week16, 2021 #10; Week17, 2021 #7; Week18, 2021 #12). Influenza positivity rates and outpatient influenza-like visits remain below baseline levels, further identifying this period in the off-season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the minor fluctuations noted in ILI counts between Week14 and Week18, 2021 reflect low-level and inconsistent activity. Projecting forward to Week23, this pattern supports predicting a slightly reduced ILI occurrence of 1934. These stable and low ILI counts, characteristic of off-season trends, imply no significant deviations expected in the short term.
4. Influenza activity has been persistently low throughout the weeks leading up to the target (Week14, 2021 #1; Week15, 2021 #1; Week16, 2021 #1; Week17, 2021 #1; Week18, 2021 #1). The extremely low circulation of influenza during these weeks does not suggest a substantial rise in future ILI cases.
5. Novel influenza strain activity remains minimal, with only scattered reports of rare variants like A(H1N1)v and A(H3N2)v detected (Week14, 2021 #4; Week15, 2021 #3; Week16, 2021 #2). This lack of significant new strain activity contributes to stable, predictable influenza trends.
6. Outpatient respiratory illness visits for ILI remained consistently below the national baseline of 2.6% throughout the preceding weeks and showed no upward momentum (Week14, 2021 #5; Week15, 2021 #6; Week16, 2021 #3; Week17, 2021 #7; Week18, 2021 #4). This suggests minimal community-level spread of ILI, supporting the forecasted low value.
7. In summary, the consistent minor fluctuations in ILI occurrences, the off-season timing of Week23, 2021, persistently low influenza activity and positivity rates, negligible activity in novel influenza strains, and stable outpatient visits align to predict 1934 ILI occurrences after five weeks.
