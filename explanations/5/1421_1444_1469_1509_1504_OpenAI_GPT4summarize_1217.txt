1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks ('1421', '1444', '1469', '1509', '1504') reflect a general upward trend from Week 28, 2024, to Week 32, 2024, with a moderate increase from 1421 to 1509 in the first four weeks and a slight dip to 1504 in Week 32, 2024. This trend suggests a gradual escalation in ILI activity, peaking in Week 31, which correlates with overall elevated respiratory illness occurrences.
2. A positive correlation is observed between the past and future trends, where the gradual rise in ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks culminates in a future spike to 2257 occurrences by Week 37, 2024. The stability in weeks toward the end implies that co-circulating respiratory pathogens preserved activity, maintaining residual ILI momentum over time.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained slightly below baseline yet exhibited a stable rise (from 1.4% in Week 28 to 1.5% in Week 32, 2024). This indicates uninterrupted respiratory presentation in clinics, acting as a precursor factor for the future increase.
4. The persistent co-circulation of multiple pathogens, including Influenza A, Influenza B, COVID-19, and RSV, as repeatedly highlighted in all CDC reports, suggests a compounded impact on ILI occurrences. This interplay likely sustained elevated respiratory cases through fluctuating contributions.
5. Low yet sustained rates of flu positivity (e.g., 0.8% in Week 28, gradually declining to 0.4% in Week 32, 2024) in clinical labs signal flu activity persistence, with Influenza A dominance, particularly H3N2 (e.g., 70% in Week 32, 2024). Despite low overall rates, these sustained presence fractions likely supported the observed increase.
6. The sporadic emergence of avian (H5) and variant Influenza A strains (A(H3N2v)), reported across Weeks 31–32, 2024, highlights novel viral surveillance contributing to regional respiratory illness spikes and future caseload variability.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 2257 (Week 37, 2024) can be attributed to the steady upward trend in past occurrences, consistent outpatient respiratory reporting, co-circulation of multiple pathogens, persistent low flu positivity dominated by Influenza A (H3N2), and isolated but impactful variant or avian influenza cases. Together, these factors fueled escalation beyond the baseline trend.
