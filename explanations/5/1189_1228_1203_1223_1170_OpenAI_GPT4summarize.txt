1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibit a fluctuating trend, with values of ['1189', '1228', '1203', '1223', '1170']. After an initial increase from 1189 (Week 43, 2021) to 1228 (Week 44, 2021), there was a decline to 1203 (Week 45, 2021), a slight rise to 1223 (Week 46, 2021), and a subsequent dip to 1170 (Week 47, 2021). Although the fluctuations indicate variability, the overall pattern suggests stable and minimal ILI activity over the observed period.

2. The correlation between past and future ILI occurrences shows alignment in expected patterns. Despite the stable and steady fluctuations noted in the 5-week past data, the CDC reports predict an impending uptick in flu activity due to increasing Influenza A(H3N2) detections and rising outpatient ILI visits reported in Weeks 46–47, 2021. These trends correlate with the future increase to 2250 occurrences after 5 weeks, signaling a plausible escalation in flu cases.

3. a) Outpatient visits for ILI displayed an incremental upward trend from 1.9% in Week 43, 2021, to 2.4% in Week 47, 2021, reflecting a gradual increase in respiratory illnesses. This aligns with the projection of an increase to 2250 future occurrences.   
   b) The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, with values ranging from 15.6% (Week 43, 2021) to 15.5% (Week 47, 2021). This persistent PIC mortality suggests an underlying rise in respiratory disease activity, reinforcing the anticipated future ILI surge.  
   c) Influenza A(H3N2) emerged as the dominant strain in the summarized reports, with increasing positivity rates—from 0.2% (Week 43, 2021) to 1.5% (Week 47, 2021)—and clustering in age groups and regions. These factors are indicative of a growing influenza season, reflected in a future rise.  
   d) Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, as reported by the CDC, complicates ILI trends; however, their cumulative impact likely contributes to the heightened ILI occurrences projected in the future.

4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 2250 (Week 52, 2021) can be attributed to the combination of stable yet increasing outpatient visits for ILI during Weeks 43–47, persistent PIC mortality above the epidemic threshold, elevated Influenza A(H3N2) activity, and the compounding effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses. While the past time-series ILI data reflected minimal activity, the consistent reports of rising clinical and public health detections signal an impending increase in ILI cases, resulting in the observed surge.
