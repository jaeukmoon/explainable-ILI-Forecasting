1. The time-series ILI counts from Week6 to Week10, 2023 (18554, 17310, 16585, 15411, 14829) exhibit a declining trend over time. ILI occurrences decreased consistently across these five weeks, indicating a steady reduction in influenza-like illness activity. This downward trajectory suggests a transition into a period of reduced influenza prevalence.
2. Week20, 2023 belongs to the off-season period for influenza activity in the U.S. As per historical trends, the off-season starts after the peak season, around Week6, 2023, and persists through Week31, 2023. The low influenza positivity rates and continued declines in key indicators across the last five weeks align with this seasonal classification.
3. The consistently decreasing time-series trend suggests that the ILI occurrences will maintain a gradually declining trajectory over the next five weeks. Based on past patterns and the steady reduction in Week6 through Week10, 2023, it is reasonable to forecast a continued decrease, stabilizing at around 13307 occurrences for Week20, 2023.
4. Nationwide positivity of respiratory specimens for influenza remains low, consistently around or below 1.0% from Week7 to Week10, 2023. This stability, combined with no significant uptick in positivity rates, supports the forecast for low ILI occurrences in Week20, 2023.
5. Influenza vaccination appears effective, as current vaccine strains match well with circulating viruses, and over 99% of tested strains remain susceptible to antiviral treatment (Week6, 2023 #9; Week7, 2023 #7; Week8, 2023 #9; Week9, 2023 #8; Week10, 2023 #9). This factor suppresses transmission and reduces influenza-like illnesses across the population, contributing to the declining ILI trend.
6. Co-circulation of other respiratory illnesses, including SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other pathogens, is noted to influence overall ILI trends without causing significant spikes in influenza activity (Week6, 2023 #13; Week7, 2023 #9; Week8, 2023 #11; Week9, 2023 #11; Week10, 2023 #12). The absence of significant outbreaks or novel influenza variants minimizes potential volatility in ILI trends during the forecasting period.
7. In summary, the steady decline in recent ILI occurrences, off-season classification, low influenza positivity, vaccine success, and absence of novel viral strains or significant outbreaks justify the projected value of 13307 ILI occurrences for Week20, 2023. Stable virus circulation and effective mitigation factors reinforce this prediction.
