1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but general upward trend, with values of ['13895', '15312', '16729', '15058', '17928']. While there was a slight decline in Week 47 (15058), the overall trajectory from Week 44, 2021 (13895) to Week 48, 2021 (17928) underscores an increasing trend in ILI activity, likely driven by rising respiratory illness cases and changing seasonal dynamics.

2. A clear positive correlation between the rising past ILI occurrences and the future occurrences (35304) is observed. The consistent increase leading into Week 48, 2021, sets the stage for the sharp amplification in Week 53, 2021. The end-of-period surge (17928 in Week 48) supports this trajectory, aligning with the subsequent rise to 35304 occurrences after 5 weeks.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased over the observed period, from 2.1% in Week 44, 2021 to 2.5% in Week 48, 2021, reaching the national baseline. This steady climb in ILI-related outpatient visits, especially in younger age groups (5–24 years) and select regions, foreshadows more substantial ILI activity in the coming weeks.

4. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exhibited a consistent increase, from 14.1% in Week 44, 2021 to 17.5% in Week 48, 2021, exceeding epidemic thresholds during the entire period. This escalating trend underlines concurrent respiratory illness activity, reinforcing the likelihood of a subsequent surge in ILI.

5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including Influenza A(H3N2) and SARS-CoV-2, likely contributed to the observed uptick in ILI trends, complicating traditional surveillance methods and paving the way for amplified future occurrences. Increasing Influenza A(H3N2) activity, concentrated initially in younger populations but spreading to other age groups by Week 48, 2021, is particularly noteworthy.

6. In conclusion, the reported 35304 future ILI occurrences (Week 53, 2021) can be attributed to the overall upward trend in past time-series ILI data, rising ILI outpatient visits and PIC mortality, increasing Influenza A(H3N2) circulation, and compounding effects of multiple co-circulating viruses and disrupted surveillance due to COVID-19 impacts.
