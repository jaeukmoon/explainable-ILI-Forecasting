1. The past ILI occurrences over five weeks (Week11, 2021 to Week15, 2021) show an increasing trend. Starting at 1016 in Week11, the values slightly decreased to 1010 in Week12, then rose to 1176 in Week13, followed by significant increases to 1464 in Week14 and 1435 in Week15. On average, the absolute increase between consecutive weeks is approximately 105. Based on this observed trend, the gradual rise reflects the start of possible seasonal fluctuations or other influencing factors.
2. Week20, 2021 falls within the peak onset season. This classification is supported by U.S. influenza seasonality trends from Background Knowledge, where the peak onset season typically begins around Week32 or from Week19 in exceptional years. Given the observed increases in ILI activity in the preceding weeks and the expectation of a gradual rise toward higher flu activity, Week20 corresponds well with this transitional phase.
3. A time-series analysis suggests a historical correlation between the gradual growth of ILI occurrences and the transition to peak onset season activity. By averaging the absolute weekly increases from Weeks11 to Week15 (+6, +166, +288, -29), the net mean growth rate is approximately **107 cases per week**. Extrapolating this weekly growth rate over five weeks (107 × 5 = 535) from the most recent observation (1435), the forecasted value for Week20, 2021 is approximately **1435 + 535 = 1970**. Adjusting for lower-than-normal seasonal influenza activity (as reported by the CDC), a downward adjustment of approximately 6% is applied (1970 × 0.94 ≈ 1856).
4. Three relevant factors from the summarized CDC reports substantiate this projection:
5. 1. CDC anticipates a gradual increase in influenza activity due to overlapping COVID-19 trends and healthcare-seeking behavior shifts (Week11 to Week15 summaries). This expectation supports a continued rise in weekly ILI occurrences.
6. 2. Unusually low nationwide influenza positivity rates (0.1% of specimens), combined with minimal pediatric deaths, indicate lower severity, directly influencing the adjustment from raw projections to reflect suppressed ILI levels (Week11).
7. 3. Seasonal trends and vaccination promotion efforts—despite limited updates—likely moderate the expected rise in ILI occurrences through partial immunity (Week12 and Week14). These efforts indicate controlled expansion rather than an extreme surge, reinforcing a capped growth factor.
5. In summary, the predicted value of 1856 ILI occurrences for Week20, 2021 reflects a steady increase based on past trends, adjusted for expected seasonal activity levels in the peak onset phase. Factors such as low influenza activity, seasonal shifts, and vaccination efforts collectively lead to this tempered forecast, which aligns with historical patterns and CDC guidance.
