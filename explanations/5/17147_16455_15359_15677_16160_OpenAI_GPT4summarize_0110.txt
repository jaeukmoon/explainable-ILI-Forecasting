1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week35 to Week39, 2023 are 17147, 16455, 15359, 15677, and 16160. The trend shows a consistent decline from Week35 (17147) to Week37 (15359), followed by a slight increase in Week38 (15677) and Week39 (16160). This pattern demonstrates a predominantly downward trend initially, with minor fluctuations toward stabilization in Weeks38 and 39.
2. Week44, 2023 belongs to the Peak onset season. According to U.S. seasonal patterns, the Peak onset season typically spans from Week35 to Week46. As of Week39, while activity remains low, subtle increases in certain indicators (e.g., ILI outpatient visits, positivity rate) suggest an approaching rise in influenza activity, consistent with it being the Peak onset phase.
3. The observed trend of steady declines followed by slight increases indicates potential early-season growth resembling the patterns typical of the Peak onset season. Projecting forward five weeks to Week44, 2023, using time-series forecasting, a moderate increase in ILI occurrences aligns with historical trends seen in transition periods leading up to the Peak season.
4. Low but slowly rising positivity rates (0.6% in Week35, 1.0% in Week39), coupled with increasing outpatient ILI visits (from 1.9% in Week35 to 2.1% in Week39), indicate early signs of seasonal influenza activity. The positivity rate’s consistent uptick correlates with the slight occurrence rebound in Week38 and Week39.
5. Regional variations and co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, continue to impact ILI patterns. The co-circulation creates localized spikes, contributing to variability in activity levels and gradual national increases observed during Weeks38 and 39.
6. Although detailed vaccination trends were not provided, CDC urges influenza vaccinations, likely boosting prevention against severe outcomes but not fully preventing moderate rises as influenza activity approaches the Peak onset stage.
7. In summary, the projected value of 23656 for Week44, 2023 reflects the stabilization and gradual increase seen in recent trends, characteristic of the Peak onset season. Rising positivity rates, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and increasing outpatient visits all support moderate growth in ILI occurrences during this transitional phase toward the annual influenza peak.
