1. The ILI occurrences from Week41, 2023 to Week45, 2023 are 1635, 1897, 1895, 2172, and 2707. This pattern demonstrates a steadily increasing trend, with a marked rise from Week44 (2172) to Week45 (2707). This trajectory suggests consistent growth in ILI activity, indicative of entering a more active phase of the influenza season rather than fluctuations or stabilization.
2. Forecasting Week50, 2023 as part of the peak season is appropriate since, in the U.S., peak season generally spans from Week46 through Week6 of the following year. Additionally, increasing influenza positivity rates, outpatient ILI visits, and hospitalizations by Week45, 2023 align with peak season characteristics. The continual rise in ILI occurrences and surging activity further supports this classification.
3. The time-series trend shows a robust linear growth in past ILI occurrences, particularly significant between Week44 and Week45, 2023. Extrapolating this upward momentum toward Week50, 2023, aligns with an expected increase in ILI counts, given historical patterns of intensifying activity as flu season progresses. Projecting this trend forward suggests a strong likelihood of higher ILI counts at Week50, which rationalizes the forecasted value of 4965.
4. Rising flu activity is evident nationally, with positivity rates increasing from 2.3% (Week41, 2023) to 4.0% (Week45, 2023), signaling the broadening influenza spread across regions and contributing to the upward trend in ILI cases. Increasing positivity rates are well-documented in multiple CDC reports (Week45, 2023 #1; Week44, 2023 #1; Week43, 2023 #1).
5. Regional differences in activity levels indicate that locations such as the South Central, Southeast, and West Coast are exhibiting the highest rates of transmission, reflecting regional hotspots contributing to national increases (Week45, 2023 #1, #3). These areas are sustaining elevated ILI activity, supporting a continued rise in national ILI metrics.
6. Influenza hospitalizations continue a steady climb, with cumulative hospitalization rates rising from 0.3 per 100,000 in Week41, 2023 to 1.7 per 100,000 in Week45, 2023 (Week45, 2023 #4; Week44, 2023 #3; Week43, 2023 #4). Elevated hospitalizations signal increasing severity and greater circulation, serving as a precursor to projected higher ILI occurrences.
7. In conclusion, the significant upward time-series trend in past ILI occurrences, the classification of Week50, 2023 as peak season, rising positivity rates, and hospitalizations alongside heightened regional activity collectively justify the forecasted ILI count of 4965. The projection aligns with ongoing seasonal developments and the natural influenza progression during peak season.
