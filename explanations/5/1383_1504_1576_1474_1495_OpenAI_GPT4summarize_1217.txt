1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed fluctuations but limited indications of significant upward trends, with values of ['1383', '1504', '1576', '1474', '1495']. A notable increase was observed from 1383 (Week21, 2021) to 1576 (Week23, 2021), followed by a decline to 1495 (Week25, 2021). This pattern suggests constrained variability without a clear sustained escalation.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 2036 demonstrate a substantial increase compared to past data. This indicates a divergence from the declining or stable trend observed in Weeks 24 and 25, 2021. The correlation is weak, suggesting other external influences beyond the immediate past trajectory are driving this sharp rise.
3. PIC mortality rates consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, from 8.3% (Week21, 2021) to 6.6% (Week25, 2021), driven primarily by COVID-19. This heightened respiratory illness-related mortality reflects overlapping viral activity that may have influenced the future ILI surge. Similarly, healthcare-seeking behavior changes and COVID-19 pandemic disruptions in Weeks 21–25, 2021, created inconsistencies in ILI reporting and interpretation, potentially underestimating actual influenza transmission. Lastly, minimal influenza activity and low positivity rates (<0.1%) across Weeks 21–25, 2021, might have delayed recognition of increasing seasonal flu spread, contributing to the unexpected rise to 2036.
4. The steady PIC-related mortality above epidemic thresholds, healthcare-seeking and data disruptions fueled by COVID-19, and delays in identifying low-level influenza spread collectively explain the future ILI surge. These factors created a lagging effect, contributing to the sharp increase to 2036 occurrences after 5 weeks, despite no significant upward trends in the immediate past data.
