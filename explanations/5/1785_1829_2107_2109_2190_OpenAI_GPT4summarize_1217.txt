1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend: starting from 1785 (Week42, 2021), rising to 1829 in Week43, then increasing significantly to 2107 in Week44, 2109 in Week45, and reaching 2190 in Week46. This steady growth reflects an acceleration of ILI activity, particularly during the latter weeks, with the week-on-week changes prominently indicating rising cases and heightened illness dynamics by the end of the observed period.
2. The correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences suggests that the progressive increase seen in Weeks 44–46, 2021, has continued into the subsequent weeks, culminating in the future ILI total of 2550 by Week51, 2021. The observed pattern of rising ILI occurrences aligns with the increasing healthcare visits, hospitalizations, and lab-confirmed flu cases from past summarized reports, supporting the buildup to the future peak.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI rose steadily during the observed weeks: 1.8% in Week42, 1.9% in Week43, 2.1% in Week44, Week45, and 2.2% in Week46, all close to but below the baseline of 2.5%. These increases reflect growing respiratory illness activity in the population, emphasizing the progressive intensity contributing to future ILI growth.
4. Influenza A(H3N2), dominating reported lab-confirmed cases (e.g., 97.1% in Week45 and 98.4% in Week46), has shown targeted outbreaks among younger populations (ages 5–24). This demographic-driven outbreak, along with localized clustering (e.g., Michigan's Week44 outbreak), likely fueled the reported ILI increase to 2550 occurrences by Week51.
5. Concurrent circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (including SARS-CoV-2) and alterations in healthcare-seeking behaviors (frequently noted in CDC reports) complicated traditional ILI interpretations and data tracking. These factors likely contributed to underreported or underestimated cases during the earlier weeks, resulting in a delayed yet pronounced increase reflected in Week51, 2021.
6. In summary, the future recorded ILI occurrences of 2550 (Week51, 2021) are consistent with and attributable to the steady upward trend in past data, the progressive rise in outpatient ILI percentages, regional and age-specific influenza outbreaks, the dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), and the complex interplay of co-circulating respiratory viruses and pandemic-linked reporting challenges.
