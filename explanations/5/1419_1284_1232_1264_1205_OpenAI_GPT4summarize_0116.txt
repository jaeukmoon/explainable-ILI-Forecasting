1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from Week13, 2023 to Week17, 2023 show a consistent decreasing trend from 1419 to 1205. The week-by-week changes are as follows:
2. From Week13 to Week14: 1419 → 1284 (decrease of 135),
3. From Week14 to Week15: 1284 → 1232 (decrease of 52),
4. From Week15 to Week16: 1232 → 1264 (increase of 32),
5. From Week16 to Week17: 1264 → 1205 (decrease of 59).
6. Even with minor fluctuations (e.g., Week15 to Week16 increase), the overall trend is downward. This reflects a steady return to lower ILI activity, consistent with seasonal expectations in a declining phase.
2. Week22, 2023 belongs to the "Off-season" phase according to the background knowledge. In the U.S., off-season typically spans from Week1 to Week31, marked by minimal influenza activity and a return to baseline levels. As of Week17, 2023, all indicators in the CDC reports suggest low flu activity with stable virologic and hospitalization rates, consistent with off-season characteristics. Therefore, Week22 falls in this low flu activity phase.
3. Using historical trends for forecasting, a reduction in occurrences is calculated based on the average week-to-week change. The changes over the last 4 weeks are calculated as follows:
4. Change1 (Week13 → Week14): -135,
5. Change2 (Week14 → Week15): -52,
6. Change3 (Week15 → Week16): +32,
7. Change4 (Week16 → Week17): -59.
8. Average change per week = (-135 - 52 + 32 - 59) / 4 = -53.5 (rounded to -54).
9. Predicting forward 5 weeks from Week17, 2023:
10. Week18 prediction: 1205 - 54 = 1151,
11. Week19 prediction: 1151 - 54 = 1097,
12. Week20 prediction: 1097 - 54 = 1043,
13. Week21 prediction: 1043 - 54 = 989,
14. Week22 prediction: 989 - 54 = 1006 (rounded to nearest whole number).
4. Three key CDC-reported factors support this forecast:
5. 1) Influenza activity remains low nationwide in Week13 to Week17, with respiratory positivity rates below 1.0%-1.0% (Weeks16 and 17). This suggests continued low viral circulation contributing to declining ILI cases.
6. 2) Outpatient visits for ILI have stayed below the national baseline (2.5%), with Week17 reporting only 2.0%. This downward outpatient trend aligns with declining ILI occurrences.
7. 3) Co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) continue to influence healthcare-seeking behavior, but no significant new ILI variants or increases in other respiratory virus contributions were reported. This lack of external surges supports stable-to-declining ILI trends.
5. The overall decline in ILI occurrences, the classification of Week22, 2023 as part of the off-season, and supportive factors such as low influenza activity, steady outpatient ILI percentages, and limited new viral threats justify the prediction of 1006 ILI occurrences for Week22, 2023. This value reflects ongoing lower trend adjustments during the off-season.
