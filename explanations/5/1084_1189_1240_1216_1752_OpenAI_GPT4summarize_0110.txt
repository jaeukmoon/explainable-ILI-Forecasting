1. The reported ILI counts from Week44 to Week48, 2021 are 1084, 1189, 1240, 1216, and 1752. This data indicates an upward trend, with a significant increase from Week47 (1216) to Week48 (1752). The rising pattern suggests a shifting transition from low activity to a growing influenza presence over these weeks. The steep jump in Week48 implies that ILI activity is accelerating.
2. Based on the season classification, the target Week1, 2022 occurs during the peak season, as it lies within the typical peak period from Week46 of one year through Week6 of the next. The increasing flu activity reported in Weeks47 and 48, 2021, aligns with expectations of heightened transmission during the peak season.
3. Time-series projections suggest that the significant rise in Week48, 2021 (1752) indicates increased flu circulation that could extend into the upcoming weeks. Considering the upward trajectory and the proximity to the peak season, this points toward continuing growth, projecting occurrences to reach 2533 in Week1, 2022.
4. Week48, 2021 reports rising outpatient visits for ILI (2.5%), reaching the national baseline, signaling increasing activity across regions, with some regions already above baseline.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including Influenza A(H3N2), dominate with a growing trend, particularly affecting age groups 5–24, with early signs of increases in adults aged 25+ (Week47, 2021 #10, Week48, 2021 #2).
6. Vaccination trends show effective distribution (166.9M doses by Week48), though uptake is reported to be slightly lower than the previous season (Week48, 2021 #7), possibly leaving more individuals susceptible to infection.
7. In summary, the forecast for 2533 ILI occurrences in Week1, 2022 is driven by the sharp rise in past ILI trends, alignment with the peak flu season, increasing outpatient visits at or above baseline, dominance of A(H3N2) among age groups, and slightly slower vaccine uptake. These factors collectively justify the projection and suggest a high-intensity transmission period.
