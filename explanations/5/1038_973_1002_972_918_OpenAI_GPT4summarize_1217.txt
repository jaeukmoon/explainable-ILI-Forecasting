1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a steady decline, beginning at 1038 (Week11, 2022) and dropping consistently to 918 by Week15, 2022. The sequential values of '1038', '973', '1002', '972', and '918' show a reduction in ILI activity, with some minor fluctuations, such as a slight increase from Week12 to Week13, before continuing the downward trend in subsequent weeks. This persistent decrease suggests declining ILI activity leading up to Week15, 2022.
2. The decline in past ILI occurrences over Weeks11–15, 2022, shows a notable negative correlation with the future ILI occurrences of 762 (Week20, 2022). The consistent downward trajectory in the preceding weeks aligns with the comparatively lower value of 762 observed 5 weeks later, suggesting the continuation of a similar trend in reduced ILI activity over time.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below baseline throughout Weeks11–15, 2022, with only slight increases (1.8% in Week11, 1.9% in Week13, and 2.1% in Week15). Despite these modest increases, the overall below-baseline activity reflects reduced healthcare visits for respiratory illnesses, correlating with the lower future ILI occurrences of 762.
4. Mortality data for pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained slightly above epidemic thresholds across Weeks11–15, fluctuating from 9.1% in Week11 to 7.1% in Week15. The majority of PIC-related deaths were attributed to COVID-19 rather than influenza, further indicating reduced influenza-specific activity contributing to the observed decline in ILI.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, accounted for up to 5.4% of tested specimens in Week12 and 5.0% by Week15. This overlapping viral presence may have dampened the relative contribution of influenza to overall ILI activity.
6. Influenza-associated hospitalizations steadily increased but remained lower than pre-pandemic levels, with weekly rates rising modestly from 6.5 per 100,000 in Week11 to 9.8 per 100,000 in Week15. Such gradual changes in severe cases align with the lower ILI activity observed in the future data.
4. Despite regional variations and the predominance of Influenza A(H3N2), influenza activity displayed signs of declining intensities nationally by Week15, 2022. Vaccination efforts continued, but antigenic mismatches in A(H3N2) strains, observed in the CDC reports, may have limited their effectiveness, contributing to slower progression or plateauing of cases.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 762 in Week20, 2022, are attributable to the consistent decrease in past time-series occurrences, below-baseline outpatient visits, reduced influenza-specific mortality, moderate co-virus activity with influenza, and a lack of meaningful spikes in hospitalization trends during Weeks11–15, 2022. These factors collectively reflect reduced ILI activity that persisted into the subsequent weeks.
