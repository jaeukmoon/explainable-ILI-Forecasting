1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall upward trend, with values of ['1493', '1401', '1559', '1593', '1729']. After an initial dip from 1493 in Week7, 2022, to 1401 in Week8, 2022, the occurrences steadily increased to 1729 by Week11, 2022. This consistent rise in ILI activity toward the later weeks indicates intensifying influenza activity during the observed period.
2. There is a clear positive correlation between the increasing past ILI occurrences and the reported ILI future occurrences of 2309 by Week16, 2022. The consistent rise from 1593 in Week10, 2022, to 1729 in Week11, 2022, suggests a trajectory of continued growth, aligning with the higher future values after 5 weeks.
3. Hospitalizations due to influenza consistently increased across the 5 weeks, rising from 4.9 per 100,000 in Week7, 2022, to 6.5 per 100,000 in Week11, 2022. This ongoing hospitalization rise reflects greater severity and spread of influenza, correlating with the heightened future occurrences. Percent positivity of specimens tested for influenza increased weekly, from 4.2% in Week7, 2022, to 7.7% in Week11, 2022. This steady rise in positive cases supports the observed trend of increasing transmission, leading to the reported future surge. Antigenic differences in H3N2 strains compared to vaccine strains were consistently noted across the weeks, indicating reduced vaccine effectiveness. This mismatch likely contributed to increased influenza spread and subsequently higher future ILI occurrences.
4. Consistent increases in ILI activity, hospitalization trends, influenza positivity rates, and antigenic differences in circulating H3N2 strains—the dominant influenza subtype—formed a synchronized set of factors driving the significant rise in ILI occurrences to 2309 after 5 weeks.
