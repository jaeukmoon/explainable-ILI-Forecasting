1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent and steep upward trend, with values of ['1977', '2104', '2309', '2654', '2895']. Starting from 1977 in Week14, 2022, there was a continuous increase, culminating at 2895 in Week18, 2022. This steady rise reflects significant increases in ILI activity, which likely set the stage for higher future occurrences.
2. A strong positive correlation is evident between the increasing ILI occurrences in Weeks14–18, 2022, and the future value of 3158 after 5 more weeks. The consistent upward trajectory up to Week18 signifies escalating ILI activity, which continues to influence the increase to 3158 occurrences in Week23, 2022.
3. Weekly hospitalization rates escalated from 8.9 per 100,000 in Week14 to 13.4 per 100,000 in Week18, 2022. With hospitalizations rising consistently even at Week18, these trends likely contributed to the sustained increase in future ILI cases. Outpatient respiratory illness visits rose from 2.0% (Week14) to 2.3% (Week18), indicating elevated healthcare visits for respiratory symptoms, which correlated with the reported future increase. Influenza positivity rates in clinical labs grew weekly, starting at 8.4% in Week14 and reaching 8.6% in Week18; this upward virologic trend reflects escalating influenza activity that likely drove future ILI occurrences.
4. Respiratory virus co-circulation, including SARS-CoV-2, was consistently noted across the weeks, with co-infection rates around 5% and increasing regional impacts from multiple agents (e.g., COVID-19, Influenza B). These complex interactions likely amplified ILI activity, contributing to the rise to 3158 occurrences.
5. In summary, the reported 3158 future ILI occurrences (Week23, 2022) are attributable to the clear upward trend in ILI cases during Weeks14–18, increasing hospitalization and outpatient visit rates, rising influenza positivity levels, and the compounding effects of respiratory virus co-circulation during the observation period.
