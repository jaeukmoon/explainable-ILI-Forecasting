1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend, with values of ['1770', '1809', '1954', '2058', '1858']. There was an initial increase from 1770 (Week18, 2022) to 2058 (Week21, 2022), with a peak in Week21, 2022. However, a decline to 1858 occurred in Week22, 2022. This pattern reflects a mixed trend with short-term variability in ILI activity.
2. The observed reduction in ILI occurrences from 1858 (Week22, 2022) to the lower value of 1122 after 5 weeks suggests a sharp decrease, which likely aligns with the decline seen in Week22, reversing the rising trend between Week18 and Week21, 2022. This correlation indicates that the peak observed during Week21 may have been a transitional high before a broader downturn in ILI activity.
3. The percentage of outpatient visits for ILI remained stable or below baseline across the 5 weeks, ranging between 2.3% and 2.4% (Weeks18 through 22, 2022). Despite regional variations, the consistently low levels suggest limited spread of influenza-like symptoms in the population, contributing to the decline in future ILI occurrences.
4. Key factors in the summarized CDC reports directly relate to the decline in ILI activity: (a) SARS-CoV-2 co-infection rates remained consistently low, at 4.3%–4.7%, minimizing compounded respiratory illness impacts; (b) low antigenic match effectiveness of vaccines against H3N2 viruses may have delayed broader population immunity, stabilizing ILI rates; and (c) minimal influenza activity in some regions and reduced positivity rates in Weeks21-22, 2022 (5.7%-5.9%) countered the significant epidemiological spread.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1122 reflect the downturn following the Week21, 2022 peak during Week22, 2022 in alignment with stable outpatient respiratory illness rates, low co-infection percentages, seasonal influenza stability, and regional variability observed in CDC reports. These factors collectively explain the reduced ILI activity 5 weeks into the future.
