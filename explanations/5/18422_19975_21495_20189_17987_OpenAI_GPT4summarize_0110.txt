1. The ILI occurrences from Week31 to Week35, 2021 are 18422, 19975, 21495, 20189, and 17987. The data indicate a peak in Week33 (21495), followed by a decline in Week34 (20189) and Week35 (17987). The overall trend over the five weeks starts with an increase (Week31 to Week33) and transitions into a decreasing pattern (Week34 and Week35). This suggests a fluctuating trajectory with a slight downward trend toward the end of the observation period.
2. Week40, 2021 lies within the peak onset season, as it falls between Week35 and Week46, when ILI activity typically begins to climb from baseline to higher levels. Recent declines in Week34 and Week35 suggest that the activity remains moderate and aligns with the gradual buildup expected of the peak onset season.
3. Historical trends demonstrate an initial increase and then a decrease, which aligns with a fluctuating pattern. These fluctuations are characteristic of periods leading into peak onset seasons, where activity begins to stabilize or slightly recede before potentially rising again. Thus, projecting forward, Week40, 2021 is expected to fall into a moderate activity band, consistent with similar past periods transitioning toward or within the peak onset phase.
4. Influenza circulation remains minimal, as respiratory specimens tested for influenza consistently showed low positivity in Weeks31 through Week35, with week-specific summaries indicating that most ILI increases were driven by non-influenza respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (Week31 #4; Week34 #4; Week35 #4).
5. Healthcare-seeking behaviors continue to influence ILI surveillance, reflecting altered patterns due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This impacts the accuracy of surveillance data, making future ILI predictions more complex (Week31 #8; Week33 #9; Week35 #8).
6. Novel influenza variants such as Influenza A(H1N2)v cases were reported in Week32, 2021, tied to localized exposures. Although there was no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, such incidents underscore the potential for sporadic localized surges that could contribute to slight fluctuations in ILI (Week32 #2; Week32 #9; Week35 #9).
7. In conclusion, the ILI forecast of 11730 for Week40, 2021 is supported by the observed fluctuating trends, moderate activity of non-influenza viruses driving ILI occurrences, and the transitional nature of the peak onset season. While influenza activity remains minimal, the interplay of other respiratory viruses and healthcare-seeking behaviors aligns with the slight downward projection within a moderate activity range, making this forecast reasonable.
