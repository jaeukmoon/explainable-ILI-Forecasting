1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 17–21, 2024) showcased a consistent and sharp decline, with values of ['13960', '13498', '12644', '12615', '12081']. The decline from 13960 (Week 17, 2024) to 12081 (Week 21, 2024) represents an overall reduction of 13.5% across the observed interval, indicating significant waning of ILI activity during this period.
2. A negative correlation is observed between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the declining trend in the past weeks (Week 17 to Week 21, 2024) corresponds to a continued reduction, culminating in a future ILI count of 10087 after 5 weeks (Week 26, 2024). The ongoing decrease provides a predictive signal for the reported lower values in the subsequent period.
3. Respiratory specimen positivity rates decreased consistently, dropping from 3.9% (Week 17, 2024) to 1.7% (Week 21, 2024). This steady decline in influenza detection aligns with reduced ILI occurrences after 5 weeks. Outpatient ILI visits also remained stable below the national baseline (between 2.2%–1.9%, Weeks 17–21, 2024), reflecting lower flu activity. Mortality attributed to influenza exhibited a significant decline, from 0.2% (Weeks 17–18, 2024) to 0.1% (Weeks 19–21, 2024). These reduced mortality and outpatient rates correspond to the diminished future ILI occurrences.
4. High co-circulation of other respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV reported during Weeks 17–21, 2024, suggests ongoing multifactorial contributions to respiratory cases. However, the percentage of lab-confirmed flu-related cases decreased consistently below baseline, reducing influenza-specific ILI activity. Declining hospitalization rates from 9.0 per 100,000 at the peak to 0.2 per 100,000 (Week 20, 2024) also indicate lower healthcare burden, translating to fewer ILI cases. Stable influenza vaccination recommendations without any new trends suggest no significant spikes in preventative measures, which aligns with the observed decline.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 10087 (Week 26, 2024) can be attributed to the consistent downward trajectory in past ILI occurrences (Weeks 17–21, 2024), decreasing lab positivity rates and outpatient visits, reduced influenza-attributed mortality and hospitalization rates, stable vaccination trends, and diminishing flu-specific contributions amidst the co-circulation of respiratory pathogens.
