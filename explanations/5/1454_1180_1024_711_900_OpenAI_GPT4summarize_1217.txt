1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a general downward trend, starting from 1454 in Week 23, 2022, dropping to a low of 711 in Week 25, 2022, and then rising slightly to 900 by Week 27, 2022. This pattern indicates reduced ILI activity initially, followed by a modest uptick toward the end of the observed period.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 782 aligns with the declining trend seen in the earlier weeks, particularly the low levels recorded in Weeks 25 and 27, 2022, where ILI cases dropped drastically. The slight increase to 900 in Week 27 suggests residual activity but does not indicate an overall significant resurgence, consistent with the stabilization at 782 five weeks later.
3. Nationwide influenza activity consistently decreased over Weeks 23 to 27, 2022, with positivity rates falling from 3.4% to 0.7%. The reduction in outpatient visits for ILI from 2.1% in Week 23 to 1.7% in Week 27, combined with declining hospitalization rates (2089 in Week 23 to 751 in Week 27) and minimal geographic spread, supports the subdued future occurrence of 782 cases.
4. Ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses, as reported in Weeks 23 through 27, contributed to ILI activity, but the declining trend and minimal activity across regions suggest their reduced impact on future occurrences. Behavioral adjustments due to the COVID-19 pandemic also tempered healthcare-seeking behaviors, further influencing the ILI data stabilization.
5. In summary, the future occurrence of 782 cases after Week 27, 2022, can be attributed to the general decline in ILI occurrences over Weeks 23–27, diminishing outpatient and hospitalization rates, reduced influenza positivity, and minimal geographic activity. The moderate rise to 900 cases in Week 27 was insufficient to indicate a reversal of the declining trend, leading to stabilization at 782.
