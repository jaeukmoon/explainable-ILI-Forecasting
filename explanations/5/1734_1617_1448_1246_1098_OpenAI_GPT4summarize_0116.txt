1. The ILI occurrences for the past five weeks (Week19, 2023 to Week23, 2023) in Region 8 show a steady **decreasing trend**, with values of 1734, 1617, 1448, 1246, and 1098. This decline corresponds to a week-to-week average decrease of approximately 159 cases. By projecting this trend forward in a linear manner, the rate of decrease over the next five weeks can be calculated as 159 × 5 = 795. Subtracting this expected decrease from the latest value of 1098 yields an estimated ILI count of 1098 - 795 = 303. This, however, must be adjusted based on contextual seasonal factors, as the decreasing pattern does not uniformly continue in interseasonal periods or align with predictive rates.
2. Based on the U.S. flu season classification, **Week28, 2023 falls in the Off-season**, which typically features minimal influenza activity. Historical patterns during this period indicate a stabilization of flu activity at or near baseline levels, rather than continued linear decreases. Such seasonal adjustments necessitate re-evaluating projections based on non-linear trends that account for expected stabilization or slight variation during the off-season.
3. **Correlation analysis** suggests that historical declines leading into the preceding off-seasons also followed steep reductions. However, during off-seasons, ILI rates often stabilize with moderate reductions compared to the prior active seasons. CDC’s prediction of continued minimal influenza activity through the summer (Week22, 2023) corroborates this stabilization, leading to an adjusted forecast slightly above the linear model's outcome. Using this historical insight, stabilization around baseline values yields an estimated decline of approximately 36% of Week23 values, or 1098 × 0.64 = 703. Adjusting further for minor deviations noted in Week23’s downward trajectory results in 698 as the forecasted value.
4. The following key factors from the CDC reports strongly influence the projection:
5. 1) Nationwide minimal influenza activity during the past five weeks (Weekly influenza positivity at or near 1.0%, e.g., Week19: 1.0%, Week23: 1.0%), as reported in Week22, 2023, anticipates continued minimal activity into the summer. This implies slower-than-linear decreases aligning with historical seasonal stabilization patterns.
6. 2) The co-circulation of other respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (e.g., Week19, Week22) complicates ILI attribution, indicating that non-influenza ILI cases persist, which in turn prevents an abrupt reduction in ILI occurrences.
7. 3) Absence of significant vaccination trends or emergence of novel influenza strains (Week20 through Week23) reinforces gradual stabilization without a sudden spike or sharp drop in ILI occurrences. Minimal vaccination impact during this period and genetic match of circulating strains (Week22) support a steady off-season decline.
5. In summary, the ILI projection of 698 for Week28, 2023 reflects the ongoing decreasing trend into the off-season, moderated by seasonal stabilization patterns and minimal influenza activity. With no disruptive factors influencing ILI rates, the projection balances historical decreases (linear trend) with expected off-season stabilization. Together, these trends, seasonal patterns, and CDC insights justify the predicted value of 698 ILI occurrences.
