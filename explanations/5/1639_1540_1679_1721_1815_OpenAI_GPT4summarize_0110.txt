1. The reported ILI counts from Week37 to Week41, 2021 are 1639, 1540, 1679, 1721, and 1815, showing a gradual upward trend across the weeks. The data reflects a steady increase in ILI occurrences, particularly from Week38 (1540) to Week41 (1815), without any pronounced spikes or dips, suggesting a progressive rise indicative of approaching seasonal activity.
2. Forecasting Week46, 2021 falls within the peak onset season, which typically spans Week35 to Week46 annually in the U.S. The continuous increase in ILI trends and the historical seasonality place Week46, 2021 in this phase right before the peak season begins.
3. From a time-series perspective, the continued upward trend in ILI counts over the past five weeks suggests momentum toward further increases in the short term. Extrapolating this trend using historical dynamics of the peak onset season anticipates that ILI occurrences should continue rising moderately, aligning with the projected 2190 cases for Week46, 2021.
4. The prevalence of other respiratory pathogens, particularly COVID-19, remains high (Week37 #3, Week38 #3, Week39 #4, Week40 #6, Week41 #5), contributing to overlapping increases in respiratory illness visits. However, influenza positivity rates remain low (Week40 #1, Week41 #1), mitigating a sharper surge in ILI occurrences.
5. Vaccination efforts remain ongoing, with the CDC emphasizing coverage by the end of October (Week40 #8, Week41 #8), but the lack of updated data on vaccination rates (Week37 #8, Week38 #6, Week39 #8) means its impact on curbing ILI occurrences remains uncertain for upcoming weeks.
6. Healthcare-seeking behaviors influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic continue to affect ILI data interpretation and reporting (Week37 #9, Week38 #7, Week39 #9, Week40 #9, Week41 #10). These behavior shifts may have caused underreporting of true influenza activity, potentially underestimating projected trends.
7. Given the increasing ILI counts over the last five weeks, the alignment of Week46, 2021 with the peak onset season, and contributing factors such as concurrent respiratory virus activity and incomplete vaccination data, the projected value of 2190 ILI occurrences for Week46, 2021 is justified as a continuation of the upward trajectory during this transitional period.
