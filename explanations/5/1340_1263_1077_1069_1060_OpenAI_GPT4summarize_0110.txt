1. The ILI occurrences from Week49, 2020 to Week53, 2020 were 1340, 1263, 1077, 1069, and 1060. This downward trend indicates a consistent decrease in ILI activity over the five weeks, with no indication of recovery or significant spikes, suggesting continued low activity levels leading up to Week5, 2021.
2. Based on the influenza season classification, Week5, 2021 falls within the late peak season, which typically spans Week46 of the prior year to Week6 of the current year. However, due to the consistently low ILI trends and unusually low flu activity (Week49-53, 2020 #1; Week53, 2020 #1), this period behaves more akin to an off-season. Thus, Week5, 2021 is likely within an atypically subdued peak season.
3. Time-series analysis from the past five weeks predicts a further reduction in ILI occurrences. The steady decreases coupled with no upward triggers in behavior or prevalence suggest the ILI occurrence would settle closer to off-season-like values of 586, as projected five weeks forward from Week53, 2020.
4. Nationwide influenza positivity remained exceptionally low, ranging from 0.1% to 0.3% (Week49, 2020 #1; Week53, 2020 #1). This low positivity rate aligns with minimal ILI activity and supports low projections.
5. Altered healthcare-seeking behavior and the dominance of COVID-19 over influenza impact surveillance accuracy and dampen traditional seasonal flu patterns (Week49, 2020 #9; Week52, 2020 #9; Week53, 2020 #9). These changes reduce the ILI counts, as fewer individuals likely seek care for milder influenza symptoms.
6. The low vaccination uptake trend as unreported specifics (Week49, 2020 #8; Week52, 2020 #8; Week53, 2020 #10) and minimal influenza strain circulation (e.g., A(H1N1)pdm09, limited Influenza B—Week53, 2020 #3) constrain opportunities for activity resurgence, further reinforcing the muted forecast.
7. The combination of consistently declining ILI trends, extremely low flu activity (positivity rates and hospitalization counts), the overlapping COVID-19 pandemic’s suppressive effect on flu transmission, and a late subdued peak season align to produce the projected ILI occurrence of 586 for Week5, 2021.
