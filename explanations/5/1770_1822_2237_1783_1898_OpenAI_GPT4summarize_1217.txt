1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited fluctuation but showed a general decline. Starting at 1770 (Week48, 2020), the numbers increased to a peak of 2237 (Week50, 2020), followed by a decrease to 1783 (Week51, 2020) and 1898 (Week52, 2020). This trend reflects sporadic variations in weekly ILI activity without a clear upward or downward trajectory across the full time span.
2. The correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is negative, as the decline from the peak of 2237 in Week50, 2020, to 1783 in Week51, 2020, precedes the reported decrease in future ILI occurrences to 1399 after 5 weeks. The overall reduction by Week52, 2020, aligns with the lower future ILI level.
3. Low percentages of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza (0.1%-0.3% across Weeks48–52, 2020) in the CDC reports indicate minimal viral activity, aligning with the observed drop in future ILI occurrences to 1399.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at 1.6% throughout Weeks48–52, 2020. These values stayed below the national baseline of 2.6%, suggesting a consistent but subdued level of ILI activity contributing to the lower future ILI numbers.
5. Persistent reports of low influenza-associated hospitalizations (e.g., 101 cases total by Week52, 2020) and minimal pediatric influenza mortality (1 death across the 2020–2021 season) underscore a mild ongoing influenza season, consistent with the relatively low future ILI occurrences of 1399.
6. Overall, the reported 1399 future ILI occurrences result from the decline in past time-series data from Week50, 2020, low virologic positivity rates (0.1%-0.3%), stable outpatient ILI percentages at 1.6%, low hospitalization rates, and minimal influenza-attributed mortality. These factors collectively signify a milder influenza season dominated by the impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures, driving down ILI activity over the observed period.
