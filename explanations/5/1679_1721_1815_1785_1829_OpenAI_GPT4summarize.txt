1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over 5 weeks illustrated a fluctuating but gradual upward trend, with values of ['1679', '1721', '1815', '1785', '1829']. Initial increases were observed from 1679 (Week 39, 2021) to 1815 (Week 41, 2021), followed by a slight dip to 1785 (Week 42, 2021) and a rebound to 1829 (Week 43, 2021). This overall rise highlights an increasing trajectory of ILI activity toward the end of the observed period.  

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the steady rise in ILI activity in later weeks (Weeks 41–43, 2021) corresponds with the further escalation to 2084 future occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 48, 2021). The increasing trajectory in recent weeks acts as a precursor to the amplified ILI activity in the future period.  

3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistent at 1.9% (Week 39, 2021), dipped to 1.8% (Weeks 41–42, 2021), and returned to 1.9% by Week 43, 2021. These stable percentages, though below the baseline of 2.5%, reflect continuous respiratory illness activity that aligns with increased future occurrences.  
4. Persistent high percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), ranging from 18.7% (Week 39, 2021) to 15.6% (Week 43, 2021), far exceeded epidemic thresholds throughout the period. This sustained PIC mortality suggests elevated respiratory illness burden, correlating with the rise in future ILI cases.  
5. Minimal influenza positivity rates, ranging from 0.1% (Weeks 40–42, 2021) to 0.2% (Week 43, 2021), indicate limited flu circulation. However, overlapping impacts of other respiratory viruses, healthcare-seeking changes, and the uncertainties introduced by COVID-19 likely influenced the future surge to 2084.  
6. The gradual increase in public health lab influenza detections, from 10 specimens (Week 41, 2021) to 35 specimens (Week 43, 2021), suggests early signs of growing influenza circulation. This trend may contribute to the observed future ILI escalation, despite overall low flu activity.  

7. In summary, the future rise to 2084 ILI occurrences (Week 48, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks 41–43, 2021, stable but persistent ILI outpatient visit percentages, steady PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, initial increases in influenza-positive lab specimens, and overlapping respiratory illness trends compounded by pandemic-related healthcare dynamics.
