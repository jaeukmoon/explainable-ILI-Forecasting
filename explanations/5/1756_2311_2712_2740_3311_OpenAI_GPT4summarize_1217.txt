1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, from 1756 (Week 4, 2024) to 2311 (Week 5, 2024), 2712 (Week 6, 2024), 2740 (Week 7, 2024), and peaking at 3311 (Week 8, 2024). This sustained increase highlighted progressive intensification in ILI activity throughout the observed period.
2. A strong correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences. The peak value of 3311 in Week 8, 2024, was followed by a subsequent reduction to 1747 after 5 weeks (Week 13, 2024). This decline indicates the resolution of the previously escalating trend, consistent with seasonal flu patterns and plateauing activity suggested in the past data.
3. Outpatient ILI visits remained above baseline, peaking at 4.5% in Weeks 6–7, 2024, before slightly decreasing to 4.4% in Week 8, 2024. This pattern demonstrates a high but stabilizing level of ILI cases in healthcare settings, likely a precursor to the observed future decline in cases.
4. Hospitalization rates increased steadily, from 47.8 per 100,000 in Week 4, 2024, to 61.5 per 100,000 in Week 8, 2024, with older adults most impacted. Past weeks' surges in hospitalizations suggest flu severity peaked but began stabilizing by Week 8, contributing to the subsequent drop in Week 13, 2024.
5. Influenza virus positivity rates in clinical labs decreased slightly from 15.7% in Week 6, 2024, to 14.2% in Week 8, 2024, marking a shift toward reduced transmission by the end of the observed period. Concurrent declines in influenza-associated deaths further align with the declining trend in ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 1747 (Week 13, 2024) results from the stabilization observed in Weeks 7–8, 2024, following the peak in Weeks 5–6, 2024. The reduction was influenced by diminishing outpatient ILI visits, tapering hospitalization rates, and declining influenza positivity, all indicative of waning flu activity.
