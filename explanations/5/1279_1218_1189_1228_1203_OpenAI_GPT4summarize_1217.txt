1. The past time-series ILI occurrences suggested a mostly stable and slightly fluctuating trend with values ['1279', '1218', '1189', '1228', '1203']. While the data does not indicate a substantial increase or decrease over the five weeks, minor oscillations are apparent, with Week 41, 2021 at 1279, followed by slight declines to Week 43, 2021, before a mild rebound in Week 44 and subsequent drop in Week 45, 2021. This relatively stable pattern aligns with the reported low influenza activity during this period.
2. A weak positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences can be deduced. Although past ILI trends remain stable with minor fluctuations, the relatively higher future occurrence of 1437 after five weeks may reflect gradual intensification in conjunction with the slight upticks noted in Weeks 44 and 45, 2021, and increasing influenza positivity in lab reports during those weeks.
3. Influences from summarized reports may include: (a) Progressive increases in public health influenza detections, with positivity rates climbing from 0.1% (Week 41-42, 2021) to 0.7% by Week 45, 2021, coupled with dominant H3N2 circulation. (b) Rising outpatient visits for ILI (from 1.8% in Week 41, 2021, to 2.1% by Week 45, 2021), particularly in the 0–4 and 5–24 age groups, hinting at growing respiratory illness trends. (c) A notable outbreak in Michigan (Week 44, 2021) contributing to a spike in H3N2 cases, capturing regional intensification. (d) Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, contributing to increases in non-specific ILI activity.
4. PIC deaths consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds over the five weeks, starting at 17.5% (Week 41, 2021) and declining to 14.4% (Week 45, 2021), with COVID-19 remaining a key driver. This sustained excess mortality signals heightened respiratory illness activity that correlates with future surges.
5. Structural reporting challenges and behavioral changes due to COVID-19, as indicated in all weeks, impaired traditional ILI data accuracy, possibly underestimating current occurrences and inflating future values. Additionally, discrepancies in age-specific and regional reporting lagged behind the growing trend in detected influenza activity by the end of Week 45, 2021.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1437 (Week 50, 2021) are driven by a gradual build-up in laboratory-confirmed influenza positivity, rising outpatient visits for ILI, localized outbreaks in certain age groups, compounding effects of COVID-19, and surveillance/reporting shifts, despite a stable past time-series trend over five weeks.
