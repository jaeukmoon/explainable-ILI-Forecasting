1. The time-series data of past ILI occurrences for Region 4 from Week22, 2024 to Week26, 2024 shows a fluctuating but overall decreasing trend. The values are 12014, 11077, 9910, 9946, and 10087. From Week22 to Week24, a consistent decline in occurrences is evident; however, Week25 shows a slight rise from 9910 to 9946, followed by a further increase to 10087 in Week26. This suggests a moderate recovery from a declining trend. The weekly rates decreased by approximately -7.8% (Week22 to Week23), -10.5% (Week23 to Week24), and then shifted towards positive growth with +0.4% (Week24 to Week25) and +1.4% (Week25 to Week26). This indicates the deviations are small but trending toward stabilization, with fluctuations likely influenced by seasonal factors and co-circulating respiratory viruses (COVID-19, RSV).
2. Season Classification: Week31, 2024 falls in the Off-season (from Week9, 2024 to Week31, 2024) based on historical U.S. flu season data, as it aligns with a period of minimal influenza activity. The Off-season typically sees ILI occurrences near baseline levels with no imminent spikes, coinciding with the data and CDC reports indicating low influenza activity and stable trends in hospitalization, outpatient visits, and respiratory illnesses.
3. Correlation analysis: The ILI occurrences exhibit moderate short-term fluctuations, primarily governed by external variables like influenza subvariant circulation, vaccination coverage, and co-existing seasonal respiratory viruses. Using a weighted rolling average (to account for slow stabilization), the following approach is applied:
4. - Compute the simple average for the past 5 weeks: (12014 + 11077 + 9910 + 9946 + 10087) ÷ 5 = 10606.8.
5. - Adjust for recent increases: The last two weeks (9946 and 10087) show a +1.4% stabilization in ILI occurrences after prior declines. To account for potential stabilization, an adjustment factor of +3.0% is added to the average, resulting in 10606.8 × 1.03 = 10925.01.
6. - Therefore, the ILI projection lands at approximately 10927 after rounding to represent the predicted occurrences for Week31, 2024.
4. Factors from the CDC reports:
5. - Vaccination effectiveness and coverage: Reports from Week22 through Week26, 2024 confirm that most circulating influenza variants exhibit high antigenic similarity to vaccine strains, suggesting effective vaccine protection and minimal risk of widespread outbreaks. However, vaccination trends are not detailed, and co-circulating viruses (RSV, SARS-CoV-2) could contribute to localized spikes, aligning with the moderating uptick from Week25 to Week26.
6. - Overall low influenza activity: Reports consistently documented below-baseline rates of outpatient visits and low hospitalization rates (e.g., 0.2 per 100,000 in Week22 decreasing to 0.1 per 100,000 in Week26). These metrics reinforce an Off-season context, suggesting that the current trend toward stabilization is consistent with sustained low activity levels.
7. - Co-circulating respiratory viruses: The presence of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV within the same timeframe influences respiratory trends. For example, Week25 reports novel Influenza A(H1N2)v and outbreak-linked A(H5N1), emphasizing potential localized rebounds. This aligns with the subtle uptick in past ILI occurrences and underpins the expected stabilizing effect seen at 10927 in severity.
5. In summary, the prediction of 10927 ILI occurrences for Week31, 2024 reflects a combination of time-series pattern stabilization, the Off-season classification, sustained low influenza activity, and minimal hospitalization trends reported by the CDC. Localized variation influenced by co-circulating respiratory viruses contributes to the upward stabilization observed toward Week26. Quantitative adjustments, including rolling averages and slight upward corrections for stabilization trends (+3%), justify the predicted value, which aligns with public health expectations during the Off-season.
