1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['11544', '9899', '8238', '6649', '6169']. Week13, 2024, marked the highest value (11544), followed by Week14 (9899), Week15 (8238), and Week16 (6649), reaching its lowest point at Week17, 2024 (6169). This decline across all 5 weeks reflects a steady decrease in ILI activity nationally.
2. A strong negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed. The consistent declining trend in past data (Week13–Week17, 2024), particularly nearing Week17 (6169), aligns with the further reduction to 3520 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks. The drop in activity leading into Week17 serves as a precursor to the substantially lower level seen 5 weeks later.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI declined from 3.0% in Week13, 2024, to 2.2% in Week17, 2024, consistently decreasing below the national baseline over the period. This mirrors the decrease in ILI activity and supports the observed reduction in future occurrences to 3520.
4. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza steadily declined from 9.1% (Week13, 2024) to 3.9% (Week17, 2024). With proportions of Influenza A and B maintaining relatively stable distributions, the decrease in specimen positivity reflects diminished transmission and aligns with reduced ILI activity in subsequent weeks.
5. Cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza showed minor increases from 74.2 per 100,000 (Week13, 2024) to 79.8 per 100,000 (Week17, 2024), but weekly admissions decreased consistently. This pattern indicates diminishing severe cases, correlating with overall reduced ILI activity and the drop to 3520 future occurrences.
6. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, persisted throughout Weeks13–17, 2024, but their gradual decline in impact contributed to lower respiratory illness levels overall. Regional activity variability and high-priority vaccination recommendations bolstered efforts to contain further spread, supporting the observed drop in ILI cases to 3520.
7. In summary, the reported 3520 future ILI occurrences (Week22, 2024) can be attributed to the consistent 5-week decline in ILI occurrences, reductions in outpatient visits, decreasing respiratory specimen positivity rates, stabilization of influenza-associated hospitalizations, and the diminishing impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses, reflecting a broader trend of declining respiratory illness activity nationally.
