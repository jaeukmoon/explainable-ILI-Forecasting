1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Week 52, 2021 to Week 4, 2022) showed a substantial and consistent decline, with values decreasing week by week from 11,653 in Week 52, 2021, to 9,458 in Week 1, 2022, to 7,190 in Week 2, 2022, further dropping to 5,344 in Week 3, 2022, and reaching 3,944 in Week 4, 2022. This continuous downward trend reflects a significant decrease in ILI activity over this period.

2. A strong negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The declining trend observed over the 5 weeks (Week 52, 2021 to Week 4, 2022) aligns with the continuation of lower ILI occurrences, culminating in 3,671 cases reported after 5 weeks (Week 9, 2022). The steady reduction in ILI cases over the past weeks serves as a direct precursor to the relatively moderate level of future ILI activity.

3. Multiple factors from the summarized CDC reports correlate with the shift in ILI activity. Firstly, outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses showed a downward trend, declining from 4.8% in Week 52, 2021, to 3.5% in Week 2, 2022, and further to 2.0% in Week 4, 2022, indicating reduced healthcare-seeking behavior for ILI or related conditions. Secondly, influenza positivity rates in clinical labs decreased sharply, from 3.8% (Week 52, 2021) to 1.7% (Week 4, 2022), signaling reduced influenza virus circulation. Lastly, vaccination coverage remained lower than the previous season but provided some level of protection against severe influenza cases, potentially mitigating future ILI spikes.

4. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 3,671 (Week 9, 2022) is largely attributable to the sustained decline in ILI activity over the past 5 weeks (Week 52, 2021 to Week 4, 2022), decreased outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses, a drop in flu positivity rates, and the mitigating impact of flu vaccination, although coverage was relatively low. These combined factors contributed to the moderate level of future ILI cases reported.
