1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1115', '916', '783', '757', '586']. This decline began with 1115 (Week1, 2021) and steeply dropped to 586 by Week5, 2021, representing a sharp reduction in ILI occurrences over the period, likely indicative of overall suppressed influenza transmission and reduced respiratory illness activity.
2. There is a negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences. The steady decline in the past time-series ILI data (Weeks1–5, 2021) contrasts with the subsequent rise to 698 occurrences 5 weeks later. The suppressed ILI activity in Weeks1–5 may have created conditions for a delayed rebound due to unpredictable trends amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily decreased from 1.7% (Week1, 2021) to 1.1% (Weeks4 and 5, 2021), remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%. This reduction in healthcare-seeking for ILI over 5 weeks indicates suppressed ILI activity, which likely contributed to the potential for a slight recovery in future occurrences, as reflected in the 698 cases.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) fluctuated but remained significantly elevated, ranging from 17.2% (Week1, 2021) to a peak of 28.4% (Week4, 2021) and settling at 25.0% (Week5, 2021). Despite being primarily driven by COVID-19, persistently high PIC mortality reflects increased respiratory illness activity, indirectly correlated with the eventual uptick in future ILI cases.
5. The ongoing influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare-seeking behaviors, low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.4% in Week1 and 0.1% in Weeks4–5, 2021), and uncertainties in surveillance and reporting disrupted influenza trends, complicating predictions and potentially amplifying ILI activity after a suppressed baseline, contributing to the observed future rise to 698.
6. In summary, the reported 698 future ILI occurrences (5 weeks later) can be attributed to suppressed past ILI trends, declining outpatient visits, fluctuating but elevated PIC mortality, and compounding influences of pandemic-driven disruptions that created conditions for a modest rebound in ILI activity.
