1. The reported ILI counts from Week18 to Week22, 2021 are 2022, 2012, 2114, 1933, and 1867. The trend shows a slight decline overall from Week18 (2022) to Week22 (1867), with a minor uptick in Week20 (2114). This fluctuation indicates a generally decreasing trend with stable low activity rather than any significant spikes or sustained increases.
2. Forecasting that Week27, 2021 belongs to the off-season is supported by the timing and context. Historically, off-season extends from the end of the peak season to the next peak onset season (Week01–Week31). The summarized CDC reports from Week18 to Week22, 2021 consistently indicate minimal influenza activity, with ILI percentages far below the national baseline (e.g., Week18, 2021 #4; Week19, 2021 #7; Week22, 2021 #1). This aligns Week27, 2021 with the off-season classification.
3. The decreasing trend observed in the past five weeks suggests that ILI occurrences are likely to remain stable or decline slightly over the subsequent period. In time-series forecasting models, historical patterns are often projected forward. Given the lack of any substantial uptick and consistent reports of minimal activity, the forecast anticipates a slight increase in ILI occurrences reaching 2482 in Week27, 2021. This reflects minor fluctuations but remains within the bounds of minimal activity expectations.
4. Sustained low ILI positivity rates over the past weeks (e.g., 0.1% consistently from Week18 to Week20, 2021), combined with ongoing minimal outpatient respiratory illness visits (Week18, 2021 #4; Week19, 2021 #7; Week21, 2021 #1), indicate a continued reduced transmission environment.
5. Novel Influenza A variant detections, such as H1N2v (Week20, 2021 #7) and other variants (Week21, 2021 #3), have not led to human-to-human transmission based on available data. While novel strains are important for surveillance, their limited circulation suggests no significant impact on ILI trends for Week27, 2021.
6. COVID-19’s dominance in healthcare-seeking behaviors (Week18, 2021 #9; Week21, 2021 #7; Week22, 2021 #7) continues to skew traditional ILI surveillance. This factor is critical in adjusting expectations, as current ILI counts could reflect some overlap with COVID-19 cases, complicating influenza-specific activity predictions. Nonetheless, the consistent low influenza positivity remains an indicator of minimal direct flu impact.
7. The projected ILI count of 2482 for Week27, 2021 is justified by the combination of a decreasing time-series trend, typical off-season timing, and strong CDC indicators of minimal flu activity. The dominant role of COVID-19 in healthcare impacts, alongside stable low hospitalization and positivity rates, supports the prediction of minor increases in ILI counts as part of a general stabilization within the off-season context.
