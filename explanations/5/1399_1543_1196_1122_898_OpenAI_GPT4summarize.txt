1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 24–28, 2022) revealed a consistent downward trend with values of ['1399', '1543', '1196', '1122', '898']. Starting at 1399 in Week 24, 2022, the ILI count peaked at 1543 in Week 25, only to decline steadily afterward, reaching a low of 898 in Week 28. This trend indicates a significant reduction in ILI activity by the end of the observed period.

2. The downward trajectory in past ILI occurrences correlates with the lower future ILI occurrences of 661 after 5 weeks (approximately Week 33, 2022). The declining trend observed during Weeks 26–28, 2022, is a precursor to continued lower ILI activity, as evidenced by the future count. This correlation suggests sustained suppression of respiratory illness activity over these weeks.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a gradual decline during Weeks 24–28, 2022, moving from 1.9% (Week 24, 2022), 1.8% (Week 25), 1.7% (Weeks 26 and 27), to 1.6% in Week 28. This steady decrease in ILI visits, especially as they dipped below the national baseline in Week 28, aligns closely with the reduction in future occurrences.

4. Flu positivity rates in clinical labs significantly decreased across the observed period, starting from 2.5% in Week 24, 2022, and dropping to only 0.7% in Weeks 27 and 28. Lower test positivity rates mirror the diminished influenza activity and reduced likelihood of ILI transmission.

5. The co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, as documented in Week 28, 2022, complicates interpretation but suggests these competing pathogens may have limited the dominance of influenza-specific ILI cases or diluted ILI trends during this period. This reflects the low ILI activity and corresponds with the future decrease in occurrences.

6. Persistent alterations in healthcare-seeking behavior due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as emphasized throughout Weeks 24–28, 2022, contributed to reduced ILI reporting and potentially undercounted ILI cases. These disruptions likely impacted the observed downward trend in ILI and subsequent decline to 661 future occurrences.

7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence of 661 (approximately Week 33, 2022) can be explained by the clear downward trend in Weeks 24–28, 2022, decreasing outpatient visits, reduced influenza positivity rates, co-circulation of respiratory pathogens limiting ILI dominance, and the impact of pandemic-altered healthcare-seeking behaviors on reporting trends.
