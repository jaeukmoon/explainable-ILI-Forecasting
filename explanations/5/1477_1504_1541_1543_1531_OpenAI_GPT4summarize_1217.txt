1. The past time-series ILI occurrences during the 5 weeks showed a subtle upward fluctuation, with values ['1477', '1504', '1541', '1543', '1531']. While the increase was not entirely linear, a general upward trend is observable, peaking at 1543 in Week 33, 2021, before slightly dipping to 1531 in Week 34, 2021. This overall rise suggests increased ILI activity leading up to the future occurrence period.
2. A positive correlation is present between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the gradually rising figures from Week 30 to Week 33, 2021, align with the reported increase to 1978 occurrences (Week 39, 2021). The consistent higher values in the later weeks (Weeks 32–34, 2021) act as indicators of heightened respiratory illness trends contributing to this future surge.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily increased across the weeks, progressing from 1.9% in Week 30, 2021, to 2.2% by Week 34, 2021. Rising ILI percentages among the 0–4 and 5–24 age groups notably contributed to this trend, underlying potential drivers of the elevated future ILI count.
4. Death percentages attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) escalated significantly during the observation period, from 9.0% in Week 30, 2021, to 19.4% in Week 34, 2021. This consistent increase above the epidemic threshold reflects concurrent respiratory illness burdens that likely influenced the upward trajectory of future ILI activity.
5. Pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare-seeking patterns, as emphasized throughout the weeks, impacted ILI surveillance and reliability. These changes, alongside the heightened activity of non-influenza respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2, likely compounded the increase in reported ILI occurrences to 1978 (Week 39, 2021).
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1978 (Week 39, 2021) are attributable to the rising past ILI numbers, increasing outpatient visits across age groups, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, pandemic-driven surveillance challenges, and overlapping impacts from non-flu respiratory illnesses during the observation period.
