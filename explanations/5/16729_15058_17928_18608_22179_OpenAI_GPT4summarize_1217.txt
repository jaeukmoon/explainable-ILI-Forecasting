1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks revealed an overall upward trend, with the following values: ['16729', '15058', '17928', '18608', '22179']. While Week46, 2021 (16729), to Week47, 2021 (15058), showed a decrease, the subsequent weeks exhibited consistent increases—Week48, 2021 (17928) to Week49, 2021 (18608), and then a significant rise in Week50, 2021 (22179). This demonstrates a growing trend in ILI activity over time, particularly in the latter weeks.
2. A strong correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the upward trajectory observed in Week48–50, 2021, directly aligns with the reported future ILI occurrences of 18431 after 5 weeks. The notable increase in Week50 (22179), the peak of the observed period, suggests momentum in ILI activity that corresponds to the reported future occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI rose steadily, from 2.2% in Week46, 2021, to 3.1% in Week50, 2021, surpassing the national baseline. This upward trend in outpatient ILI activity signifies increasing respiratory illness cases, supporting the rise in future ILI occurrences.
4. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed the epidemic threshold, increasing from 14.5% in Week46, 2021, to 18.8% in Week50, 2021. This persistent excess of PIC mortality suggests heightened respiratory illness severity, aligning with the reported increases in ILI cases after 5 weeks.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including influenza A(H3N2) and other pathogens, was reported weekly. As ILI involves non-specific respiratory symptoms, these co-circulating illnesses likely contributed to the observed rise, with Week50, 2021, marking intensified flu contributions (evident from 5.6% positive tests for flu).
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 18431 can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks48–50, 2021, rising outpatient ILI visits exceeding baseline levels, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and the intensification of co-circulating respiratory viruses—particularly influenza A(H3N2)—as observed in Week50.
