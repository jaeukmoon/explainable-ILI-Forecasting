1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a steady and marked upward trend, with values rising from '1635' (Week 41, 2023) to '2707' (Week 45, 2023). Over this period, Week 42 saw a minor fluctuation but remained close to Week 41 levels ('1897' and '1895' respectively). However, a pronounced increase began in Week 43 with '2172' and culminated in the highest five-week value of '2707' in Week 45, 2023. This escalating trend signals an intensification of ILI cases over the observed weeks, setting the stage for future increases.
2. A strong positive correlation between the past and future ILI trends is evident. The consistent upward trajectory in Weeks 43–45, 2023, mirrors the reported significant rise to '4965' future occurrences by Week 50, 2023. The continuous growth in past data reflects an ongoing amplification of ILI case numbers, which aligns seamlessly with the observed future escalation.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a steady increase over the 5-week period, moving from 2.3% (Week 41, 2023) to 3.5% (Week 45, 2023). This progression not only surpassed the national baseline of 2.9% by Week 44, 2023, but also demonstrates rising healthcare utilization for respiratory illnesses, closely correlating with the substantial increase in future ILI occurrences.
4. Hospitalization rates and influenza positivity also increased steadily, with hospitalization rates starting at 0.3 per 100,000 (Week 41, 2023), rising consistently to 1.7 per 100,000 by Week 45, 2023. Lab positivity rates climbed from 1.3% (Week 41, 2023) to 4.0% (Week 45, 2023). These synchronous patterns underline the compounding effect of increased disease severity and transmission, fueling the projected rise to '4965' future cases.
5. The co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, particularly RSV and SARS-CoV-2, substantially contributed to ILI activity during this period, as indicated by CDC observations of overlapping respiratory disease burdens. Such co-factors likely exacerbated the reported future spike in ILI cases.
4. The marked rise in ILI cases (from '1635' in Week 41, 2023, to '2707' in Week 45, 2023), growing outpatient visits and hospitalization rates, increasing influenza positivity, and the co-circulation of respiratory viruses collectively contributed to the robust future increase to '4965' by Week 50, 2023. These interrelated factors, reflecting both escalating transmission and severity of influenza-like illness, align to explain the sharp rise in future occurrences.
