1. The reported ILI counts from Week47, 2021 to Week51, 2021 are 1216, 1752, 1772, 1874, and 2104. The trend indicates consistent growth over the 5-week period, with a sharp rise in Week48 (1752) and continuing upward momentum. This reflects a steady escalation rather than stabilization or fluctuation. The trajectory suggests increasing flu transmission during this period, aligning with seasonal factors.
2. Based on historical U.S. flu patterns, the peak season generally occurs between Week46 and Week6. Week4, 2022 falls within this window, specifically in the later phase of the peak season. The increasing ILI counts in Week47–Week51, 2021 and continued elevation indicate that Week4, 2022 is consistent with peak season categorization.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent rise in ILI occurrences from Week47, 2021 to Week51, 2021 illustrates an upward trajectory without signs of plateauing. Extrapolating this trend forward, the data anticipates moderated but still elevated levels by Week4, 2022. This historical growth pattern supports the projected ILI count of 1484 after accounting for potential seasonal tapering toward the later stage of the peak season.
4. The summarized CDC reports emphasize several factors influencing future influenza epidemiology:
5. - Influenza A(H3N2) subtype has dominated (Week47–Week51, 2021), comprising nearly all positive cases (98.6%–99.7%), with rising case distributions in adults over 25 years, suggesting broader community transmission.
6. - Flu vaccination uptake shows early signals of being lower compared to the prior season (Week48–Week51, 2021), reducing population immunity and contributing to increased susceptibility during peak flu season.
7. - Increased outpatient respiratory visits (from 2.4% in Week47, 2021 to 3.8% in Week51, 2021) and rising hospitalization rates (e.g., 1.8 per 100,000 in Week51, 2021) highlight escalating influenza burden across regions as the season intensifies.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV (Week47–Week51, 2021), complicates ILI forecasts but reinforces higher transmission dynamics. The ongoing pandemic may alter healthcare-seeking behaviors and underreport ILI trends in some areas, although national patterns suggest sustained growth in flu activity.
6. The eastern and central U.S. report more pronounced virus circulation (Week49–Week51, 2021), contributing to overall national ILI trends, while western states show relatively lower ILI counts, balancing region-dependent variation into the forecast.
7. The projected 1484 ILI occurrences for Week4, 2022 align with the observed rise from past data and the late-peak season timing. The continuous elevation in influenza activity, predominance of A(H3N2) with possible vaccine mismatch, declining immunization rates, and escalating outpatient visits collectively justify moderated but sustained ILI activity at this stage of peak season.
