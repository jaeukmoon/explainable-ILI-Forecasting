1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week22 to Week26, 2022, show a consistent and sharp decline: 1695 (Week22), 1454 (Week23), 1180 (Week24), 1024 (Week25), and 711 (Week26). This indicates a strong downward trend in ILI activity over the five weeks, with no interruptions or fluctuations, suggesting an off-season period of reduced ILI activity.
2. Week31, 2022, falls within the off-season as per U.S. seasonal patterns. Typically, the off-season spans from the end of the peak season to the beginning of the peak onset season. Given the sustained low influenza activity in Week26, 2022, and the ongoing decrease in ILI levels, Week31, 2022, is consistent with the off-season.
3. The time-series data shows a pronounced decline over five weeks. Based on this trend, the time-series forecasting model anticipates a continued decrease in ILI occurrences. By projecting this pattern forward, ILI counts are expected to stabilize close to a minimal baseline in Week31, 2022, leading to the forecast of 769 ILI occurrences.
4. Significant factors from CDC reports influencing the forecast include:
5. - The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza steadily declined, dropping from 5.9% in Week22 to 1.4% in Week26, with Influenza A(H3N2) remaining the dominant strain and no emergence of novel or antigenically significant variants (Week22-Week26, 2022 #1, #2).
6. - Outpatient respiratory illness visits declined consistently (Week22: 2.3%, Week23: 2.1%, Week24: 1.9%, Week25: 1.8%, Week26: 1.7%) and remained well below the national baseline, reflecting reduced community spread during this period (Week22-Week26, 2022 #2, #3, #4).
7. - Minimal influenza activity was observed across most jurisdictions, with hospitalization rates declining significantly from 2,089 cases in Week23 to 964 cases in Week26, consistent with an off-season trajectory (Week22-Week26, 2022 #6, #9).
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses showed no significant upward trend during this period (Week22-Week26, 2022 #9), and healthcare-seeking behavior, though affected by the post-COVID-19 pandemic, did not indicate increased ILI visits or shifts in trends.
6. Vaccination data indicate no substantial uptick in coverage or revised recommendations during this period, while vaccine antigenic compatibility remains stable with circulating strains, partially mitigating ILI spread (Week22-Week26, 2022 #8, #7).
7. In conclusion, the sustained decline in ILI activity (Weeks22-26, 2022), alignment of Week31 with off-season dynamics, reduced influenza testing positivity and outpatient visits, and consistent vaccine impact justify the prediction of 769 ILI occurrences for Week31, 2022.
