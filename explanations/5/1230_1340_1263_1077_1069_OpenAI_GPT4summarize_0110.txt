1. The reported ILI counts from Week48 to Week52, 2020 are 1230, 1340, 1263, 1077, and 1069. The trend initially increased from Week48 (1230) to Week49 (1340) but then consistently declined over the following weeks to Week52 (1069). This indicates a decreasing trend in ILI occurrences, with no significant spikes or fluctuations observed during this period.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans from approximately Week46 to Week6 of the following year. Given that Week4, 2021 falls within this period and influenza activity remains low but stable (Week48, 2020 #9; Week49, 2020 #10; Week50, 2020 #10; Week51, 2020 #10; Week52, 2020 #10), it is classified as part of the peak season.
3. From the time-series perspective, the consistent decline across Weeks48 to Week52, 2020 suggests that the ILI occurrences have been reducing due to suppressed influenza activity. However, influenza activity could experience a moderate rise or leveling off in the peak season due to expected seasonal impacts. By projecting forward from these trends, the future count of 757 is likely attributed to the ongoing atypically low but stable influenza activity.
4. Influenza activity remains unusually low, with less than 0.3% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in all five consecutive weeks (Week48, 2020 #1; Week49, 2020 #1; Week50, 2020 #1; Week51, 2020 #1; Week52, 2020 #1).
5. Persistent disruptions from COVID-19, including masking, distancing, and changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors, have limited influenza transmission and reduced data reliability (Week48, 2020 #10; Week49, 2020 #9; Week50, 2020 #11; Week51, 2020 #8; Week52, 2020 #11).
6. The CDC projects that flu activity could rise in the coming months, but it remains unusually low compared to historical norms at this time of year (Week48, 2020 #9; Week49, 2020 #10; Week50, 2020 #10; Week51, 2020 #10; Week52, 2020 #10).
7. Combining the above factors, the forecasted value of 757 ILI occurrences for Week4, 2021 reflects the continued restrained influenza activity due to pandemic-associated measures and behavioral changes. The modest reduction aligns with historical influenza declines observed during disrupted flu seasons.
