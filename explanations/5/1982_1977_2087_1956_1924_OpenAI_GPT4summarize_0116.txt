1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences of the past 5 weeks (Week12, 2021 to Week16, 2021) show a consistent **slightly decreasing trend**: 1982 → 1977 → 2087 → 1956 → 1924. The increases in Week14 (2087) and subsequent decrease in Week15–16 (1956 and 1924) indicate a fluctuating yet overall declining trend. To forecast Week21, 2021, a linear regression approach was applied. First, we calculated the average weekly rate of change: (1977–1982)/1982 ≈ -0.25%, (2087–1977)/1977 ≈ +5.56%, (1956–2087)/2087 ≈ -6.27%, (1924–1956)/1956 ≈ -1.63%. The average weekly rate of change over the past 4 weeks ≈ (-0.25% + 5.56% - 6.27% - 1.63%)/4 ≈ -0.65%. Applying this average decline over the next 5 weeks to Week16, 2021's value (1924): 1924×(1 - 0.0065)^5 = 1777. This reflects a gradual decline in line with historic trends.
2. Season Classification for Week21, 2021: Based on Background Knowledge, Week21, 2021 is categorized as the **Off-season**, which generally spans from after the Peak season (around Week6) to the next Peak onset season starting in the late summer or early fall. During the Off-season, influenza activity is typically at baseline or near minimal levels. The historical decreasing trend in ILI occurrences leading to Week16, 2021 aligns with Off-season characteristics, further validating this classification.
3. Correlation analysis between historical trends and Week21, 2021 prediction supports continued decline in ILI occurrences. The trend reflects reduced activity with no indication of spikes or significant deviations due to novel external factors. Given the transition into the Off-season, the predictive model assumes continued decline in line with observed historical data, with the weekly -0.65% average rate of decline being a quantitatively significant predictor. The calculation process demonstrates consistency between historical changes and the forecast.
4. Three key factors from CDC reports significantly influencing the prediction:
5. - **Exceptionally low influenza activity:** Over the past five weeks, only 0.1% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza, indicating minimal transmission. This trend aligns with Off-season expectations and influences a continuation of declining ILI activity. Its quantitative impact reinforces the trend, as no notable increase in positive cases alters the outlook.
6. - **Lower hospitalization rates compared to past seasons:** The cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rate (0.8 per 100,000) from Week16, 2021 indicates far fewer cases than even prior low-severity seasons (e.g., 2011-12). This reflects limited spread of severe ILI, implying reduced activity persistently through Week21, 2021. Hospitalization data integrates into trend analysis by validating minimal ILI impact.
7. - **Minimal emergence of novel influenza strains:** Despite the report of three novel influenza A(H1N1)v cases this season (one in Week14, 2021), no notable outbreaks have occurred. This suggests no sudden ILI surge in coming weeks. The absence of novel strains quantitatively supports maintaining the steady decline trend in ILI occurrences.
5. Summary: The forecasted ILI occurrences for Week21, 2021 in Region 2 are 1777. This is driven by a slightly decreasing trend in ILI activity over the past 5 weeks, transitioning into Off-season (characterized by minimal activity), and supported by CDC reports emphasizing low influenza activity, reduced hospitalization rates, and absence of significant strain emergence. The calculation of a -0.65% average weekly decline reflects the quantitative alignment of these factors, ensuring a robust forecast.
