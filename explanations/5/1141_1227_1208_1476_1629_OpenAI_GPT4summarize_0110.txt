1. The past ILI occurrences from Week33 to Week37, 2023 (1141, 1227, 1208, 1476, 1629) indicate a clear upward trend. The weekly counts rose steadily, particularly between Week35 (1208) and Week37 (1629), suggesting growing ILI activity with no significant declines or fluctuations in this timeframe.
2. Forecasting for Week42, 2023 aligns with the Peak onset season as Week42, 2023 occurs within the onset phase, typically ranging from Week35 to Week46 in the U.S. The observations of increasing outpatient ILI visits, rising hospitalization rates, and growing influenza proportions in surveillance reports further validate this seasonal classification.
3. The consistent upward trajectory in ILI cases from Week33 to Week37, 2023 suggests ongoing intensification of influenza activity. Given this trend and the season classification, projecting an increase in ILI occurrences to 2348 by Week42, 2023 aligns with historical patterns and time-series forecasting models.
4. Laboratory surveillance reports (Week33 to Week37, 2023 #1, #2) show an increase in positivity rates for influenza, particularly Influenza A, which constituted the majority of cases. This indicates rising infection rates contributing to higher ILI occurrences in the near-term.
5. Outpatient respiratory illness visit rates rose from 1.5% (Week33, 2023 #4) to 2.0% by Week37, 2023 (#6), particularly among young children, highlighting enhanced transmission within high-risk groups, further driving the forecasted rise in ILI cases.
6. Rising hospitalizations with laboratory-confirmed influenza from 477 (Week33, 2023 #8) to 820 (Week37, 2023 #4) underscore increasing clinical burden and widespread community activity, suggesting an upward trajectory for ILI occurrences.
7. The forecast of 2348 cases in Week42, 2023 corresponds to rising positivity, outpatient visits, and hospitalizations reported in the Peak onset season, coupled with consistent upward trends in prior ILI occurrences. These factors jointly substantiate the expected increase to this level.
