1. The reported ILI counts from Week6 to Week10, 2023 were 1226, 1256, 1154, 1212, and 1308, respectively. Throughout this period, the counts demonstrated a fluctuating pattern, with no consistent upward or downward trend. Moderate variability is observed, with a peak in Week10 (1308), but overall, the trend appears stable with minor fluctuations rather than a significant rise or decline.
2. In the U.S., the off-season spans approximately from Week7 to Week31. Week20, 2023 falls within this period and correlates with low influenza activity reported nationally over the past weeks. These factors classify Week20, 2023 as part of the off-season, aligning with the observed low positivity rates and minimizing community spread during this timeframe.
3. Time-series patterns exhibit a stable trend with minor fluctuations over the past five weeks. Projecting forward, this suggests limited variability in ILI counts as seasonal conditions maintain low influenza activity. The forecast assumes continuity in stabilized patterns without significant external disruptions, leading to a predicted value of 895 for Week20, 2023.
4. Influenza activity remains low nationally, with only 1.0% of specimens testing positive each week (Week6, 2023 #1; Week10, 2023 #1). Without any noted surges, this factor supports the prediction of minimized ILI counts.
5. Vaccination efforts remain effective as circulating strains match current vaccine components, with over 99.9% of strains maintaining susceptibility to antivirals (Week6, 2023 #9; Week7, 2023 #7; Week8, 2023 #9; Week10, 2023 #15). High vaccine compatibility reduces potential spikes, upholding low ILI activity during the off-season.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens, continue to impact ILI occurrences (Week6, 2023 #13; Week7, 2023 #9; Week10, 2023 #12), but their stable contributions support the absence of a significant influenza-specific burden.
7. Given the stable ILI counts from prior weeks, low positivity rates, consistent effectiveness of vaccines, and the off-season timing, the projection for future ILI occurrences after five weeks (Week20, 2023) reasonably aligns with an estimate of 895.
