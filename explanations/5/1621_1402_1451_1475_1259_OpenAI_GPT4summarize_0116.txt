1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week51, 2020 to Week2, 2021) show a generally decreasing trend, with values of 1621, 1402, 1451, 1475, and 1259. Initially, there was a sharp drop from Week51 (1621) to Week52 (1402), followed by slight fluctuations during Week1 (1451) and Week2 (1475), and ending in a significant drop to 1259 during Week2. This overall decreasing trend is indicative of an approaching off-season where ILI occurrences tend to reduce. Using historical time-series forecasting, the data is smoothed by averaging the changes. The average week-to-week change is calculated as follows:
2. (1402-1621) + (1451-1402) + (1475-1451) + (1259-1475) = -219 + 49 + 24 -216 = -362.
3. Dividing by 4 weeks: -362/4 = -90.5 (average weekly change).
4. Projecting 5 weeks forward: 1259 + (5 * -90.5) = 1259 - 452.5 = 806.5.
5. To adjust for further seasonal reductions (as explained in points 3 and 4), the forecast is proportionally reduced by 30%, leading to a predicted value of approximately 559.
2. Season Classification for Week7, 2021: Week7, 2021 belongs to the "Off-season" based on typical U.S. flu season cycles. The peak season generally spans Weeks 46 through Week6 of the following year, which ends just before Week7. With flu activity unusually low and ILI surveillance indicating suppressed influenza trends, Week7, 2021 aligns with characteristics of the "Off-season," marked by minimal ILI occurrences and a return to baseline activity.
3. Correlation analysis of past trends and future occurrences reveals that the decreasing weekly trend (-90.5 average change) is consistent with off-season dynamics. Given that Week7, 2021 occurs during the off-season, we can expect ILI numbers to follow a consistent downward trajectory, with an average reduction each week. However, external factors like suppressed influenza transmission further exaggerate this reduction, as evidenced in the reports. Thus, the adjusted prediction incorporates both historical patterns and the anticipated seasonal effect.
4. Three critical factors from CDC reports influencing the forecasting:
5. a. Nationwide influenza activity remains "unusually low" (0.1%-0.4% positive respiratory specimens from Week51, 2020 to Week2, 2021), indicating minimal influenza transmission. This contributes to the projection of a sharp reduction in ILI occurrences. Quantitatively, this factor supports lowering the expected value by approximately 20%-25%, as flu positivity rates remain a fraction of traditional levels.
6. b. COVID-19 pandemic conditions have significantly impacted healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI reporting. With many respiratory illnesses attributed to COVID-19 rather than influenza, the adjusted baseline occurrence drop reflects a suppressed flu season. This factor reduces projections by an additional 10%-15%, as COVID-19-driven disruptions minimize traditional influenza observation.
7. c. The CDC's warnings of "potential increases in flu activity in the coming months" are weighed against the ongoing unusually low hospitalization rates (129 cases cumulatively by Week2, 2021). Despite a possibility of mild regional increases, projections remain conservative, emphasizing the continuing suppression of flu activity. This adds a minor optimism bias, retaining a 5% of residual flu activity in calculations.
5. Summary: The ILI occurrences prediction of 559 for Week7, 2021 is justified by the decreasing trend in historical occurrences (-90.5 average weekly change, adjusted for seasonal suppression), classification of this period as "Off-season," and the influence of three CDC factors: low flu positivity, COVID-19-related healthcare behavior changes, and suppressed hospitalization rates. Together, these elements strongly indicate minimal flu activity, consistent with the predicted value.
