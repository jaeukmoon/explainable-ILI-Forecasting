1. The reported ILI counts from Week35 to Week39, 2023 are 1208, 1476, 1629, 2035, and 2037. Over the five weeks, a consistent upward trend is observed, with a particularly sharp rise between Week37 (1629) and Week38 (2035). This pattern suggests sustained growth in ILI occurrences, indicative of an expanding respiratory disease burden.
2. The forecasting target week (Week44, 2023) falls within the Peak onset season (from Week35, 2023 to Week46, 2023). During this time, ILI activity traditionally begins its rise toward peak intensity. The trend of increasing ILI occurrences in recent weeks (e.g., Week39, 2023 at 2037) and rising influenza positivity further supports classification within this season.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the steady upward trajectory in ILI occurrences provides a strong indication of continuing growth. By Week39, 2023, no decrease or leveling off is evident, suggesting that community transmission and outpatient visits for ILI will increase over the coming weeks. Given the 19.6% rise from Week37 to Week39, 2023, extrapolated increases align with the projected Week44 estimate of 2743.
4. Several notable factors from the CDC summarized reports contribute to the forecast. (1) The proportion of positive clinical lab specimens for influenza increased from 0.6% (Week35, 2023) to 1.0% (Week39, 2023), indicating a slow but steady rise in influenza activity nationwide. (2) Hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed influenza grew continuously, increasing from 509 in Week35, 2023, to 1,040 in Week39, 2023, further reflecting heightened community spread. (3) Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, is consistently reported (e.g., Week38, 2023 #8; Week39, 2023 #7), amplifying overall ILI activity.
5. Recent outpatient ILI visits slightly surpassed baseline levels, rising from 1.9% (Week35, 2023) to 2.1% (Week39, 2023), with children aged 0-4 years recording the highest rates (Week39, 2023 #3). The increase in pediatric ILI likely amplifies transmission in high-risk settings and contributes to rising occurrences.
6. While influenza activity remains low overall, Influenza A (predominantly H1N1) continues to dominate virologic surveillance (e.g., Week39, 2023 #2), suggesting stable transmissibility. No novel virus or unusual antigenic drift has been detected (Week39, 2023 #7), limiting any abrupt surges but allowing steady growth.
7. In conclusion, the observed rising trend in ILI occurrences, alignment with the Peak onset season, and supportive CDC indicators (e.g., hospitalizations, virologic trends, outpatient visits) collectively justify the projected future ILI count of 2743 for Week44, 2023. This forecast reflects ongoing disease activity driven by influenza and co-circulating respiratory pathogens.
