1. The ILI counts for the past five weeks—Week51, 2023 (17393), Week52, 2023 (18744), Week1, 2024 (16149), Week2, 2024 (15014), and Week3, 2024 (12554)—illustrate a declining trend. After a peak in Week52, 2023 (18744), the ILI counts steadily decreased up to Week3, 2024 (12554), reflecting reduced activity over time. This suggests the wave of influenza activity may be tapering following the peak in late December 2023.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans from Week46 of one year to approximately Week6 of the next. Since target Week8, 2024, occurs right after this typical peak window and aligns with progressively declining counts and CDC reporting lower influenza activity, it is best classified as belonging to the off-season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the steady decline observed in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks indicates a continuation of this trend into the future weeks. Extrapolating from this trajectory, the rate of decline is expected to stabilize as the virus enters the off-season, resulting in ILI occurrences of 11037 in Week8, 2024.
4. Several distinct factors from the CDC reports influence this forecast. First, influenza activity has been stable or declining recently, with positivity rates dropping to 14.2% in Week3, 2024 from a high of 17.5% in Week52, 2023, indicating a downward trend. Second, vaccination efforts are ongoing, with the CDC encouraging late-season protection and vaccine match to circulating strains mitigating risk. Third, co-circulating respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV continue to contribute to ILI trends but are not showing dramatic surges impacting overall influenza trajectories.
5. Despite an earlier peak in Week52, 2023, the decline in hospitalization rates from Week1 (31.7 per 100,000) to Week3, 2024 (43.3 per 100,000 cumulative but decreasing weekly admissions) aligns with reduced influenza transmission and suggests the continued tapering into the off-season.
6. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 remains the predominant strain through Week3, 2024, driving most illnesses and hospitalizations. However, antiviral resistance remains low overall, and public health interventions ensure effective management, further supporting the declining trend.
7. In conclusion, the declining ILI trends over the past five weeks, the off-season classification of the target week, stabilized co-circulating virus activity, and the protective effects of vaccination collectively justify the forecast of 11037 ILI occurrences for Week8, 2024. This estimate reflects the seasonal decline and transition toward minimal influenza activity.
