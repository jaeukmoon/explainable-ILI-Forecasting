1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating trend, with values of ['1089', '1216', '1141', '1227', '1208']. The data reflects an initial rise from 1089 (Week31, 2023) to 1216 (Week32, 2023), a dip to 1141 (Week33, 2023), and then an increase to 1227 (Week34, 2023) followed by a slight drop to 1208 (Week35, 2023). This pattern suggests intermittent fluctuations around a generally moderate activity level.
2. The future occurrence of 2328 aligns with an overall subtle upward trend seen in Weeks 34 and 35, 2023, particularly reinforced by the peak at Week34, indicating ongoing susceptibility for an escalated ILI count. This upward trajectory in later weeks potentially preludes the spike observed 5 weeks later.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI demonstrated consistent increases each week, from 1.1% in Week31 to 1.9% in Week35, with the highest percentages in children aged 0–4 years reaching 7.2% (Week35, 2023). This surge in age-specific outpatient engagement likely contributed to the rise in future ILI occurrences.
4. Hospitalizations also trended upward, progressing from 638 (Week31, 2023) to 509 in Week35. The cumulative increase in case severity alongside higher hospital admissions (e.g., 779 in Week34), despite low positivity rates, indicates an amplified burden from broader respiratory illnesses beyond influenza that likely influenced future ILI rates.
5. PIC mortality rates consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, increasing from 5.9% (Week31, 2023) to a peak of 10.0% (Week33) before stabilizing at 9.6% (Week35). Persistent elevated PIC rates act as a proxy for intensified respiratory illnesses, underscoring the broader context of heightened systemic respiratory disease activity.
6. Despite minimal influenza positivity rates (0.5%–0.8% across weeks) and limited lab-confirmed influenza cases, co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, particularly in children, and altered healthcare-seeking behaviors contributed to the compounded increase in overall ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2328 (Week40, 2023) are attributed to the subtle upward trend observed in Weeks 34–35, increasing outpatient visits among pediatric groups, elevated hospitalizations and PIC mortality, and the influence of non-influenza respiratory virus activity and evolving healthcare dynamics.
