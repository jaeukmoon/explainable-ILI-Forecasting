1. The reported ILI counts from Week18 to Week22, 2022 are 1770, 1809, 1954, 2058, and 1858. Over these weeks, there is an overall increasing trend from Week18 (1770) to a peak in Week21 (2058) followed by a dip in Week22 (1858). This indicates a fluctuating pattern with a general rise in initial weeks but a reduction in Week22, suggesting declining activity.
2. Week27, 2022 aligns with the off-season period for influenza. Based on historical U.S. trends, the off-season typically encompasses Weeks 1–31, characterized by minimal ILI activity. This is supported by declining ILI positivity/activity in the most recent CDC reports (Week20, 2022 #1; Week21, 2022 #1; Week22, 2022 #1), confirming Week27, 2022 as part of the off-season.
3. The historical time series data shows a rising trend (Week18–Week21, 2022) followed by a decline (Week21–Week22, 2022). Extrapolating these fluctuations to subsequent weeks using a time-series forecasting perspective suggests a further decrease, aligning with off-season expectations. This decline informs the forecast for Week27, 2022, projecting ILI activity to drop to 1122 occurrences.
4. Vaccination uptake has been consistent but partial mismatches in H3N2 antigenic characteristics with vaccine strains have reduced effectiveness (Week18, 2022 #8; Week19, 2022 #9; Week21, 2022 #7).
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses and moderate SARS-CoV-2 co-infections persist but remain low in impact relative to influenza positivity (Week18, 2022 #7; Week20, 2022 #8; Week22, 2022 #7).
6. Regional trends in influenza activity are declining, with positivity rates for Influenza A(H3N2) dropping from 8.6% (Week18, 2022 #1) to 5.9% (Week22, 2022 #1). This demonstrates reduced intensity of transmission and aligns with lower projected ILI counts.
7. Considering the observed decline in ILI trends, the off-season designation (Week27, 2022), and influencing factors such as vaccine effectiveness, regional activity, and co-infections, the projection of 1122 ILI occurrences for Week27, 2022 is justified.
