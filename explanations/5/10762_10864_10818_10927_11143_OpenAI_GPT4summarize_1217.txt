1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a gradual and consistent upward trend, with values of ['10762', '10864', '10818', '10927', '11143']. Week28, 2024, had an ILI occurrence of 10762, which peaked at 11143 by Week32, 2024. Despite one minor decline from 10864 (Week29) to 10818 (Week30), the upward trajectory resumed, indicating progressively increasing ILI activity.
2. A positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the steady rise in the last three weeks (Week30–Week32, 2024) aligns with the significant jump to 13311 reported for Week37, 2024. The progressive increase toward the end of the past data suggests an amplifying trend that drove the future ILI rise after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased from 1.4% (Week28, 2024) to 1.5% (Week30-Week32, 2024), which, while below the national baseline, consistently showed subtle upward movements. This aligns with the gradual rise in past ILI occurrences, contributing to the higher future occurrence.
4. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as Influenza A, Influenza B, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV noted throughout Week28–Week32, 2024, likely compounded ILI trends, fueling the higher future ILI rates. Despite low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.8% in Week28 to 0.4% in Week32, 2024), the interplay of multiple pathogens may have driven ILI increases.
5. Surveillance reports indicated low but persistent human infections with novel influenza strains (e.g., Influenza A(H5) and H3N2v) in Week28, Week29, and Week31, 2024. While isolated, these cases heightened vigilance and may have indirectly influenced healthcare-seeking behaviors, contributing to higher future ILI numbers.
6. In summary, the reported 13311 future ILI occurrences in Week37, 2024, are attributable to the steady upward trend in past ILI occurrences, increasing outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses, the co-circulation of various respiratory viruses, and sporadic cases of novel influenza strains influencing ILI trends. These factors together explain the observed rise.
