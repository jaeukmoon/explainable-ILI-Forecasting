1. The reported ILI counts from Week14 to Week18, 2024 are 13338, 13604, 12541, 13258, and 12849. The data indicates an initial increase from Week14 (13338) to Week15 (13604), followed by a notable decline in Week16 (12541). Subsequently, a slight recovery occurred in Week17 (13258), with a mild dip in Week18 (12849). Overall, the trend illustrates a fluctuating yet gradually declining pattern, with no significant spikes suggesting sustained activity.
2. Week23, 2024 aligns with the off-season. Historically in the U.S., the off-season spans from the post-peak season until the next peak onset (e.g., Week9, 2024 to approximately Week30, 2024). CDC reports from Weeks14 to Week18, 2024 underscore declining ILI activity, positivity rates below the national baseline, and no moderate or high ILI activity across jurisdictions. These factors, alongside the seasonal timing, confirm Week23 as part of the off-season.
3. From the time-series perspective, the observed fluctuating but declining trend up to Week18 reflects a steady tapering off of ILI occurrences. Projections based on this pattern suggest continued declines over the subsequent five weeks, consistent with off-season expectations, leading to the estimated value of 11270 ILI occurrences by Week23, 2024.
4. Virus positivity rates have consistently decreased, from 7.7% in Week14, 2024 to 3.1% in Week18, 2024. All jurisdictions demonstrated minimal ILI activity below baseline during this span, with no indications of potential resurgence or novel influenza variants driving an increase. (Week14 #1, #10; Week15 #3, #8; Week18 #1, #9.)
5. Vaccination remains recommended by the CDC, with high antigenic similarity between circulating strains and vaccine components. Though no significant vaccination rate changes were reported in the recent data, the well-matched vaccine contributes to dampened ILI occurrences during the off-season. (Week14 #7; Week15 #6; Week16 #9; Week18 #8.)
6. Co-circulating respiratory pathogens, including COVID-19 and RSV, continue to exert minor influences on overall respiratory illness trends, but their activity has shown no marked escalation in recent weeks. This combined stability reinforces the forecast of declining ILI occurrences. (Week14 #8; Week16 #10; Week17 #7; Week18 #10.)
7. In summary, the combination of a consistently declining trend, off-season classification for Week23, reduced influenza activity across weeks, high vaccine effectiveness, and the absence of significant co-circulating respiratory virus impacts justifies the projection of 11270 ILI occurrences for Week23, 2024.
