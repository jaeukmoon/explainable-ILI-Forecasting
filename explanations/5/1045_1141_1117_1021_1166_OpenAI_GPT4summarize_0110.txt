1. The reported ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks (from Week11 to Week15, 2022) are 1045, 1141, 1117, 1021, and 1166. This time-series reflects fluctuating trends with no consistent upward or downward movement. An initial increase from Week11 (1045) to Week12 (1141) was followed by modest declines and rebounds, peaking slightly in Week15 (1166). The overall pattern suggests mild fluctuations rather than pronounced growth or decline.
2. Forecasting Week20, 2022 falls within the off-season based on U.S. typical influenza patterns. By this week, influenza activity typically reduces significantly, coinciding with lower community spread and reduced positivity in virologic surveillance. Observations from Week11 to Week15, 2022 confirm comparatively lower influenza activity, aligning Week20, 2022 with expected off-season characteristics.
3. The time-series pattern suggests the ILI occurrences are stabilizing with mild fluctuations, without any sharp rise. Extrapolating forward using this trend and five weeks of stability, the anticipated occurrences for Week20, 2022 would reflect continued fluctuation and remain close to this range, resulting in the value of 1954.
4. Regional influenza positivity rates slightly increased nationally, predominantly with A(H3N2), but remain below significant thresholds. Outpatient visits have not exceeded national baselines (Week11, 2022 #4; Week12, 2022 #4; Week13, 2022 #4; Week14, 2022 #4; Week15, 2022 #4).
5. Despite slight antigenic differences in A(H3N2), vaccination programs have continued robustly, with widespread vaccine availability and no reported resistance concerns (Week11, 2022 #7; Week12, 2022 #8; Week13, 2022 #9; Week14, 2022 #8; Week15, 2022 #10). These factors have likely mitigated more substantial influenza activity.
6. SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses continue co-circulation but do not appear to disrupt declining influenza activity. Reported co-infections remain steady (Week11, 2022 #8; Week12, 2022 #9; Week13, 2022 #8; Week14, 2022 #9; Week15, 2022 #11). Such co-circulation trends in prior weeks point to stable ILI levels.
7. Considering stable yet fluctuating past occurrences, off-season timing for Week20, 2022, and no significant indicators of increasing influenza activity, the predicted ILI occurrence reflects steady levels at 1954.
