1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a clear downward trend, with values of ['2084', '1484', '1114', '888', '803']. Week 3, 2022 reported the highest ILI occurrences at 2084, followed by consistent decreases each week, reaching 803 by Week 7, 2022, the lowest in the observed period. This trend reflects a sharp reduction in ILI activity over the 5-week period.
2. A decline in past ILI occurrences correlates with the reduced future ILI occurrences of 973, observed 5 weeks later. The stabilization of occurrences at the lower end of the range (803 in Week 7, 2022) aligns with the relatively low future ILI value, indicating a plateau in activity. However, the slight increase from 803 to 973 suggests residual or persistent illness activity.
3. Several factors from the summarized reports correlate with the future ILI occurrences. First, the circulation of Influenza A(H3N2) (98%-99.7% positivity in Week 7, 2022) with minor antigenic differences from vaccine strains suggests influenza activity persisted at lower levels despite vaccination efforts. Second, lower vaccination coverage across all weeks (Weeks 3–7, 2022) likely contributed to the continued, albeit reduced, ILI occurrences. Third, the co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV and SARS-CoV-2) identified in Weeks 3–7, 2022 may have sustained ILI trends despite a decreasing contribution from influenza alone.
4. Hospitalization rates showed a gradual increase from 4.3 per 100,000 (Week 3, 2022) to 4.9 per 100,000 (Week 7, 2022), primarily driven by older adults (65+ years). This hospitalization trend likely reflects underlying ongoing respiratory virus activity, contributing to the steady future ILI occurrences.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 973 can be attributed to the substantial decline in past ILI activities over the 5-week period (Weeks 3–7, 2022), persistent low-level contributions from Influenza A(H3N2), low vaccination uptake, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and steady hospitalization trends that reflect residual illness activity maintaining moderate ILI levels.
