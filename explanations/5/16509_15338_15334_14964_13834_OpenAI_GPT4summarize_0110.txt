1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week9, 2024 to Week13, 2024 show a clear downward trend: 16509 (Week9), 15338 (Week10), 15334 (Week11), 14964 (Week12), and 13834 (Week13). This steady decline indicates a waning flu season without sharp fluctuations or unexpected spikes.
2. The target week (Week18, 2024) is part of the off-season based on the U.S. influenza activity timeline. The off-season typically spans from after the peak season (Week6–Week8) and continues until the next peak onset season (around Week32). The ILI decline observed through Week13 aligns with off-season characteristics of reduced flu activity and minimal community spread.
3. The time-series trend supports the projection to Week18, 2024. Continuing from the consistent pattern of decreasing occurrences across Week9 to Week13, the reduced rate of ILI occurrences suggests that the data will stabilize at lower levels within the next five weeks. This aligns with the anticipated decline to 12849 in Week18, a figure consistent with historical decline curves observed in off-season trends.
4. Influenza activity is gradually decreasing nationally (Week11 to Week13, 2024), with declining outpatient respiratory illness visits (Week9 #3, Week12 #5, Week13 #7) and percentage positivity for influenza testing, from 13.9% (Week9, 2024 #1) to 9.1% (Week13, 2024 #1). These declines signal reduced virus circulation heading into the off-season.
5. Vaccination remains effective against circulating strains (Week9 #8, Week10 #10, Week12 #9, Week13 #9), and antivirals show low resistance rates (Week9 #9, Week10 #8, Week12 #8, Week13 #10). Consistent vaccine coverage is reducing infection severity and occurrence, supporting lower ILI trends moving forward.
6. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, is reported throughout these weeks (Week9 #10, Week11 #10, Week12 #8, Week13 #11). However, their combined effect does not appear to be substantial enough to drive major ILI increases. Moreover, a novel strain (A(H1N2)v) and an avian strain (A(H5N1)) lack significant transmission risks, further stabilizing the downward ILI trend (Week12 #6, Week13 #4).
7. In summary, the prediction of 12849 future ILI occurrences by Week18, 2024 reflects the steady decline in ILI counts during the current off-season, supported by reduced virus circulation, effective vaccination and antiviral treatment, and stable co-circulation of respiratory pathogens. This unified evidence justifies the projected value.
