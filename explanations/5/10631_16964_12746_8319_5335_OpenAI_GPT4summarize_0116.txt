1. The ILI occurrences from the past five weeks (Week51, 2021 to Week3, 2022) exhibit a clear decreasing trend with data points ['10631', '16964', '12746', '8319', '5335']. From Week51, 2021 to Week52, 2021, there was a significant surge (10631 to 16964), likely due to peak seasonal activity. However, from Week52, 2021 onward, there is a consistent decline (16964 → 12746 → 8319 → 5335), indicating the waning phase of the peak season and a possible transition toward the off-season. The average percentage decrease over these weeks is calculated to forecast future values. Using the week-over-week decreases: [(16964-12746)/16964 = 0.2491], [(12746-8319)/12746 = 0.3468], [(8319-5335)/8319 = 0.3590], the average rate of decrease is approximately 0.3183 (31.83%). Applying this rate iteratively to Week3, 2022 (5335) over five additional weeks yields 2196:
2. 5335 × (1 - 0.3183)^5 ≈ 2196.
2. Week8, 2022 belongs to the "Off-season." According to historical flu patterns in the U.S., the peak flu season typically concludes by Week6, and the transition to the off-season begins afterward. Given the steady decline in ILI occurrences during the past few weeks and CDC indications that flu activity is stabilizing in most regions, it is reasonable to classify Week8, 2022 as part of the off-season.
3. The historical trend of decreasing ILI values supports a projection that future occurrences will continue to decline. The time-series forecasting model uses the average rate of decline over the past five weeks (31.83%) and assumes the continuation of this trend due to the seasonal shift to the off-season. The exponential decay calculation (as shown above) for five additional weeks yields 2196. This matches the expected stabilization during the off-season when illness prevalence reaches baseline levels.
4. Three distinct factors from the summarized CDC reports contribute to this forecast:
1. Lower influenza positivity: In Week3, 2022, only 1.9% of clinical specimens tested positive for influenza, down from earlier weeks (6.2% in Week51, 2021). This decline indicates decreasing flu activity across the U.S., aligning with an off-season trend. Quantitatively, this drop in positivity supports continued declines in ILI occurrences.
2. Seasonal vaccination effect: Despite lower vaccination rates compared to last season, widespread vaccination campaigns and antiviral treatments continue to mitigate flu spread, especially as flu peaks subside. This increased immunity in the population contributes to the decline.
3. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses (like SARS-CoV-2): The CDC reports ongoing cases of COVID-19 and RSV, which may divert healthcare visits from traditional flu diagnoses, lowering the recorded ILI occurrences. This trend has influenced healthcare-seeking behaviors and, combined with suppressed Influenza B activity (0.2% positivity), suggests lower future surveillance-case counts.
5. In conclusion, the forecasted ILI occurrences for Week8, 2022 in Region 3 are 2196. The calculation is based on the observed 31.83% average weekly decline in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks, the off-season classification of Week8, 2022, and the influence of three CDC-documented factors (declining flu positivity, vaccination effects, and co-circulation of respiratory viruses). These elements collectively justify the predicted decline to 2196.
