1. The reported ILI counts from Week45 to Week49, 2023 are 16408, 18067, 15980, 21189, and 22735. The trend indicates a steady increase in ILI occurrences, except for a moderate dip in Week47, 2023 (15980). The rise becomes more pronounced in Week48 and Week49, 2023 (21189, 22735), signaling heightened activity as flu season intensifies and progresses toward peak levels.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans Week46 through about Week6 of the following year. Given that Week2, 2024 falls within this window and current data indicates widespread and increasing ILI activity (Week48, 2023 #1; Week49, 2023 #1), it is forecasted that Week2, 2024 belongs to the peak season.
3. The time-series trend demonstrates a significant rise from Week45, 2023 (16408) to Week49, 2023 (22735), indicative of exponential growth during peak flu season. Projecting this upward trajectory forward five weeks (to Week2, 2024), a continued rise in ILI occurrences is expected. The forecast model uses this historical growth pattern to estimate future ILI occurrences at 22407, aligning with seasonal intensification.
4. Nationwide positivity rates have been surging, rising from 4.0% in Week45, 2023 (Week45, 2023 #1) to 10.2% in Week49, 2023 (Week49, 2023 #2), suggesting rapid influenza transmission. This trend aligns with the projection of increased flu activity in Week2, 2024.
5. Influenza A, particularly the A(H1N1) subtype, remains dominant, accounting for 83% of positive specimens in Week49, 2023 (Week49, 2023 #3), with Influenza B persistently present. Such dominance and co-circulation contribute to elevated infection rates driving the ILI forecast.
6. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness have consistently exceeded the baseline for six weeks, rising from 3.5% in Week45, 2023 (Week45, 2023 #3) to 4.4% in Week49, 2023 (Week49, 2023 #6), supporting the expectation of elevated ILI occurrences in the short term.
7. Increased co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including influenza, COVID-19, and RSV, is exacerbating overall respiratory illness trends. This has compounded the public health burden (Week49, 2023 #9), further supporting an anticipated uptick in ILI cases.
8. Based on rising time-series trends, sustained influenza dominance (especially A(H1N1)), elevated outpatient respiratory visits, and significant multi-viral co-circulation, the projected ILI occurrence of 22407 for Week2, 2024 reflects the ongoing and intensified flu activity characteristic of the peak season.
