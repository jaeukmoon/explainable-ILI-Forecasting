1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values of ['1060', '1115', '916', '783', '757']. The trend transitioned from 1060 (Week53, 2020) to 757 (Week4, 2021), demonstrating a steady downward trajectory in ILI activity during this period, which could be reflective of suppressed influenza transmission.
2. A notable correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed as the significant decline seen through Week53, 2020–Week4, 2021 corresponds to the considerably lower future occurrence value of 539 (set for Week9, 2021). This drop is consistent with the prolonged minimal influenza activity noted in the past reports.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI fell steadily over the weeks, from 1.6% (Week53, 2020) to 1.1% (Week4, 2021), consistently below the national threshold of 2.6%. This reduction aligns with the lower ILI occurrences during the 5-week period and signals a possible continuation of reduced respiratory illness incidences leading to the future value of 539.
4. Laboratory-confirmed influenza test positivity rates remained exceptionally low, ranging from 0.1% (Week53, 2020) to 0.1% (Week4, 2021), with minimal changes throughout the period. This persistently suppressed positivity rate directly corresponds to the low ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (539), indicative of reduced viral activity.
5. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) deaths remained elevated throughout but were primarily driven by COVID-19 (e.g., 14.5% in Week53, 2020 to 28.4% in Week4, 2021). The dominance of COVID-19 and subdued influenza circulation suggest minimal direct contribution from influenza-related mortality to ILI activity, reinforcing the low future value of 539.
6. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic heavily influenced healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI surveillance systems during this timeframe, as noted in all 5 summarized reports. The reduced healthcare utilization for influenza-like symptoms contributed to the decline in reported cases, further supporting lower future ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 539 future ILI occurrences (Week9, 2021) are attributable to the downward trend observed in Weeks53, 2020–Week4, 2021, declining outpatient ILI visits, persistently low influenza test positivity rates, the dominance of COVID-19 over influenza-related PIC mortality, and COVID-19-driven disruptions in healthcare-seeking and surveillance systems.
