1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week8 to Week12, 2022 are 1261, 1512, 1701, 1940, and 2032. This represents a consistently increasing trend over the five-week period, with a gradual rise in ILI counts, suggesting growing influenza activity. Notable shifts include increases of 251 (Week8 to Week9), 189 (Week9 to Week10), 239 (Week10 to Week11), and 92 (Week11 to Week12), revealing a steady upward trajectory.
2. Forecasting for Week17, 2022 aligns with the off-season, as Week17 occurs after the primary peak season (typically Week46 of one year through about Week6 of the next). While ILI activity trends are increasing, the associated gradual rise and timing outside the defined peak season align better with off-season characteristics.
3. The time-series analysis indicates consistent growth in ILI occurrences for five consecutive weeks. Projecting this trend over five additional weeks, the trajectory suggests continued growth but at a slightly moderated pace. The consistent increase coupled with leveling patterns seen in other historical contexts suggests a prediction of 2443 ILI occurrences by Week17, 2022.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) remains dominant (Week8, 2022 #1, #2; Week9, 2022 #2, #3; Week10, 2022 #9; Week12, 2022 #3), with antigenic differences noted, contributing to potential vaccine mismatches and reduced effectiveness (Week8, 2022 #8; Week10, 2022 #9; Week11, 2022 #7). This antigenic drift can lead to increased ILI activity.
5. Hospitalization rates due to influenza have increased for seven consecutive weeks (Week8, 2022 #4; Week9, 2022 #6; Week10, 2022 #7; Week11, 2022 #3; Week12, 2022 #5), with younger age groups seeing greater impact (Week10, 2022 #4; Week12, 2022 #4). These trends indicate sustained disease spread and potential for continued ILI growth.
6. The presence of co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, remains a complicating factor. Coinfections (Week8, 2022 #6; Week9, 2022 #9; Week10, 2022 #8, #12; Week12, 2022 #9) and limited vaccination coverage (Week8, 2022 #8; Week11, 2022 #9) further contribute to the ongoing rise in ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the increasing trend in ILI occurrences, the dominance of A(H3N2) with antigenic mismatches, rising hospitalization rates, and co-circulation of respiratory viruses support a forecast of 2443 ILI occurrences by Week17, 2022. These factors align with sustained growth, though the off-season classification suggests more moderate levels than peak season highs.
