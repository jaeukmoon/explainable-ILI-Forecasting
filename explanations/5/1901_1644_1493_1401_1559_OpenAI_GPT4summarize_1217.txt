1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall downward trend initially, with values of ['1901' (Week 5, 2022), '1644' (Week 6, 2022), '1493' (Week 7, 2022), and '1401' (Week 8, 2022)]. However, there was a notable uptick to 1559 in Week 9, 2022, reversing the prior decline. This resurgence in Week 9, coupled with an increase in flu positivity and hospitalization rates (as reported in the CDC summaries), suggests early signs of heightened respiratory illness activity, potentially leading to the future increase in ILI occurrences.
2. The observed rebound from 1401 (Week 8, 2022) to 1559 (Week 9, 2022) aligns with the reported future surge to 1977 after 5 weeks (Week 14, 2022). This positive correlation between the later weeks of past data and the steep future rise indicates that the resurgence in Week 9 served as a precursor to the amplified ILI activity observed subsequently.
3. Hospitalization rates steadily increased over the 5-week period, from 4.5 per 100,000 (Week 5, 2022) to 5.5 per 100,000 (Week 9, 2022), indicating a sustained rise in severe cases of respiratory illness. This trend further supports the future increase in ILI occurrences.
4. The percentage of influenza-positive specimens rose significantly, from 2.0% (Week 5, 2022) to 5.8% (Week 9, 2022). The growing positivity rate, driven largely by Influenza A(H3N2), suggests an intensification of flu activity, contributing directly to the eventual rise in ILI occurrences to 1977.
5. Antigenic differences in circulating Influenza A(H3N2) strains, reported consistently across all weeks, potentially caused vaccine mismatches, limiting the vaccine's effectiveness. This limitation, coupled with the season’s lower vaccination rates, likely exacerbated flu transmission and indirectly fueled the reported surge in future ILI occurrences.
6. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2), with co-infection rates at approximately 6%, compounded the burden of respiratory illnesses during the 5-week period. This dynamic may have intensified the ILI incidence reported after 5 weeks.
7. In summary, the future increase in ILI occurrences to 1977 (Week 14, 2022) can be attributed to the resurgence observed in Week 9 of the past data, rising flu positivity and hospitalization rates, antigenic mismatches in the vaccine, and the adverse impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses.
