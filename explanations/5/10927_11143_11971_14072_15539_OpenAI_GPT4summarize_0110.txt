1. The reported ILI counts from Week31 to Week35, 2024 are 10927, 11143, 11971, 14072, and 15539. A steady increase is observed throughout, with a significant rise from Week33 (11971) to Week35 (15539). This upward trend indicates the beginning of heightened ILI activity rather than stabilization or fluctuations, signifying early expansion in respiratory illness cases.
2. In the U.S., Week40, 2024 falls within the Peak onset season as it is positioned between Week35 and Week46, when ILI activity typically begins to rise but has not yet reached the anticipated peak season. Past patterns, alongside recent increases in ILI occurrences, also align with the expected timing of the Peak onset period.
3. Analyzing the time-series data, the consistent upward trend in ILI numbers projects continued growth. Extrapolating forward from the Week31-35 trajectory, the forecast suggests a gradual increase rather than flattening, with Week40, 2024 likely to record a mid-range count of 13736 occurrences. This value reflects a tapering in the rate of increase after significant growth from Week33 to Week35, as observed in past seasonal progression patterns.
4. Influenza A dominates virologic trends, comprising 84%-96% of samples, with H3N2 steadily present at over 50% of subtype proportions. Nationwide influenza positivity remains low at 0.4% (Week32, 2024 #1; Week33, 2024 #1; Week34, 2024 #1; Week35, 2024 #1), suggesting room for growth as transmission accelerates.
5. Outpatient visits for ILI rose to 1.8% by Week34 and Week35 (Week34, 2024 #4; Week35, 2024 #4), marking the highest levels in 5 weeks, with notable increases in children and young adults. These demographic trends typically signal broader seasonal escalation.
6. Co-circulation with other respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV persists (Week31, 2024 #8; Week32, 2024 #8; Week33, 2024 #7; Week35, 2024 #10), indicating compounded ILI contributions as influenza gains prevalence. Co-infection risks and overlapping symptomatology likely contribute indirectly to the forecasted ILI rise.
7. The projected value of 13736 ILI occurrences in Week40, 2024 is justified by the ongoing upward trend observed in recent weeks, the alignment with the Peak onset season, and contributing factors such as demographic outpatient shifts, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and the stable presence of Influenza A(H3N2). These data points collectively suggest a continued moderate escalation in ILI activity.
