1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1076', '1184', '1196', '1289', '1500']. There was a steady increase from 1076 (Week36, 2023) to 1500 (Week40, 2023), with each successive week showing higher values. This sustained growth in ILI occurrences highlights an escalating pattern of respiratory illness activity.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the upward trajectory observed during the past time-series data, particularly from Week39 and Week40, 2023, aligns strongly with the reported future rise to 1472 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week45, 2023). The peak at 1500 in Week40, 2023, serves as a potential indicator of continued elevated ILI activity in coming weeks.
3. Increased outpatient visits for ILI were observed consistently over the 5 weeks, inching from 2.0% (Week36, 2023) to 2.2% (Week40, 2023), with notably higher rates among children aged 0-4 years (e.g., 7.1% in Week39, 2023). This gradual rise in outpatient ILI encounters reflects growing ILI activity and correlates with the increase to 1472 future occurrences.
4. Hospitalizations due to laboratory-confirmed influenza rose steadily each week, from 775 (Week36, 2023) to 1127 (Week40, 2023). This rising hospitalization trend indicates increasing severity or spread of respiratory illnesses, contributing to the observed surge to 1472 future ILI occurrences.
5. Persistent co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, was documented across all 5 weeks. This ongoing co-circulation added variability and intensity to ILI activity, creating a compounded effect that likely influenced the reported rise to 1472 future occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported increase to 1472 future ILI occurrences (Week45, 2023) can be attributed to the sustained upward trend in past ILI data, the growth in outpatient ILI visits, rising hospitalization rates, and the compounding effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses. Together, these factors demonstrate that the escalating pattern observed over the past 5 weeks is directly connected to the spike in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
