1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks (Week40, 2021 to Week44, 2021) exhibit a clear upward trend. Starting from 1721 in Week40, there are minor fluctuations with slow increases (1815 in Week41, 1785 in Week42, 1829 in Week43), culminating in a noticeable rise to 2107 in Week44. This suggests an incremental growth pattern, implying that ILI activity is in an escalating phase. Using a linear growth model to compute the increase over these weeks, the average weekly change is calculated as: ((1815 - 1721) + (1785 - 1815) + (1829 - 1785) + (2107 - 1829)) / 4 = 96 / 4 = 24. Adding this average weekly increment to the latest week's occurrence (2107) for the next five weeks suggests: 2107 + (24 × 5) = 2107 + 120 = 2227. However, considering the rapid increase in Week44 and details from CDC reports suggesting increasing influenza activity, we apply a slight adjustment toward a higher forecast of 2117 to account for variations in ILI patterns.
2. Season Classification for Week49, 2021: Based on U.S. flu season patterns, Week49 typically falls within the "Peak season." The peak season generally includes Weeks 46–6 of the following year, characterized by widespread transmission and heightened ILI activity. The ILI data and CDC reports further confirm this classification, referencing the expected uptick in influenza activity during these weeks.
3. Correlation analysis of historical trends with future ILI occurrences suggests that the upward progression in occurrences aligns closely with seasonal flu dynamics. In similar patterns of previous years, when ILI rose gradually toward Week46 and beyond, subsequent weeks typically saw heightened transmission due to increased viral circulation in the peak season. The observed shift from 1721 in Week40 to 2107 in Week44 is consistent with typical pre-peak patterns, supporting a projected continuation toward a slightly elevated Week49 figure. Quantitative forecast adjustment for Week49 involves amplifying the prior incremental rate slightly to better reflect strain-specific and external factors indicated in CDC reports.
4. Three distinct factors from summarized CDC reports influencing the forecast include:
5. 1) Rising detection of Influenza A (H3N2), which is dominant in public health labs (Week44 reports 97.3% of positive Influenza A specimens as H3N2). Increased transmission potential of H3N2 suggests a robust elevation in ILI cases, particularly in demographics showing susceptibility (e.g., ages 5-24).
6. 2) Vaccination trends and coverage remain stable (Week44 notes over 158.7M doses distributed), yet the uptake has not significantly surged. This provides moderate immunity, potentially mitigating but not preventing an increase in ILI occurrences in Week49.
7. 3) Outpatient respiratory illness trends reflect increases in age groups 0–4 and 5–24 (Week44), aligning with the widened spread of H3N2 in localized outbreaks. This demographic-driven transmission is expected to sustain or exacerbate the ILI trajectory heading into Week49.
5. In summary, the ILI forecast for Week49, 2021 is 2117. This prediction reflects the upward trajectory in occurrence numbers, the seasonal classification of Week49 within the peak season, historical trend analysis indicating continued growth during such periods, and significant external influences outlined in CDC data (e.g., dominant viral strain, partial immunity through vaccination, and demographic shifts in illness patterns). The integration of these factors justifies a gradual increase from the current Week44 level of 2107 to a forecast of 2117 in Week49.
