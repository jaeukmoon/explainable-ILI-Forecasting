1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a steady decline, with values of ['1069', '1060', '1115', '916', '783']. The highest value was observed in Week 52, 2020 (1069), while a consistent drop occurred afterward, reaching the lowest at 783 by Week 3, 2021. This trend reflects a progressive reduction in ILI activity during the observed period.
2. A negative correlation is evident between past and future ILI occurrences, as the declining trend in the past weeks does not align with the reported future increase to 522 after 5 weeks, indicating a shift in factors influencing ILI trends during this period.
3. Outpatient ILI visits remained historically low over the 5 weeks, varying minimally from 1.6% (Week 52, 2020) to 1.3% (Week 3, 2021), below the national baseline of 2.6%. However, the subtle regional increases and persistent low activity indicate suppressed circulation of influenza strains, further contributing to low ILI reporting.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained significantly high during these weeks—14.5% (Week 53, 2020) to 14.8% (Week 3, 2021)—with the majority driven by COVID-19. The high PIC mortality reflects dominantly COVID-related respiratory illnesses affecting the statistical representation of influenza rates.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior altered by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as reported consistently across weeks, led to disruptions in traditional influenza reporting and surveillance systems. Reduced testing and alternative care-seeking pathways complicated accurate ILI tracking, possibly masking the actual disease burden and contributing to an underreporting of cases during the past weeks.
6. Despite cumulative influenza positivity rates remaining below 1% across all weeks and consistently low hospitalization rates (e.g., 0.5 per 100,000 by Week 3, 2021), suppressed influenza circulation does not sufficiently explain the eventual rise to 522 future occurrences, suggesting other respiratory illnesses or delayed reporting impacting future numbers.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 522 can be attributed to significant shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance challenges during the pandemic, high COVID-driven PIC mortality that influenced case dynamics, and inconsistent trends in outpatient ILI visits, which collectively disrupted the relationship between past and future ILI patterns.
