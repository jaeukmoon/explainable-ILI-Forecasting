1. The past time-series ILI occurrences (‘1706’, ‘1503’, ‘1521’, ‘1532’, ‘1837’) over the 5 weeks (Week 6–10, 2021) display a fluctuating but overall increasing trend. A decrease from 1706 (Week 6, 2021) to 1503 (Week 7, 2021) and stabilization around 1521–1532 (Weeks 8–9, 2021) was observed, followed by a sharp rise to 1837 in Week 10, 2021. This upward shift in Week 10, 2021, suggests an escalation in ILI activity heading into future weeks.

2. A positive correlation between the upward ending trend in past data (Week 10, 2021: 1837) and the future value (Week 15, 2021: 1956) is evident. The increase in Week 10 serves as a precursor for the observed future rise in ILI occurrences. Comparatively, the minimal weekly fluctuations and stabilization followed by a sharp increase provide a basis for the continued growth into Week 15.

3. Several indirect factors from the CDC reports correlate with the rise in ILI occurrences:  
   - Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable (1.1% in Week 6 to 0.9%–1.0% in Weeks 8–10, 2021) but showed a slight upward trend among pediatric age groups (0–4 years) over eight weeks, suggesting a contributing population-based increase in future ILI activity.  
   - PIC mortality, largely dominated by COVID-19, remained well above epidemic thresholds (22.3% in Week 6 to 13.3% in Week 10, 2021), reflecting the persistence of respiratory illnesses that could influence broader ILI metrics.  
   - Behavioral disruptions due to COVID-19, noted across all weeks, created substantial challenges in ILI reporting. These disruptions, including healthcare-seeking changes, likely caused underreporting, masking earlier increments and concentrating the observed future rise.

4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1956 (Week 15, 2021) are attributed to the sharp increase in the past week's (Week 10, 2021) ILI data, a positive overall correlation with prior weeks' trends, pediatric age-group-driven outpatient visit growth, elevated PIC deaths, and disrupted healthcare-seeking/reporting patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. These elements collectively underline the anticipated rise in ILI activity 5 weeks later.
