1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the observed 5 weeks showcase a consistent decline, with values of ['1448', '1246', '1098', '1017', '889'], starting at 1448 in Week 21, 2023, and reaching a low of 889 in Week 25, 2023. This downward trend indicates a steady reduction in ILI activity across the period, reflecting seasonal influenza waning or minimal respiratory illness activity.
2. The dramatic decrease in past ILI occurrences does not align with the reported future ILI occurrences of 666 (Week 30, 2023), suggesting a disconnection or a drastic shift in factors influencing the trend after Week 25. The continuous decline ending at 889 contrasts with the lower future occurrence, indicating an additional external factor not apparent within the time-series data itself.
3. Persistent levels of minimal ILI outpatient visits were observed, declining from 1.9% (Week 21, 2023) to 1.4% (Week 25, 2023). The lowest level remains well below the national baseline of 2.6%, reflecting minimal influenza contributions to respiratory illness during the reported weeks. However, low outpatient visit rates can contribute to suppressed future ILI occurrences such as the 666 after 5 weeks.
4. Pneumonia, Influenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC)-attributed deaths hovered near or above epidemic thresholds throughout the time frame, with 7.0% (Week 21) falling to 6.2% (Week 25). This persistence of PIC-associated deaths reflects respiratory illness trends that, although declining, align with national respiratory morbidity and mortality.
5. The influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, RSV) complicated ILI data precision, as ongoing trends suggest other pathogens are disproportionately contributing to the declining ILI cases. These viral interactions may explain suppressed ILI activity, with Week 25 data signaling trends mirrored by the low future occurrences of 666.
6. In summary, the low future occurrence of 666 (Week 30, 2023) is attributed to the sharp and continuous decline in past ILI activity from Week 21 to Week 25, 2023, reflecting minimal outpatient visits for ILI, persistent but slightly receding PIC-related deaths, and respiratory virus co-circulation dampening ILI contributions. These factors collectively explain the reduced future cases.
