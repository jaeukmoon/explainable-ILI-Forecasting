1. The reported ILI counts from Week14 to Week18, 2024 are 16091, 15163, 14138, 13960, and 13498. The data reveal a clear downward trend over the five weeks, with consistent week-over-week decreases. This decline suggests a tapering of influenza-like illness activity rather than any resurgence or fluctuations during this period.
2. In the U.S., the off-season typically spans from the end of the peak season through the onset of the following season, such as Week9 through Week30, 2024. Given that Week23, 2024 falls within this off-season window, combined with ongoing declines in ILI positivity rates and the absence of significant activity in recent weeks (Week17, 2024 #10; Week18, 2024 #9), forecasting that Week23 belongs to the off-season aligns with national trends.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent decreases in ILI occurrences reflect a steady decline, characteristic of the off-season. Extrapolating this trend forward by five weeks indicates continued reductions in ILI counts, aligning with a projection of 11077 occurrences for Week23, 2024. The progression suggests a tapering effect due to waning transmission levels post-peak activity.
4. Influenza activity has been steadily declining, with positive specimen rates dropping from 7.7% in Week14, 2024 to 3.1% in Week18, 2024 (Week14, 2024 #1; Week18, 2024 #1). Continued reductions in positivity rates reinforce the downward trajectory for future weeks.
5. Vaccination coverage remains stable, with circulating flu strains well-matched to vaccine components (Week14, 2024 #7; Week15, 2024 #9; Week16, 2024 #9). High vaccine effectiveness reduces transmission risks, contributing to the lower expected ILI cases.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and RSV persists, but their relative influence remains stable without significant amplification of ILI reports (Week14, 2024 #8; Week17, 2024 #7; Week18, 2024 #10). This co-circulation does not indicate an impending spike in Week23, 2024.
7. Based on the consistently declining ILI trends, alignment with off-season classifications, stable or decreasing flu activity indicators, effective vaccination coverage, and absence of intensifying co-circulating respiratory virus impacts, a projection of 11077 ILI occurrences for Week23, 2024 is well-supported.
