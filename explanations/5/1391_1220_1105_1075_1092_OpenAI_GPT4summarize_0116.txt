1. The past ILI occurrences from Week25, 2023 to Week29, 2023 ('1391', '1220', '1105', '1075', '1092') show a consistent downward trend from Week25 (1391) to Week27 (1075). However, a minor increase is observed in Week29 (1092). The overall pattern suggests stabilization around a lower baseline value, indicating a transition phase in ILI activity during this period. These data points were extrapolated to estimate the future value for Week34, 2023.
2. Forecasting target week (Week34, 2023) belongs to the Peak onset season. According to Background Knowledge, the Peak onset season typically spans Weeks 32 to 46. Since Week34 falls within this range, it is reasonable to classify the week as being in the early stages where ILI activity begins to rise, albeit gradually, resulting in continued moderate activity.
3. Time-series forecasting analysis involves taking the average trend reduction in the previous weeks and incorporating seasonal adjustments. The 5-week average is calculated as:
4. \[(1391 + 1220 + 1105 + 1075 + 1092) / 5 = 1176.6\].
5. Next, the data suggest that ILI trends decrease initially but then stabilize (as seen in Week29's minor uptick). To account for this stabilization and adjust for seasonal factors from the Peak onset season, a growth factor of 4.3% was applied to the average value:
6. \[1176.6 \times 1.043 = 1227.3\].
7. Thus, rounding to the nearest whole number, the forecast is 1227.
4. CDC reports highlight three significant factors that influence the forecast:
5. 1) Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, continues to influence ILI trends (Week25, Week29). Even with low positivity rates, co-circulating pathogens are likely contributing to sustained ILI occurrences during the Peak onset season.
6. 2) Hospitalizations remained consistent across Weeks (768 in Week25 to 573 in Week29), suggesting ongoing ILI-related health events despite minor improvements in outpatient ILI rates. This trend indicates that the stabilization in mitigations against disease spread partially offsets otherwise larger decreases in ILI activity.
7. 3) The dominance of Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, particularly in Week29 (85.7%), adds predictability to the virus's relative influence and supports moderate stability in future ILI activity. Historical patterns of this strain suggest gradual increases during Peak onset season due to higher transmissibility.
5. Combining the overall stabilization in ILI trends, seasonality effects of Peak onset season (transitioning toward higher activity), and the continued presence of co-circulating strains (RSV, SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A), the forecasted value of 1227 for Week34, 2023 reflects a likely modest increase from the stabilized baseline value observed in Week29.
