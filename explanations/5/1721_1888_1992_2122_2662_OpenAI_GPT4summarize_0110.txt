1. The reported ILI counts from Week30 to Week34, 2023 are 1721, 1888, 1992, 2122, and 2662. The data indicate a clear upward trend, with ILI occurrences steadily increasing across these weeks. The most notable rise is observed between Week33 (2122) and Week34 (2662), marking a significant spike in activity.
2. Week39, 2023 falls under the Peak onset season, as it lies between Week35 and Week46. The increased positivity rates for influenza and the rising ILI trends observed in Weeks33 and Week34, 2023 suggest the gradual climb toward higher ILI activity, consistent with the Peak onset season classification.
3. The time-series data demonstrate a pattern of consistent increases, particularly the acceleration in Weeks33–34, 2023. Extrapolating this trajectory, the forecast projects continued growth in ILI counts over the next five weeks. Applying time-series techniques to model the rate of increase suggests a forecast of 4126 ILI occurrences by Week39, 2023.
4. Pediatric ILI outpatient visit rates are rising, with a sharp increase from 4.4% in Week32, 2023 to 5.8% in Week34, 2023. This highlights a significant contribution of infections in younger populations to the overall increase in ILI activity. (Week32, 2023 #5; Week34, 2023 #5). Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) continue to exceed the epidemic thresholds across all weeks, e.g., 6.5% in Week34, 2023, suggesting heightened respiratory illness pressures (Week32, 2023 #6; Week33, 2023 #5; Week34, 2023 #6). A notable rise in hospitalizations for influenza across Weeks30 to Week34, 2023 (e.g., 649 in Week30 to 779 in Week34) reflects the worsening severity of the season's onset, supporting the projection of further ILI increases (Week30, 2023 #5; Week31, 2023 #4; Week34, 2023 #4).
5. Influenza circulation shows increasing activity. For example, the percentage of positive specimens rose from 0.5% in Week33, 2023 to 0.8% in Week34, 2023. Additionally, public health lab reports indicate ongoing dominance of Influenza A strains, including H1N1 and H3N2, which could facilitate further community spread (Week33, 2023 #1–#2; Week34, 2023 #1–#3).
6. Vaccine trends and uptake remain unaddressed in recent CDC reports, and vaccination campaigns are likely still ramping up as seasonal flu activity builds. Low vaccination coverage at this point could be contributing to the increased ILI activity (Week30, 2023 #9; Week31, 2023 #9; Week34, 2023 #10).
7. In summary, the forecast of 4126 ILI occurrences for Week39, 2023 is justified by the consistent upward trajectory of ILI counts, increased pediatric ILI rates, rising hospitalizations, PIC deaths exceeding epidemic thresholds, growing prevalence of Influenza A strains, and the timing within the Peak onset season. These trends collectively support the expectation of further amplified ILI activity.
