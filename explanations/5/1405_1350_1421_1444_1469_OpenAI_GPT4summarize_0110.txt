1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week26 to Week30, 2024 are 1405, 1350, 1421, 1444, and 1469. Over these five weeks, the trend shows a gradual and steady rise, starting with Week27 at a low point (1350) and consistently increasing to Week30 (1469). This suggests a slight upward trajectory in ILI activity, likely influenced by seasonal factors or co-circulation of respiratory viruses that maintain minimal but growing transmission rates.
2. Based on the typical influenza seasonality in the U.S., Week35, 2024 aligns with the peak onset season. This is characterized by the beginning of a gradual increase in ILI activity as the season transitions toward higher levels of transmission preceding the peak season, as indicated by the historical onset pattern between Week32 and Week46 (e.g., Week32, 2024).
3. The upward trend from Week26 to Week30, 2024 in reported occurrences suggests a moderate growth curve in ILI counts. Using time-series forecasting models, which consider this rise and low national activity, the projection for Week35, 2024 indicates a continuing gradual increase, leading to an anticipated count of 1722. This is consistent with earlier trends in similar seasonal transitions.
4. Nationwide, reported influenza activity remains low, with only 0.7%-1.0% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza over the past five weeks, indicating minimal baseline circulation (Week26, 2024 #1; Week28, 2024 #1; Week30, 2024 #1). However, there is slight positivity fluctuation, primarily in Influenza A (e.g., 85.5%-93.8%) compared to Influenza B (Week26, 2024 #2; Week30, 2024 #2), supporting a mild incremental rise in activity.
5. Vaccination against influenza appears effective, with circulating strains (H1N1, H3N2, and B Victoria) remaining highly antigenically similar to the vaccine (Week27, 2024 #7; Week28, 2024 #9; Week30, 2024 #7). Minimal resistance reduces probabilities of widespread antiviral treatment failure, maintaining a controlled progression of activity.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, RSV, and novel avian influenza variants like A(H5N1), continues. While their contribution to overall respiratory illness remains stable (Week27, 2024 #9; Week29, 2024 #7; Week30, 2024 #6), vigilance is necessary as regional variation or minor outbreaks may moderately impact ILI occurrences.
7. The projected ILI occurrence of 1722 for Week35, 2024 is justified by the observed slow increase in ILI trends, the seasonal transition to the peak onset period, the controlled co-circulation of diverse respiratory viruses, and a well-matched vaccine. These factors collectively support a consistent and steady rise in ILI counts, aligned with historical patterns.
