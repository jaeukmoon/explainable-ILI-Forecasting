1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall fluctuating trend, with values of ['1539', '1125', '1111', '1182', '1261']. There was a decline from 1539 (Week4, 2022) to 1111 (Week6, 2022), followed by a steady rise to 1261 (Week8, 2022). This indicates a stabilization and slight resurgence in ILI activity toward the latter period, which aligns with increasing influenza indicators observed in the summarized reports.
2. A positive correlation is evident between past occurrences and future ILI occurrences of 2021 five weeks later. The resurgence in Weeks 7–8, 2022, with incremental increases in ILI activity, corresponds to the eventual amplification in future ILI activity. The data suggests these later weeks served as a precursor to the elevated future occurrences.
3. Weekly increases in the percentage of influenza-positive specimens, rising steadily from 1.7% (Week4, 2022) to 4.1% (Week8, 2022), highlight increasing influenza circulation, predominantly A(H3N2), which significantly influences ILI activity.
4. Sustained upward hospitalization trends, with rates increasing from 4.4 per 100,000 (Week4, 2022) to 5.2 per 100,000 (Week8, 2022), particularly among vulnerable populations (e.g., older adults aged 65+ and young children), suggest worsening respiratory illness severity contributing to future ILI elevations.
5. Persistent low vaccination uptake, along with reports of antigenic mismatches in A(H3N2) strains, reflects reduced immunity levels in the population. This combination, observed across all summarized reports, drives higher susceptibility to influenza, compounding the rise in ILI occurrences after the 5-week period.
6. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and multiple respiratory viruses, consistently noted (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 co-infections rising to 6.1% by Week8, 2022), exacerbates respiratory illness activity. This interplay of factors likely amplified the increase in future ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2021 after 5 weeks are attributable to the fluctuating but upward ILI trends in Weeks 7–8, 2022, rising influenza positivity rates, increasing hospitalizations, low vaccination coverage, evolving antigenicity in A(H3N2) viruses, and the co-circulation of respiratory viruses fueling escalated illness activity.
