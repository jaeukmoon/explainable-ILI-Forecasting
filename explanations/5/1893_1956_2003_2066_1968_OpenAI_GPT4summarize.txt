1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks presented a fluctuating pattern, with values of ['1893', '1956', '2003', '2066', '1968']. There was an initial increase from 1893 (Week 12, 2021) to 2066 (Week 15, 2021), followed by a slight decline to 1968 in Week 16, 2021. This variability, particularly the peak in Week 15, indicates moderate respiratory illness activity despite the overall low influenza activity reported.

2. A slight positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences can be observed. Even with the minor drop in Week 16, 2021, the elevated levels seen in Weeks 14 and 15, 2021, lay the groundwork for the relatively consistent future ILI occurrences, ending at 1933 after 5 weeks (Week 21, 2021). The absence of sharp decreases in past trends suggests that ILI activity remains stable.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained very low but slightly elevated, inching from 0.9% (Week 12, 2021) to 1.1% (Weeks 14–16, 2021). Stability at 1.1% by Week 16, 2021, despite being below the 2.6% national baseline, reflects an ongoing but controlled level of respiratory illness activity that supports the future value of 1933 occurrences.

4. Elevated percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) persisted over the 5 weeks, with values of 11.4% (Week 12, 2021) to 12.4% (Week 15, 2021), all exceeding the epidemic thresholds of 6.7%–7.0%. These high PIC mortality percentages indicate continued respiratory disease burden, even though driven largely by COVID-19, and likely contribute indirectly to sustained ILI activity levels.

5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and pandemic-related complications in ILI surveillance across Weeks 12–16, 2021, were highlighted in the reports. The presence of these distortions likely caused underreporting or delays in recognizing ILI cases, concentrating the reported ILI numbers into a stable range for both the present and future occurrences.

6. Despite exceptionally low influenza virus positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% of specimens in clinical labs across Weeks 12–16, 2021) and minimal viral transmission, the steady state of ILI occurrences hints at contributions from other respiratory pathogens or non-specific illnesses. Pandemic-induced changes in reporting and surveillance methods may have further stabilized ILI activity in the future data.

7. In summary, the future occurrences of 1933 ILI cases after 5 weeks (Week 21, 2021) can be attributed to the stable trend in ILI occurrences observed across Weeks 12–16, 2021, low but consistent outpatient ILI visit percentages, persistently high PIC mortality rates, and pandemic-driven distortions in healthcare-seeking behavior, which likely maintained ILI activity at stable levels despite low influenza activity.
