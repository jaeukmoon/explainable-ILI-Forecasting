1. Explanation:
1. The time-series data ['1189', '1240', '1216', '1752', '1772'] indicates an overall increasing trend. A significant jump is observed between Week48, 2021 (1752) and Week49, 2021 (1772), which aligns with the CDC reports showing increasing influenza activity during the same period. Calculating the average weekly rate of increase (e.g., using Week46 to Week49 data), the growth is approximately [(1772-1216)/3] = ~185.33 cases per week.
2. Week2, 2022 falls within the "Peak season" as per background knowledge. The peak season typically spans from Week46 of the previous year to Week6 of the following year. CDC reports confirm this classification since ILI activity has shown a steady rise from Week45, 2021 onwards, with increasing outpatient ILI visits, positivity rates, and hospitalizations in recent weeks.
3. Correlated historical patterns suggest that the increasing trend continues through the next 5 weeks due to the proximity to peak season. Extrapolating from the last two weeks' growth (1752 to 1772, an increase of 20 cases) and applying a compounding rate due to the peak season effect (~185.33 cases per week as calculated earlier), we project continued ILI growth, resulting in 2536 cases. The calculation is as follows:
4. Base ILI occurrences = Week49 value (1772). Apply the weekly growth rate for 5 weeks. Linear projection: 1772 + (185.33 × 5) = ~2536.
4. Three CDC report factors influencing this prediction:
5. 1) Influenza A dominance (especially A(H3N2), with 97%-99% cases in Weeks48-49, 2021) is driving a higher ILI burden across all age groups. The predominance of this subtype during peak activity aligns with historical surges in ILI counts during peak season.
6. 2) Hospitalizations increased from 356 (Week46, 2021) to 1,057 (Week49, 2021), reflecting rising severe flu cases. This suggests a continued rise in respiratory burden as ILI peaks.
7. 3) Vaccination uptake remains suboptimal compared to the previous season, as noted in Weeks48-49, 2021. Lower vaccination rates correlate with reduced population immunity, amplifying ILI occurrences.
5. The forecast of 2536 for Week2, 2022 is justified by the combination of the increasing historical trend, classification as peak season, and compounding effects of rising positivity and hospitalization rates driven by Influenza A(H3N2) along with suboptimal vaccination coverage.
