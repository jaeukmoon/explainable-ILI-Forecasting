1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a declining trend initially, from 1805 (Week 4, 2021) to 1503 (Week 7, 2021), followed by a minimal increase to 1521 (Week 8, 2021). This fluctuation suggests a generally declining or stable ILI activity during this period.

2. The rise in future ILI occurrences to 1977 (Week 13, 2021) contrasts with the overall declining or stable trend in past data, suggesting a lagging factor or external influence. Minimal activity in the past weeks combined with historic lows in influenza metrics indicates this increase could be influenced by delayed reporting, seasonal variation, or other respiratory illnesses, rather than strict continuity from past data.

3. Several factors in the CDC reports correlate with the increase to 1977 future ILI occurrences:
   - Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at 1.1% (Weeks 4-7, 2021) and slightly declined to 0.9% (Week 8, 2021), remaining below baseline. Despite this, slight increases in ILI trends among children aged 0–4 years over the past six weeks suggest localized rises in future activity.
   - COVID-19 disruptions to ILI surveillance and healthcare-seeking behaviors (reported consistently in all weeks) likely led to underreporting, with potential backlogs contributing to a future sharp rise.
   - Historic lows in hospitalization rates (e.g., 0.7 per 100,000 by Week 8, 2021), virological activity, and underreported influenza activity nationwide indicate that the rise could involve non-influenza respiratory illnesses or healthcare normalization post-COVID-19 disruptions.

4. In summary, the 1977 future ILI occurrences (Week 13, 2021) can be explained by the interplay of a declining trend in past ILI occurrences, CDC-reported healthcare disruptions impacting data reporting, localized ILI increases among young children, and the continued impact of non-influenza respiratory illnesses. These factors cumulatively highlight the evolving and unpredictable nature of ILI reporting during the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic.
