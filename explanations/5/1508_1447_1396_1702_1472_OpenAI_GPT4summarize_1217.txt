1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks presented fluctuations with values of ['1508', '1447', '1396', '1702', '1472']. There was a decline from 1508 (Week41, 2023) to 1396 (Week43, 2023), followed by a sharp rise in Week44, 2023, reaching 1702, and then a slight decrease to 1472 in Week45, 2023. This dynamic pattern indicates sporadic but overall stable levels of ILI activity during this period.
2. The increasing trend in Week44, 2023, to 1702, coupled with stable levels in surrounding weeks, signifies a positive correlation with future ILI occurrences, as the rise during Week44 likely acted as a precursor leading up to the higher reported value of 3151 after 5 weeks (Week50, 2023).
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily increased over the 5 weeks, moving upward from 2.3% (Week41, 2023) to surpass the national baseline at 3.5% (Week45, 2023). This sustained rise demonstrates growing healthcare utilization for ILI, influencing the reported future value of 3151.
4. Hospitalization rates showed a notable escalation from 0.3 per 100,000 (Week41, 2023) to 1.7 per 100,000 (Week45, 2023), driven primarily by rises in older adults (65+). These trends align with expanding severe respiratory illness activity, which likely contributed to elevated future ILI occurrences.
5. Regional increases in influenza activity across multiple areas, such as the Southeast and South Central, combined with the co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens like RSV and SARS-CoV-2, amplified cumulative respiratory burden. These factors contributed to the observed increase to 3151 future ILI occurrences (Week50, 2023).
6. Overall, the reported future value of 3151 occurrences stemmed from a combination of the Week44 spike in ILI activity, rising outpatient ILI visits, escalating hospitalization rates, increasing regional flu activity, and concurrent respiratory viruses contributing to a nationally expanding illness trend.
