1. The reported ILI counts from Week44 to Week48, 2020 are 1705, 2092, 2178, 2157, and 1770. Initially, the trend showed a significant increase from Week44 (1705) to Week46 (2178), followed by a slight decrease in Week47 (2157) and a sharper dip in Week48 (1770). This pattern indicates a fluctuating trend with a peak in Week46 before declining in subsequent weeks.
2. Forecasted week (None) is expected to fall in the off-season. Historical peak influenza-like illness activity typically occurs between Week46 and Week6 of the following year. Considering the unusually low influenza positivity and ILI activity below baseline in Week48, 2020 and no evidence of an upcoming spike, it aligns with off-season characteristics with minimal flu activity.
3. The time-series pattern suggests a decline post-peak activity in Week46 and Week47. Extrapolating this trend forward indicates a continued stabilization or marginal rise near a baseline level due to the low recent activity but without significant cause for future escalation. This supports the projected value of 1867 after five weeks.
4. The unusually low levels of influenza positivity (as low as 0.1%-0.2% from Week46 to Week48) and below-baseline ILI outpatient visits (1.6% compared to a 2.6% national baseline) suggest suppressed influenza transmission, possibly driven by COVID-19 mitigation behaviors like masking and distancing (Week46, 2020 #6; Week47, 2020 #1; Week48, 2020 #2, #10).
5. Mortality surveillance reveals a high PIC rate (10.7%-12.8% from Week46 to Week48, dominated by COVID-19-associated deaths rather than influenza). This further supports the minimal role of influenza transmission during this period (Week46, 2020 #4; Week47, 2020 #4; Week48, 2020 #3).
6. Vaccination recommendations remain consistent, with public health efforts continuing to emphasize flu immunizations. However, the absence of significant changes in vaccination uptake reported does not indicate a strong influence on ILI trends during this period (Week46, 2020 #7; Week47, 2020 #8; Week48, 2020 #7).
7. In conclusion, the declining ILI trend, off-season timing, low influenza activity, overwhelming impact of COVID-19 on healthcare behaviors, and relatively stable influencing factors like vaccination and co-circulation trends collectively justify the forecasted ILI occurrences of 1867 within five weeks.
