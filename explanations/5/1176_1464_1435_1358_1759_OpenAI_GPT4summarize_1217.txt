1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall increasing trend, with values of ['1176', '1464', '1435', '1358', '1759']. Starting from 1176 in Week13, 2021, there was a steady rise to 1464 in Week14, followed by a slight dip to 1435 in Week15, and another decrease to 1358 in Week16. However, a significant surge to 1759 in Week17, 2021, marks the highest value in this period, indicating an escalation in ILI activity.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is discernible, as the sharp increase in Week17, 2021, strongly aligns with the reported rise to 1817 occurrences in Week22, 2021. The substantial jump in the final week of the past data period appears to set the momentum for the observed uptick in future ILI activity.
3. Minimal outpatient ILI visit levels at 1.0%-1.1% over the 5 weeks, consistently below the baseline of 2.6%, reflect a low baseline activity; however, the week-over-week stability and lingering COVID-19 pandemic effects possibly masked broader trends, contributing to the unexpected rise in Week22, 2021.
4. The percentage of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained above the epidemic threshold throughout, ranging from 11.4% in Week13, 2021, to 11.7% in Week17, 2021, with COVID-19 as the main contributor. These elevated PIC mortality rates hint at persistent respiratory illness risks that may extend into the observed future increase.
5. Healthcare behavior alterations connected to the COVID-19 pandemic, repeatedly reported in the CDC summaries, disrupted traditional ILI data interpretation, potentially leading to underreporting in the earlier weeks and a subsequent spike in Week22, 2021.
6. In summary, the reported 1817 future ILI occurrences (Week22, 2021) are attributable to the increasing trend shown in Week17, 2021, persistent PIC mortality rates exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the compounded effects of healthcare-seeking behavior disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have obscured ILI detection in earlier weeks but contributed to the observed rise.
