1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating but slightly declining trend overall, with values of ['1783', '1687', '1639', '1540', '1679']. There was an initial decrease from 1783 (Week35, 2021) to 1540 (Week38, 2021), followed by a slight rebound to 1679 in Week39, 2021. This suggests a relatively stable period of low-to-moderate ILI activity with minor variations.
2. A moderate positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the rebound toward Week39, 2021, from 1540 to 1679 aligns with the increased future ILI value of 2107 (Week44, 2021). The stabilization and slight resurgence in values in the last week influence the projected growth seen in future weeks.
3. Weekly outpatient visits for ILI remained notably below baseline values, ranging from 0.9% (Week35, 2021) to 1.9% (Week39, 2021), but minor increases in Week38–39 signal potential rising trends in respiratory illnesses fueled by other non-influenza viruses. Elevated PIC (Pneumonia, Influenza, or COVID-19) mortality remained consistently high (e.g., 21.0% in Week36, 2021) due to COVID-19, surpassing epidemic thresholds and contributing to a complex respiratory illness environment. Healthcare behavior shifts, attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, impacted ILI data interpretation and delayed recognition of illnesses, which likely compressed and amplified ILI activity in later weeks.
4. Limited influenza virus circulation, consistently reported during Weeks35–39, highlights the role of other respiratory pathogens in driving ILI trends. Non-specific respiratory illnesses appear to compensate for low influenza activity, aligning with observed increases in future ILI occurrences.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences rising to 2107 by Week44, 2021, can be attributed to the slightly increasing trend in the final weeks of the past data, sustained PIC mortality, non-influenza respiratory virus activity, and complications in surveillance due to pandemic-driven healthcare behavior changes. These factors collectively shaped the trajectory toward higher ILI counts beyond the observed period.
