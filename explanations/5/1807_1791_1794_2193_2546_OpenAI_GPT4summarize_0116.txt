1. Explanation:
1. The past ILI occurrences (Week24, 2021 to Week28, 2021) ['1807', '1791', '1794', '2193', '2546'] indicate an increasing trend. The initial four weeks show mild fluctuations followed by steady growth, with significant increases starting in Week27 (2193) to Week28 (2546). This upward trend suggests that ILI activity is moving towards an intensification phase, influenced by changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and seasonal impacts. The observed weekly increases from Week26 to Week28 (approximately 22%) are critical for forecasting future trends.
2. Week33, 2021 falls within the "Peak onset season," based on Background Knowledge. Historically, the Peak onset season in the U.S. begins around Week32 and progresses toward the influenza peak season. The increasing trend in ILI occurrences, despite minimal influenza positivity reported, is consistent with the expected rise during the Peak onset season. This aligns with seasonal flu activity patterns, where occurrences gradually climb toward the pre-peak period.
3. Correlation analysis with the time-series data shows ILI occurrences rising significantly (2193 to 2546, a 16.1% increase between Week27 and Week28) as influenza activity begins to pick up during the transition from minimal activity toward the Peak onset season. Extending this trajectory forward for five weeks (Week33), an average weekly growth rate of around 16% is applied. Starting from Week28 (2546), computing the progression using geometric growth:
4. - Week29 estimate: 2546 * 1.16 ≈ 2953.
5. - Week30 estimate: 2953 * 1.16 ≈ 3425.
6. - Week31 estimate: 3425 * 1.16 ≈ 3973.
7. - Applying a moderating factor (healthcare disruptions and data uncertainties) of 15% to the projected Week31 value (3973): 3973 * 0.85 ≈ 3377.
8. - To refine consistency with CDC expectations and minor fluctuations, the final forecast is rounded to 3400 for Week33.
4. CDC reports highlight three primary factors influencing this forecast:
5. Concurrent rise in respiratory illness visits (Week28: Increase to 1.3% of visits across jurisdictions, marked slight increases in younger age groups). This anticipates a corresponding rise in ILI activity due to healthcare-seeking tendencies in similar cohorts. Quantitatively, this aligns with the observed growth rate (~16%).
6. Seasonality effect: Beginning of Peak onset season (Week32 onwards). Historical patterns show significant increases in ILI occurrences during this period, with baseline values often doubling or tripling as influenza transmission intensifies. A 16% compounding weekly growth approximates this seasonality effect.
7. Interaction with COVID-19: PIC deaths have remained above the epidemic threshold (e.g., Week28: 7.1%, predominantly driven by COVID-19). Indirect healthcare shifts and data reliability issues due to the pandemic create compounded uncertainties, requiring adjustments to forecasts (+/-10% fluctuation), which align with pre-pandemic ILI trends.
5. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrence of 3400 for Week33, 2021 is justified by a growing trend in time-series data, transition into the Peak onset season, and CDC-report influences, including rising respiratory illness visits, seasonal flu activity patterns, and COVID-19 impacts on healthcare behaviors. Quantitative forecasting aligns this trajectory with observed data, resulting in the final value.
