1. The ILI occurrences from Week5 to Week9, 2021 are 1892, 825, 618, 1031, 862. The trend indicates an initial sharp decline from Week5 (1892) to Week7 (618), followed by a moderate recovery to Week8 (1031) and a subsequent slight drop in Week9 (862). This pattern demonstrates fluctuating activity, with no sustained growth or decline over the period.
2. Forecasting target week (Week14, 2021) belongs to the off-season. Influenza activity during Weeks5–9, 2021 was unusually low (Week5 #1, Week6 #1, Week7 #1, Week8 #1, Week9 #1), with all indicators remaining well below baseline levels. Given the timing and lack of significant activity, Week14, 2021 aligns with off-season classification.
3. Historical patterns show that ILI trends during Weeks5–9, 2021 fluctuated at relatively low levels without signs of consistent increases. Projecting these trends forward suggests that historical stability and the absence of any sudden surges will likely continue, leading to a moderate increase in ILI occurrences. The forecast anticipates a gradual rise in activity to 1464 by Week14, 2021, reflecting slow recovery around the off-season baseline.
4. Influenza positivity nationwide has consistently remained low, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive across all weeks (Week5 #1, Week6 #1, Week7 #1, Week8 #1, Week9 #1). This inhibits widespread transmission and reduces the likelihood of sharp spikes in ILI occurrences.
5. COVID-19 continues to dominate morbidity and mortality trends during this period, with pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) deaths far exceeding epidemic thresholds but primarily attributed to COVID-19 (Week5 #6, Week6 #6, Week7 #6, Week8 #7, Week9 #6). This reduced overall healthcare visits for traditional ILI, altering typical trends.
6. Minimal influenza activity is reported across all age groups, although slight increases in ILI trends among children aged 0–4 years over previous weeks are noted (Week7 #12, Week9 #9). This shift in pediatric ILI activity could contribute to a modest rise in reported occurrences.
7. In summary, the low yet fluctuating ILI activity during Weeks5–9, 2021, the off-season designation for Week14, 2021, and the compounding effects of low influenza positivity, COVID-19 disruptions, and pediatric trends combine to predict modest recovery in ILI counts. These factors justify the forecasted value of 1464 for Week14, 2021.
