1. The past time-series ILI occurrences ('1315', '1243', '1309', '1140', '1250') show a fluctuating pattern with an overall decrease, dropping from 1315 in Week 36, 2021, to 1140 in Week 39, 2021, but then slightly increasing to 1250 in Week 40, 2021. Although the trend doesn't consistently rise, the final upward movement indicates potential changes in respiratory illness dynamics toward the end of the 5-week period.  

2. A weak positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is observed. The overall decrease in past ILI occurrences does not strongly align with the reported future occurrence of 1203 in Week 45, 2021. However, the slight rise from Week 39 to Week 40 (1140 to 1250) may act as a precursor to stabilizing respiratory illness activity leading to 1203.  

3. Percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained much higher than the epidemic threshold, starting at 21.0% (Week 36, 2021) and declining marginally to 18.0% (Week 40, 2021). This persistent excess mortality, primarily driven by COVID-19, indicates elevated respiratory disease burden, which could maintain higher ILI levels in the future.  
   - Healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted ILI surveillance, as emphasized in all weeks. These disruptions may have affected timely data interpretation and contributed to an unpredictable future trend.  
   - Non-influenza respiratory viruses, noted as the primary drivers of increased ILI activity, sustained higher outpatient ILI percentages (e.g., 2.3% in Week 36 to 1.9% in Week 40, 2021), further fueling respiratory illnesses not attributable to influenza.  
   - Minimal influenza circulation (e.g., 0.1% test positivity in Weeks 36–40) suggests most ILI cases were caused by other pathogens. This aligns with continued low influenza activity despite stable ILI rates.  

4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence of 1203 in Week 45, 2021, is likely influenced by the slight upward turn in the final week of past occurrences, persistent elevated PIC mortality, disruptions to ILI data due to pandemic-driven healthcare behavior changes, and the contribution of non-influenza respiratory pathogens in maintaining ILI levels amid limited influenza circulation.
