1. The ILI occurrences from the past five weeks (Week21, 2024 to Week25, 2024) show a consistent downward trend: 1492 → 1367 → 1119 → 924 → 879. This declining pattern indicates a steady reduction in ILI activity over time, likely as the flu season transitions further into the off-season. The week-to-week decrease in ILI occurrences is calculated as follows: Week21 to Week22 = (1367 - 1492) / 1492 ≈ -8.4%; Week22 to Week23 = (1119 - 1367) / 1367 ≈ -18.1%; Week23 to Week24 = (924 - 1119) / 1119 ≈ -17.4%; and Week24 to Week25 = (879 - 924) / 924 ≈ -4.9%. The overall rate of change shows a slowing reduction, indicating stabilization toward baseline levels typical of the off-season.
2. Week30, 2024 belongs to the "Off-season" based on the U.S. flu season classification, as it occurs after the peak season (generally Week46 to Week6) and is still before the next peak onset season (starting around Week32). Past trends and CDC data indicate stable, low ILI activity levels during this off-season period.
3. Correlation analysis between past trends and future occurrences shows that the consistent reduction in ILI data is indicative of a regression toward baseline levels. Using a weighted decay model based on the percentage decline observed in the last five weeks, we focus on the Week24-to-Week25 slowdown (4.9% decrease, lower than prior weeks). Forecasting forward, we assume a continued but diminishing rate of weekly decline (about 4.9%-5%). Given the Week25 value (879), a compounded reduction over five weeks would yield ~778. The calculation is: 879 × (1 - 0.05)^5 ≈ 778, assuming the progression stabilizes toward minimal activity characteristic of the off-season.
4. The following CDC report factors strongly influence the prediction:
1. Influenza activity remains low nationally, with positivity rates in clinical labs continuing to decline: 1.7% (Week21) → 1.8% → 1.6% → 1.4% → 1.1% (Week25). This highlights consistent reductions in viral activity.
2. Outpatient respiratory illness visits, an indicator of ILI, have stayed below the national baseline throughout this period, declining from 1.9% in Week21 to 1.5% in Week25.
3. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, RSV) complicates ILI patterns but contributes to stability, as no individual virus shows explosive growth. Surveillance detects no significant novel influenza strains, which limits the likelihood of unexpected surges in ILI occurrences.
5. The prediction of 778 ILI occurrences for Week30, 2024 aligns with a continuation of the downward trend observed in recent weeks, the off-season's characteristic low ILI activity, and the stable surveillance indicators provided in the CDC reports. The quantitative calculation combines the observed rate of decline with season-appropriate adjustments, leading to a steady regression toward the off-season baseline. Together, these factors justify the forecasted value.
