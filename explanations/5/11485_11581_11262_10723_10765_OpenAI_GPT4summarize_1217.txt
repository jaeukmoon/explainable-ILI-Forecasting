1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['11485', '11581', '11262', '10723', '10765']. There was an initial minor rise from 11485 (Week 8, 2023) to 11581 (Week 9, 2023), followed by a steady decline to 10765 (Week 12, 2023), reflecting a reduced overall ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A strong correlation exists between the decline in past ILI occurrences and the reported future ILI occurrences being significantly lower at 8843 after 5 weeks (Week 17, 2023). The consistent drop in ILI occurrences, particularly between Weeks 10–12, strongly aligns with the lower ILI activity observed in Week 17, 2023.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI dropped steadily from 2.6% (Week 8, 2023) to 2.3% (Week 12, 2023), remaining below the national baseline of 2.5% and signaling reduced healthcare encounters for respiratory illnesses, which likely contributed to the future decrease in ILI occurrences.
4. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza stabilized, ranging from 59.9 per 100,000 (Week 8, 2023) to 60.8 per 100,000 (Week 12, 2023), and weekly hospitalizations for influenza remained stable at low levels (e.g., 1387 in Week 10, 2023). This stability in hospitalizations indicates declining severe illness trends, reflective of the lower ILI activity observed in Week 17, 2023.
5. Declining PIC mortality rates, from 9.2% (Week 8, 2023) to 8.3% (Week 12, 2023), along with ongoing low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.9%-1.0% in Weeks 8–12, 2023), highlight weakening respiratory virus activity, further linked to the future drop in ILI occurrences to 8843.
6. Northern hemisphere seasonality and the co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and Influenza remained stable or demonstrated decreasing activity (e.g., Week 12, 2023), reflecting diminished respiratory illness burdens, which anticipated the 8843 future ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 8843 (Week 17, 2023) can be attributed to the persistent downward trend in past ILI activity, declining outpatient ILI visits, stable or reduced hospitalizations, decreasing PIC mortality rates, low influenza positivity, and seasonally consistent reductions in respiratory illness trends. This unified convergence of data highlights reduced respiratory illness activity over time.
