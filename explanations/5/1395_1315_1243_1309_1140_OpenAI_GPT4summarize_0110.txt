1. The reported ILI counts from Week35 to Week39, 2021 are 1395, 1315, 1243, 1309, and 1140. The trend exhibits a steady decline from Week35 (1395) to Week39 (1140), with a small rebound in Week38 (1309). This suggests a decreasing overall pattern, interspersed with minor fluctuations.
2. Week44, 2021, falls within the Peak onset season. In the U.S., the Peak onset season typically spans from Week32 to Week46. Given the timeline and the current surveillance data reflecting low influenza circulation and a steady baseline (Week35, 2021 #1; Week39, 2021 #1), Week44, 2021 is classified as late Peak onset season.
3. The declining trend from Week35 to Week39, 2021, suggests that a continuation of low to moderate ILI activity levels is likely for the next 5 weeks. Forecasting based on this time-series trajectory suggests that the ILI numbers will remain stable or slightly fluctuate around these low values, contributing to the prediction of 1228 occurrences for Week44, 2021.
4. Influenza activity remains minimal nationwide with 0.9-1.9% of outpatient visits attributed to ILI, well below the national baseline of 2.4-2.6% (Week35 to Week39, 2021 #1). This indicates low influenza circulation and reduced transmission levels.
5. The concurrent influence of non-influenza respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens, continues to impact overall respiratory illness visits (Week36, 2021 #2; Week37, 2021 #5; Week39, 2021 #2), though these are not directly driving sharp increases in general influenza activity.
6. Low vaccination updates or coverage for seasonal influenza, combined with sustained minimal virus positivity rates in clinical and public health labs, contribute to limited ILI growth (Week36, 2021 #8; Week38, 2021 #6; Week39, 2021 #8). Despite CDC recommendations for vaccination, data indicate only modest uptake in prior seasons.
7. Given the observed steady decline in ILI occurrences, the classification of Week44 within late Peak onset season, the minimal influenza circulation, impacts of other respiratory viruses, and limited vaccination trends, 1228 ILI occurrences are forecast for Week44, 2021. This projection aligns with historical patterns and current influencing factors, suggesting a continuation of low ILI activity levels.
