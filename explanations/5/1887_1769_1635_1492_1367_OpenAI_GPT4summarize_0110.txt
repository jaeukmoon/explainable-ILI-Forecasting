1. The reported ILI counts from Week18 to Week22, 2024 show a consistent decreasing trend: 1887, 1769, 1635, 1492, and 1367. This continuous decline signals diminishing influenza activity over the five-week period, suggesting reduced disease transmission and seasonal recession with no significant spikes in activity.
2. In the U.S., Week27, 2024 falls within the off-season (Week9 to Week30). During this period, influenza activity is typically subdued, with minimal transmission and lower ILI occurrence levels, consistent with observed declining patterns in previous weeks.
3. From the time-series perspective, the steady decline in ILI occurrences over the last five weeks strongly informs the forecast. Assuming a similar trend persists in the short term, the future value of 727 in Week27 reflects a continuation of diminishing activity, typical of the off-season. The value is consistent with the models’ tendency to project further reductions during offseason periods following sustained declines.
4. Recent influenza activity has remained low, with positivity rates decreasing from 3.1% in Week18 to 1.8% in Week22. Stable outpatient ILI visit percentages (maintained below the baseline at 2.1% in Week18, reducing to 1.9% by Week22) further indicate reduced ILI prevalence across communities, supporting an off-season forecast of 727 occurrences.
5. The influenza vaccine remains effective, with circulating strains matching vaccine components. Despite no change in vaccination coverage reports, this compatibility minimizes severe cases or rapid spread (Week18, 2024 #8; Week21, 2024 #10; Week22, 2024 #13). High antiviral effectiveness against most strains (Week18, 2024 #7) limits severe outcomes, helping to sustain low ILI activity.
6. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, continues over Week18 to Week22 but contributes variably to overall ILI trends without directly influencing a flu resurgence (Week18, 2024 #10; Week20, 2024 #12; Week22, 2024 #10). Novel influenza viruses like A(H5) remain isolated with no evidence of widespread spillover into human influenza cases (Week20, 2024 #7; Week21, 2024 #4).
7. Considering the sustained downward trend in ILI reports, the off-season timing of Week27, 2024, effective vaccine coverage, and the absence of novel or variant-driven surges, the predicted value of 727 accurately reflects the expected low-level influenza activity consistent with offseason dynamics.
