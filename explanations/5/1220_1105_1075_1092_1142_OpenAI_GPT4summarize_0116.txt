1. The past ILI occurrences from Week26, 2023 to Week30, 2023 show a generally fluctuating pattern: 1220 (Week26), 1105 (Week27), 1075 (Week28), 1092 (Week29), and 1142 (Week30). The trend indicates an initial decline from Week26 to Week28, followed by a slight recovery in Week29 and Week30. This fluctuation suggests no significant spikes but rather moderate variability. Using a moving calculation of the differences (Week27-Week26: -115, Week28-Week27: -30, Week29-Week28: +17, Week30-Week29: +50), it can be deduced that recent increases (Weeks29-30) may reflect a moderate rise in future weeks.
2. Week35, 2023 falls within the Peak onset season, based on U.S. seasonal influenza patterns as the CDC classifies this period (Week32 to Week46). This timeframe typically sees activity beginning to increase from baseline levels toward the peak season, which aligns with slight upticks observed in Weeks29-30. This seasonal classification strongly supports a forecast of moderate increases by Week35.
3. The correlation analysis between historical fluctuations and future ILI occurrences relies on observed patterns. From Week26-Week30, the average ILI occurrence is (1220+1105+1075+1092+1142)/5 = 1126.8. Calculating the numerical trends, we observe an average weekly decrease across the first three weeks of about -72.5 and an average increase in the last two weeks of +33.5. Projecting forward using these observed fluctuations and incorporating the likely pattern of modest season-driven increases in the Peak onset season, a plausible estimate for Week35 aligns with an ILI occurrence close to prior peak values.
4. Three specific factors from the CDC summarized reports contribute quantitatively to the 1208 forecast:
5. 1. Influenza A (H1N1) dominance: Weeks26-30 revealed that Influenza A ((H1N1)pdm09) remains the dominant strain, accounting for about 59%-67% of clinical lab specimens. Elevated transmission potential is expected as seasonal activity intensifies during the Peak onset season, leading to a modest increase in ILI occurrences. This likely contributes an estimated 3%-5% rise above the Week30 occurrence of 1142, suggesting a range of 1175-1200.
6. 2. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, SARS-CoV-2): Weeks26-30 reports highlight ongoing co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses. The CDC anticipates variability due to these factors, with possible increases across certain regions. This could contribute an additional ~0.5%-1%, supporting an adjustment of ~+5 to the previously estimated range.
7. 3. Seasonal progression into Peak onset season: Historically, the Peak onset season drives gradual increases in ILI due to heightened transmission rates and a simultaneous fall in vaccination uptake as the preceding flu season wanes. Factoring in a seasonal effect forecast of ~0.5%-1% increase, this elevates the Week35 prediction to approximately 1208.
5. By integrating all calculations and key insights, the final forecast for Week35, 2023 is 1208. This value reflects the observed average, adjusted by the recent upward trend, the dominance of Influenza A, co-circulating viruses, and seasonal effects characteristic of the Peak onset season.
