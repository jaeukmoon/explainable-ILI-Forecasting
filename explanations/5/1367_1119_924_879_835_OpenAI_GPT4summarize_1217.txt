1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrate a consistent decline, with values of ['1367', '1119', '924', '879', '835']. This steady downward trajectory began with 1367 in Week22, 2024, and continued to 835 in Week26, 2024, indicating a marked reduction in ILI activity over the observed period. With no significant spikes or plateaus noted, the trend reflects a gradual reduction in reported cases.
2. The correlation between past and future ILI occurrences suggests that the consistent decline in Weeks22–26, 2024, aligns with the reported drop to 795 future occurrences by Week31, 2024. The steady downward pattern observed in past data emphasizes the continued low ILI activity after 5 weeks, with the future data reflecting a natural progression of this trend.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses remained below baseline levels across all 5 weeks, declining from 1.9% in Week22, 2024, to 1.4% in Week26, 2024. This decrease in outpatient visits reflects reduced healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory symptoms, correlating with the continued dip to 795 future ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza positivity rates followed a downward trend, reducing from 1.8% in Week22, 2024, to 1.0% in Week26, 2024. The low rates of influenza detection contributed directly to the declining ILI occurrences, consistent with the forecasted future data.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses showed limited activity, with no significant detections or surges in novel or existing respiratory pathogens across the reporting weeks. Stable antiviral susceptibility and vaccine coverage further minimized the impact of influenza-like illnesses, reinforcing the low future ILI occurrence level of 795 as projected.
6. In summary, the reported 795 future ILI occurrences by Week31, 2024, result from the consistent decrease in ILI activity from Weeks22–26, 2024, as evidenced by declining case counts, reduced outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses, dropping influenza positivity rates, and the absence of significant co-circulating virus activity. These factors collectively contribute to the continued low ILI activity projected in the future data.
