1. The reported ILI counts from Week19 to Week23, 2022 are 1809, 1954, 2058, 1858, and 1595. The trend shows a gradual increase from Week19 (1809) to Week21 (2058), followed by a notable decline through Week23 (1595). This overall pattern indicates an initially rising trend, transitioning into a marked reduction across the final two weeks, suggesting a declining trajectory as the season progresses.
2. Forecasting Week28, 2022 aligns with the off-season as it occurs well after the peak season (typically Week46 to Week6) and before the peak onset season, which usually begins around Week32 or later. Declining ILI activity further supports this classification.
3. From a time-series perspective, the sharp decrease observed in Week22 and Week23 suggests a continuing downward trend. Extrapolating this decline implies lower activity levels in the upcoming weeks, consistent with off-season patterns. This historical trend supports a forecast of 898 ILI occurrences for Week28, 2022.
4. The seasonality of influenza impacts activity, as the off-season typically coincides with lower ILI rates due to reduced community transmission and virus circulation (Week23, 2022 #1, #9).
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, has been notable but moderate (Week22, 2022 #9). A declining positivity rate and reduced outpatient respiratory visits also align with decreasing ILI numbers (Week23, 2022 #1, #3).
6. Antigenic variances of Influenza A(H3N2) strains relative to the vaccine strain have limited vaccine effectiveness (Week21, 2022 #7), but vaccination efforts remain robust (Week22, 2022 #8). A reduction in late-season antigenic match and co-circulatory activity likely suppresses significant influenza transmission into Week28, 2022.
7. The predicted ILI occurrence of 898 for Week28, 2022 is justified by the declining trend in recent weeks, classification as off-season, the seasonal suppression of ILI activity, moderate co-circulation of respiratory illnesses, and diminished outpatient respiratory visits. These factors together support a projection of reduced ILI activity for the target week.
