1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a predominantly rising trend, with values of ['1543', '1531', '1502', '1743', '1887']. After a slight decline from 1543 (Week33, 2021) to 1502 (Week35, 2021), there was a marked increase to 1743 (Week36, 2021) and further to 1887 (Week37, 2021). The sharp rise toward the later weeks suggests an escalation in ILI activity leading into the future period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences. The significant increase observed in the last two weeks of the past data (Weeks 36–37, 2021) aligns with the elevated future ILI occurrences of 1800 five weeks later, indicating that the upward trend served as a precursor to sustained ILI activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed incremental increases among certain age groups and regions throughout Weeks33–37, 2021, beginning at 2.2% (Weeks33–34, 2021), peaking at 2.3% (Week36, 2021), and slightly dropping to 2.1% (Week37, 2021). These changes, although below baseline, reflect broader respiratory illness trends, potentially contributing to elevated future ILI occurrences.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold during this period, increasing from 17.2% (Week33, 2021) to 21.1% (Week37, 2021). Driven mainly by COVID-19, this high PIC mortality indicates persistent respiratory illness activity, correlating with rising ILI cases.
5. The concurrent circulation of non-influenza respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, highlighted in all weeks, significantly influenced ILI occurrences. Minimal influenza activity (0.1% positivity in clinical specimens) suggests that other pathogens predominantly impacted the observed and future ILI trends. Additionally, altered healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional reporting and likely concentrated reported ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 1800 future ILI occurrences (five weeks after Week37, 2021) can be attributed to the sharp upward trajectory in Weeks36–37, 2021, increased ILI-related outpatient visits, sustained high PIC mortality driven by respiratory illnesses, and the compounding effects of pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare-seeking and surveillance systems.
