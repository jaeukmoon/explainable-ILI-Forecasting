1. Explanation:
1. The past 5 weeks' ILI occurrences from Week4, 2024 to Week8, 2024 are ['18657', '17687', '16168', '16987', '16544'], showing a general decreasing trend. The ILI occurrences dropped consistently from Week4 (18657) to Week6 (16168), rebounded slightly in Week7 (16987), and declined again in Week8 (16544). This trend indicates a stabilization at a moderately high activity level but with an overall gradual downward trajectory in ILI occurrences. Averaging the decrease: [(17687-18657), (16168-17687), (16987-16168), (16544-16987)] = [-970, -1519, +819, -443], we see an average decrease per week of approximately -528. Applying this rate to Week13, 2024 would predict a decline of 5 weeks × (-528) = -2640 from Week8, giving 16544 - 2640 = 13904 as the baseline projection.
2. Week13, 2024 belongs to the "Off-season" based on the U.S. influenza season cycle. Typically, the peak season concludes by Week6 or Week7, transitioning into the off-season by Week9 when ILI activity declines toward baseline levels. Additionally, the ongoing declining trend in ILI occurrences further reinforces that flu activity for Week13 aligns with typical off-season characteristics.
3. The correlation between past trends and future ILI occurrences suggests that the gradual decline observed from Week4, 2024 to Week8, 2024 likely continues during the off-season due to reduced flu transmission and increased vaccination effects. The slight week-to-week variability, such as the temporary rebound in Week7, should still result in an overall decline. As the flu season transitions into off-season activity, historical patterns support that ILI occurrences tend to taper steadily rather than spike.
4. Three key CDC-reported factors further quantify and influence future ILI projection to Week13, 2024:
5. - **Decreasing influenza positivity rates**: The percentage of specimens testing positive declined progressively from Week4 (16.2%) to Week8 (14.2%). A drop of about 0.5% per week signals lower transmission intensity, which directly corresponds to reduced ILI occurrences.
6. - **Vaccination emphasis**: Consistent CDC recommendations for vaccination likely increased vaccination rates as the season progressed. Widespread immunization dampens flu transmission toward the off-season, contributing to the ILI decrease.
7. - **Seasonal decline in hospitalizations and mortality**: Hospitalization rates only slightly increased between weeks (e.g., 47.8 per 100,000 in Week4 to 61.5 per 100,000 in Week8), but these changes primarily impacted high-risk populations. Mortality from influenza also stabilized at around 0.7%-0.8%, indicating no resurgence of severe flu outcomes. These cumulative trends suggest waning ILI burden moving into Week13.
5. Combining the quantitative decline observed in past ILI trends, seasonality effects transitioning into the off-season, and CDC-reported factors like vaccination and decreasing positivity, a slight adjustment to the baseline forecast is necessary due to the expected stabilization effect during the off-season. A final modest downward adjustment of approximately 0.5% to account for further seasonal stabilization (13904 × 0.995 = 13834) aligns the predicted ILI occurrence for Week13, 2024 to 13834. This value reflects a steady off-season decline from the high-level flu activity observed earlier in the season.
