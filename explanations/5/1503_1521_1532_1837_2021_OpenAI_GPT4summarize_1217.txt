1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but overall upward trend, with values of ['1503', '1521', '1532', '1837', '2021']. An initial gradual increase is observed from 1503 (Week 7, 2021) to 1532 (Week 9, 2021). This is followed by a significant rise to 1837 (Week 10, 2021) and further to 2021 (Week 11, 2021), demonstrating a marked escalation in ILI activity toward the end of the period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the sharp rise in occurrences toward the latter weeks of the past data, particularly from Week 9 to Week 11, 2021, aligns with the future increase to 1924 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 16, 2021). The significant rise in Weeks 10 and 11 likely contributed to sustaining elevated levels reflected in the future data.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable but below baseline values, consistently near 0.9%, from Week 7 to Week 11, 2021. However, these levels are coupled with reports of increasing trends among children aged 0–4 years over the past eight weeks. This pediatric trend suggests a gradual amplification in ILI dynamics, potentially contributing to the rise in future occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded epidemic thresholds throughout the observed period, decreasing from 19.3% (Week 7, 2021) to 12.1% (Week 11, 2021). Despite the decline, these values consistently reflect heightened respiratory illness activity, aligning with the increase in future ILI cases.
5. COVID-19-related disruptions to healthcare-seeking behaviors and data interpretations were reported throughout Weeks 7–11, 2021. These disruptions likely impacted the surveillance of ILI cases, masking potential increases during the observed period. However, delayed recognition or reporting may have surfaced in subsequent weeks, contributing to the rise to 1924 cases after Week 11, 2021.
6. Nationwide influenza activity remained unusually low, with consistently less than 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza. Despite this, a rise in Influenza A proportions in positive specimens and steady reports of novel influenza strains (e.g., A(H1N1)v) suggest that non-influenza respiratory illnesses or atypical flu trends could moderately influence the higher future ILI data.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences (1924, Week 16, 2021) can be attributed to the escalating pattern in Weeks 10–11, 2021, increasing pediatric ILI trends, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, potential delays in ILI reporting due to COVID-19 impacts, and lower influenza activity coupled with non-influenza respiratory illnesses.
