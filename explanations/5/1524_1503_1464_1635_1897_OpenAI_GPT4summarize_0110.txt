1. The reported ILI counts from Week38 to Week42, 2023 are 1524, 1503, 1464, 1635, and 1897. Initially, the ILI trend was slightly declining from Week38 (1524) to Week40 (1464), followed by a noticeable increase from Week41 (1635) to Week42 (1897). Overall, the data indicates a moderate upward trend in ILI occurrences, particularly during Weeks41–42, suggesting an emerging rise in activity.
2. Forecasting Week47, 2023 corresponds to the peak season. The U.S. peak season typically spans Week46 through Week6 of the following year. The gradual increase in ILI activity observed during Weeks41–42, 2023 aligns with the seasonal rise leading into peak season dynamics.
3. Historical ILI trends indicate a progressive increase as influenza activity transitions from the peak onset season into the peak season. The sharp rise seen during Week41 and Week42, 2023, projects forward into a continued expansion in ILI occurrences for Week47, 2023. Based on time-series forecasting, the expected trajectory points to higher ILI intensities consistent with peak season levels, justifying the prediction of 3100 cases.
4. Regional increases in influenza positivity were observed in Weeks41–42, 2023 (Week41, 2023 #10; Week42, 2023 #11). Influenza positivity nationally rose from 1.3% (Week41, 2023 #1) to 1.7% (Week42, 2023 #1), reflecting broadening transmission dynamics as the season progresses.
5. Hospitalization rates for Week42, 2023 showed a continued rise (0.5 cumulative per 100,000, Week42, 2023 #3), indicative of growing influenza-related burden. This trend supports a projection of increased ILI activity through the upcoming weeks.
6. SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory viruses are co-circulating with influenza (Week41, 2023 #9; Week42, 2023 #8), complicating attribution but contributing to elevated outpatient ILI visits (2.5% by Week42, 2023 #5). Combined respiratory pathogen activity likely amplifies ILI occurrences independent of influenza alone.
7. Considering the upward trend in ILI occurrences, the ongoing transition to peak season, increases in positivity rates, rising hospitalizations, and additional contributions from co-circulating respiratory viruses, the predicted ILI occurrence for Week47, 2023 is justified at 3100.
