1. The reported ILI counts from Week3 to Week7, 2021 are 1042, 883, 812, 684, and 559. This trend shows a consistent decrease in occurrences, indicating declining influenza-like illness activity over five weeks without any significant fluctuations or reversals.
2. Week12, 2021 falls well after the typical peak season (which generally concludes by Week6) and occurs during the period when ILI activity remains subdued. Based on the timing and low reported influenza-positive rates (Week7, 2021 #1), Week12, 2021 is classified as part of the off-season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the steady downward trajectory of ILI occurrences over five weeks suggests that the future value will continue decreasing but at a slower rate as it approaches a lower limit. Using this pattern, the model anticipates a gradual decline, projecting Week12, 2021 ILI occurrences as 664, a value consistent with prior trends.
4. Nationwide influenza activity remained unusually low, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in Weeks4 through Week7. This suggests minimal flu circulation, influencing reduced ILI (Week4, 2021 #1; Week5, 2021 #1; Week7, 2021 #1).
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes and surveillance challenges caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as consistently highlighted in Weeks3 through Week7 summaries, play a critical role in the low observed ILI trends and influence projections (Week3, 2021 #7; Week5, 2021 #9; Week7, 2021 #9).
6. Despite CDC's encouragement for vaccination and no significant data indicating widespread uptake, minimal flu activity across jurisdictions, with the dominance of Influenza B and no noted outbreaks, reinforces the expectation of continued low ILI activity into Week12 (Week6, 2021 #10; Week7, 2021 #12).
7. The declining trend in ILI occurrences, off-season timing (Week12, 2021), unusually low influenza activity, COVID-19's impact on healthcare behaviors, and historical projection from the time-series model together justify the forecast of 664 ILI occurrences for Week12, 2021.
