1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week7 to Week11, 2022 are 1493, 1401, 1559, 1593, and 1729, showing a consistent upward trend over the past five weeks. The increase is gradual, with no significant spikes or drops, demonstrating a steady growth pattern in ILI activity. This gradual rise suggests increasing influenza activity in the population during this period.
2. Considering Week16, 2022 lies after the typical peak season (which ends near Week6 in most U.S. flu years), this forecasted week is more likely associated with the off-season. While ILI activity is rising, it does not reflect the extreme intensity and widespread transmission of the peak season, aligning with off-season characteristics.
3. From the time-series perspective, the observed rise in ILI occurrences from Week7 to Week11, 2022, suggests the persistence of influenza activity in the coming weeks. Projecting this growth forward, the consistent increase aligns with a moderate extension of ILI levels, resulting in the modeled occurrence of 2309 in Week16, 2022. This reflects a predictive law of continuing the gradual trajectory seen in previous weeks, factoring in the influence of steady activity typical of a post-peak phase.
4. The percentage of positive influenza tests increased each week, from 4.2% in Week7, 2022 to 7.7% in Week11, 2022, reflecting an upward trend in community-level influenza spread.
5. Influenza A(H3N2) is the dominant subtype, with some antigenic differences reported from vaccine strains. This mismatch could lead to reduced vaccine effectiveness and consequently higher spread in subsequent weeks. This antigenic drift aligns with increased occurrences in the forecasted target week.
6. Hospitalization rates increased incrementally throughout the period, from a cumulative rate of 4.9 per 100,000 in Week7, 2022 to 6.5 per 100,000 in Week11, 2022. This steady rise indicates growing strain on healthcare systems, driven by increasing viral transmission, which also supports future higher ILI counts.
7. With a steady uptick in ILI percentages, antigenic considerations affecting vaccine efficacy, and rising hospitalization rates, coupled with the consistent growth trend from past weeks, Week16, 2022 is projected to see 2309 occurrences. These factors support a scenario of elevated yet manageable ILI activity consistent with off-season patterns.
