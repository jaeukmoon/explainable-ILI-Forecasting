1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a clear upward trajectory, with values changing sequentially from 1208 (Week 35, 2023) to 2037 (Week 39, 2023). There was a steady increase from 1208 to 2035 over Weeks 35–38, with only a marginal rise from 2035 to 2037 in Week 39, 2023. This pattern demonstrates sustained growth in ILI activity over the observed period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the persistent rise in ILI activity over the past weeks (culminating at 2037 in Week 39, 2023) aligns with the notable jump to 2743 occurrences reported after 5 weeks (Week 44, 2023). The consistent upward trend in Weeks 35–39, 2023, provides a foundation for the substantial increase in Week 44, 2023.
3. Outpatient ILI visit percentages remained low but showed slight increases, moving from 1.9% in Week 35, 2023, to 2.1% in Week 39, 2023. The persistently higher rates among children aged 0–4 years, peaking at 7.1% in Week 39, point to enhanced pediatric contributions to ILI trends, correlating with the rise in future occurrences. Elevated PIC mortality rates consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, with values ranging from 7.0% in Week 36, 2023, to 7.6% in Week 37, showcasing a stable respiratory illness burden contributing to the future surge. Increasing co-circulation of respiratory viruses noted repeatedly across reports accentuates the complexity of ILI surveillance, potentially amplifying ILI occurrences in Week 44, 2023.
4. The steady upward trajectory in past ILI occurrences, alongside subtle rises in outpatient ILI visit percentages and consistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, points to increased respiratory disease activity fueling the rise to 2743 ILI occurrences in Week 44, 2023. Persistent co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses likely compounded this trend, supporting the observed escalation over background ILI activity levels.
