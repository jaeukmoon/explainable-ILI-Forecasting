1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent upward trend with values of ['1184', '1196', '1289', '1500', '1508']. Starting from Week37, 2023, there was a steady rise from 1184 to 1508 in Week41, 2023. This steady increase, particularly in the last three weeks, indicates a sustained escalation in ILI activity, suggesting an amplifying trend heading into subsequent weeks.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 1860 display a strong positive correlation with the observed upward trajectory in the past data. The consistent growth from Week39, 2023 (1289), through Week41, 2023 (1508), underpins this correlation, as the pattern indicated a continuation of rising ILI activity levels into the following weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a gradual increase during the monitored period, moving from 2.0% (Week37, 2023) to 2.3% (Week41, 2023). This steady rise in outpatient ILI reports reflects growing respiratory illness burdens, contributing to the increase in future occurrences. Hospital admissions associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza increased weekly, from 820 (Week37, 2023) to 1228 (Week41, 2023), suggesting intensifying flu activity influencing ILI rates. Regional variations in respiratory virus co-circulation, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV, were consistently reported, with slight increases in influenza positivity in Week41, 2023, signaling growing transmission in specific areas. These co-circulating pathogens likely contributed to the rise in ILI cases.
4. Despite low national-level influenza activity, the observed consistent increases in outpatient ILI visits, hospital admissions, and regional flu positivity indicate localized intensifications in respiratory illness pressures. Co-circulating respiratory pathogens and slight upticks in transmission further compounded these effects.
5. In summary, the future occurrences of 1860 (Week46, 2023) can be attributed to the sustained upward trend in past ILI occurrences, increasing outpatient ILI visits and hospital admissions, regional variability in co-circulating respiratory pathogens, and rising flu positivity toward the end of the past monitored period.
