1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent upward trend, increasing from 1170 in Week 47, 2021, to 1746 in Week 51, 2021. This progression reflects a steady intensification in ILI activity, with Week 51, 2021, marking the peak during this period. The rise in occurrences demonstrates a clear trajectory of growing respiratory illness burden.

2. A strong positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the continuous rise in ILI cases up to 1746 (Week 51, 2021) is aligned with the reported ILI value of 1567 after 5 weeks (Week 6, 2022). Although the future ILI value (1567) is slightly lower, it signifies a sustained high level of activity following the peak observed in Week 51, 2021.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased steadily across the 5 weeks, from 2.4% in Week 47, 2021, to 3.8% in Week 51, 2021, surpassing the national baseline of 2.5%. This growth reflects an underlying rise in respiratory illness activity that correlates with the elevated future occurrence value. Additional factors include a significant rise in influenza positivity in clinical labs, from 1.5% in Week 47 to 6.2% in Week 51, driven predominantly by Influenza A(H3N2). Furthermore, hospitalizations for influenza-related illnesses increased sharply from 495 in Week 47 to 1825 in Week 51, mirroring the observed increase in ILI occurrences. Finally, the ongoing co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, further fueled the growth in ILI activity during this period.

4. In summary, the reported future ILI value of 1567 (Week 6, 2022) can be attributed to the consistent upward trend in ILI occurrences during Weeks 47–51, 2021, the continued rise in outpatient ILI visits exceeding the baseline, heightened influenza positivity rates, surging influenza-related hospitalizations, and the overlapping influence of multiple respiratory viruses. These factors collectively explain the elevated future ILI activity.
