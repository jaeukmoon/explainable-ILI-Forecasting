1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week9 to Week13, 2021 are 1517, 1585, 1673, 1893, and 1956. The trend indicates a steady increase in ILI occurrences across the five weeks, with no significant fluctuations or dips. This suggests that ILI activity during this period is on a mild upward trajectory.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the next, with off-season occurring thereafter. Given that Week18, 2021 falls well outside the usual peak seasonal timeline and that influenza surveillance data reports unusually low activity nationwide (Week9, 2021 #1; Week10, 2021 #1; Week11, 2021 #1; Week12, 2021 #1; Week13, 2021 #1), Week18, 2021 aligns with the off-season classification.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent increase in ILI occurrences over five weeks suggests a gradually rising trend, but levels remain well below epidemic or peak thresholds. By projecting this trend forward to Week18, 2021, the data suggests continued mild increases, contributing to the estimate of 2022 as the ILI occurrence. The relatively slow growth aligns with off-season expectations due to low overall influenza activity.
4. The national influenza positivity rate from respiratory specimens has remained at 0.1% for five consecutive weeks, providing further confirmation of minimal influenza activity nationwide (Week9, 2021 #1; Week10, 2021 #1; Week11, 2021 #1; Week12, 2021 #1; Week13, 2021 #1).
5. Pediatric ILI activity trends have shown slight increases in children aged 0–4 years over the past eight weeks, whereas other age groups remain stable or decline (Week9, 2021 #9; Week12, 2021 #5). While marginally elevated activity is noticed in younger populations, it does not suggest a widespread or sharply accelerating outbreak.
6. COVID-19 continues to dominate overall PIC-related mortality and healthcare disruption, complicating the interpretation of ILI data trends (Week9, 2021 #10; Week10, 2021 #9; Week11, 2021 #9; Week12, 2021 #10; Week13, 2021 #8). However, no substantial influenza-related increase or additional strain emergence has been noted for this period.
7. Based on the gradually rising ILI trend, off-season timing of Week18, 2021, continued historically low influenza activity, and stable surveillance patterns, the projected ILI occurrence of 2022 reflects a minor increase consistent with off-season variations but not indicative of a significant public health concern.
