1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1350', '1421', '1444', '1469', '1509']. There was a gradual increase from 1350 (Week27, 2024) to 1509 (Week31, 2024), marking a 12% overall increase, which reflects steadily rising ILI activity over this period.
2. There is a clear positive correlation between the past data and the future occurrence of 1849 after 5 weeks. The consistent increase in ILI occurrences during Week27–Week31, 2024, suggests the prevalence of rising respiratory illness activity, paving the way for the further substantial increase to 1849 by Week36, 2024. The upward momentum demonstrates a continuation of this trend.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a slight but steady increase from 1.4% (Week27, 2024) to 1.5% (Week31, 2024). This subtle upward trajectory in healthcare utilization for respiratory symptoms aligns with the later spike to 1849 ILI occurrences.
4. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza (A and B), SARS-CoV-2, and RSV, as reported from Week27 to Week31, 2024, likely contributed to increasing ILI activity and the rise after 5 weeks. While influenza activity remained low overall, regional variability in virus patterns may have escalated ILI cases.
5. Public health surveillance highlighted sporadic human infections with novel Influenza A(H5) and A(H3N2)v (Week28 and Week31, 2024). Though isolated, these zoonotic cases raise awareness of potential surges in respiratory illnesses, which may have compounded the increase to 1849 future occurrences.
6. High similarity between vaccine strains and circulating influenza viruses, reported across Week27–Week31, 2024, suggests that other respiratory pathogens or behaviors, such as reduced preventive interventions, may have played a larger role in increasing ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the rise to 1849 future ILI occurrences (Week36, 2024) is attributed to the steady upward trend in Weeks 27–31, an increase in ILI-related outpatient visits, the co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and isolated zoonotic influenza infections. These factors collectively indicate a continuation of increasing respiratory illness activity.
