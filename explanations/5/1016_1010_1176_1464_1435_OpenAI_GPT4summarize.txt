1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a generally increasing trend, with weekly values of ['1016', '1010', '1176', '1464', '1435']. While a slight decrease was observed from Week 11, 2021 (1016) to Week 12, 2021 (1010), subsequent weeks exhibited marked increases, peaking at 1464 in Week 14, 2021, before a small dip to 1435 in Week 15, 2021. This overall upward trajectory in reported ILI cases indicates rising activity during this period.  

2. The upward trend in the past ILI occurrences strongly correlates with the reported future increase to 1856 after 5 weeks (Week 20, 2021). The rising figures in Weeks 13 and 14, 2021, which reached the highest observed values for the past period, act as a precursor to the future spike, suggesting a continuation of increased ILI activity.  

3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed slight increases, from 0.9% of all visits in Week 11, 2021, to 1.1% in Week 14 and Week 15, 2021, though remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%. This consistent uptick in outpatient encounters for ILI is indicative of an increasing burden of respiratory illnesses, contributing to the future rise in ILI occurrences.  
   
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained consistently elevated, surpassing epidemic thresholds in all weeks (e.g., 12.1% in Week 11, 2021, and 12.4% in Week 15, 2021). While most PIC deaths were driven by COVID-19, the persistently high PIC mortality aligns with increasing ILI activity and respiratory illness severity, directly correlating with the expected future increase.  
   
5. Healthcare-seeking behaviors were altered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted throughout the CDC reports. These changes complicated traditional surveillance and increased reporting variability for ILI, potentially leading to under-recognition during the observed weeks and a subsequent sharp future rise as cases began being captured more accurately.  

6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1856 (Week 20, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trend in past occurrences (particularly notable in Weeks 13 and 14, 2021), slight but steady increases in outpatient visits for ILI, persistently elevated PIC mortality rates exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the compounded effects of pandemic-related disruptions to surveillance and healthcare-seeking behaviors.
