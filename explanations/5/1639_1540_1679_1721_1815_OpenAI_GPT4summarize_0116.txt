1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from Week37, 2021 to Week41, 2021—['1639', '1540', '1679', '1721', '1815']—show a consistent increasing trend. Starting from Week37 (1639), there is a minor dip in Week38 (1540), followed by steady increases in Week39 (1679), Week40 (1721), and Week41 (1815). This upward trend reflects a growth rate over the past five weeks. Calculating the weekly percentage increase, the changes are approximately -6.04% (Week38), +9.03% (Week39), +2.50% (Week40), and +5.46% (Week41). This shows a consistent positive trend with minor fluctuations. Assuming an average weekly increase of 2-5.5% based on historical growth, a continuation of this trend over the next five weeks would project Week46, 2021 as a period of heightened ILI occurrences.
2. Week46, 2021 belongs to the "Peak onset season." According to the U.S. seasonal flu patterns and Background Knowledge #4, the Peak onset season typically spans Week32/35 through Week46, characterized by a gradual incline in ILI occurrences heading into peak activity. The increasing trend in the past weeks (Week37 to Week41) supports that Week46, 2021 falls during the latter stages of the Peak onset season, as ILI activity historically begins to concentrate and rise toward the annual peak.
3. To forecast future ILI occurrences for Week46, 2021, extrapolating from the observed trend is paramount. Assuming an average weekly increase of 2-5.5% based on the past five weeks, applying a compound growth rate formula iteratively can be used:
4. ILI_forecast = ILI_base * (1 + average_growth_rate)^interval_weeks.
5. Taking Week41, 2021 as the baseline (1815 occurrences), an assumed approximate average weekly growth rate of 4% (within the growth range) over five weeks leads to:
6. ILI_forecast = 1815 * (1 + 0.04)^5 ≈ 1815 * 1.216 ≈ 2190.
4. Three factors from the CDC reports strongly influence this forecast:
5. 1. **Vaccination patterns and CDC recommendations:** While vaccination efforts are emphasized by the CDC, uptake levels for this period have not yet been specified. With some individuals delaying vaccination or remaining unvaccinated, influenza spread remains a possibility, supporting an upward shift in ILI trends, particularly during the Peak onset season.
6. 2. **Limited influenza virus circulation and competing respiratory illnesses:** Despite low influenza positivity, increases in outpatient visits for non-influenza respiratory illnesses (e.g., other viruses impacting ILI rates) have contributed to rising trends. Non-flu pathogens contribute to observed ILI data, especially during this period of widespread respiratory activity.
7. 3. **Impacts of novel influenza variants and shifts in respiratory virus patterns:** Two variant cases (e.g., H3N2v) were reported by Week41, 2021, which might foreshadow an increasing circulation of potential influenza strains. Historical data suggests these introductions align with the Peak onset season's gradual rise in activity toward the peak period.
5. In summary, the consistent upward trend in the past five weeks, seasonal classification of Week46, 2021 as part of the Peak onset season, and the quantitative contribution of relevant CDC factors substantiate the forecast of 2190 ILI occurrences for Week46, 2021. The prediction integrates the observed growth rates, seasonality, and anticipated influences of vaccination, respiratory illnesses, and potential variant shifts.
