1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited an irregular trend, starting with a decline from 1976 (Week 36, 2021) to 1587 (Week 39, 2021), followed by a sharp rise to 2438 in Week 40, 2021. This abrupt increase in the final week highlights a dramatic shift in respiratory illness activity, marking a potential precursor to elevated ILI occurrences in subsequent weeks.
2. A clear positive correlation is identifiable between the strong resurgence in ILI occurrences during Week 40, 2021, and the future rise to 2671 after 5 weeks. The significant jump in Week 40 sets the stage for sustained higher ILI levels, influencing the trajectory of future data.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently low, stabilizing between 2.1% (Week 37, 2021) and 1.9% (Weeks 38–40, 2021), while remaining below the national baseline. These low percentages suggest a lagging indicator which, in combination with potential underreporting or other respiratory pathogen contributions, aids in explaining the subsequent future increase. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, peaking at 21.1% in Week 37, 2021, and gradually declining to 18.0% in Week 40, 2021. The persistent elevation in PIC mortality indirectly signals ongoing respiratory illness activity, reinforcing the anticipation of future higher ILI values. Public health lab identification of Influenza A subtypes (H1N1)pdm09 and H3N2 in Week 40, 2021, despite low overall circulation, may indicate a gradual resurgence contributing to respiratory illness trends. Surveillance challenges due to pandemic-driven healthcare behavior changes distorted traditional ILI reporting and created uncertainties in accurately interpreting trends. These disruptions likely contributed to under-reported cases, with corrections or compensatory adjustments appearing in future occurrences.
4. Despite minimal influenza circulation during Weeks 36–40, 2021, the observed spike in Week 40, persistent PIC mortality, and the impact of respiratory pathogens other than influenza, combined with pandemic disruptions, help explain the increase to 2671 future occurrences after 5 weeks in Week 45, 2021.
