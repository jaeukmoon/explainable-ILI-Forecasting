1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Week26–Week30, 2021) exhibited a consistent upward trend, starting from 1054 in Week26, increasing to 1075 in Week27, 1331 in Week28, 1372 in Week29, and peaking at 1609 in Week30. This steady and progressive rise indicates escalating ILI activity toward the end of the observed period.
2. A strong positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the gradual increase during Weeks26–Week30, 2021, likely anticipated the reported jump to 2388 after 5 weeks. The upward trajectory, particularly the sharp rise from Week29 to Week30, suggests growing respiratory illness patterns that align with the later peak in ILI occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a steady increase over 5 weeks, moving from 1.2% in Week26 to 1.3% in Week28, 1.7% in Week29, and 1.9% in Week30. This progressive rise across multiple age groups, particularly ages 0–4, 5–24, and 25–49, mirrors the observed climb in ILI occurrences and likely contributed to the future surge.
4. Mortality percentages due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained consistently above epidemic thresholds, climbing from 6.2% in Week26 to 9.0% in Week30. Although primarily attributed to COVID-19, the elevated PIC mortality reflects broad respiratory illness activity, correlating with the future ILI increase.
5. Alternative healthcare-seeking behaviors due to COVID-19 pandemic disruptions were highlighted throughout the CDC reports, complicating the accuracy of ILI trend interpretation. These changes likely concentrated ILI activity and reporting into subsequent weeks, amplifying the sharp rise to 2388 occurrences.
6. Minimal influenza positivity was observed in laboratory data, with influenza activity overshadowed by non-specific respiratory illnesses or other pathogens, such as COVID-19. The dominance of COVID-19 trends and shifts in healthcare patterns further fueled the delayed yet significant future ILI increase.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 2388 can be attributed to the persistent upward trend in Week26–Week30, 2021, increasing outpatient ILI visits, PIC mortality exceeding thresholds, pandemic-related shifts in healthcare behaviors, and indirect contributions from non-specific respiratory illnesses beyond influenza.
