1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks (Week25, 2021 to Week29, 2021) were ['1046', '965', '1107', '1072', '1230']. This data shows a generally upward trend. ILI occurrences began at 1046 in Week25, dipped to 965 in Week26, and then increased to 1107, 1072, and 1230 by Week29. This upward trend suggests a gradual rise in influenza-like illness activity, which may signal the beginning of a seasonal transition rather than isolated fluctuations. The average weekly growth rate across these weeks is calculated as:
2. [(965-1046)/1046 + (1107-965)/965 + (1072-1107)/1107 + (1230-1072)/1072]/4 ≈ -0.077 + 0.147 + -0.032 + 0.147 = 0.185/4 ≈ 0.046,
3. indicating an average weekly increase of ~4.6%.
2. Week34, 2021, the target week, belongs to the "Peak onset season" based on the U.S. flu season classifications. The Peak onset season typically spans from Week32 to Week46, immediately following the Off-season. The increasing ILI activity in recent weeks (ending in Week29, 2021) combined with historical patterns aligns with the characteristics of a Peak onset season, where influenza activity starts increasing from baseline levels toward higher peaks.
3. A linear projection method combined with historical trend analysis was used for prediction. Using the average weekly growth rate (4.6%) observed in the past, the projected value for Week30, Week31, Week32, Week33, and Week34 is calculated iteratively as follows:
4. Week30 = 1230 × (1 + 0.046) ≈ 1286.
5. Week31 = 1286 × (1 + 0.046) ≈ 1345.
6. Week32 = 1345 × (1 + 0.046) ≈ 1407.
7. Week33 = 1407 × (1 + 0.046) ≈ 1472.
8. Week34 = 1472 × (1 + 0.046) ≈ 1531.
9. Hence, the predicted ILI occurrences for Week34, 2021, is 1531.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports that strongly influence this forecast:
5. 1) Outpatient visit trends: ILI visits have shown a consistent increase in Weeks27-29, 2021, particularly in younger age groups (e.g., 0-4, 5-24, and 25-49 years). This trend signals a rising transmission of respiratory illnesses, contributing to the projected increase.
6. 2) Healthcare disruptions due to COVID-19: Changes in healthcare-seeking behavior and alternative care settings could result in underreporting, although indirect evidence (PIC death rates and age-stratified ILI increases) suggests rising activity. This may lead to sustained or slightly elevated activity levels in the weeks ahead.
7. 3) Seasonality: Week34, 2021, falls within the Peak onset season, when ILI activity typically starts increasing toward peak levels. This seasonality effect complements the aforementioned incremental trends seen recently.
5. In summary, the time series data from the past five weeks shows a clear upward trend, with past Weekly occurrence growth averaging at ~4.6%. Week34, 2021, aligns with the seasonal classification of the Peak onset season, a time when ILI activity begins to ramp up. Additionally, factors from the CDC reports, such as age-specific increases in ILI rates, disruptions in healthcare systems, and overall seasonality trends, support the expected upward trajectory during this period. With these combined analyses, Week34, 2021, is projected to have an ILI occurrence of 1531, reflecting a continuation of recent growth patterns observed in the data.
