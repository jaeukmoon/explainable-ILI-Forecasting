1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a steady upward trajectory, starting from 1888 (Week31, 2023) and increasing incrementally to 3153 (Week35, 2023). The rise from 1888 to 3153 shows a consistent growth in ILI activity, with the most pronounced increase occurring between Week33 (2662) and Week34 (3153). This pattern points to a progressive intensification in ILI activity over the period.
2. A positive correlation is evident between the past and future ILI occurrences. The persistent upward trajectory in the past weeks indicates increasing intensity, which aligns with the reported spike in future ILI occurrences to 5127 after 5 weeks. The pattern of escalation observed in Week34 (3153) and Week35 (3153) serves as a precursor to the significant rise in Week40, 2023.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased steadily from 1.1% (Week31, 2023) to 1.9% (Week35, 2023), with notable growth in visits among children aged 0-4 years, peaking at 7.2% in Week35. This rise in outpatient ILI encounters highlights an underlying increase in reported ILI cases and potential community transmission, contributing to the future surge. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) deaths consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, climbing from 5.9% (Week31, 2023) to 9.6% (Week35, 2023). This upward trend points to heightened respiratory illness activity, correlating with the increase in overall ILI occurrences. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including non-influenza pathogens, was repeatedly noted, with weekly reports emphasizing shifting healthcare dynamics and data disruptions affecting ILI recognition. These factors likely fueled the reported future rise. Minimal vaccination updates and reduced emphasis on seasonal influenza vaccination tracking were noted across all weeks. This limited vaccination coverage may have indirectly facilitated the higher transmission of ILI-related illnesses, contributing to the future increase.
4. In summary, the reported 5127 future ILI occurrences (Week40, 2023) can be attributed to the steady rise in past occurrences observed through Week31–Week35, increasing outpatient ILI visits, persistent PIC mortality rates exceeding thresholds, heightened non-influenza respiratory virus activity, and limited vaccination prioritization, all contributing collectively to the significant surge in ILI cases.
