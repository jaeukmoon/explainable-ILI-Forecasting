1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating trend: ['1783', '1898', '1867', '1941', '1388']. There was an initial rise from 1783 (Week 51, 2020) to 1898 (Week 52, 2020), followed by a slight dip to 1867 (Week 53, 2020). A peak of 1941 was observed in Week 1, 2021, but this was followed by a significant decline to 1388 in Week 2, 2021. This declining trend in Week 2, 2021 could have indicated an overall tapering of ILI occurrences during the observed period.

2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The significant decline in Week 2, 2021 acts as a precursor to the sharp downturn to 618 occurrences reported after 5 weeks (Week 7, 2021). The decreasing ILI activity aligns with suppressed influenza circulation associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and low influenza positivity rates reported during the period.

3. Factors contributing to the future decline to 618 occurrences are:  

   - **Minimal influenza activity and positivity rates**: Across the 5 weeks, respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza remained low, ranging between 0.1% (Week 53, 2020 and Week 2, 2021) and 0.4% (Week 1, 2021). Reduced virus circulation and testing positivity signify weak influenza activity leading to reduced ILI counts.  

   - **Healthcare-seeking changes due to COVID-19**: Reports consistently highlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic altered healthcare-seeking behaviors and complicated traditional ILI surveillance, contributing to reduced recognition and documentation of ILI cases in later periods.  

   - **Significant influence of PIC mortality by COVID-19**: Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds in all 5 weeks, with COVID-19 being the predominant contributor. This suggests a reduced burden of influenza-related ILI in favor of pandemic-driven surveillance focus on COVID-19.  

   - **Vaccination and preventative measures**: Reports emphasized strong encouragement for influenza vaccination, though uptake trends were not detailed. Additionally, widespread use of masks and social distancing measures mitigated influenza transmission, likely contributing to the sharp decline in ILI activity.  

4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 618 (Week 7, 2021) can be attributed to the declining trend observed in Week 2, 2021, minimal influenza virus activity and positivity rates, disruptions in healthcare-seeking and traditional surveillance caused by the pandemic, and the compounding effects of COVID-19-focused healthcare and preventative measures, which collectively suppressed ILI counts.
