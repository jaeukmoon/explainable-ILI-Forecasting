1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values of ['18744', '16149', '15014', '12554', '13044']. Starting at 18744 (Week 52, 2023), ILI occurrences steadily decreased to 12554 (Week 3, 2024), before experiencing a slight uptick to 13044 in Week 4, 2024. This overall downward trajectory, despite a minor rebound at the end, suggests diminishing flu activity during the observed period.
2. The correlation between past and future ILI occurrences shows alignment, as the general downward trend in the 5 weeks aligns with the significant reduction to 10736 ILI cases observed after 5 weeks (Week 9, 2024). The decline in Weeks 52, 2023–Week 3, 2024, mirrors the continuation of reduced ILI activity into Week 9, albeit at a slower rate.
3. Hospital admissions and cumulative hospitalization rates, despite peaking at 47.8 per 100,000 in Week 4, 2024, began to show signs of stabilization or decline in the later weeks (e.g., reduced weekly hospitalizations from Week 3, 2024). This trend reflects diminished flu severity, contributing to reduced future ILI occurrences. Outpatient visits for ILI demonstrated a downward trajectory from 6.9% (Week 52, 2023) to 4.3% (Week 4, 2024), remaining above baseline but signaling declining healthcare-seeking for respiratory illnesses, correlating with the lower future ILI cases. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2, while complicating the interpretation of trends, likely contributed to sustained elevated ILI activity during peak flu weeks. However, their diminishing contribution as flu activity subsided helps explain the reported lower ILI counts. Continued vaccination campaigns and antiviral use, highly effective against circulating Influenza A(H1N1) strains, likely curbed transmission rates, thereby contributing to reduced ILI case counts after 5 weeks.
4. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 10736 in Week 9, 2024, is attributable to the overall declining trend in ILI occurrences across Weeks 52, 2023–Week 4, 2024, supported by reduced outpatient visits for ILI, stabilizing hospitalization rates, co-circulating respiratory viruses tapering off, and the mitigating effects of vaccination and antivirals.
