1. The ILI occurrence data from Week5 to Week9, 2021 shows a decreasing trend overall, with initial figures of 1714 and 1706 in Week5 and Week6, respectively, followed by a further decline to 1503 in Week7. After this significant drop, there is only a slight increase in Week8 (1521) and Week9 (1532), indicating stabilization at a lower level. Overall, the trend suggests a decline followed by stabilization rather than a significant resurgence or spike.
2. Forecasting Week14, 2021 aligns with the off-season. During this period, influenza activity tends to be minimal, as historically off-season spans after the peak season (Week6) until the following peak onset season (Week32–46). Week5 to Week9, 2021 reports continuously low influenza positivity rates (0.1%), minimal hospitalizations, and widespread minimal ILI activity across all jurisdictions, consistent with off-season conditions.
3. The time-series analysis indicates that after stabilization in Week9, 2021 with occurrences of 1532, activity is expected to marginally increase in the five-week range towards 2087 in Week14, 2021. This projection accounts for a gradual shift influenced by marginal pediatric ILI increases noted in recent weeks (Week7–Week9, 2021) along with expected subdued but slightly upward off-season activity.
4. Several CDC-reported factors influence the forecast of 2087 occurrences in Week14, 2021:
5. - Minimal influenza positivity (0.1%) consistently observed across clinical and public health labs (Week5, 2021 #1; Week6, 2021 #1; Week7, 2021 #1; Week8, 2021 #1; Week9, 2021 #1) leading to low ILI activity nationwide.
6. - Altered age group trends: Increasing ILI trends observed in children aged 0–4 years through the past eight weeks, as older age groups showed slight decreases (Week7, 2021 #12; Week8, 2021 #5; Week9, 2021 #9). These pediatric trends provide a slight upward activity contribution.
7. - Complexities of healthcare-seeking and surveillance dynamics: COVID-19's influence on ILI data interpretation and healthcare trends adds ongoing unpredictability, causing reliance on historical trends for projections (Week5, 2021 #9; Week6, 2021 #9; Week7, 2021 #9; Week8, 2021 #10; Week9, 2021 #10).
5. Hospitalization and influenza-associated deaths remain at historic lows (Week5, 2021 #5; Week6, 2021 #5; Week7, 2021 #5; Week8, 2021 #6; Week9, 2021 #7), further reinforcing the stabilization of ILI occurrences.
6. The percentage of deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the PIC category significantly exceeds epidemic thresholds (16.4%–25.0%; Week5, 2021 #6; Week6, 2021 #6; Week7, 2021 #6; Week8, 2021 #7; Week9, 2021 #6), mitigating a sharp influenza rebound due to dominant COVID-19 activity.
7. In conclusion, future ILI occurrences of 2087 in Week14, 2021 align with the observed declining ILI trends in Week5–Week9, 2021, minor pediatric ILI increases, and the expected subdued off-season rise. Despite low influenza activity, marginal fluctuations are anticipated due to increased pediatric contributions and complex pandemic impacts.
