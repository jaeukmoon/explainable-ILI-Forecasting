1. The reported ILI counts from Week35 to Week39, 2021 are 1502, 1743, 1887, 1889, and 1978. Over this period, ILI occurrences showed a steady rise, reflecting consistent weekly increases without any significant dips. This gradual upward trajectory may indicate the beginning of heightened activity leading toward the peak onset season, although the rate of increase remains moderate rather than sharp.
2. Week44, 2021 falls within the peak onset season (Week35 to Week46) as it is prior to the traditional peak influenza season, which begins around Week46. While current activity remains low, the upward trend and alignment with historical seasonality place Week44 within the peak onset phase.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent growth in ILI occurrences from Week35 (1502) to Week39 (1978) suggests that activity is likely to continue increasing into Week44. Such historical patterns align with a gradual escalation typical of the peak onset period. Projecting forward using the observed trend, Week44, 2021 is forecasted at 2296 ILI occurrences, reflecting ongoing upward momentum at a stable rate of growth.
4. The circulation of influenza viruses remains minimal nationwide (Week35, 2021 #1; Week36, 2021 #3; Week38, 2021 #2; Week39, 2021 #2), with other respiratory viruses primarily contributing to ILI activity. However, as the peak onset season progresses, influenza-specific activity may eventually increase.
5. Behavioral and surveillance changes driven by the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic present challenges in interpreting traditional ILI data (Week35, 2021 #9-#10; Week36, 2021 #10; Week39, 2021 #9). Despite low baseline influenza circulation, these factors contribute to the volatility and unpredictability of ILI trends.
6. The cumulative percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remains significantly elevated (Week36, 2021 #6; Week37, 2021 #3; Week38, 2021 #3; Week39, 2021 #4), although primarily driven by COVID-19. This continued high burden of respiratory illnesses promotes heightened vigilance, particularly given the interaction of pathogens.
7. Given the sustained weekly increase in ILI counts, alignment with peak onset season timing, the influence of concurrent respiratory illnesses, and uncertainties surrounding data collection during the pandemic, the projected ILI count of 2296 for Week44, 2021 aligns with the observed trends and seasonal patterns.
