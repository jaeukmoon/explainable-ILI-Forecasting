1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Week 3–Week 7, 2022) showed a sharp and steady decline from 18,431 in Week 3, 2022, to 9,072 in Week 5, 2022, followed by stabilization at 9,072 for both Week 6 and Week 7, 2022. This trend reflects a significant reduction in ILI activity initially, with no further decline or rise after Week 5, 2022. This stabilization serves as a key indicator of consistent respiratory illness occurrence levels by the end of the observed period.

2. The correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences (9475 after 5 weeks) reveals an alignment with the stabilization observed in Weeks 6 and 7, 2022, where the ILI values plateaued at 9,072. Rather than showing a continued decline, the stable trend in the latter weeks suggests that the activity levels remained steady, contributing to a comparable future ILI occurrence figure of 9,475.

3. Influenza A(H3N2) dominated lab detections across all weeks (97%-99%), yet antigenic differences from the vaccine strain and low vaccination coverage consistently noted across the weeks may have weakened immunity in the population. This would sustain steady ILI levels, seen in both the plateaued past occurrences and the future occurrences.

4. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed epidemic thresholds, varying between 20.4% (Week 7, 2022) and 28.6% (Week 4, 2022). Although a larger proportion of PIC deaths were attributed to COVID-19 rather than influenza, this persistent PIC activity likely reflects continued respiratory illness severity, which aligns with the future ILI report.

5. Hospitalizations remained stable but increased slightly across the weeks, with a cumulative rate climbing from 4.3 (Week 3, 2022) to 4.9 per 100,000 (Week 7, 2022). The rising hospitalization rates, prominently in older adults (65+) and children (0-4 years), underscore the sustained need for healthcare, correlating with consistent ILI occurrences in future data.

6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 9,475 after 5 weeks are attributable to the stabilization of past data in Weeks 6–7, 2022, the dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) with antigenic evolution and low vaccine uptake, persistently high PIC-associated deaths, and rising hospitalization rates. These factors collectively reflect a scenario of steady respiratory illness activity extending into the future.
