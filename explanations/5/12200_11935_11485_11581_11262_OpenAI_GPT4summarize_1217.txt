1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a gradual downward trend, with values of ['12200', '11935', '11485', '11581', '11262']. There was a consistent decrease from 12200 in Week6, 2023, to 11485 in Week8, 2023, with a minor uptick in Week9, 2023 (11581), followed by a continued decline to 11262 in Week10, 2023. This pattern indicates a sustained, albeit fluctuating, reduction in ILI activity during the observed period.
2. The correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is moderate, as the overall declining trend during the past 5 weeks (Week6–Week10, 2023) aligns with the lower reported 9675 ILI occurrences for future Week15, 2023. The decreasing activity in successive weeks strongly prefigures the continued drop in future data, suggesting a direct relationship.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI initially remained stable at 2.6% from Week6 to Week8, 2023, before decreasing to 2.4% in Week9 and Week10, 2023. This dip below the national baseline of 2.5% reinforces the downward trajectory of ILI occurrences and likely contributed to the observed future decline to 9675.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained above epidemic thresholds, declining from 9.4% in Week6, 2023, to 8.6% in Week10, 2023. This gradual reduction in PIC mortality reflects a less severe respiratory illness burden, aligning with the decreasing ILI trends.
5. Factors such as the low percentage of positive influenza specimens (1.4% in Week6, 1.0% in Week7, 2023) and continued dominance of Influenza A (66.2%–81.8% in Week10, 2023) suggest reduced viral transmission. Combined with stable antiviral susceptibility and vaccine efficacy, these patterns substantiate the reported reduction in ILI activity to 9675 occurrences in Week15, 2023.
6. In summary, the future 9675 ILI occurrences for Week15, 2023, can be attributed to the gradual downward trend in past occurrences, declining outpatient visits for ILI, decreasing PIC mortality thresholds, low influenza positivity rates, and effective antiviral and vaccine alignment, all collectively reflecting reduced respiratory illness activity.
