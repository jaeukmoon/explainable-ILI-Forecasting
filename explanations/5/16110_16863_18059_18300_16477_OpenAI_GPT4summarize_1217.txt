1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend, peaking in Week 8, 2024 (18300), before declining to Week 10, 2024 (16477). This variability reflects changes in respiratory illness dynamics, with Week 6, 2024 recording 16110, Week 7, 2024 increasing to 16863, and a subsequent rise to a peak in Week 8, 2024 (18300), before a decline in Week 9, 2024 (18059), followed by a sharper drop in Week 10, 2024 (16477). This downtrend toward the final weeks signals a potential waning of activity leading up to the future decrease in occurrences.
2. A negative correlation is observed between the decreasing trend in ILI occurrences during Weeks 9-10, 2024, and the future decline to 8238 occurrences after 5 weeks. The drop from 18300 in Week 8, 2024 to 16477 by Week 10, 2024 foreshadows a continued reduction in ILI activity, aligning with the diminished future value of 8238.
3. Regional influenza activity varied consistently across the CDC reports, with notable declines in positivity rates from 15.7% (Week 6, 2024), to 14.8% (Week 7, 2024), and 13.9% (Week 9, 2024). Though there were slight regional increases, these steady decreases in positivity rates align with declining ILI activity trends toward Week 10, 2024 and suggest a key driver for the future reduction to 8238.
4. Hospitalization rates, while elevated, showed stabilizing trends toward Week 10, 2024, with a cumulative rate of 67.9 per 100,000. Weekly hospitalizations notably declined after sharp increases earlier in the season, with 8819 reported in Week 10, 2024, down from 10148 in Week 8, 2024. This mirrors the broader decline in respiratory illness activity.
5. Pediatric and overall influenza mortality demonstrated stabilization across the weeks, with 116 pediatric deaths reported by Week 10, 2024, but a slower weekly increase compared to earlier periods. Declines in co-circulating respiratory virus interactions (e.g., RSV and COVID-19) and related impacts, noted in Weeks 8-10, 2024, further contributed to the expected decline in ILI activity.
6. In summary, the reported 8238 future ILI occurrences (after 5 weeks) reflect the downward trajectory in Weeks 9-10, 2024, declining positivity rates, stabilized hospitalization rates, and diminished severity of respiratory co-infections. The consistent reduction in key indicators supports the anticipated decrease to 8238, aligning with broader influenza activity trends.
