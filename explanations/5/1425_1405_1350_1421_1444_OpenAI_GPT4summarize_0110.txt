1. The past ILI occurrences from Week25 to Week29, 2024 were 1425, 1405, 1350, 1421, and 1444, showcasing a slightly fluctuating trend. While there was a moderate decline between Week25 (1425) and Week27 (1350), the ILI counts rebounded slightly by Week28 (1421) and Week29 (1444). This pattern reflects minor fluctuations within a relatively low activity range, without signs of a significant surge or decline.
2. In the U.S., the off-season generally spans from right after the peak season to the next peak onset season, approximately from Week01 through Week31, with the peak onset usually beginning between Week32 and Week35. As Week34, 2024 is during this transitional period, it can be classified as part of the peak onset season when ILI activity typically begins to increase gradually toward its higher levels.
3. From a time-series perspective, the past five weeks reveal a stable yet slightly fluctuating trend in ILI occurrences, with no indication of significant spikes. Projecting forward into Week34, 2024, which aligns with the anticipated gradual rise of activity in the peak onset season, the prediction of 1634 ILI occurrences suggests a minor increase consistent with the historical pattern and seasonality trends.
4. Despite low influenza activity nationwide, the CDC reports consistent co-circulation of Influenza A (dominantly H3N2) and Influenza B (Victoria lineage), potentially contributing to a gradual rise in ILI occurrences as vaccine efficacy and immunity wane slightly (Week25, 2024 #3; Week28, 2024 #3).
5. The emergence of novel influenza strains such as A(H1N2)v and A(H5) in Weeks25 and Weeks28&29, 2024, though isolated and without sustained human-to-human transmission, highlights zoonotic risks that may lead to localized or slightly higher activity due to heightened surveillance or testing (Week25, 2024 #7; Week28, 2024 #8; Week29, 2024 #6).
6. Vaccine strain similarity to dominant circulating viruses remains high, and general susceptibility to antiviral treatments is observed (Week25, 2024 #8; Week28, 2024 #9). However, with vaccination rates not explicitly detailed and likely gaps in vaccine coverage, minor seasonal increases are plausible as the population immunity adjusts to the nearing peak onset period (Week25, 2024 #9; Week28, 2024 #9).
7. The ILI prediction of 1634 for Week34, 2024 is consistent with the minor fluctuations seen in the past weeks, the transition to the peak onset season, co-circulation of influenza strains with zoonotic influences, and vaccine-protected yet slightly rising activity. These factors collectively justify the forecast, reflecting a slight increase compared to Week29, 2024.
