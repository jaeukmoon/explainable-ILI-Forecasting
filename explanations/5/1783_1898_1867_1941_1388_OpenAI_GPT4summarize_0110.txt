1. The reported ILI counts from Week51, 2020 to Week2, 2021 are 1783, 1898, 1867, 1941, and 1388. Overall, ILI occurrences fluctuated during these weeks. Week51, 2020 (1783) to Week1, 2021 (1941) showed mild increases, suggesting potential high transmission during the peak season. A sharp decline occurred in Week2, 2021 (1388), indicating suppressed activity, likely due to pandemic-related healthcare behavior changes or interventions. The general trend is fluctuating with a recent declining trajectory.
2. Forecasting target Week7, 2021 belongs to the peak season. Historically, in the U.S., the peak season spans from approximately Week46 of one year to Week6 of the next; however, limited influenza transmission this season has shifted peak activity projections. With Week7, 2021 immediately following the peak season window and expected transmission levels remaining low but not negligible, influenza activity aligns with prolonged peak season characteristics.
3. Past trends, particularly the fluctuating but overall declining ILI occurrence by Week2, 2021, suggest an atypical transmission season likely influenced by external factors (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) and suppressed influenza spread. Projected patterns indicate a continued decline in occurrences five weeks ahead (Week7, 2021), though still within the range of reduced peak season activity (618 projected occurrences). This reflects both the suppressed activity and periodic fluctuations observed earlier in the season.
4. Influenza activity was unusually low nationwide throughout Weeks51, 2020 to Week2, 2021 (Week51, 2020 #1; Week53, 2020 #1; Week2, 2021 #1), with cumulative positivity rates of approximately 0.1%–0.4%. Minimal positivity and low hospitalization rates (Week53, 2020 #7; Week2, 2021 #5) suggest direct suppression of influenza transmission, affecting the projection of ILI occurrences for Week7, 2021 (618).
5. Ongoing COVID-19 impacts disrupt healthcare-seeking behaviors and complicate traditional surveillance interpretations (Week51, 2020 #8; Week1, 2021 #9; Week2, 2021 #9), leading to atypical declines in outpatient visits for ILI (Week2, 2021 #4) and contributing to lower projected counts.
6. CDC anticipates potential increases in future flu activity despite reduced circulation levels (Week53, 2020 #10; Week2, 2021 #10), likely explaining the modeled projection of some ILI resurgence (618) in Week7, especially within the peak season window.
7. In summary, the projection of 618 ILI occurrences for Week7, 2021 is influenced by a fluctuating but declining trend in past weeks, ongoing suppression of influenza positivity linked to COVID-19 conditions, and the CDC’s expectation of potential flu activity increases. The target week falls within the peak season, aligning with reduced but ongoing elevated activity.
