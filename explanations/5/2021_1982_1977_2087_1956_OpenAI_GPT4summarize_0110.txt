1. The ILI occurrences from Week11 to Week15, 2021 are 2021, 1982, 1977, 2087, and 1956. The trend shows notable fluctuations rather than a consistent increase or decrease. Week11 started higher (2021), followed by a decline through Week13 (1977), then a slight spike in Week14 (2087), and another drop in Week15 (1956). This pattern signifies no clear trajectory, indicating oscillations around a relatively stable baseline.
2. Week20, 2021 occurs well beyond the traditional peak season, which generally ends by Week6. Coupled with persistently low influenza indicators across Week11 to Week15, 2021, it places Week20 in the off-season. This classification aligns with low rates of influenza positivity, outpatient visits, and hospitalization observed in the past five weeks.
3. The time-series pattern suggests that despite fluctuations, ILI occurrences maintain a general equilibrium. With no evidence of a significant upward trend or a major outbreak in Weeks11–15, the continuity of these oscillations supports projecting a stable count for Week20, 2021. The forecasted value of 2025 aligns with this slight fluctuation range.
4. Influenza activity remains abnormally low nationwide, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive during Week11 to Week15, 2021. This prolonged minimal positivity suggests a reduced likelihood of any sharp ILI increases within the next five weeks (Week11, 2021 #1; Week12, 2021 #1; Week15, 2021 #1).
5. Vaccination trends remain stable, with CDC continuing to emphasize flu vaccination (Week11, 2021 #10; Week12, 2021 #9; Week15, 2021 #10). However, there is no indication of significant vaccine uptake or drop-off during this period, reducing the influence of vaccination-related impact on ILI trends.
6. COVID-19 and changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors have impacted ILI surveillance, leading to lower reported rates and altered reporting patterns (Week11, 2021 #9; Week12, 2021 #10; Week14, 2021 #11). These factors, coupled with the ongoing pandemic dynamics, limit the likelihood of a sudden influenza surge.
7. The ILI pattern in the past weeks, combined with the off-season timing of Week20, 2021, and continuous low influenza activity reported by clinical labs, supports the projected ILI occurrence of 2025. The forecast incorporates the slight fluctuations observed in the time-series data while considering real-world factors like influenza positivity and vaccination stability.
