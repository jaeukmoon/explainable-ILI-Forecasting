1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, with values increasing steadily from 1075 (Week27, 2021) to 1910 (Week31, 2021). This trend reveals progressive growth in ILI activity by Week31, marked by substantial increases, especially in the last two weeks with 1609 (Week30, 2021) and 1910 (Week31, 2021), indicating a notable escalation as the period concluded.
2. A strong positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the pronounced rise in past weeks (Weeks30–31, 2021) aligns with the significant future increase to 1976 occurrences after 5 weeks. The upward momentum observed at the end of the prior data serves as a precursor to higher ILI activity in the future.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily rose from 1.3% (Week27, 2021) to 2.0% (Week31, 2021), showing increases across all age groups and regions. This consistent rise in ILI-related healthcare encounters supports the likelihood of heightened future ILI activity, leading to the reported value of 1976 occurrences. Increased outpatient visits directly reflect growing respiratory illness transmission.
4. PIC (pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19) deaths consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, escalating from 6.5% (Week27, 2021) to 11.9% (Week31, 2021). These elevated PIC mortality rates indicate intensified respiratory illness trends, correlating with the surge in ILI occurrences in future weeks as the overall respiratory disease burden amplified.
5. The influence of healthcare-seeking behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted conventional ILI surveillance and reporting systems, creating challenges in trend interpretation. These disruptions may have concentrated case reporting, contributing to a delayed but substantial rise in future ILI occurrences to 1976.
6. Despite minimal influenza virus activity reported in all weeks (e.g., 0.1% positivity in Week27, 2021), the consistent rise in non-flu respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19 played a significant role in driving ILI increases. Increased transmission of other viral respiratory pathogens likely underpinned the upward trend observed both in past and future weeks.
7. In summary, the reported rise to 1976 future ILI occurrences is attributed to the sustained upward trend in Weeks30–31, 2021, increasing outpatient ILI visits across regions, consistently high PIC mortality rates indicating heightened respiratory illness burden, and disruptions in surveillance systems. Minimal influenza activity suggests other viral pathogens as primary drivers of the ILI increase.
