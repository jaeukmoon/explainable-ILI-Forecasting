1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week17 to Week21, 2024 are 1808, 1864, 1881, 1698, and 1711. The data shows an initial mild increase from Week17 (1808) to Week18 (1864) and Week19 (1881), followed by a decrease in Week20 (1698) and Week21 (1711). This indicates a fluctuating trend, with no significant sustained increase or decrease within these weeks. Overall, the trend reflects a gradual decline in ILI activity after a slight peak in Week19.
2. The target week (Week26, 2024) falls within the off-season, as this period typically spans from the conclusion of the peak season (Week6, 2024) through Week31. The summarized data (Week17–Week21, 2024) consistently highlights low influenza activity, with positivity rates and outpatient visits remaining below baseline nationwide, further confirming that Week26, 2024 aligns with off-season patterns.
3. The past ILI trends suggest that fluctuations observed during Weeks17–21, 2024 are consistent with a gradual epidemiological decline seen in the off-season. The decreasing positivity rates, minimal hospitalization levels, and stable outpatient visits during these weeks suggest a downward trajectory. Based on time-series forecasting, including these observations, the model reasonably projects 1268 ILI occurrences in Week26, 2024, correlating with expected attenuation in flu activity during this period.
4. Summarized CDC reports from Week17–21, 2024 support the forecast with the following influential factors:
5. - Nationwide influenza activity is declining, as positivity rates dropped from 3.9% (Week17) to 1.7% (Week21), reflecting consistent low activity (Week17 #1; Week18 #1; Week19 #1; Week20 #1; Week21 #1).
6. - Outpatient respiratory illness visits remained stable and below the national baseline throughout the five weeks (Week17 #5; Week18 #3; Week19 #4; Week20 #3; Week21 #5), signaling no resurgence in ILI prevalence.
7. - Flu vaccination efforts and antiviral susceptibility have been effective, with current circulating strains closely matching vaccine components, minimizing the risk of increased illness due to vaccine mismatch (Week17 #6, #10; Week18 #8; Week19 #10; Week20 #9, #11; Week21 #10).
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, remain present but stable, influencing overall respiratory illness trends without significantly elevating ILI levels (Week17 #7; Week18 #10; Week19 #9; Week20 #10; Week21 #12).
6. Novel influenza virus cases have been sporadic and isolated, such as A(H5N1) and A(H5) outbreaks in Michigan, reducing their immediate contributions to widespread ILI occurrences (Week20 #7; Week21 #4, #13).
7. Combining these factors—fluctuating yet declining ILI trends, characteristics of the off-season, low positivity rates, matched vaccine effectiveness, minimal pressure from co-circulating viruses, and a lack of significant novel virus outbreaks—justifies the model's projection of 1268 ILI occurrences in Week26, 2024, consistent with low off-season influenza activity.
