1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent upward trend, beginning at 1372 (Week 29, 2021) and steadily increasing to 2164 (Week 33, 2021). This rise, particularly from 1936 to 2164 within Weeks 32–33, highlights growing respiratory illness activity toward the end of the period.

2. A clear correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, where the sustained increase in past ILI data culminates in a future value of 1665 (Week 38, 2021). This decline from the Week 33 peak (2164) to 1665 could represent a natural attenuation in respiratory illness activity after a sharp rise in earlier weeks.

3. The summarized reports point to several contributing factors to future ILI occurrences:
   - *Increasing ILI trends*: Outpatient visits for ILI consistently rose, from 1.7% in Week 29 to 2.2% in Week 33, with all age groups exhibiting incremental increases, particularly ages 5–24 and 25–49, indicating broader respiratory illness transmission.
   - *High PIC mortality*: Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) increased, from 7.4% in Week 29 to 17.2% in Week 33, far exceeding epidemic thresholds. Although primarily driven by COVID-19, this suggests heightened respiratory illness activity overall.
   - *Healthcare-seeking behavior changes*: Pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare access and alternative care-seeking behavior (e.g., for COVID-19-like symptoms) likely led to elevated reporting of non-specific ILI, impacting both current and future trends.

4. In summary, the future occurrence of 1665 (Week 38, 2021) reflects a combination of the upward trajectory in past ILI occurrences, increasing outpatient visits and PIC mortality during Weeks 29–33, 2021, and alterations in healthcare-seeking behaviors. These factors collectively contributed to the sustained respiratory illness activity observed in the future period, despite a decrease from the Week 33 peak.
