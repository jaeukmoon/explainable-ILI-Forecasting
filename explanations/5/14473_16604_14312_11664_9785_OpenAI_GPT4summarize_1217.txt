1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent and significant decline, with values of ['14473', '16604', '14312', '11664', '9785']. There was a peak in Week 50, 2023 (16604) followed by a sharp decrease over the subsequent weeks, reaching the lowest value of 9785 in Week 52, 2023. This steady decline suggests a temporary reduction in ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A rebound in future ILI occurrences to 18059 after 5 weeks (Week 3, 2024), despite the decreased trend in the last observed weeks, aligns with historical patterns where post-holiday surges are anticipated according to CDC (e.g., second increases after declines). The steep drop in Weeks 51 and 52, 2023 likely set the stage for a rebound, amplified during later winter weeks (Week 3, 2024).
3. Co-circulation of Influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 as reported in Weeks 51, 2023 to Week 1, 2024 contributed heavily to elevated ILI trends. Continued dominance of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (79.6%–81.4%) throughout this period ensured widespread transmission potential, especially with its antigenic alignment encouraging sustained activity. Regions with high positivity trends (Regions 6, 8, 5, and 3 in Week 3, 2024) also underscore geographic variability as a localized driver of the elevated future occurrences. Increasing resistance in A(H1N1)pdm09 (Week 3, 2024) to oseltamivir may have also hindered mitigation efforts.
4. A significant cumulative hospitalization rate increase, from 15.4 per 100,000 in Week 51, 2023 to 43.3 per 100,000 in Week 3, 2024, signals widespread severe outcomes correlating with rising infections during early 2024. Notably, hospitalization figures (18,526 in Week 1 and 12,382 in Week 3, 2024) remain significant despite observed declines, denoting elevated disease activity persisting into the future.
5. While vaccination recommendations and antiviral effectiveness were repeatedly emphasized, vaccination uptake and coverage likely face challenges given documented trends of declining outpatient visits for ILI (6.9% in Week 52, 2023 to 4.3% in Week 3, 2024). This indirect trend may reflect suboptimal prevention measures further contributing to the observed rebound of 18059 in future weeks.
