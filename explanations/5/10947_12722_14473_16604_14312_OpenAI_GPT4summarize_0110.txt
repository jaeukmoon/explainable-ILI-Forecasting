1. The reported ILI counts from Week49, 2023 to Week1, 2024 are 10947, 12722, 14473, 16604, and 14312. The trend shows a consistent and significant increase from Week49 (10947) to Week52 (16604), followed by a slight dip in Week1 (14312). This indicates a peak near Week52, 2023, with Week1, 2024 reflecting a potential brief decline or plateau in ILI occurrences after a rapid rise. The trend suggests ongoing high activity, with the potential for another increase influenced by post-holiday factors.
2. Week6, 2024 belongs to the peak season, as the U.S. peak season typically spans from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the next, and the recent CDC reports indicate continued elevated activity driven by Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and other contributing factors such as co-circulation of respiratory viruses.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent upward trend from Week49, 2023 to Week52, 2023 and the slight decrease in Week1 suggests the likelihood of continued high ILI occurrences in the short-term future. If historical trends align (where sudden decreases revert to moderate increases afterward), Week6, 2024 may likely see numbers rebounding near mid-peak levels, consistent with the predicted 16110.
4. Elevated influenza activity nationwide suggests persistent peak-season intensity (Week49, 2023 #1; Week50, 2023 #1; Week51, 2023 #1; Week52, 2023 #1; Week1, 2024 #1), driven predominantly by Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (Week50, 2023 #2; Week51, 2023 #3; Week52, 2023 #7; Week1, 2024 #1).
5. Outpatient ILI visits remain significantly above the baseline, increasing consistently from 4.4% in Week49, 2023 to 6.9% in Week52, 2023, with only a slight decrease to 5.7% in Week1, 2024 (Week49, 2023 #6; Week50, 2023 #3; Week51, 2023 #4; Week52, 2023 #3; Week1, 2024 #6). This sustained activity indicates high transmission levels.
6. Influenza hospitalizations and deaths remain elevated, with cumulative hospitalization rates nearly doubling over five weeks, from 8.0 per 100,000 in Week49, 2023 to 31.7 per 100,000 in Week1, 2024 (Week49, 2023 #4; Week50, 2023 #4; Week51, 2023 #5; Week52, 2023 #4; Week1, 2024 #3). Weekly pediatric deaths also increased from 14 in Week49, 2023 to 40 by Week1, 2024 (Week49, 2023 #5; Week1, 2024 #7). This trend correlates with high community spread and severity, sustaining peak-season classification.
7. The predicted ILI occurrence of 16110 for Week6, 2024 aligns with ongoing peak-season activity trends, driven by the dominance of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, elevated outpatient respiratory illness visits, and co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses. These factors, paired with consistent recent hospitalizations and deaths, support the projection of elevated ILI levels near the forecasted value.
