1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a steady downward trend, with the values of ['1977', '2087', '1956', '1924', '1816']. The highest value occurred in Week 13, 2021 (2087), after which there was a continuous decline, culminating in Week 17, 2021, with the lowest value of 1816. This decreasing pattern reflects reduced ILI activity over the observed period.

2. A neutral or weak negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences can be inferred. The consistent decline in past weeks did not strongly predict the future value of 1831 in Week 22, 2021. Instead, the future value showed a modest increase from the last recorded weekly value of 1816, suggesting stabilization or a slight rebound in activity.

3. Several factors reported in the CDC summaries indicate potential influences on the future ILI occurrences:  
   - COVID-19's predominant role in deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained consistently high (e.g., 11.4% in Week 13 to 11.7% in Week 17) and surpassed epidemic thresholds. This ongoing PIC impact highlights a general persistence in respiratory illnesses, including ILI.  
   - Minimal influenza virus positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% throughout the 5-week period) and historically low influenza activity shifted the burden of ILI to non-specific respiratory conditions or alternative explanations. This likely contributed to the ongoing background ILI activity reflected in future occurrences.  
   - Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic consistently impacted ILI data interpretation and reporting. These disruptions potentially delayed or altered the measured or inferred trends in ILI, leading to unpredictability in the future data.  

4. In summary, the future occurrence of 1831 (Week 22, 2021) reflects a stabilization or slight rebound from the previously declining pattern, influenced by persistent respiratory illness dynamics (e.g., PIC mortality), low influenza activity, and disruptions in traditional healthcare-seeking behaviors related to the pandemic. The observed data underscores the complexity in predicting ILI trends amidst overlapping pandemic influences.
