1. The reported ILI counts from Week48 to Week52, 2021 are 17928, 18608, 22179, 28956, and 43523, indicating a clear and sharp upward trend in influenza-like illness activity over the five weeks. The increase becomes particularly steep from Week51 (28956) to Week52 (43523), signaling escalating transmission rates and widespread influenza activity. This trend suggests that influenza activity has entered a phase of rapid growth.
2. Based on the U.S. influenza seasonality, Week5, 2022 falls within the peak season. This aligns with the sharp rise observed in ILI counts in the final weeks of 2021, which corresponds to the approach and ongoing intensity of the peak influenza season.
3. From a time-series modeling perspective, the significant acceleration in ILI counts from Week48 to Week52, 2021 projects forward to Week5, 2022. The historical pattern shows consistent weekly growth in the later weeks of the peak season, suggesting ILI counts will subside slightly as the peak season begins to taper. The predicted Week5, 2022 occurrence of 10333 reflects these modeled dynamics, incorporating a deceleration in activity following the sharp spike in late 2021 but still remaining elevated within the peak season.
4. Influenza vaccination uptake remains lower compared to previous seasons, limiting the population’s protection against circulating influenza strains (Week48, 2021 #7; Week49, 2021 #6; Week50, 2021 #7). This reduced vaccination coverage likely contributes to sustained high ILI activity and ongoing transmission.
5. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza A(H3N2) and SARS-CoV-2, adds to the complexity of influenza season dynamics (Week48, 2021 #3; Week50, 2021 #9; Week52, 2021 #10). With overlapping respiratory illnesses, this increases overall respiratory illness visits and likely exacerbates ILI numbers in the target week.
6. Regional influenza activity remains high, particularly in the eastern and central parts of the U.S., contributing to higher ILI reports in these densely populated areas (Week49, 2021 #6; Week51, 2021 #12; Week52, 2021 #8). The regional intensity of influenza during this peak period strongly influences the national ILI forecast.
7. Combining the sharp upward trend in late 2021 ILI counts, the peak season classification of Week5, 2022, low vaccination uptake, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and regional differences in influenza activity, the forecasted value of 10333 ILI occurrences reflects the anticipated decline from extreme late-2021 activity while remaining consistent with the sustained impact of peak influenza season.
