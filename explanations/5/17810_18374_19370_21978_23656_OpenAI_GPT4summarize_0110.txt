1. The reported ILI counts from Week40 to Week44, 2023 are 17810, 18374, 19370, 21978, and 23656. This data illustrates a consistent upward trend over the five weeks, with ILI occurrences rising sharply between Week42 (19370) and Week44 (23656). The steady increase indicates that flu activity is gradually intensifying, reflecting the early stages of seasonal escalation towards peak levels.
2. Week49, 2023 falls within the typical peak season, which generally spans from Week46 of one year through Week6 of the next year. Furthermore, the consistent increase in ILI activity (Week44, 2023 #8, #9) and alignment with historical seasonality support forecasting Week49, 2023 as part of the peak season.
3. Time-series analysis shows accelerating ILI activity beginning in Week42, 2023, and increasing further through Week44, 2023. This upward momentum, combined with historical patterns of peak activity in late November through December, strongly indicates continued growth leading up to Week49, 2023. Extrapolating from the trend, a significant increase is expected, resulting in the projected ILI occurrence of 34012.
4. CDC reports from Week40 to Week44, 2023 highlight several influencing factors: (1) Influenza positivity rates have risen from 1.1% in Week40, 2023 (Week40, 2023 #1) to 3.0% in Week44, 2023 (Week44, 2023 #1), signaling escalating viral circulation. (2) Outpatient ILI visits increased steadily, reaching the national baseline of 2.9% in Week44, 2023 (Week44, 2023 #8). This rise correlates strongly with heightened overall flu activity. (3) The cumulative hospitalization rate has surged from 0.1 per 100,000 in Week40, 2023 (Week40, 2023 #3) to 1.2 per 100,000 in Week44, 2023 (Week44, 2023 #3), alongside rising weekly hospitalization numbers indicating increasing disease severity.
5. CDC anticipates further increases in flu activity, with higher outpatient visits and positivity rates expected in upcoming weeks (Week44, 2023 #8, #9). Historical alignment with the peak season, ongoing rises in ILI indicators, and cumulative impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses such as RSV (Week44, 2023 #10) further justify the upward trajectory.
6. Vaccination coverage trends are not showing significant improvements (Week40, 2023 #7; Week44, 2023 #7), and although the vaccine is genetically aligned with predominant Influenza A strains (Week42, 2023 #10), suboptimal uptake could contribute to continued case increases. Furthermore, regions reporting high or moderate activity have expanded over the weeks (e.g., Week42, 2023 #9; Week44, 2023 #9), suggesting broader transmission.
7. The forecasted ILI occurrence of 34012 for Week49, 2023 aligns with the observed intensification of flu activity, projected peak season timing, and corroborating CDC trends. Factors including increasing positivity rates, outpatient visit percentages, hospitalization trends, and regional transmission dynamics, coupled with consistent time-series growth, strongly support this prediction.
