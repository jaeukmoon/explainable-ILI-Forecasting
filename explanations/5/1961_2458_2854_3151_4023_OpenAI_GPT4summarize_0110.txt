1. The ILI occurrences from Week47, 2023 to Week51, 2023 show a steady and significant increase: 1961, 2458, 2854, 3151, and 4023. This trend indicates a sharp upward trajectory with no evidence of stabilization or decline, suggesting a sustained rise in influenza-like illness activity during these weeks.
2. Week4, 2024 falls within the typical peak season for ILI activity in the U.S., which generally spans Week46 of one year to about Week6 of the next year. The ongoing upward trend in flu activity, combined with historical seasonality patterns, solidly categorizes Week4, 2024 as part of the peak season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the steady week-over-week increases in past ILI counts strongly correlate with an ongoing rise in activity, even as Week51, 2023 registered a notable jump (4023). Five weeks forward (Week4, 2024), historical patterns and the peak-season timing suggest a gradual decline from the peak values, resulting in a forecast of 2855—a decrease consistent with past seasonal decay trends near this point in peak season.
4. Influenza positivity rates rose significantly from Week47, 2023 (6.2%) to Week51, 2023 (16.1%), signaling strong viral spread that supports heightened ILI activity (Week47, 2023 #1; Week51, 2023 #1). This indicates ongoing high transmission, though slight reductions in sustained spread are expected moving into later weeks.
5. Vaccination coverage remains relevant but may exhibit delayed effectiveness in curbing high ILI levels due to ongoing spread. CDC reports vaccines remain available and matched well to circulating strains, with vaccination strongly encouraged to mitigate severe outcomes (Week50, 2023 #9; Week47, 2023 #7). Yet, widespread activity implies substantial unvaccinated populations, likely sustaining notable flu cases into Week4, 2024.
6. Multiple respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, are co-circulating, compounding respiratory illness trends (Week51, 2023 #9; Week49, 2023 #9; Week47, 2023 #9). While influenza is the primary driver of ILI increases, the presence of co-circulating viruses could extend overall community burden, influencing ILI persistence into early 2024.
7. In summary, the forecasted ILI count of 2855 for Week4, 2024 is justified by the sharply increasing trend observed in past occurrences, peak-season timing, rising positivity rates, high respiratory illness burden from co-circulating viruses, and gradual vaccine impact. These factors collectively indicate a decline from Week51, 2023 levels but persistent high activity reflective of ongoing peak-season transmission.
