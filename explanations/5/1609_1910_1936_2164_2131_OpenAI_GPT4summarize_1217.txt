1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed generally high but fluctuating values, with slight peaks and dips: ['1609' (Week 30, 2021), '1910' (Week 31, 2021), '1936' (Week 32, 2021), '2164' (Week 33, 2021), '2131' (Week 34, 2021)]. The data reflect a strong upward trend from Week 30 to Week 33, peaking at 2164 before a marginal decline to 2131 in Week 34. This trend indicates fluctuating respiratory illness activity nearing its peak toward the end of the observed period.
2. A moderate correlation exists between the upward trend in Weeks 33–34, 2021, and the future decrease to 1587 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 39, 2021). The initial rise through Weeks 30–33, followed by a plateau/slight decline in Week 34, suggests diminishing momentum that translates into the reduced future ILI occurrences.
3. Outpatient ILI visits progressively rose from 1.9% (Week 30, 2021) to 2.2% (Week 34, 2021), with increases across all age groups, particularly children and young adults. This ongoing, age-specific rise correlated with high past occurrences but signaled a potential plateau, aligning with the future ILI reduction to 1587.
4. PIC deaths remained above epidemic thresholds throughout, surging from 9.0% (Week 30, 2021) to 19.4% (Week 34, 2021). The prominence of COVID-19 in PIC deaths reduced the activity attributable to influenza, potentially correlating with the eventual decline to 1587 occurrences due to limited flu contributions.
5. Minimal influenza virus circulation was consistently reported, with a 0.1% positivity rate in Week 34, 2021, indicating non-specific respiratory pathogens likely drove ILI activity. As these alternate respiratory illnesses waned, the future decline to 1587 became apparent.
6. In summary, the future occurrences of 1587 (Week 39, 2021) stemmed from the fluctuating—but tapering—trends in Weeks 33–34, age-related outpatient ILI increases, sustained PIC deaths dominated by COVID-19, and minimal influenza circulation. These factors collectively explain the reduction in ILI activity 5 weeks later.
