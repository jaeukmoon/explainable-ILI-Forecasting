1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating pattern with a slight upward trajectory, with values of ['1482', '1490', '1558', '1486', '1598']. Starting from 1482 in Week 15, 2021, the ILI occurrences rose steadily to 1558 in Week 17, 2021, followed by a brief decline to 1486 in Week 18, and then peaked at 1598 in Week 19, 2021. The overall progression suggests a gradual increase in ILI activity with periodic fluctuations.

2. A positive correlation exists between the past time-series ILI data and the future ILI occurrences. The general upward trend in ILI cases between Week 15 and Week 19, 2021, culminating in the highest value of 1598 in Week 19, serves as a predictive indicator of similar high ILI occurrences, culminating in 1474 occurrences after 5 weeks.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at approximately 1.1%–1.2% during this period (Week 15–Week 19, 2021), consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%. This stability, while not directly matching the national baseline, portrays a sustained level of respiratory illness activity. The steady ILI-related healthcare usage aligns with the continuation of moderate ILI activity leading to the reported future number.

4. Minimal ILI activity in all jurisdictions (as per CDC reports) coupled with very low influenza positivity rates (0.1% across Weeks 15–19, 2021) suggests non-influenza respiratory illnesses played a key role in maintaining reported ILI occurrences. Behavioral and reporting changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic further contributed to the observed trends.

5. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained significantly above epidemic thresholds, ranging from 12.4% in Week 15, 2021, to 10.1% in Week 19, 2021. This consistently elevated PIC mortality, primarily driven by COVID-19, reflects respiratory illness prevalence, potentially influencing consistent ILI activity.

6. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and pandemic-related disruptions in data collection as indicated by the reports added complexity to interpreting ILI data. These factors likely stabilized ILI reporting trends, leading to similar levels of activity in both past and future periods.

7. In summary, the reported 1474 future ILI occurrences (Week 24, 2021) are explained by the observed upward trend in the time-series data from Week 15 to Week 19, 2021, stable outpatient ILI visits, persistently high PIC mortality reflecting respiratory illness prevalence, and data complexities arising from COVID-19 impacts.
