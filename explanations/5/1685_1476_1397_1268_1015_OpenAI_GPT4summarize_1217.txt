1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a continuous decline: 1685 (Week 23, 2024) to 1015 (Week 27, 2024). Weekly decreases were evident, with drops of 209, 79, 129, and 253 respectively, signifying a consistent reduction in ILI activity over this period.
2. A negative correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences. The sharp downward trend from Week 23 to Week 27, 2024, suggests increasingly low baseline activity, aligning with the reported reduction to 790 after 5 weeks (Week 32, 2024).
3. Influenza positivity rates in clinical and public health labs also followed a declining trend over the weeks: 1.6% (Week 23, 2024) to 0.9% (Week 27, 2024). This consistent reduction in lab-confirmed influenza cases reflects diminished viral activity, likely contributing to the lower future occurrences.
4. Outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses persisted below baseline levels, accounting for 1.7% (Week 23, 2024) to 1.4% (Week 27, 2024). The lack of significant ILI or respiratory illness activity corroborates the continued decline to 790 reported cases in Week 32, 2024.
5. Minimal influenza-attributed hospitalization rates (0.1–0.2 per 100,000) and stable mortality (0.1%), coupled with low cocirculation impacts from respiratory viruses, suggest no significant external shocks influencing ILI activity. These factors, together with vaccination stability, further rationalize the decline in future ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 790 future ILI occurrences (Week 32, 2024) are attributed to the consistent decrease in weekly occurrences, declining influenza positivity, continuing low outpatient visits, and stable hospitalization/mortality rates. These indicators collectively align with the sustained low respiratory illness activity observed throughout the past period.
