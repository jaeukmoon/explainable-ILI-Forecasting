1. Explanation:
1. The past ILI occurrences from Week16, 2021 to Week20, 2021 (‘1968’, ‘2118’, ‘2022’, ‘2012’, ‘2114’) indicate a slightly increasing and fluctuating trend. The values rise from Week16 (1968) to Week17 (2118), drop to Week18 (2022), continue decreasing in Week19 (2012), and slightly rise again in Week20 (2114). This fluctuation suggests that ILI activity is stabilizing at a higher baseline, indicating the impact of seasonal stabilization. The quantitative trend analysis involves calculating the overall mean growth rate observed over the last 5 weeks:
2. - Week17 to Week16: (2118 - 1968) / 1968 ≈ 7.6% increase.
3. - Week18 to Week17: (2022 - 2118) / 2118 ≈ -4.5% decrease.
4. - Week19 to Week18: (2012 - 2022) / 2022 ≈ -0.5% decrease.
5. - Week20 to Week19: (2114 - 2012) / 2012 ≈ 5.1% increase.
6. The average weekly growth rate is ≈1.93%. Using this growth rate over 5 weeks, the predicted Week25, 2021 value can be estimated as Week20’s value (2114) compounded by the growth rate:
7. 2114 × (1 + 0.0193)^5 ≈ 2350.
2. Week25, 2021 falls within the "Off-season" based on the U.S. flu season framework. Influenza activity during this time tends to stay at or near baseline levels. Since Week25 is close to the middle of the off-season (lasting from Week7 to Week31), ILI occurrences are expected to remain steady or experience mild fluctuations, as supported by historical trends and CDC insights about current unusual influenza patterns observed during the pandemic.
3. Historical ILI occurrences show that ILI activity is slightly increasing toward Week20 but remains below typical pre-pandemic baselines. This mild growth aligns with the stabilization phase observed in prior off-seasons. Statistical time-series techniques, relying on the past fluctuation and the average 1.93% growth rate per week, project a steady rise in Week25 to approximately 2350. The high forecast reflects continuation trends of maintaining higher-than-baseline levels in the off-season due to atypical influences.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports support the forecast:
5. - **Extremely low influenza positivity rates and reduced severity**: The 0.1% positivity rate for influenza and a cumulative hospitalization rate of 0.8 per 100,000 (lowest recorded) since Week16, 2021 suggest minimal traditional flu activity is ongoing. However, stable ILI outpatient visits at 1.1%–1.3% indicate the indirect effects of COVID-19 are contributing to ILI figures. This factor quantitatively limits significant further decreases in ILI yet allows for mild fluctuations.
6. - **COVID-19’s dominant influence**: High PIC death percentages (11.8% in Week16 to 9.5% in Week20, mainly due to COVID-19) and changes in healthcare-seeking behavior underline how ILI activity remains affected by overlapping surveillance datasets (e.g., respiratory illnesses beyond flu). This results in higher retained ILI activity, elevating a baseline prediction.
7. - **Stabilizing outpatient ILI rates**: Outpatient visits held consistently between 1.1% and 1.3% of all visits, below the national baseline of 2.6%. This stability reflects ongoing low jurisdiction-wide activity for flu, though the effect of altered healthcare reporting during COVID-19 adds inherent noise, supporting a prediction for stable and continued ILI occurrences.
5. In conclusion, using past trends, Week25, 2021 is categorized as "Off-season," where ILI activity stabilizes near a slightly elevated baseline due to non-flu-related respiratory illnesses and reporting artifacts from COVID-19. Applying the compounded weekly growth rate of 1.93% over 5 weeks, and factoring low flu positivity and overlapping healthcare trends, the predicted value for ILI occurrences after 5 weeks is **2350**.
