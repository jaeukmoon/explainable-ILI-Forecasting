1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent upward trend, starting at 1958 (Week 42, 2020), and progressively increasing to 2088 (Week 43, 2020), 2154 (Week 44, 2020), 2399 (Week 45, 2020), and peaking at 2830 (Week 46, 2020). This steady escalation in ILI occurrences strongly indicates heightened respiratory illness activity during the observed period.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the growth trajectory observed from Weeks 44 to 46, 2020, aligns with the increase to 2776 future occurrences (Week 51, 2020). The notable rise from 2154 in Week 44 to 2830 in Week 46 acted as a precursor to the continued elevated ILI activity seen in the subsequent weeks.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily rose during the observation period, from 1.2% (Week 42, 2020) to 1.5% (Weeks 45 and 46, 2020). Although these percentages remained below the national baseline of 2.6%, the consistent increase reflects heightened healthcare encounters for respiratory illnesses, likely contributing to the elevated future ILI occurrences.

4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed epidemic thresholds, increasing from 7.6% (Week 42, 2020) to 10.7% (Week 46, 2020). This substantial and increasing PIC mortality reflects heightened respiratory illness activity, aligning with the observed rise in future ILI occurrences.

5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, documented throughout Weeks 42–46, 2020, disrupted traditional surveillance systems and may have caused underreporting or misclassification of ILI cases. This disruption likely contributed to a concentrated rise in reported occurrences over time.

6. Despite low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.3% in Week 42, 2020, and 0.2% in Week 46, 2020) and minimal lab detections, the increase in ILI activity and PIC-related deaths suggests contributions from non-specific respiratory illnesses or overlapping symptoms with COVID-19, amplifying ILI reporting.

7. In summary, the reported 2776 future ILI occurrences (Week 51, 2020) can be attributed to the upward trend in past occurrences (Weeks 42–46, 2020), consistent increases in outpatient visits for ILI, rising PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the compounded effects of pandemic-related disruptions to healthcare-seeking behavior and ILI surveillance.
