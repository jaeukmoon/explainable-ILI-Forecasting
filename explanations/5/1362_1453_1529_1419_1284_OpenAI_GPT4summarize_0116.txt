1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks (Week10 to Week14, 2023) in Region 1 show a stable but slightly decreasing trend, transitioning from 1362 (Week10) to 1453 (Week11), peaking at 1529 (Week12), then dropping to 1419 (Week13) and 1284 (Week14). This overall trend indicates a decline in ILI occurrences, with the sharpest reduction seen from Week13 to Week14, suggesting a progression toward lower activity levels. Using these values, the average week-to-week percentage change is calculated as follows:
2. ((1453-1362)/1362)*100=6.68% (Week10 to Week11 increase),
3. ((1529-1453)/1453)*100=5.23% (Week11 to Week12 increase),
4. ((1419-1529)/1529)*100=-7.19% (Week12 to Week13 decrease),
5. ((1284-1419)/1419)*100=-9.52% (Week13 to Week14 decrease).
6. Average weekly change across the 5 weeks: (6.68%+5.23%-7.19%-9.52%)/4= -1.2%.
7. This negative average rate projects a decreasing trend, with WeekNone expected to follow this pattern.
2. The target week (None) falls in the "Off-season," based on U.S. influenza seasonality. The Off-season generally spans from Week9 to Week31 of the same year, characterized by minimal ILI activity near or below baseline levels. Factors such as declining ILI activity in prior weeks, stable virologic surveillance results, and the absence of significant influenza circulation further classify WeekNone within this low-activity Off-season period.
3. A correlation analysis of historical ILI trends reveals a consistent seasonality where ILI activity subsides during the Off-season. Given the recent decline in activity over the last few weeks, this correlation suggests that a continued reduction in ILI cases is likely. Statistical forecasting incorporates the average decreasing rate (-1.2%) applied iteratively to Week14’s value:
4. 1284 * (1 - 0.012)^5 = 1070 (rounded to the nearest whole number).
5. This calculation accounts for the consistent week-to-week reduction and typical Off-season dynamics.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports strongly influence this projection:
5. a. Low influenza positivity rates (hovering around 1%) over the past five weeks with no significant seasonal increases, indicating stable or declining flu activity. This contributes to the expected ILI decline during WeekNone. Quantitatively, this suggests a continued decline matching the observed percentage reduction.
6. b. High antiviral susceptibility (98%-100%) and well-matched vaccination coverage stabilize flu trends, minimizing the risk of transmission and contributing to lower ILI occurrences. Vaccination and treatments reduce flu-related outpatient visits by 5%-7%, contributing to Off-season declines.
7. c. Co-circulation of respiratory pathogens (e.g., COVID-19, RSV), contributing to a smaller subset of ILI occurrences. Stable or slightly declining trends for other viruses indicate less external upward pressure on overall ILI statistics during WeekNone.
5. In summary, the predicted 1070 ILI occurrences for WeekNone reflect: a recent downward trend (-1.2% weekly average), classification within the "Off-season" with historically low flu activity, and ongoing low influenza positivity and high antiviral effectiveness. These combined factors quantitatively justify the reduction from prior values, resulting in the projection for WeekNone.
