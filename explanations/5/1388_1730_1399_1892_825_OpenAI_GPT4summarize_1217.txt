1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5-week period exhibited significant fluctuations, with values of ['1388', '1730', '1399', '1892', '825']. There was an initial increase from 1388 (Week 2, 2021) to a peak of 1892 (Week 4, 2021), followed by a sharp decline to 825 in Week 6, 2021. This volatile pattern suggests an instability in ILI activity, marked by alternating spikes and drops over the observed weeks.
2. A mixed correlation between past and future ILI occurrences exists, as the abrupt decline to 825 (Week 6, 2021) contrasts with the eventual rise to 1016 after 5 weeks (Week 11, 2021). While the earlier peaks in Week 3 and Week 4 reflect transient heightened activity, the subsequent drop suggests that extrinsic factors may have influenced the moderate increase in the future occurrence.
3. Outpatient ILI visits remained consistently low and below the national baseline of 2.6% throughout the 5-week period, ranging from 1.4% (Week 2) to 1.1% (Week 6). This persistent suppression of ILI-related healthcare consultations aligns with the reduced baseline activity levels, indirectly affecting future occurrences.
4. COVID-19-associated disruptions to healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance systems were noted across all observed weeks, as reported by the CDC. These challenges likely contributed to underreporting or delayed recognition of ILI cases and could partially account for the future rise to 1016 occurrences.
5. Lab-confirmed influenza activity was exceptionally low, with only 0.1%-0.3% positivity rates for respiratory specimens across Weeks 2-6, 2021, indicating that the majority of reported ILI cases stemmed from non-influenza-related illnesses or alternative pathogens. This subdued influenza activity diminished its contribution to the ILI metrics yet allowed other respiratory illnesses to influence the gradual increase reflected in the future occurrences.
6. In summary, the future occurrence of 1016 ILI cases (Week 11, 2021) can be explained by the observed fluctuations in past ILI occurrences, consistently low outpatient visits, COVID-19-related surveillance limitations, and non-influenza drivers of respiratory illnesses. These factors, compounded by a transient rebound from the sharp decline in Week 6, shaped the moderate increase in the observed future activity.
