1. The past five weeks of ILI occurrences (Week43, 2023 to Week47, 2023) in Region 1 are: 1396, 1702, 1472, 1860, and 1961. These values show a generally **increasing trend** over the weeks, with fluctuations. Specifically, there is an observable dip in Week45 (1472), followed by an upward surge in Week46 (1860) and Week47 (1961). This pattern indicates a rising intensity of ILI activities as the season progresses toward the peak period.
2. Week52, 2023 falls into the **Peak season**. Based on the background knowledge, the peak season generally spans from Week46 to Week6 of the following year in the U.S., characterized by widespread transmission and elevated ILI occurrences. The CDC reports from Week43 to Week47, 2023 highlight increasing ILI activities, higher positivity rates, rising hospitalizations among all age groups, and continuing spread of Influenza A (particularly A(H1N1)) and Influenza B, all of which are consistent with peak season dynamics.
3. A correlation analysis of past patterns suggests using growth rates for forecasting. From Week43 to Week47, the week-over-week percentage increases (or decreases) are:
4. - Week44 vs. Week43: (1702 - 1396) / 1396 ≈ 0.219 (21.9% increase)
5. - Week45 vs. Week44: (1472 - 1702) / 1702 ≈ -0.135 (-13.5% decrease)
6. - Week46 vs. Week45: (1860 - 1472) / 1472 ≈ 0.264 (26.4% increase)
7. - Week47 vs. Week46: (1961 - 1860) / 1860 ≈ 0.054 (5.4% increase)
8. Averaging the positive growth rates (21.9%, 26.4%, 5.4%) yields a mean growth rate of approximately 17.9% during weeks of increasing activity. Applying this average rate forward over the next five weeks (Week48 to Week52) to the latest value (1961) captures the seasonal escalation:
9. - Week48: 1961 × (1 + 0.179) ≈ 2308
10. - Week49: 2308 × (1 + 0.179) ≈ 2719
11. - Week50: 2719 × (1 + 0.179) ≈ 3200
12. - Week51: 3200 × (1 + 0.179) ≈ 3769
13. - Week52: 3769 × (1 + 0.179) ≈ 4320
14. Hence, the forecast for Week52, 2023 is **4320**, reflecting the compounding growth typical of peak seasons.
4. Three CDC-reported factors strongly influencing this forecast are:
5. 1) **Rising influenza positivity rates**: The percentage of positive influenza tests increased from 1.9% in Week43 to 6.2% in Week47, signaling a widespread intensification of ILI activity. This upward trend aligns with the observed growth in ILI occurrences, supporting the continued rise expected into Week52.
6. 2) **High co-circulation of respiratory viruses**: Reports highlight the presence of RSV and SARS-CoV-2 alongside influenza. This co-circulation tends to exacerbate respiratory illness trends, increasing outpatient visits and hospitalizations, which feed directly into ILI occurrences.
7. 3) **Regional and age variability**: CDC reports high ILI activity particularly in elderly populations and certain regions, with hospitalization rates for adults aged 65+ spiking to 8.9 per 100,000 by Week47. As these trends intensify nationally, they contribute to the forecasted surge in Week52.
5. In summary, the prediction of 4320 ILI occurrences in Week52, 2023 is driven by: a generally increasing growth trend in past data (quantified at an average weekly growth of 17.9%), its classification as part of the peak season with heightened ILI transmission, and CDC-reported factors such as rising influenza positivity, the co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, and high regional variability and vulnerability among elderly populations. These factors collectively justify the projected value.
