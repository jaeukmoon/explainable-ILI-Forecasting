1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating yet net upward trajectory. Beginning at 1046 (Week 25, 2021), the value declined slightly to 965 (Week 26, 2021), followed by an increase to 1107 (Week 27, 2021), slight dip to 1072 (Week 28, 2021), and a subsequent increase to 1230 (Week 29, 2021). The overall increase toward the latter weeks indicates growing respiratory illness activity, suggesting a trend that foreshadows higher future ILI occurrences.

2. A strong positive correlation exists between the observed past trajectory and the reported future ILI occurrences of 1531 after 5 weeks (Week 34, 2021). The steady rise toward 1230 in Week 29, 2021, directly corresponds to the higher level of ILI activity observed 5 weeks later, indicating continuity in the upward trend.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI saw a consistent rise, from 1.2% in Week 25 and Week 26, 2021, to 1.3% in Week 27 and Week 28, 2021, and further to 1.7% in Week 29, 2021. This sustained increase reflects a broader pattern of increased healthcare encounters for respiratory illness, which supports the rise in future ILI occurrences.

4. The death rates attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded epidemic thresholds in all corresponding weeks, increasing from 6.6% (Week 25, 2021) to 7.4% (Week 29, 2021). While primarily driven by COVID-19, these elevated rates highlight systemic respiratory illness activity that likely contributed to the subsequent increase in ILI.

5. The persistent disruptions in healthcare utilization patterns and surveillance systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as highlighted in all summarized reports, influenced data reporting accuracy. These disruptions may have delayed or concentrated recognition of ILI cases, thereby magnifying reported future ILI occurrences.

6. Despite minimal influenza positivity in virologic surveillance (e.g., 0.1% positivity in Weeks 25, 27, and 28, 2021), the observed rise in ILI suggests contributions from non-influenza respiratory illnesses. The effects of pandemic-driven behavioral patterns likely amplified non-specific ILI reporting, aligning with the increase to 1531 reported in Week 34, 2021.

7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1531 (Week 34, 2021) can be explained by the upward trend in ILI occurrences through Weeks 27–29, 2021, consistent increases in outpatient ILI visits, persistently elevated PIC mortality exceeding thresholds, and the magnification of reporting due to pandemic-driven healthcare disruptions.
