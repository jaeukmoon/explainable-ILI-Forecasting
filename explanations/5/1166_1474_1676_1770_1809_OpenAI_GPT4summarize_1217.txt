1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a steady upward trend, with values of ['1166', '1474', '1676', '1770', '1809']. The increase from 1166 (Week15, 2022) to 1809 (Week19, 2022) demonstrates a consistent rise in ILI activity over this period, indicating escalating respiratory illness burden leading into Week19, 2022.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the sustained upward trajectory observed from Week15 to Week19, 2022 aligns with the moderation of ILI activity to 1399 occurrences 5 weeks later, potentially due to fluctuating factors such as seasonality or changes in intervention measures.
3. Growing hospitalization rates for influenza were observed across the 5 weeks, increasing cumulatively from 9.8 per 100,000 population (Week15, 2022) to 14.4 per 100,000 (Week19, 2022). This steady rise reflects higher influenza circulation and healthcare burden, contributing to elevated ILI occurrences.
4. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness rose gradually from 2.1% (Week15, 2022) to 2.4% (Week19, 2022), remaining below baseline nationally but showing a regional trend of increased ILI encounters, particularly in high-activity areas, correlating with sustained disease transmission.
5. Late-season antigenic mismatches in circulating H3N2 viruses and co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens reported from Week15 to Week19, 2022 maintained active viral spread, dampening vaccine effectiveness contributing to prolonged ILI activity even beyond the observed 5-week window.
6. In summary, the reported 1399 ILI occurrences (Week24, 2022) align with the consistent upward trend observed from Week15 to Week19, 2022, high hospitalization rates, steady outpatient respiratory illness visits, and antigenic mismatches in influenza strains, reflecting sustained respiratory illness transmission during the post-5-week period.
