1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed slight fluctuations but generally stabilized at a higher level compared to the initial value, progressing as ['1968', '2118', '2022', '2012', '2114']. Week 16, 2021 reported the lowest value of 1968, followed by an increase in Week 17 to 2118. Though a minor dip in occurrences was noted in Week 18 (2022) and Week 19 (2012), it rebounded to 2114 in Week 20, 2021. This suggests a pattern of overall steady ILI activity, hovering around the 2000-mark toward the end of the observed period.

2. A strong correlation is evident between the past and future ILI occurrences. The consistent stabilization of ILI values in the latter weeks (Weeks 18–20, 2021), particularly at levels exceeding 2000, aligns with the reported future increase to 2350 occurrences after 5 weeks. The plateauing trend in Week 20 served as an indicator of sustained or slightly elevated ILI activity, culminating in a gradual rise to 2350.

3. Several summarized key factors in CDC reports demonstrate a high correlation with future occurrences:  
   - Outpatient visits for ILI showed a slight upward trend, moving from 1.1% in Weeks 16–17, 2021, to 1.2% in Weeks 18–19, and 1.3% by Week 20, 2021. This subtle but consistent increase reflects steady ILI-related healthcare activity, potentially contributing to elevated occurrences.  
   - Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained well above the epidemic threshold, dropping from 11.8% in Week 16 to 9.5% in Week 20, 2021, but still indicative of persistent respiratory illness burden. COVID-19 dominance in PIC deaths could have indirectly influenced reporting and recognition of ILI.  
   - Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighted across all reports, likely skewed traditional ILI surveillance and amplified ILI reporting over time. This behavioral shift can explain the rise in ILI occurrences to 2350 despite low influenza activity.  

4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2350 after 5 weeks (Week 25, 2021) can be attributed to the steady stabilization of ILI trends in the past 5 weeks, the increase in outpatient ILI visits, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-driven changes in healthcare-seeking behavior. The interplay of these factors, despite minimal influenza activity, fueled the eventual rise.
