1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week37 to Week41, 2021 are 12979, 11487, 11116, 11730, and 11738. The trend shows an initial decline from Week37 (12979) to Week39 (11116), followed by a slight increase in Week40 (11730) and Week41 (11738). This pattern indicates a decrease in activity initially, with stabilization and marginal upward fluctuation toward the end of the period, which suggests a potential transition toward higher ILI activity.
2. Week46, 2021 falls within the U.S. peak season, which typically spans from Week46 to about Week6 of the following year. CDC reports during the observation period highlight steadily increasing influenza activity alongside stabilizing outpatient visit percentages, aligning with the early phases of increased transmission characteristic of the peak season.
3. Time-series patterns from past weeks suggest a baseline level of ILI activity that initially declines but then stabilizes and undergoes slight escalation in Week40 and Week41. Such a stabilization and rise pattern often precedes higher ILI activity, supporting the projection for a significant increase five weeks forward. These historical observations align with mechanisms of seasonality, where transition from peak onset to peak season drives progressive increases in ILI occurrences.
4. Virus circulation remains minimal but is beginning to show slight increases, evidenced by a rise in clinical positivity for both Influenza A and B during Week40 and Week41 (Week40, 2021 #1, #2; Week41, 2021 #1, #2). This trend suggests strengthening flu virus activity, which could contribute to growing ILI numbers in subsequent weeks.
5. The CDC emphasizes vaccination efforts with a target completion by October (Week40, 2021 #8; Week41, 2021 #8). However, there is no report of widespread vaccination coverage, suggesting that significant portions of the population may remain vulnerable to flu-related illnesses, influencing higher ILI occurrences after Week46, 2021.
6. While ILI activity remains low, co-circulating respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and other non-influenza viruses persist (Week37, 2021 #5; Week40, 2021 #10; Week41, 2021 #10). These pathogens, combined with changes in healthcare behavior during the pandemic, obscure ILI trends and could unexpectedly contribute to fluctuations or increases in reported ILI.
7. In summary, the transition from declining to stabilizing trends in ILI occurrences, upcoming peak season dynamics (Week46, 2021), evidence of increasing influenza positivity, moderate vaccine uptake, and overlapping respiratory virus impacts collectively justify the projected increase in ILI activity, reaching 16729 occurrences.
