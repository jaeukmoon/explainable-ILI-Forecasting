1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent and marked upward trend, starting at 1295 (Week10, 2022) and rising progressively through 1522 (Week11, 2022), 1964 (Week12, 2022), 2612 (Week13, 2022), and finally reaching 3382 (Week14, 2022). This sharp and uninterrupted rise in ILI occurrences indicates escalating respiratory illness activity over the 5-week period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the consistent week-on-week increase in the past weeks (e.g., 2612 in Week13 to 3382 in Week14, 2022) projects the continuation of an upward trajectory. This trend aligns with the reported surge to 4327 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks, supported by the momentum of increasing ILI activity in the earlier weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed incremental growth throughout the surveillance period, increasing from 1.7% of healthcare visits in Week10, 2022, to 2.0% in Week14, 2022. Such gradual increases in healthcare visits associated with respiratory illnesses reflect escalating community transmission, potentially contributing to the observed rise in future ILI cases.
4. Hospitalization rates due to influenza rose steadily across the observed weeks, climbing from 5.9 per 100,000 in Week10, 2022, to 8.9 per 100,000 in Week14, 2022. This consistent upward trend in severe respiratory illness cases aligns with the sharp increase in future ILI occurrences, as hospitalization data often mirrors community-level ILI trends.
5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, such as Influenza A(H3N2), RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, was reported throughout the period and complicated the attribution of ILI trends to specific pathogens. This heightened viral activity contributed to increases in ILI cases overall, influencing the jump to 4327 cases after 5 weeks.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 4327 (Week19, 2022) are explained by the consistent and sharp upward trend in past weeks, increased ILI-related healthcare visits, rising hospitalization rates, and the intensifying effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses during the observed period.
