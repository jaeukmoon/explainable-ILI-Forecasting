1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend with values of ['2104', '2919', '2533', '2536', '2084']. There was a notable increase from 2104 (Week51, 2021) to 2919 (Week52, 2021), followed by a decline to 2533 (Week1, 2022) and then a slight rise to 2536 (Week2, 2022) before dropping again to 2084 (Week3, 2022). This pattern indicates periodic fluctuations in activity, with no consistent upward or downward trajectory by Week3, 2022.
2. A strong correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident. Despite the fluctuations in past occurrences, the relatively lower value at 2084 (Week3, 2022) aligns with the further drop to 832 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week8, 2022). This reflects a broader declining trend from the earlier peak at 2919 (Week52, 2021).
3. Multiple factors in the summarized reports correlate with the decreased future ILI occurrences:
4. - Declines in positivity for influenza in clinical specimens from 6.2% (Week51, 2021) to 1.9% (Week3, 2022) suggest reduced influenza circulation in later weeks.
5. - Hospitalization rates slowed, with cumulative rates increasing less steeply from 3.9 per 100,000 (Week2, 2022) to 4.3 per 100,000 (Week3, 2022) compared to earlier surges.
6. - Outpatient respiratory illness visits exhibited declines starting at 4.8% (Week52, 2021) and reaching 2.8% (Week3, 2022), pointing to reduced ILI activity in healthcare settings.
4. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses alongside COVID-19 likely impacted ILI activity trends. However, decreases in higher ILI activity from earlier weeks, particularly among adults aged ≥25 years, and steady antigenic evolution in A(H3N2) strains that showed good vaccine strain matches indicate reduced illness transmission in later weeks.
5. In summary, the reported 832 future ILI occurrences (Week8, 2022) can be attributed to the substantial decline in positivity rates for influenza specimens, lower outpatient respiratory illness visits, slower hospitalization increases, and the overall waning trend in respiratory illness activity observed across Weeks1–3, 2022.
