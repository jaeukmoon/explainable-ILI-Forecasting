1. The reported ILI counts from Week45 to Week49, 2021 are 1189, 1240, 1216, 1752, and 1772. The trend initially shows stability with minor fluctuations from Week45 (1189) to Week47 (1216). A sharp increase then emerged in Week48 (1752) and Week49 (1772), reflecting a clear upward trajectory as the season progresses. This consistent rise indicates growing influenza activity.
2. In the U.S., the peak season primarily spans Week46 of one year to Week6 of the next. Given that Week2, 2022 falls within this window and that multiple indicators suggest increasing ILI activity (Week47-Week49, 2021 #1, #10; Week48-Week49, 2021 #3), the target week belongs to the peak season classification.
3. From a time-series perspective, the steep incline in ILI counts during Week48 (1752) and Week49 (1772) suggests a continued trajectory of growth. Given that the observed increase aligns with typical peak-season dynamics, projecting forward five weeks indicates that ILI occurrences are likely to remain elevated, settling at 2536 by Week2, 2022 as part of the season’s peak.
4. Nationwide influenza reports for Week48 and Week49, 2021 document a clear rise in positivity rates, escalating from 2.6% to 3.5%, predominantly driven by Influenza A(H3N2) (Week48, 2021 #1; Week49, 2021 #2). This continued increase strongly correlates with growing ILI cases.
5. Significantly lower vaccination uptake compared to the previous season (Week48, 2021 #7; Week49, 2021 #6) likely contributes to the observed rise in ILI counts, as reduced vaccination coverage leaves a larger portion of the population vulnerable.
6. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, complicates the interpretation of ILI patterns and contributes to the overall burden of respiratory illness (Week47-Week49, 2021 #12; Week48-Week49, 2021 #10). These overlapping illnesses elevate healthcare visits and ILI counts during the peak season.
7. Combining factors such as steeply rising ILI occurrences in prior weeks, the clear peak-season classification for the target week, increasing positivity rates driven by Influenza A(H3N2), lower vaccination uptake, and the compounding effect of co-circulating viruses supports the projection of 2536 ILI cases for Week2, 2022. This reflects a continuation of upward seasonal dynamics intensified by reduced immunity and increased respiratory illness circulation.
