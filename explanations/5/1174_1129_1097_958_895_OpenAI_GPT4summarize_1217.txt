1. The past time-series ILI occurrences demonstrated a consistent decreasing trend over the 5-week period, with values of ['1174', '1129', '1097', '958', '895']. Starting at 1174 in Week11, 2023, the ILI occurrences steadily declined each week, reaching their lowest point of 895 in Week15, 2023. This clear downward trajectory indicates progressively diminishing ILI activity across the observed timeframe.
2. A negative correlation is evident between the past and future ILI occurrences. The continuous decline in past weeks suggests a tapering off of ILI trends, which aligns with the reported drop to 636 occurrences after 5 weeks in Week20, 2023. The sustained reduction in earlier weeks serves as a strong precursor to the lower ILI activity observed.
3. Multiple factors in the CDC reports support the decrease in future ILI occurrences:
4. - Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline of 2.5% throughout the period, declining from 2.4% in Week11, 2023, to 2.0% in Week15, 2023. This ongoing reduction in healthcare encounters for ILI aligns with reduced future activity.
5. - Influenza positivity rates were extremely low, remaining stable between 0.8%-1.0% across Weeks11–15, 2023. The absence of significant virologic activity directly correlates with the decreasing ILI trends.
6. - PIC mortality showed a consistent decline, dropping from 8.7% in Week11, 2023, to 7.5% in Week15, 2023, indicating reduced severity of respiratory illnesses overall.
7. - The seasonally low influenza hospitalization rate (61.5 per 100,000 in Week15, 2023) and high vaccination efficacy likely limited the potential for widespread influenza-related illnesses, contributing to reduced ILI occurrences.
4. The co-circulation of respiratory pathogens like SARS-CoV-2, which impacted 3.8% of hospitalized cases in Week14, 2023, may have influenced the composition of ILI cases but did not contribute to significant increases. Effective vaccination coverage and antiviral susceptibility for influenza, as indicated in CDC reports across Weeks11–15, 2023, further contained ILI activity.
5. In summary, the observed future ILI occurrences of 636 (Week20, 2023) can be attributed to the steady decrease in past ILI occurrences from Week11 to Week15, declining trends in outpatient ILI visits, low virologic positivity rates, reductions in PIC mortality, and overall containment through vaccination and antiviral efficacy. These factors collectively explain the significantly reduced ILI activity in Week20, 2023.
