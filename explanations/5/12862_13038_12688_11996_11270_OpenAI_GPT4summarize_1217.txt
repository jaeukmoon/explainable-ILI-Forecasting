1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent declining trend with values of ['12862', '13038', '12688', '11996', '11270']. There was a minor increase from 12862 (Week19, 2024) to 13038 (Week20, 2024), but subsequent weeks showed a steady decline to 11270 in Week23, 2024. This trend reflects a sustained reduction in ILI activity over the observed period.
2. A strong negative correlation exists between the declining past ILI occurrences and the future ILI value of 8129 observed after 5 weeks (Week28, 2024). The continuous drop from Week21 to Week23 aligns with the lower future ILI value, indicating the trend of decreasing ILI activity extended into future weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable or slightly decreased during the past 5 weeks, ranging from 2.0% (Week19, 2024) to 1.7% (Week23, 2024), consistently below the national baseline. This stability and gradual decline in outpatient ILI rates align with the reduced ILI occurrences evident after 5 weeks.
4. Weekly influenza positivity rates also dropped progressively, from 2.4% (Week19, 2024) to 1.6% (Week23, 2024), highlighting reductions in flu-related activity, which likely contributed to the lower ILI values reported in future weeks.
5. The nationwide hospitalization rate showed low and stable values (e.g., 0.2 per 100,000 in Week19 through Week22, 2024, and 0.1 per 100,000 in Week23, 2024), indicating minimal ILI-associated hospital burdens contributing to future declines.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 remained active throughout the 5 weeks but showed no significant surges in activity. The lack of increases from these respiratory contributors further supports the drop in future ILI occurrences.
4. Mortality attributed to influenza remained stable at 0.1% across all 5 weeks, indicating no significant impact from severe cases that would otherwise contribute to higher ILI numbers. Pediatric influenza-associated deaths increased modestly from 167 (Week19, 2024) to 175 (Week23, 2024), reflecting localized trends with minimal effects on broader ILI metrics.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI value of 8129 after 5 weeks (Week28, 2024) corresponds to the consistent declining trend in past ILI occurrences (Week19 to Week23, 2024), reductions in outpatient visits and influenza positivity rates, stable hospitalization and mortality data, and minimal contributions from co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors collectively resulted in the continued drop in ILI occurrences into subsequent weeks.
