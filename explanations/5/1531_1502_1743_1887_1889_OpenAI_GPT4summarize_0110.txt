1. The reported ILI counts from Week34 to Week38, 2021 are 1531, 1502, 1743, 1887, and 1889. During this period, the trend showed an initial decline from Week34 (1531) to Week35 (1502), followed by a gradual and consistent increase through Week38 (1889). The trend suggests a near-linear rise in ILI occurrences over the last three weeks. Despite this, no extreme spikes indicate an accelerating outbreak, but a modest upward trajectory is evident.
2. Forecasting that Week43, 2021 belongs to the peak onset season is appropriate. Week43 occurs within the timeframe (approximately Week35 to Week46) when ILI activity begins a gradual climb toward peak season levels. The continuous rise in recent ILI occurrences further supports this classification.
3. From the time-series perspective, the consistent three-week rise in ILI occurrences (Week36 to Week38, 2021: from 1743 to 1889) suggests the beginning of an upward phase. Since no sharp fluctuations or plateauing occurred, projecting this gradual increase forward aligns with a five-week forecast of 1802, assuming moderate growth within a peak onset season environment.
4. Influenza positivity rates remained very low across clinical labs from Week34 to Week38 (e.g., Week34 #1; Week36 #3; Week37 #6; Week38 #2), indicating that the increasing ILI visits are largely driven by non-influenza respiratory viruses, such as RSV or SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., Week34 #4; Week36 #2; Week37 #5; Week38 #8). These co-circulating pathogens contribute to a modest rise in ILI activity without triggering an influenza-dominated sharp spike.
5. Observed healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Week34 #8; Week36 #9; Week37 #9; Week38 #7) likely impact ILI surveillance trends by inflating respiratory illness visit numbers. This distortion introduces an upward bias in reported ILI occurrences, given the concurrent spread of non-influenza pathogens.
6. Vaccination trends during the reporting period remain unclear (Week34 #7; Week35 #6; Week36 #8; Week37 #8; Week38 #6), with limited updates on coverage rates. However, lower vaccination uptake during this phase could influence susceptibility levels, facilitating some increases in respiratory illness transmission closer to the lead-in to peak onset. The absence of significant vaccination promotion efforts in these reports offsets further mitigating factors.
7. In summary, the gradually increasing ILI occurrence trend and alignment with the peak onset period (Week43, 2021), coupled with concurrent respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 amplifying outpatient visits, explain the forecast of 1802 occurrences. Vaccination activity's unclear impact adds a variable level of susceptibility contributing to the predicted value.
