1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week23 to Week27, 2022 are 1595, 1399, 1543, 1196, and 1122. The trend shows a consistent decrease in ILI counts over the five weeks, with no significant spikes. This downward trend indicates declining influenza activity as the weeks progress.
2. Week32, 2022 is classified as part of the peak onset season, as it aligns with the usual onset period for increasing ILI activity in the U.S., typically spanning from Week32 or Week35 to Week46 before the peak season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent decline in ILI occurrences suggests a continued reduction in activity leading into the off-season. However, the transition toward the peak onset season in Week32, 2022 implies the potential for stabilization or slight increases from the trough observed during Week27, 2022. This aligns with historical patterns projecting gradual onset during this period, resulting in 664 ILI occurrences.
4. National influenza positivity has steadily declined, with 3.4% in Week23, 2022 (Week23, 2022 #1) dropping to 0.7% in Week27, 2022 (Week27, 2022 #1). Minimal influenza activity was observed in most jurisdictions (Week27, 2022 #9).
5. Hospitalizations and outpatient ILI visits also demonstrated steady declines, with lab-confirmed hospitalizations falling from 2,089 in Week23, 2022 (Week23, 2022 #4) to 751 in Week27, 2022 (Week27, 2022 #5), and outpatient visits remaining below baseline (Week23, 2022 #3; Week27, 2022 #4).
6. Reports highlight co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, reduced healthcare-seeking behaviors, and ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on surveillance trends (Week23, 2022 #10; Week25, 2022 #10; Week27, 2022 #10).
7. Given the declining trend in ILI counts, low influenza positivity, and minimal influenza activity, combined with historical patterns of gradual increases at the onset of peak onset season and potential impact from co-circulating viruses, the projected ILI occurrence of 664 for Week32, 2022 is justified.
