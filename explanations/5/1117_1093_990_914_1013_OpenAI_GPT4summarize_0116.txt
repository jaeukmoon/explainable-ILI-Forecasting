1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks (Week4, 2021 to Week8, 2021) show a fluctuating trend: 1117, 1093, 990, 914, and 1013. Though initially in decline from Week4 to Week7, there is a rebound from 914 (Week7) to 1013 (Week8). This suggests variability in ILI activity rather than a steady increase or decrease. To forecast Week13, a quantitative approach integrates this fluctuation as evidence of variability moderated by external factors.
2. Season classification: Week13, 2021 falls within the "Off-season," as per its temporal position relative to U.S. influenza cycles. The off-season generally lasts from Week7 to Week31, marked by lower influenza activity. Week13 shows characteristics of minimal seasonal ILI occurrences, implying stability with slight underlying increases based on historical patterns.
3. A simple statistical analysis using the recent 5-week data indicates an average ILI value of (1117 + 1093 + 990 + 914 + 1013)/5 = 1025.4 (rounded to 1025). Additionally, the rebound in Week8 (+99) signals a gradual upward adjustment. Applying an estimated 4% growth rate from Week8 (based on prior rebounds and modest increases usually seen during the off-season with periodic fluctuations): 1013 × (1.04)^5 ≈ 1209. This accounts for time-series progression aligned with periodic rebounds.
4. Three key factors from summarized CDC reports impact the forecast:
5. a. Persistent COVID-19 impacts: Outpatient visits and respiratory illness trends remain subdued due to healthcare disruptions, reflecting altered flu patterns but not preventing periodic rebounds. This stabilizing factor aligns with observed modest increases.
6. b. Dominance of Influenza B: Influenza B-positive specimen rates (e.g., 85.7% in Week6 and 53.6% in Week7) suggest slow-spreading activity, which can sustain localized occurrences.
7. c. Minimal influenza activity: Consistently low hospitalization rates (e.g., 0.7 per 100,000 in Week8) and minimal ILI activity do not prevent small periodic upticks, consistent with expected slow upward corrections during off-season baselines.
5. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrences for Week13, 2021, at 1209 reflect the rebound seen in Week8, amplified by modest growth expected during a stabilizing off-season. Historical time-series trends, slow Influenza B spread, and residual outpatient visits support this forecast.
