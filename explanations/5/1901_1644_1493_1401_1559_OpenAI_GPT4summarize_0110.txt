1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week5 to Week9, 2022 were 1901, 1644, 1493, 1401, and 1559. This represents a generally declining trend up to Week8, 2022, with a slight increase in Week9, 2022. This pattern suggests fluctuating but relatively moderate ILI activity, without any sharp spikes or dips over the five weeks.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically concludes around Week6, followed by a transition to the off-season. Given that Week14, 2022 falls well beyond the peak window and ILI positivity in recent weeks has been relatively low (Week5, 2022 #1; Week6, 2022 #1; Week7, 2022 #1; Week8, 2022 #1; Week9, 2022 #1), it is reasonable to classify Week14, 2022 as belonging to the off-season.
3. Historical patterns show a consistent decline in ILI occurrences from Week5 to Week8, 2022, followed by a slight rebound in Week9, 2022. Projecting forward to Week14, 2022, this suggests stabilization with only slight fluctuations in ILI counts. Models leverage such patterns to estimate a slightly higher value of 1977 ILI occurrences by factoring in possible co-circulation influences.
4. Influenza activity in clinical specimens increased from 2.0% in Week5, 2022 to 5.8% in Week9, 2022, coupled with regional variations and cases rising in certain areas (Week5, 2022 #9, #11; Week6, 2022 #9, #11; Week9, 2022 #11).
5. Hospitalization rates progressively increased from 4.5 per 100,000 in Week5, 2022 to 5.5 per 100,000 in Week9, 2022, though they remain lower than pre-pandemic levels. This trajectory suggests a potential for mild growth in ILI over the forecast period (Week5, 2022 #4; Week6, 2022 #4; Week9, 2022 #6).
6. The reported co-circulation of respiratory viruses, especially SARS-CoV-2 (5.9% co-infection in Week9, 2022), and antigenic differences in H3N2 viruses potentially affecting vaccine coverage could sustain intermittent ILI increases during the off-season (Week6, 2022 #11; Week7, 2022 #11; Week9, 2022 #10).
7. Combining recent trend fluctuations (Week9, 2022), off-season classification, rising influenza positivity in clinical specimens, hospitalization increases, and the impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses, the forecasted ILI occurrences for Week14, 2022 are estimated at 1977 occurrences.
