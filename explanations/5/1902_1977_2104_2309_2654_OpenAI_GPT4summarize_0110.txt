1. The observed ILI occurrences from Week13 to Week17, 2022 show a steady upward trend: 1902, 1977, 2104, 2309, and 2654. This consistent increase indicates growing influenza-like illness activity over this period, with no dips or fluctuations, establishing a clear rising pattern week-over-week.
2. In the U.S., Week22, 2022 aligns with the off-season period for influenza activity. While there are indications of increasing activity during Weeks13 to Week17, there is no evidence suggesting that Week22, 2022 falls within a peak or peak-onset season. Thus, it is categorized as off-season.
3. Based on the time-series data, the steady weekly increase in ILI occurrences from Week13 to Week17, 2022 suggests that the upward momentum could continue for the next few weeks. However, as Week22 falls within the off-season, the growth rate likely tapers off, leading to a forecast of 3629 occurrences rather than a sharp rise.
4. The predominance of Influenza A(H3N2) nationwide, comprising 98.5%-99.9% of subtyped cases during Weeks13 to Week17, consistently drove increased influenza activity (Week13, 2022 #2, #3, #8; Week14, 2022 #2, #3; Week15, 2022 #2, #3).
5. Co-circulation of respiratory illnesses, including SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and others, complicated ILI attribution and likely contributed to the observed increase in outpatient respiratory illness visits (Week13, 2022 #13; Week14, 2022 #12; Week15, 2022 #12; Week16, 2022 #9; Week17, 2022 #9).
6. Although vaccination was recommended and ongoing, antigenic differences in the dominant A(H3N2) strain likely reduced vaccine effectiveness, contributing to higher ILI occurrences (Week13, 2022 #9; Week14, 2022 #8; Week15, 2022 #10; Week17, 2022 #8).
7. In summary, the steady upward ILI trend (Weeks13 to Week17), off-season classification for Week22, dominance of A(H3N2), modest vaccine mismatch, and overlapping respiratory viruses collectively justify the Week22, 2022 forecast of 3629 occurrences.
