1. The past time-series ILI occurrences for the last five weeks showed a consistent upward trend, starting at 11489 in Week 42, 2021, and rising steadily to 16729 in Week 46, 2021. This increase represents a 45.5% rise over the period, with noteworthy sequential growth indicating escalating ILI activity. Such an upward trajectory by the end of the observed time frame suggests a heightened risk of increased future ILI cases.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 28956 align with the observed incremental pattern in past ILI data from Weeks 42–46, 2021. The sharp rise from 15312 (Week 45) to 16729 (Week 46) acts as a precursor to the significant increase in Week 51, 2021 (28956), demonstrating a positive correlation between the upward trend in recent weeks and amplified future ILI activity.
3. Multiple factors from the summarized CDC reports contribute to the observed future ILI surge. First, an increasing trend in outpatient visits for ILI, rising from 1.8% (Week 42, 2021) to 2.2% (Week 46, 2021), indicates growing symptomatic respiratory illness and care-seeking rates. Second, Influenza A(H3N2)'s dominance, particularly among the 5–24 age group, with region-specific outbreaks in Week 44, 2021, further fueled localized spread and potential cross-region amplification. Third, the co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, as reported across all weeks, created compounded effects on ILI case prevalence. Finally, changes in healthcare behaviors, alongside the underreporting and data complexities noted during the COVID-19 pandemic, likely concentrated ILI recognition and reporting in subsequent weeks.
4. Several other key factors also influence the rise to 28956 ILI cases. Laboratory detections of influenza increased consistently, with positivity rates climbing from 0.1% (Week 42) to 1.0% (Week 46, 2021). Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, reaching 14.5% in Week 46, which reflects broader respiratory disease activity. Hospitalizations linked to influenza steadily rose each week, from 288 (Week 42) to 356 (Week 46), signaling worsening seasonal activity.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 28956 in Week 51, 2021, are attributable to the consistent upward trend in past ILI data, increasing outpatient visits and positivity rates, regional Influenza A(H3N2) outbreaks, PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, and healthcare reporting disruptions linked to COVID-19. These factors collectively explain the sharp rise after 5 weeks.
