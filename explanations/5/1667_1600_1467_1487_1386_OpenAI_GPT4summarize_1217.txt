1. The past time-series ILI occurrences (‘1667’, ‘1600’, ‘1467’, ‘1487’, ‘1386’) from Week 23 to Week 27, 2023, displayed a clear downward trajectory, with counts decreasing consecutively. This indicates an overall decline in ILI activity over these 5 weeks, with the lowest occurrence at 1386 in Week 27, 2023. This trend reflects reduced reported ILI cases during this time frame.
2. Despite the downward trend in the past weekly ILI data over Weeks 23–27, 2023, the future increase to 1817 occurrences by Week 32, 2023, suggests a disconnect. The decline preceding Week 27 may temporarily suppress cases, potentially leading to a subsequent rebound post-Week 27, contributing to future values exceeding recent observations.
3. Nationwide minimal ILI activity across Weeks 23 to 27, 2023, indicated ILI counts were low, with outpatient ILI visit percentages consistently below the national baseline (1.6% in Week 23, 1.3% in Week 27). This minimal activity reduces competition in surveillance, possibly making later increases more noticeable.
4. A steady dominance of Influenza A (e.g., 67.1% in Week 26 and 58.3% in Week 27), with a consistently high proportion of (H1N1)pdm09 subtype detections, may have set a foundation for increased ILI activity post-Week 27. Contributions of co-circulating respiratory viruses and decreased flu vaccination emphasis noted repeatedly across Weeks 23–27 are likely compounding factors.
5. With multiple respiratory pathogens in circulation co-existing with declining virologic positivity rates (e.g., 0.8% in Week 27), under-detection during the observed weeks may result in a delayed ILI burden. These overlooked cases combined with changing seasonal patterns likely amplify the later reported surge in ILI occurrences to 1817 by Week 32, 2023.
