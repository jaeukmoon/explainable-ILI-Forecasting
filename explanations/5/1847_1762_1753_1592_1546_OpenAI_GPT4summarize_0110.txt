1. The reported ILI counts from Week20 to Week24, 2023 were 1847, 1762, 1753, 1592, and 1546. The data indicates a continuous decline in ILI occurrences over the five weeks, with a steady reduction in weekly counts. This observed downward trend suggests the cessation of significant influenza transmission during this period. There are no indication spikes or fluctuations in the data, pointing to increasingly reduced ILI activity.
2. Week29, 2023 belongs to the off-season. The off-season spans from Week1 to Week31, marked by minimal activity and reduced community transmission. Current low influenza testing positivity (Week20, 2023 #1; Week21, 2023 #1; Week22, 2023 #1; Week23, 2023 #1; Week24, 2023 #1) and declining counts are consistent with off-season characteristics.
3. The correlation between past trends and future ILI is evident as the decreasing trend (Week20 to Week24) projects forward into continued declines in ILI activity. Given the downward trajectory in the time series, the projected Week29, 2023 count of 1092 aligns with the continuation of reductions and reflects off-season stability.
4. National influenza activity remains minimal with very low positivity levels, consistently ranging between 1.0%-1.2% during Week20 through Week24 (Week20, 2023 #1; Week21, 2023 #1; Week22, 2023 #1; Week23, 2023 #1; Week24, 2023 #1). This significant decline in virologic surveillance indicates sustained low transmission.
5. Circulation of other respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, coexists but does not drive significant increases in influenza burden. These co-circulating pathogens are stabilizing, further mitigating ILI spikes (Week20, 2023 #10; Week21, 2023 #8; Week22, 2023 #9; Week23, 2023 #10; Week24, 2023 #9).
6. Most jurisdictions report minimal influenza activity nationwide (Week22, 2023 #8; Week23, 2023 #8; Week24, 2023 #8). The lack of geographical pockets of increased activity supports continued declines in ILI occurrences.
7. Combining the steady decline in ILI activity observed between Week20 and Week24, 2023, the off-season timeframe of Week29, low positivity rates, minimal influenza hospitalizations, and stabilizing co-circulating respiratory viruses, the forecasted ILI occurrences correctly align with the expected value of 1092 for Week29, 2023.
