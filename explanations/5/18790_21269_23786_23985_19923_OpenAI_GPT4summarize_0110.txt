1. The past ILI occurrences from Week19 to Week23, 2022 are 18790, 21269, 23786, 23985, and 19923, respectively. The trend initially showed a consistent increase until Week22, peaking at 23985, followed by a sharp drop to 19923 in Week23. This pattern indicates a late-season peak with an outbound decline approaching off-season levels.
2. Week28, 2022 falls within the off-season based on the U.S. classification, which typically spans from Week1 to Week31 each year after the peak season. The decline in ILI activity in Week23, 2022, combined with the reduction in positivity rates, aligns with the transition to off-season.
3. The five-week trend in ILI occurrences reveals a peak occurrence in Week22, 2022 and a decline in Week23, 2022. This suggests that the elevated ILI occurrences were part of a late-season peak influenced by Influenza A(H3N2) activity. However, the subsequent decline in Week23 suggests stabilization at a lower baseline level over the next few weeks. Based on this trajectory, forecasting models likely projected a continued decline in ILI cases, leading to the estimate of 13771 in Week28, 2022.
4. The seasonality of ILI activity suggests that Week28, 2022 aligns with a post-peak period where ILI activity wanes significantly due to reduced community transmission after peak influenza spread (Week23, 2022 #1, #9; Week22, 2022 #1, #3; Week21, 2022 #1, #3).
5. The CDC-reported influenza positivity rate dropped from 7.0% in Week19, 2022 to 3.4% in Week23, 2022, indicating a progressive decline in viral circulation, with Week23 activity described as “decreasing” (Week23, 2022 #1; Week22, 2022 #1, #10; Week21, 2022 #1, #11).
6. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A continued through Week23, 2022, with 4.2% co-infection rates (Week23, 2022 #7). However, minimal resistance to antivirals and stable vaccination coverage have mitigated severe illness spikes (Week22, 2022 #8, #9; Week21, 2022 #9, #10).
7. Declining positivity rates, off-season timing, and CDC-reported reduced outpatient visits and mortality trends, combined with sequential declines in cases post-peak, explain the forecasted drop to 13771 ILI occurrences by Week28, 2022.
