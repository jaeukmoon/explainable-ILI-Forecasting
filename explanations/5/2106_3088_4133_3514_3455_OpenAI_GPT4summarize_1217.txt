1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating pattern with a significant peak in Week 35, 2023, followed by a decline that leveled off. Starting at 2106 (Week 33, 2023), occurrences rose sharply to 4133 (Week 35, 2023), the highest in this period, before dropping to 3455 (Week 37, 2023). This trend suggests transient spikes characteristic of dynamic respiratory illness patterns.
2. The heightened ILI occurrence in Week 35, 2023, coupled with the steadier levels in Weeks 36 and 37, correlates with the future spike to 4761 after 5 weeks (Week 42, 2023). The increase in Week 35 served as a precursor to the intensified activity, while the relatively stable rates thereafter hint at sustained ILI circulation influencing the projected numbers.
3. Outpatient ILI visits showed a steady increase, rising from 1.5% in Week 33, 2023, to 2.0% in both Week 36 and Week 37, 2023, particularly among children aged 0–4 years (6.5%-7.2%). This age group’s higher susceptibility highlights a demographic driving broader ILI trends, fueling the rise in future occurrences.
4. Influenza-related hospitalizations steadily increased over the observed weeks, from 477 (Week 33, 2023) to 820 (Week 37, 2023), reflecting a gradual escalation of severe cases consistent with higher subsequent ILI occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, documented across all weeks, compounded the challenges of segregating ILI contributors. Moreover, altered healthcare-seeking behaviors and data interpretation issues during this period likely understated real-time ILI trends, resulting in a delayed but intensifying surge by Week 42, 2023.
6. In summary, the future occurrence of 4761 ILI cases (Week 42, 2023) is informed by the transient peak in Week 35, stable ILI rates in subsequent weeks, rising outpatient ILI visits and hospitalizations, and the compounded influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses and healthcare dynamics in reporting.
