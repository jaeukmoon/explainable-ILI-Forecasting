1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week3, 2022 to Week7, 2022) show a clear downward trend: 2084 → 1484 → 1114 → 888 → 803. The weekly decreases suggest a gradual decline in influenza-like illness activity, with fluctuations becoming smaller as the series progresses. However, the decrease rate is slowing, as shown by progressively smaller differences between weeks (e.g., −600 from Week3 to Week4, −370 from Week4 to Week5, −226 from Week5 to Week6, and −85 from Week6 to Week7). This suggests that the ILI occurrences are stabilizing as they move closer to baseline levels, reflecting an eventual leveling-off trend. Based on this trend, a gradual reduction is expected over the next few weeks.
2. Season Classification for Week12, 2022: Week12, 2022 falls in the "Off-season." The CDC-defined flu season in the U.S. generally peaks between Week46 and Week6 each year, while the off-season typically spans Week7 to Week31. Given ILI activity was noted as sporadic in the latest summarized reports and the consistent trend toward lower ILI occurrences, Week12 aligns with the off-season classification where ILI activity is expected to remain near its baseline levels.
3. A historical correlation analysis shows Weeks3 to Week7 presented clear reductions in ILI cases, with average percentage decreases of approximately −28.1% (Week3 to Week4), −24.9% (Week4 to Week5), −20.3% (Week5 to Week6), and −9.6% (Week6 to Week7). By projecting the deceleration of these reductions (i.e., declining percentage changes) forward, the expected reduction for Week12 is estimated to further decrease but at a smaller rate compared to previous weeks. Assuming a continuing slowed decline over the next five weeks, the predicted value reflects this stabilizing trend.
4. Three distinct CDC-report factors influencing the forecast are as follows:
5. 1) Vaccination coverage remains lower than previous seasons (reported in Week3 through Week7), which limits population-level immunity and slows ILI transmission reduction. Vaccination trends contribute to sustained ILI activity, influencing the remaining cases that prevent full near-elimination. Quantitatively, this factor maintains slight infection persistence, preventing sharper declines (e.g., 5–10% deceleration balance).
6. 2) Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and others (reported across Weeks3–7), amplifies regional ILI activity variability. Though not fully influenza-based, these trends add a modest floor to ILI cases because infections overlap and affect overlapping demographic respiratory presentations. This factor quantitatively slows any steep reductions by 3–7%.
7. 3) Influenza A(H3N2), the dominant strain (97%-99% in Weeks3–7), exhibits antigenic variability compared to vaccine strains, allowing for residual transmission despite slower reductions. This variability explains why regions observed sporadic leveling-off rather than full elimination trends. Quantitatively, estimated resistance accounts for stabilization toward baseline slower predictions (5−8%).
5. Combining the observed downward trend with the off-season classification and above quantitative CDC report factors leads to an ILI occurrence forecast of 973 for Week12, 2022. The gradual decline reflects elements of stabilization tied to historical continuity, slower decline percentages, and the factors retaining ILI persistence. The off-season designation further explains why cases drop closer to baseline levels without disappearing entirely during this timeframe.
