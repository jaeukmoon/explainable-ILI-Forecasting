1. The ILI occurrences from Week32, 2024 to Week36, 2024 are 11143, 11971, 14072, 15539, and 14753. The trend shows a steady rise from Week32 (11143) to a peak in Week35 (15539), followed by a slight drop in Week36 (14753). This pattern indicates an overall increasing trajectory with a slight fluctuation at the end.
2. Based on historical seasonality, Week41, 2024 falls during the peak onset season as it occurs between Week32 and Week46, a period typically characterized by rising ILI activity before peak transmission is reached.
3. Using time-series correlation analysis, the significant increase from Week32 to Week35 suggests a sustained upward trajectory. Despite the minor drop in Week36, the overall trend reflects growing ILI activity, projecting further increases in the subsequent weeks. This aligns with the typical seasonality observed during the peak onset season, resulting in a future ILI occurrence prediction of 13127 for Week41, 2024.
4. The summarized CDC reports from Weeks32–36, 2024 indicate several influencing factors: (1) Co-circulation of Influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), Influenza B, and other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, poses risks for increased respiratory illnesses during this transitional period (Week32, 2024 #8; Week35, 2024 #10; Week36, 2024 #10). (2) Vaccination coverage remains low or stagnant, as highlighted across Weeks32–36, with no substantial improvement or new promotional efforts reported (Week32, 2024 #9; Week33, 2024 #10; Week36, 2024 #9). (3) The CDC's anticipation of low but increasing flu activity during this time and the need for monitoring variant strains signal the likelihood of gradual transmission rises (Week32, 2024 #10; Week35, 2024 #10; Week36, 2024 #11).
5. Nationwide low positivity rates (0.4%) and stable respiratory illness visits under the national baseline (1.5–1.8%) are observed; however, these metrics do not preclude a gradual increase as co-circulating viruses influence ILI trends. (Week32, 2024 #4; Week34, 2024 #4; Week36, 2024 #4).
6. The antigenic match of circulating strains with the vaccine remains strong, but limited effectiveness and minimal uptake curtail its impact in mitigating future ILI occurrences. This aligns with vaccination trends' lack of significant influence thus far (Week34, 2024 #8; Week35, 2024 #7; Week36, 2024 #9).
7. In conclusion, the increasing trend in past ILI data, seasonality indicating the peak onset period, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, low vaccination coverage, and ongoing surveillance predictions substantiate the forecasted ILI value of 13127 for Week41, 2024.
