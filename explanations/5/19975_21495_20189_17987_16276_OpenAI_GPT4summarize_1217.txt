1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a steady decline, with values of ['19975', '21495', '20189', '17987', '16276']. Week 32, 2021 marked the highest occurrence at 21495, with subsequent decreases to 20189 in Week 33, 17987 in Week 34, and 16276 in Week 36, 2021. This downward trend indicates a consistent reduction in ILI activity across the observed period.
2. A negative correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the consistent decline from 21495 (Week 32, 2021) to 16276 (Week 36, 2021) aligns with the drop to 11738 future occurrences by Week 41, 2021. This steady reduction in ILI occurrences over the 5-week period serves as a precursor to the decreased future activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI were stable but remained below the national baseline (2.6%) in Weeks 32–36, 2021, with rates ranging from 2.1% to 2.3%. The lack of significant increases in ILI-related healthcare encounters suggests minimal influenza or respiratory illness activity, which correlates with the decline in future occurrences.
4. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) mortality percentages were steadily high across the 5 weeks, ranging from 14.6% (Week 32, 2021) to 21.0% (Week 36, 2021), with COVID-19 as the primary driver. The high PIC mortality indicates that other respiratory pathogens dominated rather than influenza, maintaining low levels of flu-related ILI cases.
5. Low influenza circulation was consistently reported, with positive specimen rates of only 0.1% and minimal subtyping data throughout the 5-week period. Coupled with the dominance of non-influenza respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, this minimal flu activity supports the observed reduction in ILI occurrences.
6. Altered healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic affected ILI surveillance, as reported weekly. These changes likely skewed ILI reporting, with healthcare system disruptions contributing to more accurate or focused data collection, ultimately reflecting lower occurrences in future weeks.
7. In summary, the observed decline to 11738 future ILI occurrences (Week 41, 2021) can be attributed to the consistent downward trend in Weeks 32-36, 2021, stable but below-baseline outpatient ILI visits, persistently high PIC mortality driven by non-influenza causes, and minimal influenza virus circulation. Concurrent shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors further impacted ILI reporting and contributed to the reduced future activity.
