1. The past ILI occurrences from Week8 to Week12, 2024 show a consistently decreasing trend, starting at 18059 in Week8, followed by 18300 (tiny spike), and then dropping consecutively to 16477, 14164, and 12267. The cumulative decline reflects an overall reduction in ILI activity, corresponding to the waning seasonal pattern as influenza activity diminishes in many regions. To extrapolate this trend, a linear or exponential decay model can be applied, as the decline appears steep.
2. Forecasting target week (Week17, 2024) lies in the "Off-season." Based on the CDC’s influenza seasonality notes, the off-season typically begins after Week9 and extends through Week31. Week17 falls squarely in the off-season, characterized by lower ILI occurrences as flu activity declines nationwide.
3. The correlation analysis reveals that the weekly percentage decline in ILI occurrences is non-linear but significant. Between Week8 and Week9, there is a slight increase (1.3%), but from Week9 onwards, decreases of approximately 9.9%, 14.0%, and 13.4% follow consecutively. A compounding decay model predicts the expected proportionate reduction in ILI occurrences. Specifically:
4. - Average percentage decrease from Week9 to Week12: ~12.43%.
5. - Projected continued decay for five more weeks using an estimated average percentage decrease: 12267 × (1 - 0.1243)^5 ≈ 6169.
4. Several factors from the CDC reports directly influence the prediction:
5. 1. Influenza activity is decreasing nationally, as evidenced by lower percentages of positive cases (Week12, 10.5% vs. Week8, 14.2%), reduced outpatient visits for ILI (Week12, 3.1% vs. Week8, 4.4%), and declining ILI-related hospitalizations across most regions.
6. 2. Vaccine coverage and effectiveness are stable, as highlighted in Week12, with vaccines providing continued benefits and alignment with circulating strains. Vaccinations help prevent sustained or elevated flu activity in the off-season.
7. 3. The co-circulation of respiratory pathogens like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 complicates ILI trends, but the absence of any new highly transmissible flu variant (e.g., A(H1N2)v showed no human-to-human transmission) ensures no sudden rebound in ILI cases.
5. In summary, decreasing trends in ILI occurrences, the classification of Week17 as part of the off-season, and contributing factors like vaccination effectiveness and declining hospitalizations form the basis of the forecast. Using a time-series decay analysis and factoring in external CDC data, the future ILI occurrences in Region 5 for Week17, 2024 are predicted to be 6169.
