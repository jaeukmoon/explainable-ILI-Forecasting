1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week16, 2021 to Week20, 2021) show a fluctuating trend, with values of 1490, 1558, 1486, 1598, and 1645. The upward fluctuations suggest a modest increase overall, but the changes between weeks are not consistent. The increase from Week16 to Week20 (+10.4%) suggests a general upward trend in ILI occurrences. However, the variability implies no sharp or significant surge but rather fluctuations around a potentially steady range.
2. Season Classification for Week25, 2021: Based on the flu season cycles in the United States, Week25, 2021 falls clearly into the "Off-season." The off-season is characterized by minimal ILI activity and generally occurs from Week7 to Week31. During this period, flu activity is typically at or near baseline levels, reflecting reduced transmission as compared to peak or peak onset seasons. Therefore, Week25, 2021 is expected to feature stable or low ILI occurrence, consistent with off-season patterns.
3. A correlation analysis of past trends and future ILI occurrences highlights that the fluctuating data from the past five weeks lacks substantial growth or decline momentum. The arithmetic mean of observed ILI occurrences (1490, 1558, 1486, 1598, and 1645) is (1490 + 1558 + 1486 + 1598 + 1645) ÷ 5 = 1555.4, which serves as a baseline forecast value. Adjustments to this are made to account for seasonal effects (off-season suppression) and CDC-reported factors. The projection of 1495 reflects a slight decline from the mean, aligning with typical fluctuations under off-season conditions and the historical absence of any strong upward drivers.
4. Three major factors from the CDC reports strongly influence the forecasting:
5. 1) Influenza activity remains extremely low during this period, with only ~0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive each week. Both clinical and public health labs confirm negligible influenza transmission, which suggests no significant increase in ILI activity for the forecast period.
6. 2) Outpatient visits for ILI have been stable, consistently ranging between 1.1% to 1.3% and far below the national baseline of 2.6%. This stability indicates low activity and continuity of near-baseline levels moving forward.
7. 3) COVID-19-associated disruptions in healthcare behavior and surveillance continue to affect ILI data. Given trends of monitoring complexities and minimal flu transmission, an unusual surge or peak in ILI activity is unlikely during off-season conditions.
5. In summary, Week25, 2021 falls within the off-season, which is characterized by minimal flu transmission. The modest upward fluctuations in past ILI occurrences are offset by CDC-reported minimal influenza positivity rates, stable outpatient visits, and continued disruptions due to COVID-19. Based on these factors and the calculated mean of past values, the future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week25, 2021) are projected at 1495, reflecting seasonal stability with no major deviations expected.
