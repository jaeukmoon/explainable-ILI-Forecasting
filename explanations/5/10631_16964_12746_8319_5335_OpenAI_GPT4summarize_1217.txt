1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a significant decline, with values of ['10631', '16964', '12746', '8319', '5335']. Week51, 2021, marked the peak with 16964 cases, followed by a steep decline to 12746 in Week1, 2022, further to 5335 by Week3, 2022. This downward trajectory indicates waning influenza-like illness activity throughout this period.
2. The sharp decrease in ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks correlates with the substantial drop to 2196 occurrences reported after 5 weeks (Week8, 2022). The consistent decline from Week51, 2021, to Week3, 2022, suggests a continuation of this downward trend leading to lower activity in the future period.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily declined from 4.8% in Week52, 2021, to 2.8% in Week3, 2022. This reduction in healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory illnesses aligns with and supports the lower ILI occurrences reported in Week8, 2022.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) positivity rates in clinical and public health labs consistently declined from 6.2% in Week51, 2021, to 1.9% in Week3, 2022, reflecting diminished influenza transmission activity, which likely contributed to the significantly reduced future ILI occurrences.
5. Lower flu vaccination coverage compared to prior seasons, combined with ongoing antigenic changes in Influenza A(H3N2) viruses, as highlighted in Week1, 2022, and Week2, 2022, may have prolonged flu activity earlier in the season. However, the stabilization of hospitalization and mortality rates by Week3, 2022, suggests a deceleration that aligns with the future ILI reduction to 2196 occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 2196 future ILI occurrences in Week8, 2022, result from the sharp decline in ILI trends observed in Weeks51, 2021, through Week3, 2022, supported by decreasing outpatient visits, influenza positivity rates, and stabilization of severe outcomes such as hospitalizations and deaths by the end of the analyzed period.
