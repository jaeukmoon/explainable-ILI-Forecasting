1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week38 to Week42, 2021 are 1064, 975, 1124, 1063, and 969. Across these weeks, the trend demonstrates fluctuations with no consistent increase or decrease, marked by a spike in Week40 (1124) followed by a decline to Week42 (969). This suggests an overall stable or slightly fluctuating pattern without significant growth.
2. Week47, 2021 belongs to the peak season. Historically, U.S. peak ILI activity typically occurs from Week46 of one year through about Week6 of the next. Week42, 2021 reports low influenza positivity (<2.5%), but the timeframe transitions into the initial weeks of the peak season.
3. Time-series analysis indicates the stable and fluctuating trend observed in past weeks will likely progress into Week47, 2021. The spike in Week40 (1124) may indicate precursor activity leading into the peak season, which aligns with a forecasted rise in Week47 occurrences to 1216, consistent with historical seasonality and gradual increases in ILI cases during peak periods.
4. Minimal influenza virus circulation persists (Week38 to Week42, 2021 #1, #2, #4, #10 for all weeks) with low positivity rates (<2.5%) and significant dominance of respiratory pathogens other than influenza during this period. The transition into the peak season, combined with seasonal patterns, contributes to the predicted rise in Week47.
5. Vaccination data and uptake trends remain unavailable (Week38 to Week42, 2021 #6, #8, #8, #8, #8). While CDC emphasizes annual vaccination efforts, the lack of updates implies uncertain impacts of vaccination coverage on transmission. Nevertheless, the peak onset timing historically leads to increased ILI activity regardless of vaccination trends.
6. Overlapping impacts of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens (Week38 to Week42, 2021 #7, #7, #9, #10, #10) contribute to ILI occurrences, with shifts in care-seeking behaviors complicating direct alignment of influenza activity with historical baselines. However, steady or declining ILI trends across age groups (Week38 to Week42, 2021 #5, #6, #4, #4, #4) help balance projections against unexpected spikes.
7. The forecasted occurrence of 1216 in Week47, 2021 reflects the progressive seasonal transition into the peak season (Week46 onward), the observed trend of slight fluctuations, and increased co-circulation of respiratory pathogens. These align with historical expectations of rising ILI activity during this phase despite ongoing low influenza positivity.
