1. The recorded ILI occurrences from Week21, 2022 to Week25, 2022 show a significant decreasing trend: 2058 → 1858 → 1595 → 1399, reaching 1543 in Week25, indicating a slight fluctuation after consistent decline. This reflects a trajectory from higher activity levels toward stabilization near a lower baseline, suggesting waning transmission intensity.
2. Week30, 2022, occurs within the off-season for ILI activity. The declining positivity rates (Week23, 2022 #3; Week24, 2022 #1; Week25, 2022 #1) and consistently below-baseline outpatient rates (Week21, 2022 #3; Week25, 2022 #4) align with reduced ILI occurrences typical of off-season behavior.
3. The past decreasing pattern in ILI suggests a continuing low trend extending into the off-season. Based on time-series forecasting, prior stabilization and reduced activity project a further decline over the next five weeks, arriving at a forecast of 785 occurrences in Week30, 2022.
4. Influenza positivity rates declined steadily across surveillance, dropping from 5.7% (Week21, 2022 #1) to 1.8% (Week25, 2022 #1). This trend indicates diminishing transmission intensity and aligns with off-season low activity levels.
5. Vaccination uptake and antigenic differences impact seasonal dynamics. Though vaccine virus matches showed partial alignment (Week21, 2022 #7; Week22, 2022 #8), the ongoing immunization efforts (Week21, 2022 #9; Week24, 2022 #9) likely helped reduce severe outcomes and affected future ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulating respiratory pathogens (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) have consistently contributed (Week21, 2022 #8; Week23, 2022 #7; Week25, 2022 #4) but have not significantly elevated influenza activity due to diminished influenza-specific transmission (Week23, 2022 #1; Week25, 2022 #1).
7. The declining ILI trend, low off-season activity patterns, reduced positivity and outpatient visits, and stabilization influenced by vaccination and co-circulation dynamics substantiate the projected ILI count of 785 for Week30, 2022.
