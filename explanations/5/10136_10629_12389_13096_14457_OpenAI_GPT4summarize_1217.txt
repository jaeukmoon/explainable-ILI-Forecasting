1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent upward trend: 10136 (Week 40, 2023), 10629 (Week 41, 2023), 12389 (Week 42, 2023), 13096 (Week 43, 2023), and 14457 (Week 44, 2023). This progression demonstrates a steady escalation in ILI cases, with notable week-to-week increases and the highest value recorded in Week 44, 2023.
2. The positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the steady increase from 13096 (Week 43, 2023) to 14457 (Week 44, 2023) aligns with the sharp rise to 22735 future ILI occurrences by Week 49, 2023. This trend suggests that the rising trajectory observed in the latter weeks of the past time series carried forward into the future period.
3. Increasing outpatient visits for ILI were recorded, rising from 2.2% (Week 40, 2023) to 2.9% (Week 44, 2023), reaching the national baseline; this gradual increase in healthcare encounters indicates heightened respiratory illness activity preceding the future surge.
4. Hospitalization rates for influenza exhibited consistent increases, escalating from 0.1 per 100,000 (Week 40, 2023) to 1.2 per 100,000 (Week 44, 2023), marking the second highest cumulative rate for this point in the season since 2010. This trend reflects an intensifying burden of severe flu cases contributing to rising ILI numbers.
5. Rising positivity rates of influenza in clinical labs, from 1.1% (Week 40, 2023) to 3.0% (Week 44, 2023), combined with co-circulation of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, further aggravated the overall respiratory illness burden, escalating ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 22735 future ILI occurrences (Week 49, 2023) are attributed to the noticeable upward trend in past occurrences, the rise in ILI outpatient visits, increasing hospitalization rates, and higher influenza positivity rates compounded by the co-circulation of respiratory viruses. These factors collectively explain the significant surge in future ILI activity.
