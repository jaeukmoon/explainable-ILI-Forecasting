1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trajectory, with values of ['1331', '1372', '1609', '1910', '1936']. The ILI cases increased steadily each week, from 1331 (Week28, 2021) to 1936 (Week32, 2021), marking a sustained rise of approximately 10%–20% per week in most intervals. This consistent growth indicates escalating respiratory illness activity by the end of the observation period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the steady rise in ILI cases over the 5 weeks culminated in the largest reported value of 1936 (Week32, 2021), followed by a projection of 1867 occurrences (Week37, 2021). Although the future value (1867) is slightly lower than the Week32 peak, it represents an expected stabilization or plateau after successive weeks of sharp increases.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI demonstrated a consistent increase over the observed period, climbing from 1.3% (Week28, 2021) to 2.1% (Week32, 2021). This trend reflects growing healthcare-seeking behaviors related to respiratory illnesses and aligns with the reported future ILI occurrence.
4. The percentage of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) showed a notable and increasing trend, rising from 7.1% in Week28, 2021, to 14.6% in Week32, 2021, remaining above epidemic thresholds throughout. Although primarily driven by COVID-19, this trend highlights elevated respiratory illness activity, indirectly correlating with the increase in ILI occurrences.
5. The impact of healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic persisted across all 5 weeks, complicating the interpretation of ILI trends. This disruption may have skewed surveillance data, contributing to higher reported ILI activity in both the past and future. Additionally, the increased circulation of other respiratory viruses (e.g., COVID-19) and isolated cases of novel influenza strains (Week32, 2021) likely fueled the broader ILI rise during this period.
6. In summary, the reported future occurrence of 1867 ILI cases by Week37, 2021, is attributable to the sustained upward trend in weekly data (Weeks28–32, 2021), consistent increases in outpatient ILI visits, persistently elevated PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-driven disruptions in healthcare-seeking and surveillance systems. These factors collectively explain the maintained high level of ILI occurrences.
