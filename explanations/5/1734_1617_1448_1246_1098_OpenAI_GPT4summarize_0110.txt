1. The reported ILI counts from Week19 to Week23, 2023 are 1734, 1617, 1448, 1246, and 1098. This trend demonstrates a consistent, gradual decline with no significant outliers or sharp drops, reflecting a steady downward movement in ILI occurrences over five weeks.
2. In the U.S., the off-season generally spans from the end of the peak season to the start of the peak onset season. Given that Week28, 2023 lies well within this off-season window, combined with ongoing low influenza positivity (Week19, 2023 #1; Week21, 2023 #1; Week23, 2023 #1) and minimal ILI activity across regions (Week22, 2023 #8; Week23, 2023 #8), Week28, 2023 is forecasted to fall within the off-season period.
3. Based on the time-series perspective, the steady decline in ILI occurrences (from 1734 in Week19 to 1098 in Week23) suggests a continuation of this downward trend, albeit moderating as it approaches a baseline level. A projected count of 698 occurrences five weeks post-Week23 is consistent with this sustained reduction in ILI cases.
4. Positivity rates for influenza remained minimal nationally, with influenza positivity hovering around 1% for Weeks19 to Week23 (Week19, 2023 #1; Week22, 2023 #1; Week23, 2023 #1), indicating an ongoing low level of flu transmission.
5. SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory viruses continue co-circulating, yet their impact on driving significant spikes in ILI remains subdued, given the absence of a notable rise in respiratory illness contributions during Weeks19 to Week23 (Week19, 2023 #9; Week21, 2023 #8; Week23, 2023 #10).
6. The seasonal flu vaccine has shown to be antigenically similar to circulating strains, with CDC reports consistently recommending vaccination (Week19, 2023 #7; Week20, 2023 #9). This, coupled with widespread susceptibility of influenza strains to antivirals (Week19, 2023 #10; Week20, 2023 #8), has likely contributed to controlling influenza transmission and subsequently stabilizing ILI.
7. Combining the observed consistent trend of declining ILI, the timing of Week28, 2023 as off-season, the persistently low positivity rates for influenza, ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses without significant spikes, and the influence of effective flu vaccination, the forecast of 698 ILI occurrences aligns well with these contributing factors.
