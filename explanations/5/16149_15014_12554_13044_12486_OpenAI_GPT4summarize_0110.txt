1. The ILI counts from Week1 to Week5, 2024, show a steady decline, starting at 16149 in Week1 and reaching 12486 in Week5. Specifically, there is a significant drop between Week1 (16149) and Week3 (12554), suggesting a tapering trend after higher activity at the start of the year. However, there is a slight increase in Week4 (13044) before declining again in Week5 (12486). Overall, the trend reflects a general decline in ILI occurrences, with minor fluctuations in later weeks.
2. Considering that the typical peak season occurs between Week46 of one year and Week6 of the next, and the off-season typically begins after Week6, it can be deduced that Week10, 2024, falls within the early off-season. This aligns with the downward trend in ILI activity in recent weeks, indicating a reduction in widespread transmission and infection rates. Hence, it is forecasted that Week10, 2024, belongs to the off-season.
3. The observed decline in ILI counts from Week1 to Week5, 2024, aligns with historical trends showing a reduction in influenza activity after the peak season. Time-series analysis suggests that the tapering trend will continue into Week10, with occasional fluctuations due to co-circulating factors such as RSV and COVID-19. Using this trajectory, the forecasted value of 9697 reflects a gradual decline consistent with this pattern.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including RSV and COVID-19, continues to influence ILI activity, as noted in all weeks (Week1–Week5, 2024), but the overall impact is decreasing as these viruses' peaks subside.
5. Vaccination coverage remains critical in reducing transmission. CDC reports from Week1–Week5, 2024, indicate high vaccination advocacy. Despite ongoing infections, the existing vaccines match circulating strains, contributing to a dampening effect on severe cases and community spread.
6. CDC data from Week3 onward indicate reductions in outpatient visits, decreasing hospitalization rates, and fewer deaths attributed to influenza. This shift suggests declining activity, which supports predictions of lower ILI counts in coming weeks, including Week10. Minor regional surges (e.g., Week5, regions 2 and 7) do not offset the broader national decline.
7. In summary, the tapering trend in ILI occurrences, classification of Week10 in the off-season, and correlation to historical patterns of post-peak declines collectively lead to the forecast of 9697 ILI occurrences. This forecast is further justified by co-circulating respiratory viruses, the ongoing benefit of vaccination efforts, and decreases in outpatient and hospitalization rates, all indicating a steady reduction in ILI activity entering Week10, 2024.
