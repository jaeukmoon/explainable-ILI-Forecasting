1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating but upward trend overall, with values of ['1490', '1558', '1486', '1598', '1645']. After a drop from 1558 (Week16, 2021) to 1486 (Week17, 2021), there was a steady increase leading up to the highest value of 1645 (Week20, 2021). This trend suggests progressive escalation in ILI activity during these weeks.
2. A correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the upward trajectory from Weeks18-20, 2021, correlates with the reported future ILI occurrence of 1495 after 5 weeks (Week25, 2021). Despite an initial decline in Week17, the general rise in Weeks18-20 reflects sustained activity, supporting the future value.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a slight but steady increase, moving from 1.1% in Week16, 2021, to 1.3% in Week20, 2021. Although these values remained below the national baseline (2.6%), the gradual growth highlights increased respiratory illness-related healthcare-seeking patterns that align with the future ILI occurrences.
4. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) deaths consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, remaining around 11.8% (Week16, 2021) to 9.5% (Week20, 2021), driven largely by COVID-19. This sustained elevation reflects ongoing respiratory illness burdens contributing to future ILI levels.
5. Persistent disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, as documented across Weeks16-20, 2021, complicated ILI data interpretation. These behavioral shifts likely influenced reporting trends, leading to a stabilized yet non-diminished ILI occurrence of 1495 in future weeks.
6. Despite exceptionally low influenza positivity rates (0.1% across all weeks, Week16-20, 2021) and minimal influenza-associated hospitalizations (0.8 per 100,000 consistently), the rise in ILI occurrences suggests contributions from generalized respiratory illnesses or non-specific viral activity during the surveillance period.
7. The future ILI occurrences of 1495 (Week25, 2021) can be attributed to the overall rising trend in the past weeks, increasing outpatient visits for respiratory symptoms, persistently elevated PIC mortality, and the impact of behavioral and reporting changes influenced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These factors collectively sustained ILI activity at a consistent and elevated level.
