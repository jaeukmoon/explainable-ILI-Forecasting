1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent upward trend, with values increasing from 2088 (Week 43, 2020) to 3017 (Week 47, 2020). This steady rise reflects a progressive escalation in reported influenza-like illness activity, peaking at the highest value of 3017 in the observed period.   

2. A positive correlation exists between the rising trajectory of past data (Weeks 43–47, 2020) and the future ILI occurrences of 2836 after 5 weeks (Week 52, 2020). The substantially higher ILI levels observed toward the end of the past 5 weeks act as a precursor to the sustained elevated activity reflected in the future occurrence data.  

3. Outpatient ILI visit percentages increased consistently from 1.2% (Week 43, 2020) to 1.6% (Week 47, 2020), indicating a gradual increase in respiratory illness-related healthcare encounters. This upward trend suggests amplified ILI activity that aligns with the reported future level of 2836 occurrences.  
Elevated deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) surged from 8.2% (Week 43, 2020) to 11.3% (Week 47, 2020), substantially exceeding epidemic thresholds each week. This sustained mortality pattern reflects heightened respiratory illness severity, contributing to the future ILI levels.  
Healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional surveillance methods, complicating interpretation of ILI trends, as cited in every weekly report. These shifts may have delayed recognition of cases and artificially emphasized ILI activity in subsequent reporting, contributing to the sharp future rise.  

4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 2836 (Week 52, 2020) are primarily attributable to the upward trajectory seen in Weeks 43–47, 2020, increasing outpatient ILI visits, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-related changes in healthcare access and data collection systems, which amplified subsequent ILI trends.
