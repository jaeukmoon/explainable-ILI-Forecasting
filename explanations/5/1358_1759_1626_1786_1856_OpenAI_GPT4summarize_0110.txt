1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week16 to Week20, 2021 are 1358, 1759, 1626, 1786, and 1856. A rising trend is observed between Week16 (1358) and Week17 (1759). This is followed by a dip in Week18 (1626), likely due to reduced flu transmission or reporting variances, and then a steady increase from Week18 to Week20, reaching 1856. Overall, the trend indicates a gradual increase in ILI occurrences with some minor fluctuations, suggesting a stabilized upward trajectory.
2. Week25, 2021 is within the U.S. off-season, which generally spans from the end of the peak season (about Week6) to the next peak onset season (around Week32–Week46). As evidenced by the continued low influenza activity and predictions of minimal ILI across jurisdictions in Weeks16–20, 2021, Week25, 2021 corresponds to the off-season period.
3. From a time-series perspective, the past five weeks exhibit an upward trend in occurrences, particularly from Week18 to Week20, 2021, with no significant decline. Projecting this trend forward, ILI occurrence remains stable with modest upward fluctuations. Thus, a value of 1791 for Week25, 2021 corresponds to these incremental increases combined with off-season baseline activity.
4. During Weeks16–20, 2021, influenza positivity in clinical labs remained extremely low at 0.1% weekly, with minimal flu activity and no signs of widespread seasonal transmission (Week16, 2021 #1; Week17, 2021 #1; Week20, 2021 #1).
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic complicated ILI surveillance and reporting, potentially underestimating actual flu occurrences. Despite this, consistent low hospitalization and mortality rates suggest limited flu severity (Week16, 2021 #9; Week18, 2021 #9; Week20, 2021 #10).
6. Vaccination efforts remained steady, although no significant new trends were reported, underscoring continued protection against influenza with no immediate impacts on occurrence trends (Week16, 2021 #8; Week19, 2021 #9; Week20, 2021 #9).
7. The projected ILI value of 1791 reflects the historical rise in ILI occurrences from Week16 to Week20, 2021, despite low flu activity and strong vaccine-driven prevention. This steady upward trend during the off-season, with no evidence of influenza spikes, aligns with consistent co-circulation patterns and altered reporting behaviors under COVID-19.
