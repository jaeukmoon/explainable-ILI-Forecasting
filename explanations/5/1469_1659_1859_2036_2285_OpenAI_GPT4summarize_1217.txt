1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1469', '1659', '1859', '2036', '2285']. Starting from 1469 (Week27, 2021), the occurrences steadily increased, reaching 2285 (Week31, 2021). This continuous rise reflects an escalation in influenza-like illness activity over the observed period, indicating a sustained trajectory of growth.
2. The sharp and consistent upward trend in the past ILI occurrences aligns directly with the future occurrences of 3010 reported five weeks later (Week36, 2021). Specifically, the linear progression from Week30 to Week31, where the count reached its peak at 2285, strongly correlates with the continued rise to 3010, suggesting amplification of existing illness patterns.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased steadily across the observation period, moving from 1.3% in Week27, 2021, to 2.0% in Week31, 2021, with notable growth in younger (0–4, 5–24) and middle-aged (25–49, 50–64) groups. This upward trend reflects rising respiratory illness activity and contributes directly to the subsequent spike in future ILI occurrences.
4. Mortality associated with pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) showed a continuous increase, climbing from 6.5% in Week27, 2021, to 11.9% in Week31, 2021, consistently surpassing epidemic thresholds while being primarily driven by COVID-19. This heightened PIC mortality suggests a broader escalation in respiratory illness burden, paralleling the future ILI surge.
5. The persistent limitations in traditional data interpretation due to changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the pandemic, as highlighted across all CDC summaries, likely delayed recognition of ILI case growth while concentrating reporting in later weeks. These disruptions compounded with rising respiratory pathogen transmission, contributing to the future jump to 3010 occurrences.
6. The minimal influenza positivity rates, as observed in virologic surveillance across Weeks27–31, 2021, confirm that non-specific respiratory illnesses and other pathogens, such as COVID-19, likely drove the observed ILI increases. This broader illness dynamic set the stage for the significant rise in Week36, 2021.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 3010 (Week36, 2021) can be attributed to the consistent upward trend in past values, increasing outpatient ILI visits across all age groups, surpassing PIC mortality thresholds, and distortions in surveillance systems due to pandemic-induced healthcare behavior shifts, all occurring against a backdrop of non-influenza respiratory illness dominance.
