1. The ILI occurrences from Week2, 2024 (10877) to Week6, 2024 (10157) display a fluctuating trend. There was a significant drop from Week2 to Week3 (8551), a subsequent increase to Week4 (9246), a slight decline in Week5 (9072), and a rebound in Week6 (10157). Although the overall range of values suggests short-term variability, the trend does not exhibit a strong upward or downward trajectory, rather oscillating within a moderate range.
2. Given that Week11, 2024 falls just after the traditional peak season (Week46 of the prior year–Week6 of the following year), it would typically be classified within the off-season. Elevated activity in Week6, 2024 and preceding weeks points to the end of peak season, with Week11 belonging to the off-season as activity trends decline but remain higher than baseline levels.
3. From a time-series perspective, there is mild variability in the reported ILI counts but no sustained upward or downward motion. Projecting forward based on Week2–Week6 data, the historical fluctuations suggest a moderate decline leading up to Week11, aligning with an off-season period where activity reduces but remains above baseline metrics. Thus, the projection of 8296 occurrences for Week11 reflects this anticipated decline.
4. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 dominance (Week2, 2024 #2; Week3, 2024 #2; Week5, 2024 #1; Week6, 2024 #3) has contributed significantly to elevated activity in the time frame but aligns with prior patterns where its transmission wanes post-peak season.
5. CDC reports indicate no novel influenza virus detections (Week5, 2024 #8; Week6, 2024 #8), suggesting reduced external drivers for sustained activity. This absence favors a return toward off-season baseline levels.
6. Co-circulating respiratory illnesses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (Week2, 2024 #10; Week5, 2024 #10; Week6, 2024 #9) continue to complicate interpretations but are not expected to cause sharp influenza-specific surges as the activity moderates.
7. Vaccination remains widely recommended (Week2, 2024 #8; Week4, 2024 #7; Week6, 2024 #7), limiting the severity or further escalation of influenza activity, even with regional variation in intensity. Combined with antiviral susceptibility (Week2, 2024 #9; Week5, 2024 #7; Week6, 2024 #8), this factor supports controlled activity moving into the off-season. In summary, the moderate decline from fluctuating ILI counts, absence of novel variant impacts, and ongoing mitigation measures justify the projection of 8296 occurrences for Week11, 2024.
