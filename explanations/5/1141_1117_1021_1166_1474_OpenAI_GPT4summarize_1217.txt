1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall increasing trend after initial fluctuations, with values of ['1141', '1117', '1021', '1166', '1474']. A notable rise was observed in Week16, 2022, with a significant jump from 1166 (Week15, 2022) to 1474 (Week16, 2022), indicating escalating respiratory illness activity leading into subsequent weeks.
2. A strong correlation emerged between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the sharp increase in the latter weeks (Week15 to Week16, 2022) aligns with the future surge to 2058 occurrences by Week21, 2022. This suggests that the late rise in the past series served as a precursor to the observed peak activity after 5 weeks.
3. Rising outpatient visits for ILI, from 1.8% (Week12, 2022) to 2.1% (Week16, 2022), reflected a consistent increase in healthcare encounters for respiratory illness. This trend supported the future amplification of ILI occurrences. Continuous increases in cumulative hospitalization rates, from 7.2 per 100,000 (Week12, 2022) to 11.1 per 100,000 (Week16, 2022), indicated growing severe illness burdens, fueling future ILI surges. Persistent co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 with influenza) compounded disease activity, as evidenced by coinfection rates of 5.4%–5.0% through the past weeks, intensifying ILI case complexities.
4. The predominance of Influenza A(H3N2) at 99.8%-100% across Weeks12–16, 2022, alongside its antigenic divergence from the vaccine strain, may have reduced vaccine effectiveness, contributing to the escalating illness burden observed in Week21, 2022. Increasing regional influenza activity (especially in the northeast, rising every week) paralleled the unexpected future peak.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 2058 in Week21, 2022, can be attributed to the observed upward trend in the past series, rising hospitalization and outpatient visit rates, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and the dominance of A(H3N2) with limited vaccine effectiveness. These factors collectively explain the amplified respiratory illness activity in the future period.
