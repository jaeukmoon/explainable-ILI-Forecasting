1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week33 to Week37, 2021 are 1326, 1347, 1395, 1315, and 1243. The trend initially increased from Week33 (1326) to Week35 (1395) before experiencing a continuous decline over Week36 (1315) and Week37 (1243). This pattern suggests an overall fluctuation with a brief peak in Week35 before descending toward a lower baseline.
2. In the U.S., the peak onset season generally occurs between Week32 and Week46, preceding the typical peak season. Week42, 2021 falls within this classification. Given the relatively low ILI activity in the previous weeks and the absence of widespread influenza circulation (Week33, 2021 #1; Week34, 2021 #1; Week35, 2021 #1; Week36, 2021 #1; Week37, 2021 #1, #5), Week42, 2021 is forecasted to belong to the peak onset season.
3. The time-series trend highlights fluctuating ILI occurrences, with a mild short-lived rise followed by a decline in Weeks36 and 37, 2021. This decline suggests a stabilization or diminished activity in subsequent weeks. Extrapolating from the decreasing pattern and considering the approaching peak onset period, the projected value of 1218 aligns with the historical movement toward lower levels at this stage of the season.
4. SARS-CoV-2 and non-influenza respiratory viruses are contributing significantly to ILI visits, as influenza circulation remains minimal nationally, with influenza positivity rates consistently at or below 0.1% (Week33, 2021 #3; Week34, 2021 #4; Week36, 2021 #3; Week37, 2021 #6).
5. ILI activity trends show regional variations, though most regions remain below their baselines, with only isolated increases observed sporadically (Week33, 2021 #7; Week34, 2021 #3; Week36, 2021 #2; Week37, 2021 #7). This reflects localized impacts rather than widespread influenza activity.
6. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors driven by the COVID-19 pandemic are influencing the interpretation and reporting of ILI trends, with altered surveillance patterns compared to typical influenza seasons (Week33, 2021 #9; Week34, 2021 #8; Week36, 2021 #9; Week37, 2021 #9).
7. In summary, the projected ILI occurrence of 1218 for Week42, 2021 aligns with the ongoing decline in ILI trends, a low prevalence of influenza activity, and the broader context of reduced healthcare visits linked to influenza. SARS-CoV-2 dominance further suppresses traditional ILI activity, maintaining lower-than-average levels reflective of the peak onset season.
