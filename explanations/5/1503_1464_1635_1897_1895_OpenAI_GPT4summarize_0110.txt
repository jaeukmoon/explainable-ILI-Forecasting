1. The reported ILI counts from Week39 to Week43, 2023 are 1503, 1464, 1635, 1897, and 1895. The trend shows an overall gradual increase in ILI occurrences, with a nearly stable pattern between Week42 (1897) and Week43 (1895). This suggests a consistent rise in activity over the past five weeks, indicating that influenza transmission and ILI visits are beginning to intensify but have not reached a peak level yet.
2. Forecasting Target Week (Week48, 2023) belongs to the peak season. The historical trend places Week48, 2023 squarely within the peak season for ILI activity in the U.S., which typically spans from Week46 through Week6 of the following year. Additionally, the slightly increasing trend in positivity rates, ILI visits, and hospitalizations in recent weeks (Week42 and Week43, 2023) suggests the beginning of the peak intensity period.
3. The time-series analysis reveals a stepwise upward trend, with gradual increases of 131 from Week39 to Week40, 170 from Week40 to Week41, and a sharp rise from Week41 to Week42 (+262). Although Week43 shows a slight stabilization, the pattern approximates the early progression seen during the onset of peak seasons in prior years. This implies a continuation of rising cases, with a projected increase to 3701 ILI occurrences in Week48, 2023, assuming ongoing upward momentum.
4. Current ILI patterns reflect increasing outpatient visits and baseline positivity for influenza. Reports from Week42, 2023 (#10) and Week43, 2023 (#3, #9) indicate moderate and high activity in several jurisdictions, accompanied by steady increases in respiratory illness rates, which suggest rising influenza activity.
5. Anticipated seasonal trends and high-risk timing contribute to the forecast. Week43, 2023 (#10) highlights the CDC’s expectation of a continued rise in flu activity, supported by co-circulation of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV. Week42, 2023 (#11) also confirms mild increases regionally, which is consistent with the predicted trajectory for Week48 activity levels.
6. Influenza vaccination rates and antiviral susceptibility are other factors. Week43, 2023 (#7, #10) reports no novel influenza variants and notes genetic compatibility between current vaccines and predominant strains like Influenza A(H1N1). However, the lack of significant progress in vaccination rates across weeks (e.g., Week40, 2023 #7; Week41, 2023 #8) leads to limited mitigation effects as flu cases grow during the peak season.
7. In conclusion, the projected rise to 3701 ILI occurrences in Week48, 2023 is supported by the historical upward trend aligning with the start of the peak influenza season, ongoing increases in outpatient visits and positivity rates, CDC-forecasted activity growth, and stable vaccine effectiveness despite low vaccination coverage. These factors collectively drive the prediction of higher ILI occurrences.
