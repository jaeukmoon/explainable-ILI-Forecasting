1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week19 to Week23, 2021, are 1598, 1645, 1383, 1504, and 1576. The trend shows mild fluctuations over these weeks, with decreases observed from Week20 (1645) to Week21 (1383) and subsequent increases to Week23 (1576). Overall, the pattern reflects slight short-term variability but remains at relatively low levels across the period without any significant surge.
2. In the U.S., the off-season generally spans from immediately after the peak season to the next peak onset season, typically covering Weeks 7 to 31. Given the low influenza activity reported and the off-season timeline, Week28, 2021 aligns with the off-season classification for ILI activity.
3. Based on the historical trend, the fluctuations observed from Week19 to Week23 indicate a generally stable or minimally shifting baseline. Projecting this trend forward, the expected occurrence after 5 weeks is influenced by consistent low-level ILI activity and no significant indications of a sharp rise or dip. The model forecasts 1659, reflecting the general stability and slight margins of fluctuation.
4. A novel Influenza A(H1N2)v case reported in Week20, 2021, indicates isolated detection without human-to-human transmission, contributing minimally to broader influenza activity (Week20, 2021 #7).
5. Minimal outpatient visits for ILI remain consistently below the national baseline of 2.6% (Week19, 2021 #7; Week20, 2021 #4; Week21, 2021 #1; Week22, 2021 #1; Week23, 2021 #1), confirming reduced community spread.
6. The hospitalization rates and severe outcomes remain at historically low levels with no increase in influenza-associated deaths over these weeks (Week19, 2021 #4, #6; Week20, 2021 #5, #8; Week21, 2021 #4; Week22, 2021 #4; Week23, 2021 #3).
7. Conclusively, the stable fluctuations in ILI levels, off-season timing (Week28, 2021), minimal outpatient visits, low hospitalization and mortality data, and minimal impact of novel strains collectively justify the forecasted ILI value of 1659.
