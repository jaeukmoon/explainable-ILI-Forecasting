1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an upward trend, starting at 1911 in Week41, 2020, dropping to 1730 in Week42, 2020, and increasing to 1793 in Week43, 2020. The upward trajectory continued sharply, reaching 2148 in Week44, 2020, and peaking at 2576 in Week45, 2020. This pattern reflects escalating ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the marked increase in past data, particularly Weeks44 and Week45, 2020, aligns with the reported decrease to 1679 after 5 weeks. The sharp peak in Week45 appears to precede the eventual decline in future occurrences, likely signifying a delayed epidemic curve trajectory.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a gradual increase from 1.2% in Week41, 2020, to 1.5% in Week45, 2020, while remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%. The steady rise in visits reflects greater ILI-related burden, supporting the elevated future ILI value of 1679.
4. Persistent PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19)-attributed mortality, rising from 7.2% (Week41, 2020) to 8.9% (Week45, 2020) and consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds, points to high respiratory illness activity during this period, correlating with the elevated future ILI burden.
5. Ongoing disruptions to healthcare-seeking patterns and traditional ILI surveillance caused by the COVID-19 pandemic likely influenced reporting trends. These disruptions may have delayed a peak in epidemiological data capture, creating a lag that contributed to the observed future decline to 1679 occurrences.
6. Despite low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.3% in Week41 and 0.2% in Week44, 2020) and minimal public health lab detections, rising ILI activity suggests that non-influenza respiratory illnesses or alternative factors, such as behavioral changes, could have amplified case reporting in prior weeks, eventually stabilizing to future lower levels.
7. In summary, the reported 1679 future ILI occurrences (Week50, 2020) reflect the peak and decline in ILI activity seen in Weeks44–45, 2020, steadily increasing ILI outpatient visits, persistent PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, and COVID-19-driven shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance patterns.
