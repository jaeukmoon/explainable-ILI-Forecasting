1. The reported ILI counts from Week44, 2020 to Week48, 2020 are 1171, 1320, 1416, 1293, and 1230. The trend shows an initial increase from Week44 (1171) to Week46 (1416), followed by a decrease in Week47 (1293) and Week48 (1230). This indicates a mild fluctuation, with a short peak around Week46 before a decline. Overall, the trajectory is slightly downward toward stabilization.
2. Based on historical patterns, Week53, 2020 (target week) falls within the typical peak season timeframe (Week46 to Week6). However, influenza positivity and ILI activity remain significantly low and atypical for this period due to external factors such as the high prevalence of COVID-19 and public health interventions. Considering these factors, Week53 is better classified as part of an off-season.
3. The time-series patterns of the past five weeks suggest that ILI occurrences are stabilizing at lower levels due to the declining counts in Week47 (1293) and Week48 (1230) after the modest peak in Week46 (1416). Projecting this forward, the model predicts further stabilization, resulting in a future occurrence of 1060 by Week53, 2020.
4. Recent influenza activity has been unusually low for this time of year, with weekly influenza positivity rates remaining between 0.1% and 0.2% (Week44, 2020 #1; Week45, 2020 #1; Week46, 2020 #1; Week47, 2020 #1; Week48, 2020 #1).
5. The continued dominance of COVID-19 (PIC deaths surpassing thresholds between 8.1% and 12.8% over all weeks) alongside changes in healthcare-seeking behavior and overlaps in symptoms reduce traditional flu transmission and surveillance reliability (Week44, 2020 #6, #9; Week45, 2020 #6, #9; Week46, 2020 #4, #8; Week47, 2020 #6, #8; Week48, 2020 #3, #8).
6. Low levels of influenza virus circulation, including minimal Influenza A and B detections (ranging from 0.1% to 0.2% positivity) with limited subtyping, further support lower ILI activity in the short term (Week44, 2020 #2, #3; Week45, 2020 #2, #3; Week46, 2020 #1, #2; Week47, 2020 #1, #3; Week48, 2020 #1, #4).
7. The projected occurrence of 1060 for Week53, 2020 reflects the interplay of modestly fluctuating past trends, the off-season classification, the influence of ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, and historically low influenza activity. Together, these factors predict stabilized, reduced ILI activity rather than a significant increase.
