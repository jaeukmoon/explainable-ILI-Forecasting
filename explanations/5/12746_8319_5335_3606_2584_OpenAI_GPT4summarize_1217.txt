1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent downward trend, with values decreasing from 12746 (Week 1, 2022) to 2584 (Week 5, 2022). Each week showed a gradual but significant reduction in cases, indicating a steady decline in ILI activity over the observed period.
2. The recurrent decline in past ILI occurrences directly correlates with the lower future value of 2881 reported after 5 weeks (Week 10, 2022). The gradual reduction over the 5 weeks appears to predict stabilization at a lower level, with the future value reflecting this stabilization.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed significant decreases during these weeks, starting above the baseline at 4.3% (Week 1, 2022), progressively declining to 1.7% (Week 5, 2022). This decrease in healthcare visits signals lesser ILI-related health-seeking behavior, contributing to the reduced value of 2881 after 5 weeks.
4. Influenza activity and positivity rates steadily declined, with clinical lab positivity dropping from 2.2% (Week 1, 2022) to 1.7% (Week 5, 2022). The waning positivity rates, particularly for Influenza A(H3N2), suggest a reduced transmission rate, supporting the lower occurrence of 2881 in the future timeframe.
5. Flu vaccination coverage remained lower than in previous seasons, and co-circulation with SARS-CoV-2 was persistent but showed no significant increases. The limited spread and sporadic nature of influenza activity (emphasized in Week 4 and Week 5, 2022) align with the stabilization of ILI occurrences after 5 weeks at 2881.
6. In summary, the reported future occurrence of 2881 ILI cases (Week 10, 2022) aligns with steady declines in ILI trends, outpatient visits, and positivity rates. Additionally, sporadic regional activity, lower vaccine uptake, and minimal increases in influenza and SARS-CoV-2 co-infections further explain the observed stabilization at lower levels.
