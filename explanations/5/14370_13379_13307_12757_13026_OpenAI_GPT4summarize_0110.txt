1. The ILI occurrences from Week8 to Week12, 2023 decreased steadily from 16585 to 14594 by Week11, 2023 before showing a slight increase to 14942 in Week12, 2023. This overall downward trend, followed by mild fluctuation, indicates a gradual decline in influenza activity with no significant upward spikes during this period.

2. Week22, 2023 falls well into the off-season for influenza activity, as it occurs long after the usual peak season (Weeks46–6) and exhibits continued low influenza positivity rates and ILI levels throughout Weeks8–12, 2023.

3. Historical ILI patterns suggest that after periods of consistent declines like those of Week8 to Week11, 2023 with minor fluctuations, a stabilization or slight decrease in ILI numbers can be expected in the following weeks. Based on this trend, Week22, 2023 is projected to continue reflecting off-season dynamics with reduced occurrences compared to peak levels.

4. CDC data highlights low nationwide influenza activity across the last five weeks, with positivity rates consistently below 1.0%–1.4%. This low positivity (Week8, 2023 #1; Week11, 2023 #1; Week12, 2023 #1) strongly supports a continuing downward trend into Week22.

5. Vaccines remain antigenically well-matched to circulating strains, and antiviral drugs demonstrate high effectiveness and susceptibility across tested viruses (Week8, 2023 #9, #10; Week12, 2023 #8). This containment, coupled with steady vaccination rates, reduces the likelihood of sudden surges in ILI cases.

6. Co-circulation with other respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 persists but shows no evidence of spikes or novel variants contributing to increased ILI trends in recent weeks (Week11, 2023 #9; Week12, 2023 #10). This factor further stabilizes projections for Week22, 2023.

7. Considering reduced positivity, declining ILI occurrences, off-season timing, vaccine effectiveness, and minimal impact of co-circulating viruses, the projected ILI cases for Week22, 2023 appropriately settle at 13026.
