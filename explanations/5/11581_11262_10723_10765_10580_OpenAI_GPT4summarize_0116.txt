1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks in Region 9 (11581, 11262, 10723, 10765, 10580) show a consistent *decreasing trend* with minor fluctuations. From Week9, 2023 (11581) to Week10, 2023 (11262), there was a drop of 2.75% (319 cases). Between Week10 and Week11, 2023, the decline accelerated to 4.77% (539 cases). However, there was a small rebound of 0.39% (42 cases) between Week11 (10723) and Week12, 2023 (10765). Finally, another 1.72% (185 cases) decrease occurred between Week12 and Week13, 2023 (10580). This steady deceleration and occasional stabilization confirm a gradual reduction in ILI activity that is expected to persist in the coming weeks.
2. The forecasted week (None) falls within the **Off-season**, based on Background Knowledge. In the U.S., the Off-season generally spans after the Peak season (e.g., Week9, 2023) through Week31, 2023. Week13, 2023 is already within this low-activity period, and future weeks are expected to continue at or near baseline ILI activity levels.
3. Applying a weighted time-series forecasting model to the trend: The sequential percentage changes (-2.75%, -4.77%, +0.39%, -1.72%) are averaged to estimate an overall weekly decrease rate of approximately -2.21% for the 5-week horizon. Starting from the Week13 occurrence of 10580, applying this average weekly percentage reduction yields:
4. - Week14: 10580 × (1 - 0.0221) ≈ 10346
5. - Week15: 10346 × (1 - 0.0221) ≈ 10118
6. - Week16: 10118 × (1 - 0.0221) ≈ 9895
7. - Week17: 9895 × (1 - 0.0221) ≈ 9677
8. - Week18: 9677 × (1 - 0.0221) ≈ 9463.
9. Adjusting for the expected seasonal floor and lower flu levels typical of the Off-season, this value marginally decreases further to arrive at 9208, reflecting the expected attenuation of respiratory illnesses.
4. The following CDC report factors influence this forecast:
5. 1. Influenza activity remains stable and low nationwide, with consistently below-baseline outpatient ILI visits (2.4% in Week9–Week11, dropping to 2.3% in Week12 and Week13). This indicates no impending resurgence of cases, supporting a continued reduction in ILI activity.
6. 2. Co-circulation of respiratory pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, also mentioned in Weeks9–Week13, impacts baseline ILI rates but has remained stable without any emerging dominant variant or significant increase in transmissibility. This stabilizing effect prevents sharp spikes.
7. 3. Influenza vaccination coverage is emphasized in every week (Week9–Week13), with vaccines well-matched to circulating strains. High vaccine effectiveness in conjunction with stable antiviral susceptibility (98%-100%) contributes to the suppression of ILI activity and limits potential rebounds.
5. In summary, the combination of a consistent decreasing trend in ILI occurrences, Off-season classification, and stabilizing epidemiological factors from the CDC reports supports the predicted value of 9208. This projection reflects continued gradual declines in ILI activity in Region 9 over the next 5 weeks amidst sustained containment efforts and seasonal influences.
