1. The reported ILI counts from Week40 to Week44, 2023 are 1500, 1508, 1447, 1396, and 1702. The trend demonstrates an overall mild fluctuation, with a slight decline from Week40 (1500) to Week43 (1396), followed by an uptick in Week44 (1702). This pattern indicates a shift toward increasing activity, which aligns with the seasonal upswing noted in CDC reports for Week44, 2023.
2. Week49, 2023 falls within the typical peak season (Week46 to Week6) as influenza activity is historically expected to intensify during this period. Observational data from Week44, 2023 also confirm that the U.S. is entering or has already entered its annual influenza peak season.
3. Correlation analysis suggests that the recent increase in ILI occurrences (Week43 to Week44 data) is consistent with the anticipated rise in cases during the peak season. The rise in ILI activity over the past five weeks and in outpatient visits, accompanied by virologic surveillance trends in Week44, 2023, supports a projection of further increases, culminating in the forecasted Week49 level of 2854 ILI cases.
4. Growing virologic influenza positivity (Week40-44, 2023 #1; Week44, 2023 #1) from 1.1% (Week40) to 3.0% (Week44) indicates increasing transmission across regions. This rising trend in positivity is a significant driver of the upward forecast.
5. CDC expectations highlight an anticipated continued rise in flu activity (Week43, 2023 #10; Week44, 2023 #9), citing geographical increases in activity and outpatient visits reaching the national baseline of 2.9% in Week44, 2023. This aligns with projections of further intensification of ILI occurrences by Week49, 2023.
6. Respiratory co-infections, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, complicate illness severity and contribute to increasing outpatient visits and hospitalizations (Week40-44, 2023 #6; Week44, 2023 #10). These infections exacerbate the influenza burden, amplifying ILI activity during the peak season.
7. In summary, the forecasted 2854 cases in Week49, 2023 are justified by the observed rising trend in ILI counts, alignment with historical peak season timelines, increasing virologic positivity and outpatient visits, and the compounding effects of respiratory co-infections. These factors collectively support the projection of heightened influenza-like illness activity during this time frame.
