1. The reported ILI counts from Week9 to Week13, 2023 are 15411, 14829, 14594, 14942, and 14370. The trend demonstrates a general decline over these weeks, indicating a gradual reduction in ILI occurrences with slight fluctuations around Week12 (14942). This declining pattern is indicative of stable or decreasing activity during an off-season period.

2. Week23, 2023 occurs well after the typical peak season (Week46 to Week6) and falls within the off-season, which generally spans from right after the peak season to the next peak onset season (e.g., from Week7 to Week31). The consistent low positivity rate (Week9, 2023 #1; Week10, 2023 #1; Week11, 2023 #1; Week12, 2023 #1; Week13, 2023 #1) and trends align with an off-season classification for Week23, 2023.

3. The time-series data show ILI occurrences decreasing over five weeks, suggesting a continued decline or stabilization as seen in previous off-seasons. The gradual reductions in positivity rates and hospitalizations (Week10, 2023 #1, #6; Week11, 2023 #1, #3) and sustained lower activity levels project no significant changes, forecasting a modest decrease from Week13 to Week23, 2023, resulting in the predicted 13095 ILI occurrences.

4. Nationwide influenza activity remains low, with respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza ranging from 0.8% to 1.0% (Week9, 2023 #1; Week10, 2023 #1; Week11, 2023 #1; Week12, 2023 #1; Week13, 2023 #1). This consistent trend supports the expectation of minimal ILI spread in Week23, 2023.

5. Current vaccinations are well-matched to circulating influenza strains, and antiviral susceptibility remains high (Week9, 2023 #8, #9; Week10, 2023 #15, #16; Week11, 2023 #7, #8; Week12, 2023 #9; Week13, 2023 #8). The extensive vaccination coverage contributes to reduced transmission and lower ILI activity.

6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory illnesses, including SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and influenza, continues to impact ILI trends without driving notable ILI spikes (Week9, 2023 #10; Week10, 2023 #14; Week11, 2023 #9; Week12, 2023 #10; Week13, 2023 #10). This overlap with other pathogens results in a mixed but stable respiratory illness baseline.

7. The declining ILI trend observed in previous weeks, classified off-season timing, low influenza positivity rates, effective vaccination and antiviral outcomes, and stable co-circulating respiratory activity collectively justify the predicted ILI occurrence of 13095 for Week23, 2023.
