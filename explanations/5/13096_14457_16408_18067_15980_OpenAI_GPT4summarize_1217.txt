1. The past time-series ILI occurrences indicated an overall increasing trend over 5 weeks, starting at 13096 (Week 43, 2023) and peaking at 18067 (Week 46, 2023) before slightly decreasing to 15980 (Week 47, 2023). This pattern shows a sharp rise in ILI activity from Week 43 to Week 46, followed by a marginal decline in Week 47, suggesting heightened flu activity during this period.
2. A clear positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences. The consistent climb in Weeks 44–46, 2023, mirrors the rise in ILI cases to 26712 in Week 52, 2023. This upward movement in the past weeks provided a strong indicator of the amplified activity seen later.
3. The rising outpatient visits for respiratory illness (ILI) reflect the progression. Weekly percentages increased from 2.7% (Week 43) to 3.9% (Week 47), consistently exceeding the baseline of 2.9% by Week 45. Additionally, high positivity rates for respiratory specimens (rising from 1.9% in Week 43 to 6.2% in Week 47) indicate amplified ILI activity contributing to the reported rise.
4. Hospitalization rates, reflecting severe cases, also saw a steep rise, from 0.8 per 100,000 (Week 43) to 3.7 per 100,000 (Week 47), with significant increases among elderly adults (65+ years). This surge aligns with increasing ILI activity reported in subsequent weeks.
5. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2, highlighted in all weeks, exacerbated the rise in ILI occurrences. Coinfections likely contributed to both the increased severity and widespread distribution of ILI cases, intensifying the trend toward Week 52, 2023.
6. Overall, the escalation to 26712 occurrences in Week 52, 2023, is primarily driven by the observed rising trend in past ILI cases, increasing ILI outpatient visits, elevated positivity rates in respiratory specimens, surging hospitalization rates for severe cases, and compounding impacts of co-circulating respiratory viruses.
