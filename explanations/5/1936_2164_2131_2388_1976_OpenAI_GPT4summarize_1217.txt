1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed fluctuating but consistently high activity, with values of ['1936', '2164', '2131', '2388', '1976']. An increase from 1936 (Week32, 2021) to 2164 (Week33, 2021) was followed by slight declines to 2131 (Week34, 2021), then peaked at 2388 (Week35, 2021) before dropping to 1976 (Week36, 2021). This overall pattern suggests varied respiratory illness activity, influenced by contributing factors such as non-influenza viruses or healthcare-seeking behavior changes.
2. A positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the highest recorded activity at 2388 during Week35, 2021, and subsequent fluctuations hint at a sustained plateau in respiratory illness activity. This led to a stabilization seen in the future occurrence of 2230 after 5 weeks (Week41, 2021). Consistent trends observed during Weeks32 to 36 align with this outcome.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed steady levels below the national baseline, with percentages ranging from 0.9% to 2.3% across Weeks32 to 36, 2021. Regions like 4 and 9 exceeded regional baselines, and age groups (0-4 and 5-24) drove increased ILI visits, indicating localized surges aligned with the reported rise to 2230 in the future.
4. Respiratory illness mortality, particularly from pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), remained extremely high, peaking at 21.0% (Week36, 2021), far above epidemic thresholds. Minimal influenza activity within this high PIC context reflects significant contributions from other respiratory illnesses, sustaining elevated ILI occurrences despite low influenza positivity.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted ILI surveillance interpretations, as noted across all summaries. These changes likely contributed to delayed recognition or misclassification of respiratory illnesses, amplifying non-specific ILI reporting seen in future data.
6. Extremely low influenza positivity rates (0.1% in Weeks34–36, 2021), alongside concurrent circulation of other respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2, suggest that most ILI cases resulted from non-influenza pathogens. The compounded effects of non-specific respiratory illness activity contributed to the stabilization of ILI occurrences at 2230 in Week41, 2021.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2230 (Week41, 2021) can be attributed to fluctuating and regionally elevated ILI activity in Weeks32–36, increasing outpatient visits driven by specific age groups, persistently high PIC mortalities primarily due to non-influenza viruses, and pandemic-era disruptions to healthcare-seeking and surveillance systems. This confluence of factors led to sustained respiratory illness levels observed in the future.
