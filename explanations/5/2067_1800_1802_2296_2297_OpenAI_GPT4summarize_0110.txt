1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week41 to Week45, 2021 are 2067, 1800, 1802, 2296, and 2297. Initially, the trend showed a slight decrease from Week41 (2067) to Week42 (1800) and Week43 (1802). Starting in Week44 (2296) and Week45 (2297), a noticeable increase occurred, signifying the beginning of a growth pattern. This suggests a transition from a stable or declining phase to a gradual increase reflecting early seasonal activity.
2. Week50, 2021 falls within the peak season in the U.S., typically spanning from Week46 of a given year to about Week6 of the following year. The steady rise in ILI activity during Week44 and Week45, 2021 coupled with ongoing influenza drivers aligns with the expected peak season classification.
3. Historical patterns indicate a transitionary rise in the final weeks before consistent peak activity. The slight increase starting at Week44 aligns with precedent for peak season trends. Additionally, Week50 projections account for the observed growth in ILI counts beyond the baseline (2.5%) despite being early in the peak season, resulting in a time-series forecast reaching 3957 ILI occurrences.
4. Rising influenza positivity rates among both clinical (0.1% in Week41 to 0.7% in Week45; Week41 #1 and Week45 #1) and public health labs (Week43 #1 and Week44 #1) indicate increasing viral circulation, driven by Influenza A (H3N2).
5. Vaccination distribution steadily increased, with 162.5M flu vaccine doses delivered as of Week45 (Week45 #8). However, the uptake rate remains uncertain, and vaccine impact appears insufficient to curtail the steady rise in cases (Week44 #8).
6. COVID-19 co-circulation and broader respiratory virus activity continue to modify healthcare-seeking behavior and impact traditional ILI surveillance (Week41 #10, Week43 #10, Week45 #10). These trends likely amplify ILI occurrences during peak flu season despite flu-specific positivity being moderate.
7. In summary, the increasing positivity rates, the early upward ILI trend evidenced from Week44 and Week45, the confirmed beginning of peak season for Week50, 2021, and the impact of both low vaccination trends and co-circulating viruses support the forecast of 3957 ILI occurrences during Week50, 2021.
