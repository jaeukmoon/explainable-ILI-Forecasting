1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating but predominantly stable trend with values of ['1093', '990', '914', '1013', '975']. After an initial decline from 1093 (Week 5, 2021) to 914 (Week 7, 2021), a moderate increase to 1013 (Week 8, 2021) occurred, followed by a slight drop to 975 (Week 9, 2021). This pattern indicates relative stability in ILI occurrences, with no significant escalation or dramatic declines throughout the period.
2. There appears to be a positive correlation between past ILI occurrences stabilizing around the 900–1000 range during Weeks 7–9, 2021, and future occurrences peaking at 1496, indicating an eventual delayed ILI increase. The change aligns with the broader unpredictability of ILI activity influenced by the report findings.
3. Pediatric ILI trends displayed slight increases in children aged 0–4 years over the past eight weeks (Week 9, 2021). This age-specific growth likely contributed to the spike in future occurrences, reflecting demographic-specific vulnerability. Consistent low but increasing positivity in clinical specimens, including 0.1% and slight shifts in Influenza A and B distributions, suggest gradually evolving influenza activity impacting future numbers. Deaths caused by pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained significantly high (e.g., 22.3% in Week 6 to 14.6% by Week 9, 2021), highlighting sustained respiratory health strain that could catalyze future ILI numbers due to heightened illness burden.
4. Pandemic-induced disruptions to healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI surveillance as consistently noted (e.g., healthcare access variability highlighted in Week 7, 2021) have compounded challenges in accurately tracking ongoing case trends. The resulting delayed recognition and compounded activity likely contributed to the reported future surge to 1496 ILI occurrences.
5. In summary, the reported 1496 future ILI occurrences (Week 14, 2021) likely stem from pediatric-specific increases in ILI activity, sustained PIC-associated mortality rates reflecting respiratory stress, evolving albeit minimal influenza positivity trends, and pandemic-related alterations influencing surveillance and reporting systems. This combination of demographic trends, environmental health strains, and broader systemic impacts helped drive the observed future spike.
