1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited an overall increasing trend, with values of ['1478', '1424', '1468', '1532', '1817']. Initially, there was a slight decline from 1478 (Week28, 2023) to 1424 (Week29, 2023), followed by a consistent increase over subsequent weeks, culminating in the highest count of 1817 in Week32, 2023. This rising pattern reflects increasing ILI activity as the weeks progressed.
2. A strong positive correlation between past ILI activity and future occurrences is evident, as the continuous escalation in ILI counts through Weeks 30–32, 2023, aligns with the significant rise to 3455 future occurrences after 5 weeks. The steep rise at the end of the observation period suggests an upward trajectory that likely contributed to the amplified ILI activity in the future data.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased slightly from 1.2% (Week28, 2023) to 1.3% (Week32, 2023), consistently remaining below the national baseline. However, higher percentages of visits among children aged 0-4 years, peaking at 4.4% in Week32, indicate vulnerable age groups driving healthcare-seeking behaviors. This trend supports the observed rise in future ILI occurrences.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded or met the epidemic threshold, ranging from 5.6% in Week29 to 6.1% in Week32, 2023. This persistent elevation in respiratory-related mortality indicates heightened respiratory illness activity possibly correlating with the spike in ILI occurrences to 3455 after 5 weeks.
5. The continuous co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, including influenza (dominated by Influenza A H1N1), SARS-CoV-2, and RSV during Weeks28–32, 2023, likely contributed to increased respiratory illness activity. The surge in hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed influenza, rising from 573 (Week29, 2023) to 677 (Week32, 2023), further aligns with enhanced ILI activity in future weeks.
6. In summary, the significant rise to 3455 future ILI occurrences (after Week32, 2023) can be attributed to the steady upward trend in past ILI occurrences, increased ILI outpatient visits among vulnerable age groups, persistently elevated PIC-related deaths, and the combined impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses, which collectively intensified respiratory illness activity.
