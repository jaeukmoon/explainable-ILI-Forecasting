1. The ILI occurrences from Week53, 2020 to Week4, 2021 are 1060, 1115, 916, 783, and 757, showing a consistently decreasing trend across five weeks. This decline reflects a reduction in ILI activity, with no sharp spikes or fluctuations observed.
2. Week9, 2021 falls into the off-season, following the peak season that typically ends around Week6 in the U.S. The ongoing suppression of influenza activity (Week1, 2021 #4; Week2, 2021 #4) and below-baseline outpatient ILI rates confirm low influenza transmission, consistent with off-season dynamics.
3. Based on historical trends, the consistent decline in ILI counts over the past five weeks suggests that the ILI activity will stabilize at relatively lower levels in the coming weeks. The time-series trend points toward a projection of continued low activity, resulting in a forecast of 539 ILI occurrences for Week9, 2021.
4. Flu activity is unusually low, with the percentage of positive influenza specimens remaining far below typical seasonal norms (Week53, 2020 #1; Week1, 2021 #1; Week4, 2021 #1).
5. Ongoing impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, which alter healthcare-seeking behaviors and suppress influenza circulation, have severely reduced overall ILI activity across the nation (Week53, 2020 #9; Week1, 2021 #9; Week4, 2021 #8).
6. Despite CDC warnings about potential increases, the stable or declining trend in outpatient ILI visits below the national baseline (Week53, 2020 #4; Week2, 2021 #4; Week4, 2021 #3) suggests minimal immediate growth in ILI activity.
7. The forecasted 539 ILI occurrences in Week9, 2021 reflect the observed consistent decline in ILI counts, influenza suppression due to COVID-19, below-baseline ILI visits, and alignment with off-season timing. These combined factors indicate sustained low ILI activity.
