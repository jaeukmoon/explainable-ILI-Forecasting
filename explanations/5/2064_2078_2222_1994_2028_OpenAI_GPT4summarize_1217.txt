1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated fluctuating trends with values ['2064', '2078', '2222', '1994', '2028']. There was an initial rise from 2064 (Week 48, 2020) to 2222 (Week 50, 2020), marking the highest value in the 5-week period. However, the following weeks saw a decline to 1994 (Week 51, 2020), followed by a slight recovery to 2028 (Week 52, 2020), suggesting overall variability with no sustained upward or downward trajectory.
2. A weak negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident as the highest value in the past data (2222, Week 50, 2020) is followed by a decline in future ILI occurrences to 1805 (5 weeks later in Week 5, 2021). This indicates that the fluctuating past trend did not directly predict an increase in future occurrences but instead aligns with reduced activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained stable at 1.6% through all 5 weeks, well below the national baseline of 2.6%. Minimal variability in outpatient ILI percentages suggests reduced influenza circulation, contributing to the drop in future ILI occurrences.
4. Persistent low influenza positivity rates were reported, including 0.1% (Week 48, 2020) to 0.3% (Weeks 50, 51, and 52, 2020), indicating limited influenza transmission during the observed period. This unusually low flu activity aligns with the reduced future ILI occurrences of 1805.
5. Impact of COVID-19 on healthcare-seeking behaviors, as emphasized in all CDC reports, likely led to changes in surveillance accuracy and healthcare access. The overlap of COVID-19 symptoms with influenza further reduced distinct ILI reporting, contributing to the observed decline in future occurrences.
6. Extensive COVID-19 mitigation strategies, such as masking and social distancing, were highlighted across all weeks as suppressing influenza transmission. These measures likely had a continued suppressive effect on future ILI occurrences, consistent with the 1805 observed.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1805 (Week 5, 2021) are attributed to the fluctuating past trend with no sustained increase, stable and below-baseline outpatient ILI visits, exceptionally low influenza activity during the observed period, shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors, and the mitigating effects of COVID-19 measures suppressing flu and other respiratory illnesses.
