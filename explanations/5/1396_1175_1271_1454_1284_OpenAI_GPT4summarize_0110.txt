1. The reported ILI counts from Week51, 2020 to Week2, 2021 are 1396, 1175, 1271, 1454, and 1284. The trend shows fluctuations with an initial drop from Week51, 2020 (1396) to Week52, 2020 (1175), followed by an increase in Week1, 2021 (1454). However, Week2, 2021 (1284) indicates a slight decline after the peak in Week1, 2021. Overall, the pattern reflects fluctuating activity without a sustained upward or strong downward trend.
2. Forecasting Week7, 2021 aligns with the off-season. Based on historical data, the U.S. peak season typically concludes around Week6 of the following year. During Week2, 2021, influenza activity remains well below baseline levels, supporting a classification as off-season.
3. The time-series data suggests that ILI occurrences remain relatively volatile but overall low. The dips and minor rises between weeks indicate an absence of a significant broader uptrend. Projecting this forward to Week7, 2021 anticipates a continued declining trend, consistent with subdued ILI activity during the off-season, justifying the forecast of 914.
4. Minimal influenza positivity is continually reported, with rates hovering at 0.1-0.4% (Week51, 2020 #1; Week52, 2020 #1; Week1, 2021 #1; Week2, 2021 #1), significantly below seasonal expectations. Suppressed influenza transmission and testing rates, despite high surveillance, align with lower ILI occurrences.
5. The ongoing presence of COVID-19 remains a key factor, impacting healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI reporting (Week51, 2020 #8; Week53, 2020 #9; Week2, 2021 #9). This results in reduced influenza-related hospitalizations (Week51, 2020 #6; Week1, 2021 #7; Week2, 2021 #5) and overall decreased ILI occurrences.
6. Influenza vaccination remains emphasized by the CDC, but detailed data on vaccine uptake is lacking (Week51, 2020 #7; Week1 #8; Week2 #8). Meanwhile, novel influenza strain appearance has been minimal, with only one A(H3N2)v variant case reported (Week53, 2020 #8).
7. Based on the observed decline in influenza positivity rates, low hospitalization and ILI percentages below baseline, overlapping effects of COVID-19, and the expected subdued activity during the off-season, the predicted ILI occurrence for Week7, 2021 of 914 reflects a continued low trend.
