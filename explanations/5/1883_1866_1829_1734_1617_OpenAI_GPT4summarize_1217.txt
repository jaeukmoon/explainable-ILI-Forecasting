1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values of ['1883', '1866', '1829', '1734', '1617']. Each week exhibited a gradual but steady decrease, with the sharpest drop between Week18, 2023 (1829) and Week20, 2023 (1617). This consistent downward trajectory reflects a general reduction in ILI activity over time, suggesting a declining pattern by the end of this period.
2. The declining trend in past ILI occurrences correlates with the significantly lower future ILI occurrence of 889 by Week25, 2023. The sustained decrease throughout the past period, particularly the rapid decline in Weeks19 and 20, mirrors the outcome of substantially reduced ILI activity after 5 weeks, reinforcing the predictive association between trends.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently below the national baseline of 2.5%, with rates ranging from 1.9% to 2.0% over Weeks16–20, 2023, indicating subdued community-level respiratory illness transmission. This stable and low activity level aligns directly with the reduced ILI occurrences of 889 in Week25, 2023. Deaths from pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) also exhibited a gradual decline across Weeks16–20, from 7.5% to 6.5%, signaling easing respiratory-related impacts, contributing to the reported drop in future ILI occurrences. The high antigenic similarity (98-100%) of influenza viruses to vaccine strains reported throughout Weeks16–20 underscores effective influenza control, reducing future ILI transmission.
4. Multiple reports highlight diminished influenza positivity rates during Weeks16–20, ranging from 0.8% to 1.1%, with no significant increases in virus detection or evolution. The co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, while noted, had minimal additional ILI impacts during this period due to stable trends and low levels of identified influence from these pathogens. Together, these factors supported the sustained reduction in ILI activity reflected in the future occurrences.
5. In summary, the reported 889 future ILI occurrences (Week25, 2023) can be attributed to the consistent decline in past ILI occurrences, decreasing outpatient ILI visit percentages, reduced PIC mortality rates, effective vaccine strain matching, low influenza positivity rates, and the limited impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses. These dynamics collectively explain the drop in ILI occurrences in the subsequent period.
