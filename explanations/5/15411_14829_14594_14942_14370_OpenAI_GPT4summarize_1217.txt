1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the studied 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but slight downward trend, with values of ['15411', '14829', '14594', '14942', '14370'] from Week9 to Week13, 2023. After an initial drop between Week9 (15411) and Week10 (14829), there was a small rebound in Week11 (14942) followed by another decline to Week13 (14370). This decline indicates an overall reduction in ILI activity despite minor short-term variations.
2. The decrease in ILI occurrences over the weeks correlates with the future value of 13095 reported after 5 weeks (Week18, 2023). The steady decline seen in Weeks12–13, 2023 provides a trajectory that aligns with the lower occurrence observed in Week18, suggesting that the reduction in ILI activity during the past 5 weeks set the stage for continued decline.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below the national baseline during the past 5 weeks, holding steady at 2.4% from Week9, 2023 to Week11, 2023 and slightly dropping to 2.3% by Week12 and Week13, 2023. This stability below baseline levels signifies subdued ILI trends contributing to the reduction to 13095 occurrences.
4. Cumulative influenza hospitalization rates showed moderate rates in vulnerable populations, with Week13, 2023 reporting 61.1 per 100,000 population, primarily affecting adults aged 65+. Despite this, weekly hospitalizations remained stable, indicating no significant surges in influenza severity that would elevate ILI values in future weeks.
5. Influenza activity consistently remained low over the observed weeks, with respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza ranging between 0.8% and 1.0%. Minimal virologic activity, combined with strong vaccine matches and antiviral effectiveness, limited potential influenza-related ILI surges. Co-circulating respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 contributed to reported cases but did not escalate influenza-specific trends, reinforcing the suppressed ILI activity leading to the decrease reported in Week18, 2023.
6. Deaths attributed to PIC remained stable but slightly above the epidemic threshold across Weeks9–13, 2023 (e.g., 8.9% in Week9 to 7.9% in Week13). The ongoing elevation in PIC mortality reflects the continued impact of respiratory pathogens, yet did not result in heightened ILI occurrences as it remained relatively consistent over time.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 13095 in Week18, 2023 are explained by the observed declining trend across the past 5 weeks, consistently reduced outpatient ILI visits below the national baseline, stable hospitalization rates, low virologic influenza activity with effective vaccinations, and steady PIC mortality levels. These factors collectively ensured a suppressed trajectory of ILI occurrences over the subsequent weeks.
