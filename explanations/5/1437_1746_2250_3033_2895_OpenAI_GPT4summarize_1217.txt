1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a sharp initial increase followed by a decline in the last week. The values rose significantly from 1437 (Week 50, 2021) to 3033 (Week 52, 2021), representing a twofold increase, but then decreased slightly to 2895 in Week 1, 2022, marking the highest levels of ILI activity before the drop. This pattern reflects heightened transmission in Weeks 50–52, 2021, followed by a potential plateau or early signs of a decline in Week 1, 2022.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent as the sustained elevation and peak during the past weeks (Week 52, 2021–Week 1, 2022) transitions sharply to significantly lower occurrences (870) five weeks later (Week 7, 2022). The drop suggests waning transmission or seasonality after the initial high levels.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased progressively, peaking at 4.8% during Week 52, 2021, before declining to 3.5% in Week 2, 2022. This pattern aligns with the decreasing trend observed in future occurrences, suggesting reduced healthcare-seeking for respiratory illness over time.
4. Mortality attributed to PIC steadily increased, exceeding epidemic thresholds, reaching 25.5% in Week 2, 2022, primarily driven by non-influenza-related deaths (e.g., COVID-19). While influenza contributed minimally, the overall burden on healthcare systems may have reduced focus on tracking and reporting ILI occurrences, influencing the decline in future data.
5. Lower flu vaccination uptake reported throughout the observed period likely contributed to sustained transmission during Weeks 50, 2021, to Week 1, 2022. However, eventual behavioral adaptation (e.g., increased vaccination or immunity development) may explain the significant drop in future ILI levels.
6. In summary, the future decline to 870 ILI occurrences (Week 7, 2022) results from reduced outpatient visits, saturation of transmission by Week 2, 2022, the declining trend in PIC-related deaths, and increased immunity or vaccination effect, contrasting the earlier peak during Weeks 50–52, 2021.
