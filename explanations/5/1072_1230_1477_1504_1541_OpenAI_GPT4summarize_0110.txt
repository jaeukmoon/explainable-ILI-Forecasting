1. The reported ILI counts from Week28 to Week32, 2021 are 1072, 1230, 1477, 1504, and 1541 respectively. The trend shows a consistent week-over-week increase, with a notable rise between Week28 and Week32. This steady growth suggests a gradual escalation in activity, predominantly driven by respiratory illnesses.
2. Based on the timing, Week37, 2021 occurs within the Peak onset season, as it falls between Week32 and Week46. The data from Week28 to Week32, 2021 indicates increasing ILI activity, consistent with the period before peak transmission. This aligns with the classification for the Peak onset season.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the consistent upward trend in ILI counts over the past five weeks, combined with the progression toward the Peak onset season, suggests that ILI occurrences will continue to increase. Projecting forward, this pattern anticipates a value of 1887 for Week37, 2021, reflecting continued growth with a slight deceleration.
4. Influenza activity during Week28 to Week32, 2021 has remained minimal, with ILI increases primarily attributed to other respiratory viruses such as COVID-19 (Week28, 2021 #1, #4; Week30, 2021 #7). This broader circulation of respiratory pathogens contributes to overall higher ILI rates.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behavior and alternative care settings, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, have affected the interpretation of ILI data (Week28, 2021 #6; Week30, 2021 #8; Week32, 2021 #8). This complicates accurate detection trends but does not negate clear evidence of rising ILI activity.
6. The novel Influenza A(H1N2)v cases reported in Week32, 2021, though limited to swine exposure without human-to-human transmission, point to potential localized influences that could interact with other factors to increase ILI reports (Week32, 2021 #2, #9).
7. The steady increase in ILI activity in all age groups, particularly younger populations such as ages 5–24 and 25–49, throughout Week29 to Week32, 2021, indicates rising outpatient visits and overall transmission dynamics (Week29, 2021 #2; Week31, 2021 #3; Week32, 2021 #3). This reinforces expectations for continued growth up to the forecasted value of 1887 for Week37, 2021.
