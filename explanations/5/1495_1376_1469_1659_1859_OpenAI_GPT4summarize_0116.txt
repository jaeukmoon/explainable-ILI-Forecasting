1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks (Week25, 2021 to Week29, 2021) show an increasing trend: 1495, 1376, 1469, 1659, and 1859. Starting with a decrease from Week25 to Week26 (1495 to 1376), the trend reverses to sustained increases in subsequent weeks, with this upward momentum driven by gradual rises in outpatient respiratory illness visits and increased ILI reports in younger age groups (notably 0–4 and 5–24). Calculating the weekly growth rates shows 7.5% (Week26 to Week27), 12.9% (Week27 to Week28), and 12.0% (Week28 to Week29). Using these rates, a compound growth factor is applied to estimate Week34 occurrences. Taking the Week29 value of 1859 and applying the average weekly growth rate of ~10.8% over five weeks: 1859 × (1 + 0.108)^5 ≈ 3178.
2. Week34, 2021 falls into the Peak onset season. According to U.S. trends, the Peak onset season generally spans Week32 to Week46, where ILI activity begins to climb as flu season ramps up toward its peak. During this time, transmission intensity increases, aligning with historical data where gradual increases in ILI occurrences after Week31 are observed. This seasonal context supports projecting elevated ILI values during the target week.
3. Past trends and time-series patterns suggest that historical growth rates in recent weeks provide a reliable foundation for forecasting. The average weekly increase of 10.8% observed from Week26 to Week29 helps establish realistic projections for Week34, 2021. Modeling based on this historical behavior where ILI growth accelerates during the Peak onset season supports the calculation outlined above. Additionally, aggregated positivity rates for respiratory illnesses (e.g., slight increases in ILI visits across multiple jurisdictions) further substantiate this trend.
4. From the CDC reports:
1. Nationwide surveillance shows an increasing trend in ILI-related outpatient visits (e.g., Week29, 2021), particularly in younger age groups that represent key drivers of transmission. This explains the amplified growth rate incorporated into forecasting.
2. Minimal overall influenza positivity in virologic testing was observed, but gradual increases in respiratory illness-associated deaths and outpatient respiratory visits hint at potential co-circulation effects of other infectious agents (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) that can indirectly elevate ILI. These factors contribute to the upward adjustment in projections.
3. The seasonal timing and Peak onset phase historically exhibit heightened ILI activity, driven by increased transmission dynamics and public health reporting, despite challenges in accurate influenza surveillance attributed to altered healthcare-seeking behaviors.
5. In conclusion, the predicted ILI occurrence for Week34, 2021 is 3178. This figure accounts for the long-term increasing trend, guided by historical time-series patterns (with a compounded growth rate of ~10.8%) and corroborated by gradual increases in outpatient visit rates and seasonal effects indicating entry into the Peak onset season. These factors, alongside the influence of broader respiratory illness-related dynamics during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, justify the calculated forecast.
