1. The ILI counts from Week7 to Week11, 2024, demonstrate a consistently declining trend, starting high at 16987 in Week7 and reducing steadily to 15334 by Week11. The absence of significant fluctuations or spikes suggests a gradual ebbing of ILI activity over this period rather than abrupt changes.
2. Given that Week16, 2024, occurs after the typical peak season (Week46 to Week6) and aligns with the off-season classification (Week9 to Week30, based on historical patterns), Week16 falls into the off-season period.
3. Time-series analysis of the past five weeks points to a continued decline in ILI occurrences as the season transitions from higher to lower activity levels. This downward trend, combined with the expected off-season stability, supports a forecast of 12541 cases by Week16, projecting marginal reductions over the next five weeks.
4. Influenza activity is decreasing nationally, as indicated by declining outpatient ILI visits (Week10 #4, Week11 #6), reduced positivity rates in clinical labs (Week9 #1; Week11 #2), and hospitalizations trending downward (Week10 #6).
5. Co-circulating viruses such as RSV and COVID-19 complicate the respiratory illness landscape (Week9 #10; Week10 #11; Week11 #10) but do not appear to drive additional surges in ILI as influenza cases decrease.
6. Continued vaccination recommendations and low antiviral resistance rates (Week9 #9; Week10 #8; Week11 #8) enhance disease prevention and management, likely contributing to the gradual waning of ILI cases.
7. In summary, the steady downward trend in ILI counts, seasonal classification as the off-season, declining influenza activity metrics, co-circulating viruses with no sharp ILI spike, and effective vaccination coverage collectively support the forecast of 12541 ILI occurrences for Week16, 2024.
