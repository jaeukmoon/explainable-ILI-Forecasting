1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but generally increasing trend, with values of ['1223', '1170', '1408', '1325', '1437']. Although there was a slight dip from 1223 (Week46, 2021) to 1170 (Week47, 2021), the numbers rose significantly to 1408 (Week48, 2021), followed by a minor decrease to 1325 (Week49, 2021). However, a final spike to 1437 (Week50, 2021) indicates a steady upward trajectory in ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period, showcasing an overall escalation in respiratory illness activity.
2. A clear correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the surging trends toward the latter weeks (Weeks48-50, 2021) align with the eventual rise to 2331 future occurrences (Week5, 2022). The steady increase from Week48 onward likely acted as a precursor to the amplified ILI activity observed after 5 weeks, reflecting a sustained upward momentum.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI saw a consistent rise over the weeks, moving from 2.2% (Week46, 2021) to 3.1% (Week50, 2021), surpassing the national baseline of 2.5% during the final week. This upward trend in ILI-related healthcare encounters underscores the growing intensity of respiratory illnesses, directly influencing the significant future increase in reported occurrences.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, rising from 14.5% (Week46, 2021) to 18.8% (Week50, 2021), predominantly driven by COVID-19. This persistent PIC mortality reflects heightened respiratory illness prevalence, correlating with the future surge in ILI occurrences.
5. Increasing hospitalizations related to influenza were evident, beginning with 356 cases (Week46, 2021) and progressing to 1057 cases (Week49, 2021), demonstrating escalating severe outcomes linked to flu infections. This notable rise aligns with the eventual jump to 2331 future ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2) alongside increasing influenza positivity rates, from 1.0% (Week46, 2021) to 5.6% (Week50, 2021), likely contributed to the compounding burden of ILI. These patterns suggest a synergistic impact leading to the reported future amplification of ILI cases.
7. In summary, the reported 2331 future ILI occurrences (Week5, 2022) can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks48-50, 2021, rising ILI-related outpatient visits surpassing the baseline, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, escalating influenza hospitalizations, and the co-circulation of respiratory viruses accelerating ILI prevalence.
