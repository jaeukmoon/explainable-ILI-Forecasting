1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['2017', '1757', '1636', '1587', '1425']. Each week shows a steady decline in ILI activity from 2017 in Week 21, 2024, to 1425 in Week 25, 2024, indicating an overall reduction in respiratory illness activity leading up to Week 25, 2024.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is suggested, as the consistent decline in ILI occurrences over the past weeks (Weeks 21–25, 2024) aligns with the stabilized but low future occurrence of 1469 after 5 weeks (Week 30, 2024). This suggests that while there is some decline, the future value stabilizes due to external influences or reduced seasonal variations.
3. Low national influenza positivity rates were observed in clinical labs, decreasing from 1.7% in Week 21, 2024, to 1.1% in Week 25, 2024. Meanwhile, outpatient ILI-related visits also decreased gradually from 1.9% (Week 21, 2024) to 1.5% (Week 25, 2024), consistently below the national baseline each week. These factors indicate reduced flu activity contributing to the low future occurrence of 1469. The contribution of multiple respiratory viruses (including RSV and SARS-CoV-2) remains a multifactorial influence, reflecting low but sustained respiratory illness activity despite declining trends.
4. Pediatric influenza-associated deaths remained low but stable, increasing from 172 in Week 21, 2024, to 181 in Week 25, 2024. This consistent but minimal change indicates ongoing illness activity at low levels, which may have influenced the reported future ILI occurrences. Low weekly hospitalization rates for ILI (0.1–0.2 per 100,000 population) throughout the period reiterate the manageable severity of flu activity, aligning with the observed stabilization.
5. Seasonal influenza activity across Weeks 21–25, 2024, remained low, with circulating viruses (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Victoria) displaying high antigenic similarity to vaccine strains and minimal resistance to antiviral drugs. These factors, alongside significant co-circulation of respiratory viruses, contributed to stable yet low future occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 1469 future ILI occurrences (Week 30, 2024) can be attributed to the consistent downward trend in past occurrences, low outpatient ILI activity, manageable flu severity reflected by low positivity, mortality, and hospitalization rates, as well as stable seasonal patterns amid co-circulating respiratory viruses.
