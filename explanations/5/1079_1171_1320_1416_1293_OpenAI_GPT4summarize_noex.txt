1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrence trend over the past five weeks shows fluctuating values: 1079 → 1171 → 1320 → 1416 → 1293. After steady increases for four weeks, the latest week shows a slight decline in cases. This suggests a potential transition period where activity may stabilize or decrease slightly before future occurrences.
2. Week None (after five weeks) belongs to the Off-season, characterized by minimal ILI activity. Flu activity remains unusually low for this time of year (Week47, 2020), influenced by external pandemic-related factors, and there is no indication of entering a peak onset season.
3. Historical correlation indicates ILI occurrences fluctuating around a declining trend, reflected in values moving from 1416 (Week46, 2020) to 1293 (Week47, 2020). The projected future trend aligns with this pattern, with activity stabilizing near but slightly above baseline levels, resulting in the forecasted value of 1069.
4. The following three distinct factors from CDC reports strongly influence the forecast:
5. - Current influenza activity is unusually low as of Week47, 2020, with clinical lab positivity at only 0.2% and ILI visits below the national baseline (Week47, 2020).
6. - Healthcare-seeking behavior remains reduced due to COVID-19, complicating traditional ILI data analysis and contributing to lower than typical ILI occurrences during this period (Week43–47, 2020).
7. - Minimal influenza virus circulation detected by both clinical and public health labs indicates a decline in flu activity and no indication of a significant increase in the near term (Week43–47, 2020).
5. In summary, the projected ILI occurrences of 1069 after five weeks reflect a continuation of the declining trend observed in the past five weeks. This is in line with ongoing low flu activity, disruptions in data accuracy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and minimal influenza virus circulation across regions. Together, these factors justify the prediction within the Off-season timeframe.
