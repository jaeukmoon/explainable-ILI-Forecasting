1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited an overall increasing trend, with values of ['1227', '1208', '1476', '1629', '2035']. Despite a slight drop from 1227 (Week 34, 2023) to 1208 (Week 35, 2023), the occurrences steadily rose in the following weeks, peaking at 2035 in Week 38, 2023. This consistent escalation reflects sustained growth in ILI activity over time.
2. The rising trajectory from 1476 in Week 36, 2023, to 2035 in Week 38, 2023, indicates a positive correlation with the future ILI occurrence of 2464 in Week 43, 2023. The momentum observed in the last 3 weeks suggests a continuation of the upward trend, which likely contributed to the increase in occurrences after 5 weeks.
3. Hospitalizations for influenza progressively increased, with 779 (Week 34, 2023), 509 (Week 35, 2023), 775 (Week 36, 2023), 820 (Week 37, 2023), and 880 (Week 38, 2023). This steady growth of flu-related severe cases mirrors the corresponding ILI rise. Deaths reported from pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed epidemic thresholds, ranging from 6.5% in Week 34, 2023, to 7.2% in Week 38, 2023, indicating elevated respiratory illness burdens that reflect higher future ILI activity. Outpatient ILI visits demonstrated a slight increase, from 1.7% (Week 34, 2023) to 2.0% (Week 38, 2023). Pediatric ILI rates, persistently high between 5.8% and 6.8%, further highlight significant ILI contributions to future increases.
4. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, were consistently mentioned across Weeks 34–38, 2023, as contributors to ILI trends. These overlapping pathogens compounded overall respiratory illnesses. Shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors during this period, as highlighted in Week 35, 2023, and the expansion of alternative care settings, likely influenced ILI activity reporting and contributed to higher observed occurrences. The persistence of Influenza A (majority H1N1) as the dominant subtype among positives, alongside Influenza B Victoria lineage detections, reflects a viral environment potentially amplifying future ILI cases.
5. In summary, the reported 2464 future ILI occurrences (Week 43, 2023) can be attributed to the escalating trend in past ILI occurrences, increasing hospitalizations and PIC-related mortality, rising outpatient ILI percentages with notable pediatric contributions, concurrent circulation of other respiratory viruses, and healthcare-seeking adjustments that, together, culminated in the observed future surge.
