1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a steady decrease, with values of ['1695', '1661', '1621', '1402', '1451']. Weeks 49 (2020) to 52 (2020) displayed a consistent decline in ILI activity, dropping from 1695 in Week 49 to 1402 in Week 52, before a slight rebound to 1451 in Week 53. This pattern reflects an overall downward trend in ILI occurrences during the observed 5-week period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the overall decline during the observed 5-week data period (Weeks 49–53, 2020) aligns with the reported significant decrease to 812 future occurrences after 5 weeks, reflecting a sustained reduction in ILI activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently low at 1.6% across Weeks 49–53 (2020), staying well below the national baseline of 2.6%. This stability in low outpatient ILI proportions indicates subdued ILI activity, supporting the reduced future occurrences. Minimal ILI activity trends, with only one jurisdiction reporting moderate activity in Week 50, underscore the decreasing ILI burden.
4. PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) deaths consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, with weekly percentages ranging from 13.3% to 14.5% during Weeks 49–53 (2020), largely driven by COVID-19. However, as influenza-related activity remained low during this time, the PIC mortality data reflects reduced contributions from non-COVID-19 respiratory illnesses, correlating with the lower future ILI count.
5. The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare-seeking behaviors significantly impacted surveillance systems, as documented in Weeks 49–53 (2020). Changes in healthcare utilization likely reduced ILI reporting and skewed data interpretation, contributing to the marked drop to 812 future occurrences. Low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.2% in Week 49 and 0.1% in Week 53) and declining influenza-associated hospitalizations (61 in Week 49 to 118 by Week 53) further reinforce the atypically low ILI activity.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 812 after Week 53, 2020, can be attributed to the overall downward trend in past ILI data, persistently low outpatient visit percentages for ILI, minimal influenza activity with declining positivity rates and hospitalizations, high but COVID-19-dominated PIC deaths, and pandemic-driven alterations in healthcare-seeking behaviors that suppressed ILI reporting.
