1. The ILI occurrences from Week6, 2022 to Week10, 2022 were 1644, 1493, 1401, 1559, and 1593. The data shows an initial decline from Week6 to Week8, followed by a gradual increase in Week9 and Week10. This trend indicates fluctuating but relatively stable activity, with no sharp spikes or significant declines.
2. Considering that Week15, 2022 occurs after the typical U.S. peak season (which usually ends around Week6) and before the peak onset season (beginning around Week35), it aligns with the off-season. Hence, Week15, 2022 forecasts belong to the off-season, characterized by reduced community transmission and minimal influenza activity.
3. The observed historical pattern demonstrates fluctuations with no sustained increases, suggesting that ILI counts are likely to grow modestly and plateau around Week15, 2022. A time-series model projecting forward from Week10, 2022 would anticipate slight increases in ILI occurrences, influenced by sporadic influenza activity.
4. Influenza positivity rates increased steadily from Week6 (3.0%) to Week10 (6.8%), reflecting a rise in flu transmission despite being below national baselines for outpatient respiratory visits (Week6 #3; Week9 #4; Week10 #4).
5. Low vaccination rates compared to prior seasons may have contributed to ongoing, albeit non-peak, transmission, as vaccine uptake was consistently reported as suboptimal (Week6 #8; Week7 #8; Week10 #10). Antigenic mismatches in dominant Influenza A(H3N2) strains further undermined vaccine effectiveness (Week7 #7; Week9 #5; Week10 #9).
6. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and others, caused overlapping impacts on ILI trends. However, co-infection rates remained low, and no novel influenza spread was reported (Week7 #9; Week9 #9; Week10 #12).
7. In summary, the predicted occurrence of 2104 ILI cases in Week15, 2022 is consistent with the observed trends of moderate fluctuations, the off-season classification, and CDC's insights highlighting increasing flu positivity, low vaccination uptake, and antigenic mismatches in H3N2 viruses. These factors collectively suggest a modest rise in ILI cases compared to Week10, 2022, without reaching peak season intensities.
