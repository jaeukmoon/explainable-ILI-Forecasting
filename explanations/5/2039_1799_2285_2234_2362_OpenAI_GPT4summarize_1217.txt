1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating pattern with an upward tendency toward the end, with values of ['2039', '1799', '2285', '2234', '2362']. There was an initial decline from 2039 (Week26, 2024) to 1799 (Week27, 2024), followed by an increase to 2285 (Week28, 2024). While there was a minor dip to 2234 (Week29, 2024), the values rose again to 2362 (Week30, 2024), marking a steady rise toward the end of the observed period, signaling potential future increases.
2. A positive association exists between the past and future ILI data, where the gradual escalation in ILI occurrences during Weeks 28–30, 2024, aligns with the surge in future ILI occurrences to 3954 after 5 weeks. The steady rise observed in the later weeks of the 5-week period clearly correlates with the observed increase in future cases.
3. ILI outpatient visits stabilized at 1.4% from Week26–Week29, 2024, then slightly rose to 1.5% by Week30, 2024, below baseline but indicative of increasing illness activity impacting the future ILI increase. Weekly influenza-associated hospitalization rates, while low at 0.1 per 100,000 from Week26 to Week30, 2024, were predominantly associated with influenza A, previously known for higher transmission potential. Surveillance highlighted co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, across all weeks, contributing to compounded illness spread, which likely influenced the sharp rise in future ILI. Influenza antigenic similarity to vaccine strains and minimal antiviral resistance seen throughout suggests predictable viral activity, but the presence of sporadic novel A(H5N1) cases in Weeks26–29, 2024, may have heightened zoonotic and general respiratory transmission risks, driving ILI occurrences.
4. Respiratory illness trends remained steady but showed increasing viral co-circulation and illness risks, with outpatient ILI, hospitalization data, and surveillance reinforcing this. The notable viral interaction and gradual rises in past data suggest the reasons for this amplified future uptick.
5. The future ILI occurrence of 3954 can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks 28–30, rising outpatient ILI visits, compounded impacts from co-circulating respiratory viruses (COVID-19, RSV), and the rising risks associated with avian influenza cases and regional illness vulnerabilities identified in public health records.
