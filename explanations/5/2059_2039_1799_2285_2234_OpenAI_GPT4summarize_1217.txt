1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a mixed trend with values ['2059', '2039', '1799', '2285', '2234']. Initially, there was a slight decrease from 2059 (Week25, 2024) to 2039 (Week26, 2024), further declining to 1799 (Week27, 2024), the lowest value during this period. This was followed by an increase to 2285 (Week28, 2024) and 2234 (Week29, 2024). Although there was a rebound in the latter weeks, the overall trend remained variable, reflecting fluctuating respiratory illness dynamics.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences can be observed. The rise in ILI activity in the last two weeks of the past data (Week28 and Week29, 2024) corresponds to the future surge to 3408 occurrences (Week34, 2024). The notable increase at Week28 serves as a precursor to elevated ILI levels after 5 weeks, indicating a delayed yet correlated upward trajectory.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed stabilization at 1.4% across Weeks27 to 29, 2024, after initially decreasing from 1.5% (Week25, 2024) to 1.4% (Week26, 2024). While below baseline, this steady activity suggests ongoing respiratory illnesses that could have contributed to the significant increase in future occurrences.
4. Influenza-related deaths were consistently reported week-over-week, including pediatric influenza-associated deaths (3 in Week25, 3 in Week26, 2 in Week27, and 2 in Week28, 2024). Although stable at 0.1% mortality, such consistent fatal outcomes signal potential underlying illness dynamics that may have culminated in the future surge.
5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, RSV, and seasonal influenza (evident across all weeks), compounded by sporadic occurrences of novel influenza cases (e.g., A(H1N2)v and A(H5)), likely contributed to the observed variability and subsequent amplification of future ILI occurrences to 3408 by Week34, 2024.
6. In summary, the reported increase to 3408 ILI occurrences (Week34, 2024) aligns with the upward movement in Weeks28–29, 2024, stabilization of outpatient ILI visits, persistent influenza-related deaths, and the combined impact of co-circulating respiratory pathogens. These factors collectively contributed to the sharp rise after 5 weeks.
