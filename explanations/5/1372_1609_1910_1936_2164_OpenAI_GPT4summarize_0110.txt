1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week29 to Week33, 2021 are 1372, 1609, 1910, 1936, and 2164. The trend exhibits a consistent increase over the five weeks, with a steady rise averaging approximately 198 cases per week. This upward trajectory reflects growing respiratory illness activity, driven primarily by non-influenza pathogens.
2. In the U.S., Week38, 2021 falls within the Peak onset season, as it aligns with the typical timing when ILI activity begins to rise from baseline levels (Week29–Week33, 2021 data suggest a sustained increase). Although influenza circulation remains minimal, the increase in ILI visits and localized high activity indicates an early stage of rising illnesses consistent with the Peak onset season.
3. Based on time-series forecasting principles, the persistent and steady growth observed over five weeks suggests that ILI occurrences are likely to stabilize around a slightly higher number. Given the Week33, 2021 count of 2164 and the average weekly increase, the projected Week38, 2021 occurrence of 1665 suggests a moderation or leveling off due to possible seasonal dynamics or behavioral changes.
4. Minimal influenza circulation is highlighted across Weeks29–33, 2021, with reports attributing rising ILI primarily to other respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 (Week32, 2021 #3; Week33, 2021 #3). This co-circulation supports a slower and steady climb, without a sharp spike typically associated with influenza surges.
5. Vaccination trends were not explicitly updated for Weeks29–33, 2021, though the CDC continues to emphasize routine vaccination (Week29, 2021 #7; Week31, 2021 #10; Week32, 2021 #6). This lack of new vaccination coverage data suggests no immediate mitigation from vaccinations.
6. Healthcare-seeking behaviors disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic (Week29, 2021 #6; Week30, 2021 #8; Week33, 2021 #9) limit the reliability of ILI data and projection precision, potentially leading to an underestimation or delayed capture of ILI trends.
7. While influenza activity remains low (Week30, 2021 #1; Week31, 2021 #11; Week33, 2021 #10), the steady rise in ILI visits (Week29–Week33, 2021 #2–#4) and localized high activity (Week31, 2021 #9; Week33, 2021 #8) points to continued gradual increases. The projected ILI occurrence of 1665 for Week38, 2021 reflects a stabilization after factoring in this seasonal growth pattern, non-influenza respiratory viral influence, and limited vaccination or mitigating trends.
