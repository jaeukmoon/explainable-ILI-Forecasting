1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an initial gradual increase followed by a peak and mild decline, with values of ['1521', '1532', '1837', '2021', '1982']. Starting from 1521 (Week8, 2021), the numbers rose steadily to 1837 (Week10, 2021) and peaked at 2021 in Week11, 2021, before slightly declining to 1982 in Week12, 2021. This pattern shows an overall upward trajectory in ILI activity, particularly in Weeks9 through Week11.
2. A strong correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the upward trend in ILI activity noted in Weeks9 to Week11, 2021, is followed by a future level of 1816, indicative of persistent ILI activity after 5 weeks. The elevated levels during Weeks10 and Week11 serve as a precursor to maintaining a high but slightly lower ILI occurrence in the future.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI, reported consistently at 0.9% from Week8 through Week12, 2021, remained stable yet above the notable low of 0.8% in Week9, 2021. Though below baseline levels, this steady outpatient visit percentage reflects ongoing respiratory illness activity correlating with the future ILI count.
4. Elevated percentages of PIC deaths, recorded at 16.4% in Week8, 2021, and declining to 11.4% in Week12, 2021, consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds of ~7.1%. This sustained PIC mortality pattern underscores concurrent respiratory or influenza-like illnesses impacting future ILI numbers despite improvements.
5. Behavioral changes in healthcare-seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic, consistently highlighted in the summaries, complicate traditional ILI surveillance and interpretation. COVID-19-driven disruptions likely contributed to delayed or misreported cases, causing fluctuations and influencing the observed future ILI rise to 1816.
6. Despite stable influenza positivity rates (0.1% each week), low lab detections, and minimal reported influenza activity nationwide, observed ILI trends suggest contributions from broader respiratory illnesses or external surveillance complexities affecting recorded ILI data dynamics.
7. In summary, the reported 1816 future ILI occurrences (Week17, 2021) are attributed to the overall upward trend in Weeks8 to Week11, consistent outpatient visit levels for ILI, elevated PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and lingering respiratory illness activity amplified by COVID-19-related surveillance disruptions.
