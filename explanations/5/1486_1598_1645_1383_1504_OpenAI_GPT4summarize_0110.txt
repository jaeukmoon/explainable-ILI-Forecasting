1. Reported ILI occurrences from Week18 to Week22, 2021, are 1486, 1598, 1645, 1383, and 1504. The trend shows an initial increase from Week18 (1486) to Week20 (1645), followed by a sharp decline in Week21 (1383) and a mild rebound in Week22 (1504). Overall, this suggests mild fluctuations with no consistent upward or downward pattern over the time period.
2. Week27, 2021, falls well within the off-season, as it is after the peak season (ending around Week6, 2021) and before the typical peak onset season (starting around Week32 or Week35, 2021). Minimal influenza positivity rates (Week18-Week22 reports) further confirm the expected off-season classification.
3. While past ILI trends exhibit minor fluctuations, they remain largely below national baselines (e.g., Week18-Week22 outpatient visits). Extrapolating this trend forward, a continuation of marginal fluctuations with stabilized low levels of influenza activity aligns with the predicted ILI count of 1469 for Week27, 2021.
4. Influenza positivity remains exceptionally low, with only 0.1% positivity consistently reported in respiratory specimens over Weeks18 to 22, 2021, coupled with minimal virologic detections at public health laboratories.
5. Outpatient ILI visits ranged between 1.1% and 1.3%, consistently below the national baseline of 2.6% (Week18-22 reports), reflecting minimal circulation of influenza viruses or influenza-like activity during the period.
6. Healthcare behavior and ILI surveillance continue to be impacted by COVID-19-related changes (Week18-22 reports). This disruption in traditional surveillance likely masks potential ILI indicators and further contributes to the overall reduced influenza activity.
7. Given the declining ILI activity trend in Week22, 2021, the off-season timing in Week27, 2021, continued low levels of influenza positivity, and the minimal impact of novel influenza variants or significant vaccination changes reported, the forecast of 1469 ILI occurrences is consistent with an expected period of reduced flu transmission.
