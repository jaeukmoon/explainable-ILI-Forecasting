1. The past time-series ILI occurrences showed a mild fluctuation followed by an upward trend over the 5 weeks. The values were ['1706', '1503', '1521', '1532', '1837']. A decline was observed from 1706 (Week 6, 2021) to 1503 (Week 7, 2021), followed by a gradual rise to 1837 (Week 10, 2021), indicating increased ILI activity toward the end of the 5-week period.
2. A clear positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is suggested, as the increasing trend observed from Week 8 to Week 10, 2021, culminates in the sharper rise to 1956 after 5 weeks (Week 15, 2021). The growth trajectory in recent weeks acts as a precursor to the higher future ILI numbers.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI, while below the baseline of 2.6%, decreased slightly from 1.1% (Week 6, 2021) to 0.8% (Week 9, 2021), but increased marginally to 0.9% in Week 10, 2021, suggesting subtle signs of rising healthcare-seeking among specific subsets of the population (e.g., pediatric ILI cases).
4. Pediatric ILI trends noted a consistent increase among children aged 0–4 years over the 8-week period (Weeks 2–10, 2021). This age-specific escalation aligns with the rise in future ILI occurrences, as younger age groups contributed disproportionately to the ILI burden in these weeks.
5. Disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance reporting, heavily influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, led to suppressed ILI records earlier in the season. This effect likely delayed reporting spikes or concentrated ILI activity into subsequent weeks, causing a marked increase to 1956 ILI occurrences in Week 15, 2021.
6. Despite minimal influenza positivity (0.1% of respiratory samples in Weeks 6–10, 2021) and low hospitalization rates (0.6–0.7 per 100,000 across these weeks), the resurgence in ILI figures may reflect contributions from other respiratory pathogens or the gradual normalization of healthcare access post-COVID-19 disruptions.
7. In summary, the reported 1956 future ILI occurrences (Week 15, 2021) are driven by an upward pattern in Weeks 8–10, 2021, gradual increases in pediatric ILI activity, pandemic-related surveillance impacts, and shifting healthcare utilization patterns contributing to the delayed recognition or amplification of cases.
