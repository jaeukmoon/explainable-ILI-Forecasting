1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an initial rise and subsequent fluctuation, with values of ['1040', '1101', '1255', '1305', '1189']. An increase from 1040 (Week33, 2021) to 1305 (Week36, 2021) was observed, followed by a drop to 1189 (Week37, 2021). This indicates oscillating respiratory illness activity, with a peak in Week36, 2021, suggesting a transient rise in ILI activity.
2. A negative correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences, as the decreasing trend from the peak in Week36, 2021 (1305) to Week37, 2021 (1189) aligns with the decline to 969 after 5 weeks (Week42, 2021). The drop in Weeks36–37, 2021, serves as a precursor to the reduction in future ILI occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline throughout Weeks33–37, 2021 (e.g., 2.2% in Week33, 2021, and 2.1% in Week37, 2021). Limited influenza virus circulation, with positivity rates as low as 0.1%, and reports attributing ILI increases primarily to non-influenza respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2), signify minimal flu-specific contributions to future ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds (e.g., 17.2% in Week33, 2021, and 21.1% in Week37, 2021), driven predominantly by COVID-19. The overwhelming COVID-19 dominance minimized the contribution of influenza-specific trends, suggesting other respiratory illnesses might not sustain high ILI activity over future weeks.
5. CDC reports indicated altered healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, complicating the accurate interpretation of ILI data during Weeks33–37, 2021. These disruptions possibly suppressed ILI reporting, contributing to the decline to 969 after 5 weeks. The concurrent low influenza circulation and reduced influenza-associated deaths further support the reduction in ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the observed 969 future ILI occurrences (Week42, 2021) can be attributed to the fluctuating yet overall declining trend in Weeks36–37, 2021, low outpatient ILI rates below baseline thresholds, minimal influenza virus circulation, dominant PIC deaths attributed to COVID-19, and disrupted healthcare-seeking and reporting behaviors during the concurrent respiratory virus pandemic.
