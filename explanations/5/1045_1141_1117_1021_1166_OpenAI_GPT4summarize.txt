1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed fluctuating trends with overall slight increases and peaks, specifically ['1045', '1141', '1117', '1021', '1166']. Notably, the highest point was reached in Week15, 2022 (1166), indicating a resurgence of cases, following previous ups and downs. This trend suggests escalating ILI activity approaching Week15, despite variability.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is demonstrated. The rise toward the final week (Week15, 2022) to 1166 builds momentum, aligning with the sharp increase to 1954 reported 5 weeks later. The persistence of elevated activity in Week15 serves as a precursor to elevated future ILI cases.

3. Three notable contributing factors are apparent from CDC summarized reports:  
   (a) Influenza positivity rates in clinical labs rose consistently to 8.9% by Week15, 2022, predominantly Influenza A(H3N2), which dominated trends and was noted for antigenic differences (Weeks13–15). This strain accounted for higher transmission potential, fueling increased cases.  
   (b) Hospitalizations due to influenza were consistently climbing, with 11 consecutive weeks of increases (Week15, 2022), reaching a cumulative rate of 9.8 per 100,000. Rising hospital admissions directly reflect worsening ILI trends.  
   (c) Co-circulation of respiratory illnesses, including SARS-CoV-2, was significant, with 5.0% of tested specimens being dual-positive for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (Weeks12–15). This interaction complicated trends and heightened illness activity, which directly fueled ILI occurrences.

4. In summary, the reported rise to 1954 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week20, 2022) is explained by the upward trend in ILI activity observed during Week15, 2022, combined with steadily climbing influenza positivity rates, surging hospitalizations related to influenza, and the intricate co-circulation of other respiratory illnesses, particularly SARS-CoV-2. These interacting drivers collectively set the stage for increased future ILI cases.
