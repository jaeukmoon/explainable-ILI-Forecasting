1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week15, 2024 to Week19, 2024) indicate a consistent downward trend. The values ['15163', '14138', '13960', '13498', '12644'] show steady declines week-over-week. Using percentage change, the week-over-week reduction rates are calculated as follows:
2. - From Week15 to Week16: (14138 - 15163) / 15163 ≈ -6.77%
3. - From Week16 to Week17: (13960 - 14138) / 14138 ≈ -1.26%
4. - From Week17 to Week18: (13498 - 13960) / 13960 ≈ -3.30%
5. - From Week18 to Week19: (12644 - 13498) / 13498 ≈ -6.31%
6. The overall trend is an average decrease of approximately -4.91% weekly in ILI activity. Assuming a similar rate of decline persists due to seasonal factors and virologic conditions, and projecting this reduction forward to 5 weeks (Week24, 2024), the formula for forecasting is applied:
7. - Week24 ILI = Week19 ILI × (1 + average weekly change)^5
8. - Week24 ILI = 12644 × (1 - 0.0491)^5 ≈ 12644 × 0.760 ≈ 9910.
2. Season Classification for Week24, 2024: Based on U.S. flu season cycles and the observed decline in ILI activity, Week24, 2024 belongs to the "Off-season." The off-season typically follows the peak season (Weeks 46–6) and is characterized by minimal influenza activity and sustained near-baseline levels. Given the consistent downward trend in ILI occurrences and reports of reduced flu positivity rates and hospitalizations in Week19, this period aligns with off-season characteristics.
3. The correlation analysis between the past trend and Week24, 2024 supports the forecast. The observed ILI decline aligns with historical patterns of post-peak seasonal reductions during the off-season. Applying time-series forecasting, the continuation of the -4.91% weekly decline over 5 weeks mathematically leads to the predicted Week24, 2024 value of approximately 9910. The absence of new volatile factors (e.g., emergent influenza variants) reinforces the validity of projecting these historical patterns forward.
4. Three key factors from the CDC reports strongly influence the prediction:
5. - A. **Decline in positivity rates for influenza testing** (from 5.9% in Week15 to 2.4% in Week19): This corresponds to reduced influenza transmission, correlating directly with the observed drop in ILI occurrences. Assuming this reduction continues (quantitative rate of 59.3% decrease), future weeks can expect further reductions.
6. - B. **Decreasing outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses** (stabilizing below baseline at 2.0% by Week19): Low levels of outpatient respiratory cases in Region 4 reduce the likelihood of substantial ILI spikes, reinforcing the downward trend. This factor indirectly suggests that ILI occurrences will drop further below prior levels.
7. - C. **Co-circulation of influenza A, influenza B, and other respiratory viruses (e.g., COVID-19)**: While these factors can contribute to ILI activity, their cumulative impact appears stable or declining; Week19 reports showed minimal mortality (<0.1%) and stable hospitalization rates. These mathematical observations suggest no major disruptions to the falling trend, allowing for projections in line with historical declines.
5. In summary, the ILI occurrences forecast for Week24, 2024, is 9910. This prediction is derived using: the mathematical projection of a steady -4.91% average weekly decrease from Week19 levels, the "Off-season" classification indicating minimal activity, and CDC-reported declines in positivity rates, outpatient visits, and stabilizing hospitalization rates. This combined evidence quantitatively justifies the ILI forecast of 9910.
