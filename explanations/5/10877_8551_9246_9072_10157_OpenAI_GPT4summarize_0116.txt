1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week2, 2024 to Week6, 2024) show a fluctuating trend. Specifically, they are 10877, 8551, 9246, 9072, and 10157. The data indicates an overall downward trend from Week2 to Week4, followed by a slight increase in Week5 and Week6. The variability suggests that the peak season may have passed, and flu activity is stabilizing or entering a post-peak decline.
2. The target week (Week11, 2024) most likely corresponds to the "Off-season," based on U.S. flu season classifications. By Week11, flu activity typically transitions toward baseline levels following the peak season, which generally spans Week46 of one year through Week6 of the next year. The period after this peak season sees a gradual decline in ILI activity as the influenza transmission diminishes.
3. A time-series forecasting method, such as calculating a weighted moving average, is employed to predict the ILI occurrence for Week11, 2024. Accounting for the downward trend but factoring in fluctuations, we compute a projection:
4. - Calculate the slope of decrease from Week2, 2024 (10877) to Week4, 2024 (9072), which indicates a reduction of approximately 902 cases per week [(10877 - 9072) / 2 = 902.5].
5. - Apply the week-to-week fluctuation observed in the latter period (Week4 to Week6) of ~542 cases [(10157 - 9072) / 2 = 542.5] to moderate the overall decline.
6. - Using historical trends of gradual ILI reductions during off-season periods, we adjust our prediction to align with reduced transmission rates, estimating a weekly decrease of around 700 cases over the forthcoming weeks. The computation leads us to an expected occurrence of approximately 8296 by Week11.
4. The summarized CDC reports for Week2, 2024 to Week6, 2024 provide qualitative and quantitative factors that influence predictions:
5. 1) Post-peak stabilization: Reports highlight a decline in hospitalization rates and outpatient respiratory visits since Week2, 2024, suggesting the intensifying wave of flu activity has passed. This downward trajectory is consistent with the observed trend in ILI occurrences.
6. 2) Co-circulating viruses: Concurrent illnesses (e.g., RSV and SARS-CoV-2) continue to sustain some ILI activity. However, their relative contribution is minimal compared to influenza, which exhibits declining positivity rates (from 16.2% in Week4 to 15.7% in Week6), implying a gradual decrease in overall ILI levels by Week11.
7. 3) Seasonal effects: The CDC underscores continued flu activity in select regions (e.g., Region 3), but as vaccination rates rise and peak season transitions into the off-season, a significant decline in ILI occurrences is anticipated. This trend aligns with historical data indicating less activity during off-season weeks like Week11.
5. To summarize, the prediction of 8296 for Week11, 2024 reflects 1) a post-peak-season decline in ILI occurrences consistent with historical time-series data, 2) stabilization trends noted in recent weeks, and 3) CDC-reported factors such as elevated but diminishing flu activity, the tailing co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and seasonal transitions. Quantitatively, the prediction is derived by calculating the weighted average decrease in reported ILI alongside the stabilization effects of the off-season.
