1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated fluctuations with no clear upward or downward trend, having values of ['2021', '1982', '1977', '2087', '1956']. The highest value occurred during Week13, 2021, at 2087, while the lowest was seen in Week14, 2021, at 1956. The alternating pattern suggests irregular variation without a definitive directional movement in ILI activity during this period.  

2. A minor correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed. While fluctuations in the past data showed variability without a clear trend, the future ILI occurrence of 2025 aligns closely with the mid-values of the past range (1956–2087). This suggests that the future value slightly reflects the overall irregular behavior of the past weeks rather than any persistent or significant rise or fall.

3. Several external factors in the CDC reports correlate with future occurrences.  
   - The outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently low (0.9% to 1.1%) across Weeks11–15, 2021, well below the national baseline of 2.6%. Although the levels were low, the slight increase in Weeks14 and 15, 2021, (from 0.9% to 1.1%) mirrors the stabilizing future ILI value of 2025 after 5 weeks.  
   - Persistent PIC mortality rates consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold during the observed weeks, ranging from 11.2% to 12.4%, driven predominantly by COVID-19. This elevated mortality indirectly reflects sustained respiratory disease activity contributing to future ILI levels.  
   - Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and overlapping COVID-19 trends impacted influenza activity and surveillance interpretations, as highlighted in every weekly report. These challenges could cause underreporting or delayed recognition of rising ILI occurrences, which justifies the slightly increased future value of 2025 after stabilization.  

4. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 2025 (Week20, 2021) is primarily explained by the stabilization observed in the past data range, coupled with consistently low but stable outpatient visits for ILI (0.9–1.1%), persistent elevated PIC mortality rates, and the ongoing impact of pandemic-driven healthcare and surveillance biases. These factors collectively contributed to a minimally fluctuating but sustained ILI activity level five weeks later.
