1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall upward trend, with values of ['10038', '13107', '17363', '17147', '16455']. The data showed a significant rise from 10038 (Week32, 2023) to 17363 (Week34, 2023), followed by a slight decrease to 16455 (Week36, 2023). This trend indicates a sustained elevation in ILI activity during this period, with the highest value occurring in Week34, 2023.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the upward trajectory observed in the past data (Weeks32–34, 2023) and the reported future ILI occurrence value of 18374, which exceeds the highest point in the 5-week dataset. The persistent high values in the later weeks (Week34–36, 2023) demonstrate that the elevated ILI activity likely carried over and fueled the subsequent increase in occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a consistent increase, starting from 1.3% in Week32, 2023, and gradually rising to 2.0% by Week36, 2023. The heightened outpatient visits, particularly high rates among children aged 0–4 years (e.g., 7.2% in Week35, 2023 and 6.5% in Week36, 2023), indicate sustained respiratory illness activity, contributing to the elevated future ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds across all weeks (e.g., 6.1% in Week32, 2023, rising to 9.6% in Week35, 2023). These elevated PIC mortality rates highlight intensified respiratory disease impacts, correlating with the future rise in ILI activity.
5. The documented co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV, in the CDC reports contributed to the overall unpredictability and heightened ILI figures. Behavioral shifts in healthcare-seeking patterns and altered public health dynamics, specifically noted in Week35, 2023 and Week36, 2023, further amplified fluctuations in ILI reporting, likely contributing to the sharp rise to 18374 occurrences.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 18374 (Week41, 2023) can be explained by the overall upward trajectory in past ILI data, increasing outpatient visits, consistently exceeding PIC mortality thresholds, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and the compounded effects of behavior-driven healthcare-seeking changes and reporting challenges noted in the CDC reports.
