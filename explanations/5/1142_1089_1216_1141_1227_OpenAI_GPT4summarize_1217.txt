1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating but overall increasing trend, with values of ['1142', '1089', '1216', '1141', '1227']. After an initial decrease from 1142 (Week30, 2023) to 1089 (Week31, 2023), the occurrences climbed steadily, peaking at 1227 (Week34, 2023). This upward trajectory toward the end of the observed period suggests a potential continuation of this trend into the future.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the consistent rise during Weeks33 and 34, 2023, aligns with the marked surge to 2037 occurrences by Week39, 2023. The upward momentum in the latter weeks acts as a precursor to the amplified ILI activity observed in the future period.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI demonstrated a gradual increase across the 5 weeks, rising from 1.2% in Week30, 2023, to 1.7% in Week34, 2023. This steady growth, coupled with elevated activity among children aged 0–4 years (e.g., 5.8% in Week34, 2023), underscores escalating respiratory illness trends that likely contributed to the future surge.
4. Hospitalizations for influenza also rose consistently during the observed period, from 649 admissions in Week30, 2023, to 779 in Week34, 2023. Increasing hospitalization rates are a key indicator of rising respiratory illness severity, in line with the future increase in ILI occurrences.
5. Mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded epidemic thresholds throughout the 5 weeks, climbing from 5.7% in Week30 to 6.5% in Week34, 2023. This persistent elevation in PIC-related deaths reflects heightened respiratory illness activity, contributing to the observed future ILI peak.
6. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and Influenza, as consistently reported by the CDC, likely played an amplifying role in the combined ILI reporting, leading to the spike to 2037 occurrences by Week39, 2023.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2037 (Week39, 2023) can be attributed to the consistent upward trajectory of ILI occurrences reported in Weeks33 and 34, 2023, increasing outpatient visits and hospitalizations, sustained PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and the compounding effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses.
