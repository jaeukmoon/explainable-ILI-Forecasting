1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week41, 2023 (10629) to Week45, 2023 (16408) exhibit a consistent rising trend. Weekly counts increased steadily: 10629 in Week41, 12389 in Week42, 13096 in Week43, 14457 in Week44, and 16408 in Week45. This pattern indicates a clear upward trajectory without any dips or fluctuations, suggesting intensifying influenza-like activity as the season progresses.
2. Forecasting target Week50, 2023 belongs to the peak season. The sharp increase in ILI occurrences and rising positivity rates in Week44, 2023 and Week45, 2023, coupled with national trends, aligns well with the peak season, which historically occurs from Week46 to Week6 of the following year in the U.S.
3. The upward momentum in ILI counts suggests that the growth seen over the past five weeks is likely to continue. Extrapolating from the data using a time-series forecasting perspective, the week-to-week increase (averaging around 10%-12%) projects forward to reach the predicted ILI occurrence of 25895 in Week50, 2023. This reflects a continuation of rising influenza activity.
4. Key factors from the CDC reports influencing this prediction are:
5. - Increasing influenza positivity rates nationally: The percentage of clinical specimens testing positive grew from 1.3% in Week41, 2023 to 4.0% in Week45, 2023, indicating heightened viral transmission and more cases (Week41, 2023 #1; Week45, 2023 #1).
6. - Rising outpatient ILI visits: From 2.3% in Week41, 2023 to 3.5% in Week45, 2023, outpatient ILI visits surpassed the national baseline of 2.9% in Week44, 2023 (Week41, 2023 #4; Week45, 2023 #3). This reflects growing community transmission.
7. - Regional and age-related data: Increased flu activity is reported in regions 4, 6, and 9, and the highest hospitalization rates are observed among seniors aged 65+ (Week44, 2023 #10; Week45, 2023 #4, #10). This widespread rise portends further growth toward peak activity in Week50, 2023.
5. The continued rise in hospitalization rates supports this projection. Cumulative hospitalization rates rose from 0.3 per 100,000 in Week41, 2023 to 1.7 per 100,000 in Week45, 2023, reflecting increased severe cases, particularly among high-risk groups (Week41, 2023 #5; Week45, 2023 #4).
6. Other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, co-circulate and contribute to the overall respiratory illness burden. However, the dominance of Influenza A (H1N1) and the relatively high rate of influenza positivity suggest influenza will remain a significant driver of ILI activity into Week50, 2023 (Week41, 2023 #9; Week45, 2023 #10).
7. The predicted value of 25895 is justified by the observed weekly growth in ILI occurrences, alignment of Week50, 2023 with the peak season, increasing positivity and hospitalization rates, and widespread regional activity. These dynamics support a sharp rise to reach this projection.
