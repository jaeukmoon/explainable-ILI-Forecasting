1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating pattern without a clear upward or downward trend, with values ['1600', '1467', '1487', '1386', '1478']. The data shows a decline from 1600 (Week24, 2023) to 1467 (Week25, 2023), followed by a minimal increase to 1487 (Week26, 2023). However, a further decrease to 1386 (Week27, 2023) is observed before a slight rebound to 1478 (Week28, 2023). This variability highlights inconsistent patterns of ILI activity during the observed period.
2. While past weekly ILI occurrences show fluctuation, the future increase to 2106 (Week33, 2023) may correlate with a delayed and compounding effect from the varied peaks and rebounds seen in Weeks25–28. The transition from lower weekly occurrences to the substantial rise in Week33 indicates supplemental influencing factors rather than direct linear trends.
3. Minimal flu activity reported in most jurisdictions in Weeks24–28, 2023, coupled with low positivity rates for influenza (e.g., 0.8% in Week27 and 0.9% in Week28), aligns with a suppressed baseline of direct influenza transmission. However, co-circulating respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (reported consistently since Week24, 2023) likely exert pressure on future ILI increases due to overlapping symptomatology.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI were consistently below the national threshold (1.5% in Week24, 2023, to 1.2% in Week28, 2023). Higher age-specific engagement, especially among children under 5 years (e.g., 4.0% in Week28, 2023), reflects a demographic predisposition driving future ILI elevations.
5. Continued occurrence of PIC deaths slightly exceeding epidemic thresholds during Weeks24–28, 2023 (6.1% to 5.8%), signifies ongoing ILI relevance within severe respiratory outcomes. Although flu-associated mortality remains minimal, the sustained PIC impact hints at broader respiratory-driven healthcare burdens contributing to the observed future surge.
6. In summary, the documented rise to 2106 future ILI occurrences (Week33, 2023) is likely driven by the cumulative and delayed influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses, age-group-specific outpatient visit dynamics, and persistent PIC activity, rather than the direct trend in past ILI occurrences. The fluctuating nature of the 5-week ILI data, combined with suppressed flu positivity and minimal jurisdictional activity, underscores the role of external non-influenza factors in shaping this increase.
