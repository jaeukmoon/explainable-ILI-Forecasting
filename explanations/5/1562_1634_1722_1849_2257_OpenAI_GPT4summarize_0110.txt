1. The reported ILI counts from Week33 to Week37, 2024 are 1562, 1634, 1722, 1849, and 2257, showing a clear upward trend. This steady increase, particularly the sharp rise from Week36 (1849) to Week37 (2257), suggests an accelerating trajectory in weekly ILI occurrences.
2. Week42, 2024 falls in the peak onset season in the U.S., as it is between Week32 and Week46, where ILI activity typically rises towards peak levels each year. Recent increases in ILI trends confirm this seasonal classification.
3. From a time-series perspective, ILI occurrences demonstrated consistent upward growth over five weeks, suggesting increased influenza transmission. The progression from Week33 (1562) to Week37 (2257) reflects a compounded increase in cases averaging approximately 173 cases per week. Projecting forward five weeks with an accelerating transmission rate, the model reasonably predicts ILI occurrences reaching 3004 during Week42, 2024.
4. Factors influencing the forecast:
5. The co-circulation of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Victoria remains stable (Week33–Week37, 2024 #1–#3) but with indications of increasing outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses, particularly within younger age groups (Week34, 2024 #4; Week37, 2024 #3).
6. Increased co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2) is noted across weeks, potentially elevating overall ILI occurrences (Week35, 2024 #10; Week36, 2024 #10; Week37, 2024 #7).
7. Despite stable vaccine effectiveness and minimal antiviral resistance (Week33–Week37, 2024 #8–#9), vaccination rates (Week33–Week37, 2024 #10) show no significant improvement, possibly reducing defensive coverage against climbing activity.
5. Nationwide influenza activity remains low but with an upward trend (Week33–Week37, 2024 #1); stable effectiveness of preventive measures, including vaccines and antivirals, suggests that the increase in ILI occurrences aligns with seasonal norms. There are no indications of novel influenza variants driving abnormal spikes, so activity is predicted to follow historical patterns.
6. Vaccination focus is emphasized, but no significant increase in uptake could allow ILI activity to continue rising at seasonal rates (Week33–Week37, 2024 #10). Concurrent activity of co-circulating respiratory viruses may compound respiratory illness percentages, as noted regionally (Week35, 2024 #10; Week36, 2024 #10; Week37, 2024 #7).
7. The steady upward trend in ILI counts, expected rise during the peak onset season (Week42, 2024), and the interplay of stable influenza co-circulation, co-respiratory viruses, and unchanged vaccination coverage provide significant justification for the forecasted ILI occurrence value of 3004.
