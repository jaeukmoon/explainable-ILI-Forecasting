1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall upward trend, with values of ['1008', '1084', '1189', '1240', '1216']. Starting at 1008 in Week 43, 2021, there was a consistent rise to 1240 in Week 46, 2021. Although a slight decline to 1216 occurred in Week 47, 2021, the general pattern suggests increasing ILI activity during this period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the upward trajectory observed in the past data during Week 43 to Week 46, 2021, aligns with the reported future value of 2919 after Week 47. The general upward trend in Weeks 44–46 acts as a precursor to the elevated future ILI value.
3. Outpatient healthcare visits for ILI steadily increased from 1.9% in Week 43 to 2.4% in Week 47, 2021, approaching the national baseline of 2.5%. This progressive rise in respiratory illness-related healthcare visits reflects heightened ILI activity, which corresponds to the observed future ILI surge. Clinical lab test positivity for influenza also rose from 0.2% in Week 43 to 1.5% in Week 47, showcasing escalating influenza activity that likely contributed to the higher future occurrences. Furthermore, age-specific ILI activity among individuals aged 5-24 years rose notably, aligning with the dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), which emerged as a significant factor in the seasonal flu spread. Additionally, increases in influenza-confirmed hospitalizations, rising from 282 in Week 43 to 495 in Week 47, reflect growing severity and circulation of influenza, supporting the future ILI surge to 2919.
4. The persistence of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed the epidemic threshold, with percentages ranging from 15.6% in Week 43 to 15.5% in Week 47, further reflecting increased respiratory illness activity and complicating virus-specific ILI interpretations.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 2919 can be attributed to the consistent rise in past ILI occurrences through Week 46, 2021, increasing outpatient visits and laboratory positivity for influenza, heightened age-specific activity dominated by Influenza A(H3N2), growing influenza-confirmed hospitalizations, and persistently high PIC mortality. These interlinked factors combined to drive the reported future surge.
