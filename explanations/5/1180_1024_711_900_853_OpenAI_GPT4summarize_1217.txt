1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks illustrated a declining trend, transitioning from 1180 in Week 24, 2022, to 853 in Week 28, 2022. After a notable drop from 1180 (Week 24) to 711 (Week 26), a slight rebound to 900 (Week 27) was followed by stabilization at 853 (Week 28). This overall decrease reflects diminishing ILI activity during the observed time frame.
2. The future ILI occurrences (845 after Week 33, 2022) align with the declining trajectory observed during Weeks 24–28, 2022. Despite fluctuations in the weekly values, the downward trend evident by Week 28 suggests a stabilization that corresponds with the reported future value.
3. Hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed influenza consistently decreased across the 5 weeks, with values dropping from 1736 in Week 24 to 722 in Week 28, suggesting reduced severe ILI cases, which aligns with the stability observed in future occurrences (845). Outpatient visits also followed a steady decline, with percentages dropping from 1.9% in Week 24 to 1.6% in Week 28, further contributing to the dampened ILI activity reflected in the future data. The co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and RSV) remained a complicating factor across reports, potentially diluting pure influenza trends and supporting a low ILI occurrence in Week 33. Behavioral changes in healthcare-seeking due to the COVID-19 pandemic, noted across all reports, likely affected the detection and reporting of ILI cases, muting the future increase.
4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 845 (Week 33, 2022) are attributed to the overall declining trend observed in past occurrences, reduced hospitalization and outpatient visit rates, the confounding effects of co-circulating respiratory pathogens, and pandemic-induced disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors that influenced ILI reporting metrics.
