1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a clear downward trend, with values decreasing sequentially from 1903 (Week 48, 2020) to 1175 (Week 52, 2020). This continuous decline indicates a significant reduction in ILI activity across the observed period.
2. A negative correlation is evident between past and future ILI occurrences. The steady decline in past occurrences (Weeks 48–52, 2020) contrasts with the lower future ILI occurrence of 1117 (Week 5, 2021), maintaining the overall downward trend. However, this data also reflects a stabilization phase as the reduction rate slows in later weeks, supporting the observed future value.
3. The unusually low influenza activity reported across all weeks aligns with the reduced ILI activity. Specifically, influenza positivity rates across clinical labs remained consistently low at 0.1%–0.3% (Weeks 48–52, 2020), limiting potential contributions from influenza viruses to future ILI levels.
4. ILI outpatient visits remained stable at 1.6% throughout Weeks 48–52, 2020, staying below the national baseline of 2.6%. This persistent stagnation reflects minimal ILI-related healthcare activity, supporting the subsequent moderate future occurrence of 1117.
5. The influence of pervasive COVID-19 measures, such as masking and physical distancing, significantly restrained influenza transmission and overall respiratory illness circulation. These measures likely contributed to the sustained low levels of ILI activity observed in both the past and future data.
6. Surveillance disruptions linked to healthcare-seeking behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic introduced variability into ILI reporting and trend interpretation. This may have slightly moderated the observed trends but did not significantly alter the downward trajectory.
7. In summary, the future occurrence of 1117 (Week 5, 2021) reflects a continuation of the declining trend seen in Weeks 48–52, 2020. Key contributing factors include sustained low influenza virus activity, stable outpatient visit percentages, and the mitigating impact of COVID-19 public health measures and behavioral changes. These influences collectively explain the observed low future ILI occurrence.
