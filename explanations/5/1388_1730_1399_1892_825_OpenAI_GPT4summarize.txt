1. The past time-series ILI occurrences across the 5 weeks demonstrated a highly fluctuating pattern: from a high of 1388 (Week 2, 2021) to a significant low of 825 (Week 6, 2021). An initial increase from 1388 (Week 2, 2021) to 1730 (Week 3, 2021) was followed by alternating decreases and increases, culminating in a sharp decline by Week 6, 2021. This notable variability ended on a downward trajectory, indicating overall decline in ILI activity during the observed period.

2. A weak positive correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences. Although the final week of past occurrences (825 in Week 6, 2021) reflects a sharp drop, it likely represents an underestimated trend due to healthcare-seeking changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, unreliable surveillance, or other disruptions. These factors appear to set the stage for a resurgence, as reflected in the future occurrence of 1016 (Week 11, 2021), representing a rebound in ILI activity.

3. Several summarized report factors align with the future occurrence of 1016. First, outpatient ILI visits remained persistently low (1.1% in Weeks 4–6, 2021, well below the baseline of 2.6%), but the CDC warnings of potential increases in influenza activity (Weeks 2–6, 2021) suggest latent risk due to atypical surveillance conditions. Second, dominant Influenza B specimens (e.g., 85.7% in Week 6, 2021) alongside shifting positivity rates indicate residual viral presence capable of driving future activity. Third, altered healthcare-seeking behavior and surveillance challenges, frequently noted (Weeks 2–6, 2021), contributed to underreported cases, potentially obscuring the true burden of ILI and causing delayed growth manifesting in future occurrences.

4. In summary, the reported 1016 future ILI occurrences (Week 11, 2021) can be explained by the fluctuating but declining trend in past data, which might obscure an underlying delayed resurgence. Several contributory factors include the CDC's warnings of increased activity, a dominance of Influenza B specimens, and unique disruptions to surveillance caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which likely facilitated an upswing in ILI occurrences five weeks later.
