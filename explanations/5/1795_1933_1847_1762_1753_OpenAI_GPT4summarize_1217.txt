1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a generally declining trend, with values of ['1795', '1933', '1847', '1762', '1753']. After a peak at 1933 in Week 19, 2023, there is a consistent decrease, reaching 1753 in Week 22, 2023. This downward progression indicates a stabilization or tapering of ILI activity leading into the projected period.
2. The future decrease to 1105 occurrences after 5 weeks is correlated with the observed downward trend in past ILI occurrences, particularly from Week 19 to Week 22, 2023. This suggests that the declining trajectory during these weeks reflects diminishing respiratory illness activity, setting the stage for lower future values.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline of 2.5% throughout all 5 weeks, consistently around 1.9%-2.0%. This stability, combined with low influenza positivity rates (1.0%-1.2% from Weeks 18–22, 2023), underscores reduced influenza-related illness, contributing to the future lower value of 1105.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) showed a gradual decline from 6.9% in Week 18, 2023, to 6.2% in Week 22, 2023, mostly aligning with epidemic thresholds. This reflects a general reduction in severe respiratory cases, further resonating with the observed decrease in ILI occurrences leading into the future period.
5. The co-circulation of non-influenza respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, as highlighted across Weeks 18–22, 2023, may have led to reporting complexities and overall dilution of influenza-specific ILI trends. These overlapping patterns likely contributed to the decline seen in ILI occurrences, supporting the future projection of 1105.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence of 1105 is primarily attributed to the clear downward trend in Weeks 18–22, 2023, stable below-baseline outpatient visit percentages, declining PIC deaths near epidemic thresholds, and the compounding influence of co-circulating respiratory illnesses, all indicating reduced respiratory illness activity.
