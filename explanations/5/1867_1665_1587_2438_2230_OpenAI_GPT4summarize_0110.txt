1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week37 to Week41, 2021 are 1867, 1665, 1587, 2438, and 2230. Initially, a decreasing trend was observed from Week37 (1867) to Week39 (1587). However, a sharp rise in ILI occurrences occurred from Week39 (1587) to Week40 (2438), followed by a slight decline in Week41 (2230). This pattern suggests a fluctuating trend with a potential early seasonal uptick toward the end of this period.
2. Forecasting target week (Week46, 2021) belongs to the Peak season. In the U.S., the peak season typically starts around Week46 each year (Background Knowledge #1). The significant rise in ILI activity in Week40 and Week41, combined with CDC's expectation of increasing influenza activity toward the end of October, aligns with the onset of the peak season.
3. From a time-series perspective, ILI activity showed fluctuations with a notable increase toward the end of Week40 and a slight dip in Week41, reflecting a typical early onset of peak influenza activity. Projecting this forward, the continuation of this increasing trend is anticipated, leading to the forecasted 2626 ILI occurrences for Week46, 2021.
4. Viral activity remains minimal but increasing, as Week40, 2021 (#1, #3, #4) and Week41, 2021 (#1, #3, #4) suggest rising positivity rates in clinical and public health labs, coupled with minimal influenza-related hospitalizations, contributing to the upward trend.
5. Vaccination efforts are emphasized, with public encouragement to complete vaccinations by the end of October (Week40, 2021 #8; Week41, 2021 #8). Considering the peak onset, vaccination timing supports gradual mitigation of cases but does not immediately reduce the rising ILI trend projected into Week46.
6. The ongoing impacts of overlapping respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, are heavily influencing ILI trends while increasing PIC deaths (Week37, 2021 #3; Week38, 2021 #3; Week41, 2021 #5). These overlapping trends are driving higher outpatient respiratory illness activity and ILI counts (Week41, 2021 #10).
7. Given the fluctuating ILI patterns with a late upward trajectory, the onset of the peak season in Week46, high PIC-related incidence, ongoing vaccination efforts, and broader impacts of respiratory viruses, the predicted ILI occurrence of 2626 is consistent with historical and recent trends.
