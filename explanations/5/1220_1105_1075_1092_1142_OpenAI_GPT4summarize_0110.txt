1. The reported ILI counts from Week26 to Week30, 2023 are 1220, 1105, 1075, 1092, and 1142. The trend shows a general decline from Week26 (1220) to Week28 (1075), followed by a mild increase in Week29 (1092) and Week30 (1142). This suggests a fluctuating but overall relatively stable pattern with no sharp increases or decreases during this period.
2. Forecasting target week (Week35, 2023) belongs to the Peak onset season. Based on the U.S. seasonality, Peak onset season typically begins around Week32-Week35 (Week35, 2023 #4). Additionally, incremental rises during Week30 (1142) and reported ongoing virus circulation, align with early transition to the Peak onset season.
3. The time-series data suggest a stable base level with minor fluctuations, with an average ILI occurrence of 1126 over the five weeks from Week26 to Week30, 2023. Projecting forward, the expectation is for a slight increase toward Week35, 2023, consistent with historical patterns of influenza picking up during the Peak onset season, forecasting 1208 occurrences.
4. The presence of ongoing co-circulating viruses, such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2, continues to contribute to ILI activity (Week26, 2023 #9; Week29, 2023 #8; Week30, 2023 #8), complicating respiratory illness visits.
5. During Week30, subtle shifts in influenza virus diversity were reported, with two novel influenza A variants (H3v and H1N2v) detected, though no sustained human-to-human transmission occurred (Week30, 2023 #4). This may introduce variability in ILI trends, especially during the transition to Peak onset season.
6. Vaccination updates across all weeks were minimal, and no significant upsurge in vaccination coverage was reported (Week26, 2023 #10; Week27, 2023 #9; Week30, 2023 #9). Without better coverage, seasonal preventative effects against influenza remain constrained.
7. In summary, while ILI trends have stabilized over the past weeks, ongoing co-circulating respiratory viruses, detections of novel variant cases (though isolated), and the lack of significant changes in vaccination uptake suggest a mild increase in ILI cases. Coupled with seasonal transition from off-season to Peak onset, the predicted value of 1208 occurrences for Week35, 2023 is consistent with historical data and current patterns.
