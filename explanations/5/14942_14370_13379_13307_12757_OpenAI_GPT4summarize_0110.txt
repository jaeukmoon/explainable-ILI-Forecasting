1. The reported ILI counts from Week7, 2023 to Week11, 2023 are 17310, 16585, 15411, 14829, and 14594. This indicates a clear and consistent decline over the five weeks. The steady reduction suggests decreased transmission and lower levels of respiratory illness over time. No significant fluctuations or sudden changes are observed in this period, pointing to an overall declining trend.
2. Week21, 2023 falls well within the off-season classification, as it occurs significantly after the typical peak (Week46 to Week6) and still precedes the anticipated peak onset season (Week32 to Week46). Both reduced influenza positivity rates and stable or declining epidemiological indicators further support this classification as off-season.
3. The decreasing trend in prior ILI counts suggests the future projection for ILI occurrences is consistent with these reductions. A time-series forecasting model would likely consider the prior sustained decline, extrapolating to a further drop, resulting in the forecast of 12757 for Week21, 2023. However, the decline is expected to slow down closer to stabilization, given off-season dynamics.
4. Nationwide influenza activity remains low, with clinical lab positivity under 1.0% for five consecutive weeks (Week7, 2023 #1; Week8, 2023 #1; Week9, 2023 #1; Week10, 2023 #1; Week11, 2023 #1), strongly suggesting minimal viral spread.
5. Vaccine effectiveness remains high, with antigenic similarity between vaccine strains and circulating viruses, and nearly all tested strains showing susceptibility to antivirals (Week7, 2023 #7; Week8, 2023 #9; Week9, 2023 #9; Week10, 2023 #7; Week11, 2023 #7). This reduces the likelihood of a significant surge.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and others continues to complicate estimation of future influenza activity, but no significant increases are expected (Week7, 2023 #9, #10; Week8, 2023 #10; Week9, 2023 #10; Week10, 2023 #9; Week11, 2023 #9). Healthcare-seeking behaviors and exposure risk remain stable, consistent with low flu activity.
7. The forecasted ILI occurrence of 12757 in Week21, 2023 is well-supported by the declining trend in ILI counts, the observed off-season status, low influenza positivity rates, the effectiveness of vaccination and antivirals, and the absence of notable changes in co-circulating pathogens. These factors collectively indicate a stable off-season level with ongoing minimal activity.
