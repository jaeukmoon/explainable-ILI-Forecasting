1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a stable but slightly fluctuating pattern, with values of ['1873', '2139', '2066', '2064', '2078']. There was an initial increase from 1873 (Week 45, 2020) to 2139 (Week 46, 2020), followed by a slight dip to 2066 (Week 47, 2020). However, the final two weeks displayed consistent stability, with minimal change from 2064 (Week 48, 2020) to 2078 in Week 49, 2020. This indicates steady ILI activity during the observed period.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 2367 shows a moderate positive correlation with the past data, aligning with the slight rise observed in Week 49, 2020. The consistent stability in the later weeks of past data (Weeks 48–49, 2020) likely set the stage for the future increase, reflecting progressive yet stable ILI trends.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a stabilization at 1.6% from Week 47, 2020, through Week 49, 2020, maintaining below the national baseline of 2.6%. This consistent level of activity, although low, indicated a maintained baseline of respiratory-related illnesses capable of contributing to future increases.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) showed a continuous rise, from 8.9% (Week 45, 2020) to 14.3% in Week 49, 2020, consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds. This heightened PIC mortality indicated co-circulating respiratory illnesses contributing to the overall ILI activity dynamics.
5. Widespread influences of COVID-19 on healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance disrupted the accuracy of ILI trends, as documented across all weeks. These distortions may have delayed detection or underreported current ILI cases, contributing to the higher count of 2367 future occurrences.
6. Despite the notably low positivity rate of influenza specimens (e.g., 0.2% in Week 45, 2020, and 0.2% in Week 49, 2020), non-specific respiratory illnesses or other viral contributors likely played a role in amplifying ILI occurrences. Pandemic-driven behaviors, such as overlaps with COVID-19 symptoms, may have further explained future increases.
7. In summary, the reported 2367 future ILI occurrences (Week 54, 2020) stemmed from steady ILI trends through Weeks 48–49, 2020, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, stabilized outpatient visits for ILI, and COVID-19-associated disruptions in healthcare-seeking and surveillance practices.
