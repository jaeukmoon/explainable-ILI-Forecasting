1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a steady and notable downward trend, with values of ['1451', '1475', '1259', '1042', '883']. After peaking at 1475 in Week53, 2020, ILI occurrences decreased consistently, ending with 883 in Week4, 2021. This continuous decline reflects a decreasing level of ILI activity over the observed period.
2. The sharp decline in the past 5 weeks exhibits a negative trajectory, contrasting the future reported value of 641 (Week9, 2021). However, the persistent decrease through Week4, 2021 may have contributed to a lower stabilization before reaching the future occurrence level of 641, suggesting the decline continued but at a reducing pace.
3. Outpatient ILI visit percentages steadily decreased from 1.6% (Week53, 2020) to 1.1% (Week4, 2021), indicating gradually lower engagement with healthcare providers for ILI symptoms. This declining trend is correlated with the observed reductions in ILI occurrences, pointing to reduced transmission or reporting of ILI cases.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) was historically high throughout the period, with rates such as 28.4% (Week4, 2021), far above the epidemic threshold, primarily driven by COVID-19. The dominating impact of COVID-19 may have masked or suppressed respiratorily transmitted influenza cases, influencing the lower future ILI level of 641.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior and traditional ILI surveillance remained heavily influenced by the overlapping COVID-19 pandemic, as emphasized across all weeks in the reports. These changes in care-seeking and testing contributed to suppressed ILI case counts and clearer declines in reported activity, helping explain the low value of 641 by Week9, 2021.
6. Despite significant declines in influenza virus positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% in Weeks53 and 4), vaccine uptake and ongoing warnings about potential increases in flu activity suggest that future influenza trends might stabilize at suppressed levels, aligning with the reduced occurrences of 641.
7. In summary, the reported 641 future occurrences (Week9, 2021) can be attributed to the consistent downward trend in ILI cases from Weeks53, 2020 to 4, 2021, reduced outpatient ILI visits, suppressed flu positivity rates, the dominant impact of COVID-19 affecting PIC mortality and healthcare behaviors, and the stabilization of influenza activity at historically low levels.
