1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week35, 2021 through Week39, 2021 are 1255, 1305, 1189, 1064, and 975. The overall trend shows a consistent decline, with occurrences dropping each week. After peaking at 1305 in Week36, 2021, the numbers steadily decreased to 975 by Week39, 2021. This indicates a downward trajectory leading up to Week39, 2021 without evidence of significant fluctuations.
2. Week44, 2021 belongs to the Peak onset season. In the U.S., this period typically spans from Week35 to Week46, characterized by rising ILI activity leading into the peak season. While influenza activity remains low as of Week39, 2021 (based on CDC summarized reports), Week44 falls within the expected seasonal increase timeframe, just before a possible transition into the peak season.
3. The declining trend in ILI occurrences from Week35 to Week39, 2021 indicates potentially stabilizing or moderately increasing ILI counts over the next few weeks. By Week44, 2021, the ILI occurrences are forecasted to reach 1084, reflecting a slight recovery in activity as the season progresses from the off-season toward peak onset. The model suggests that residual seasonal effects and external factors maintain low but gradual increases toward Week44, 2021.
4. Influenza activity remains minimal nationwide, with outpatient respiratory illness visits consistently below the national baseline of 2.6% during Week35 to Week39, 2021, suggesting low influenza virus circulation (Week39, 2021 #1; Week38, 2021 #1; Week36, 2021 #3; Week35, 2021 #1).
5. Non-influenza respiratory viruses have contributed to respiratory illness trends. Increases in some regions were linked to other respiratory pathogens rather than influenza, indicating overlapping viral circulation that may slightly elevate ILI occurrences in future weeks (Week37, 2021 #1, #5; Week36, 2021 #2, #10).
6. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impact ILI surveillance data and interpretation, creating uncertainties in accurately capturing trends. However, shifts in these behaviors, combined with lingering effects of respiratory virus seasonality, may influence modest changes in ILI trends by Week44, 2021 (Week39, 2021 #9; Week38, 2021 #7; Week36, 2021 #9; Week35, 2021 #10).
7. In conclusion, the forecast of 1084 ILI occurrences for Week44, 2021 is justified by the consistent downward trend in recent occurrences, the seasonality aligning with Peak onset, and the minimal influenza activity influenced by other respiratory viruses and healthcare behavior changes. Although influenza circulation remains low, overlapping viral activity and the seasonal transition phase suggest a slight increase in ILI values from the recent trough, aligning with expected fluctuations during this period.
