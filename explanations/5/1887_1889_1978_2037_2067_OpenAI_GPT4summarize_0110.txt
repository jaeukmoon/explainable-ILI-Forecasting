1. The reported ILI counts from Week37 to Week41, 2021 are 1887, 1889, 1978, 2037, and 2067. The data shows a consistent upward trajectory, with ILI cases increasing incrementally week over week. The trend reflects a gradual rise in occurrences, signaling the initial build-up toward higher activity levels, characteristic of the peak onset season.
2. In the U.S., peak onset season typically spans from Week32 to Week46. Based on the given data and historical season chronology, forecasting Week46, 2021 aligns with the transition into the peak season. The persistent upward trend in ILI occurrences suggests that Week46, 2021 belongs to the peak season, a period marked by accelerating transmission and higher ILI counts.
3. Extrapolating from the observed steady growth in ILI cases over the past five weeks and considering the historical patterns of peak onset transitioning to peak season, future ILI occurrences are reasonably projected to reach 2658 in Week46, 2021. This is based on the ongoing rise in activity, likely influenced by both viral spread dynamics and seasonal drivers.
4. Despite limited influenza positivity, slight increases in Influenza A and B detection were noted, with Influenza A subtypes (H3N2 and H1N1)pdm09 showing increasing detection (Week40, 2021 #2; Week41, 2021 #2, #3). Such patterns indicate potential early-season viral circulation contributing to the ILI growth trend.
5. Seasonal vaccination campaigns are emphasized but with limited data on coverage rates provided (Week37, 2021 #8; Week40, 2021 #8; Week41, 2021 #8). Any delays or gaps in vaccination coverage may allow broader virus transmission, supporting the projected increase in ILI cases.
6. Concurrent respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, continue to drive significant outpatient visits, amplifying ILI activity (Week37, 2021 #5; Week38, 2021 #8; Week40, 2021 #10). This overlap could skew ILI trends higher even as influenza activity remains low, further justifying the rising projection.
7. In summary, the forecasted value of 2658 ILI cases for Week46, 2021 reflects the continuation of the upward trajectory observed in Week37–Week41, 2021, the likelihood of disease intensification during the peak season, limited vaccination coverage updates, initial influenza subtype detections, and the compounded effects of other circulating respiratory pathogens elevating ILI activity. These factors collectively support the anticipated increase in future ILI cases.
