1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent upward trend, starting from 11057 in Week28, 2021, and increasing steadily through subsequent weeks—14311 (Week29), 17202 (Week30), 18422 (Week31), and reaching a peak of 19975 in Week32, 2021. This persistent increase reflects a gradual and sustained rise in respiratory illness activity throughout the 5-week period.
2. A strong correlation is observed between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the steady escalation in ILI activity during Weeks 30–32, 2021, culminates in a sharp rise in respiratory illness activity five weeks later, with occurrences reaching 12979. The decline from the Week32 peak of 19975 to 12979 in future occurrences likely reflects the gradual slowing of ILI trends, though still elevated above Week28 levels.
3. Outpatient ILI visits increased consistently over the observed 5-week period, moving from 1.3% (Week28, 2021) to 2.1% (Week32, 2021). This steady incremental growth in healthcare encounters reflects increasing respiratory illness activity, correlating with the rise in future ILI occurrences.
4. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) mortality percentages showed a notable increasing pattern, exceeding the epidemic threshold and moving from 7.1% (Week28, 2021) to 14.6% (Week32, 2021), with COVID-19 as the primary driving factor. This persistence of PIC-related mortality signals heightened overall respiratory illness activity, aligning with continued future increases.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic featured prominently, as alternative care practices and overlapping symptoms (e.g., non-flu respiratory conditions) disrupted accurate ILI surveillance. This likely inflated ILI activity trends, contributing to elevated future occurrences.
4. Despite low influenza circulation, as suggested by consistently minimal virologic surveillance positivity across Weeks28–32, 2021, the rising trend in ILI visits and PIC-related mortality highlights the influence of other non-specific respiratory illnesses (e.g., COVID-19) on future ILI patterns and eventual occurrences.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 12979 align with the consistent upward trend in past ILI occurrences, reflecting rising outpatient ILI visits, elevated PIC mortality rates surpassing epidemic thresholds during Weeks28–32, 2021, and pandemic-driven healthcare challenges. This combination of factors explains the observed future ILI activity.
