1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a largely stable trend with minor fluctuations: ['1843', '1831', '2025', '1777', '1831']. There was an increase from 1831 (Week 19, 2021) to 2025 (Week 20, 2021), followed by a sharp decrease to 1777 (Week 21, 2021) and a rise back to 1831 (Week 22, 2021). Overall, the values stayed consistent without significant deviation, though occasional surges hint at potential variability in ILI activity.
2. A moderate correlation between the past time-series occurrences and future occurrences is indicated. The observed stabilization around 1831 in Weeks 19–22, 2021, coupled with an outlier increase to 2025 in Week 20, aligns with the future ILI increase to 2197. This suggests that elevated or volatile weeks in the past series may project onto amplified future levels.
3. Stable outpatient ILI visits holding at approximately 1.2% (e.g., Week 19, 2021) to 1.3% (Week 20, 2021) suggest a baseline level of respiratory illness activity. Slight increases, particularly among the 0–4 years age group, may signal a resurgence or broadening spread, supporting the rise in future ILI levels.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed the epidemic thresholds, although they declined week over week (10.1% in Week 19, 2021, to 7.5% in Week 22, 2021). This consistent PIC mortality contributes to underlying respiratory illness prevalence, correlating with the rise in ILI occurrences.
5. Ongoing impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic altered healthcare-seeking behaviors and disrupted ILI surveillance (e.g., Week 22, 2021), leading to potential underreporting or delayed recognition of cases. Such disruptions might have concentrated a surge in ILI counts, reflected in the 2197 occurrences after 5 weeks.
6. Despite minimal influenza virus positivity across all weeks (e.g., 0.1% in Weeks 19–22, 2021) and limited laboratory confirmations, non-specific respiratory illness or other pathogens likely contributed to the observed ILI occurrence patterns. Pandemic-driven behaviors further complicate precise tracking, intensifying eventual ILI peaks.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 2197 (Week 27, 2021) are linked to the stable and slightly volatile trend in past ILI occurrences, increasing outpatient visits tied to respiratory illness, persistent PIC mortality trends, and disruptions in surveillance caused by COVID-19.
