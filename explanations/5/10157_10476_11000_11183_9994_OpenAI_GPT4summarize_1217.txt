1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated fluctuating activity, with values of ['10157', '10476', '11000', '11183', '9994']. After an initial rise from 10157 (Week 6, 2024) to 11183 (Week 8, 2024), the last week in this series (Week 10, 2024) displayed a notable decline to 9994. This overall pattern signals increased flu activity prior to a moderate drop by the last observed week.
2. A clear correlation emerges between the decline in Week 10, 2024, and the significant decrease leading to the reported 5686 future occurrences after 5 weeks. This contrast suggests that the drop in Week 10 foreshadowed reduced flu activity, consistent with the lower levels observed in the future.
3. Several summarized report factors strongly correlate with the decreased future occurrences. Week 10, 2024, noted a slight decrease in ILI outpatient visits from 4.1% in Week 9 to 3.7%, signaling a downtrend in respiratory illness visits. The decline in flu hospitalizations, totaling 8819 (Week 10, 2024) from earlier weeks, further reflects reduced activity. Co-circulating influenza A and B positivity showed minimal variability and stable proportions, indicating the absence of a major resurgence. Persistent antiviral resistance remained low, with only isolated cases, minimizing any outbreak acceleration.
4. Influenza positivity rates, which declined steadily from 15.7% (Week 6, 2024) to 14.2% (Week 8, 2024) and slightly rebounded to 15.4% in Week 10, showed no drastic shifts, reflecting stabilizing or subsiding activity. Pediatric and senior-specific hospitalization rates also pointed to tapering trends despite regional variations.
5. In summary, the drop to 5686 future occurrences aligns with the decline observed in Week 10, 2024, and corroborates decreased ILI outpatient visits, hospitalization reductions, stable influenza positivity rates, and minimal resistance patterns identified in CDC reports. These trends collectively provide a consistent trajectory of decreasing flu impact over the subsequent weeks.
