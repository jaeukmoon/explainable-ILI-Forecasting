1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating trend, with values of ['1162', '1017', '1079', '1171', '1320']. There was an initial drop from 1162 (Week 41, 2020) to 1017 (Week 42, 2020), followed by a gradual rebound in subsequent weeks, culminating in a significant increase to 1320 (Week 45, 2020). This upward momentum at the end indicates a resurgence in ILI activity.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the consistent rise observed in Weeks 44-45, 2020 (1171 to 1320), aligns with the reported future value of 1263 after 5 weeks. This correlation underscores that the increase in ILI activity during the final weeks of the observed data likely set the stage for elevated numbers 5 weeks later.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily rose from weeks 42 to 45, 2020, increasing from 1.2% (Week 42) to 1.5% (Week 45). Although below the national baseline of 2.6%, this gradual rise indicates growing respiratory illness activity, corroborating the observed future surge in ILI occurrences.
4. Death percentages attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed epidemic thresholds, climbing from 7.2% (Week 41, 2020) to 8.9% (Week 45, 2020). This persistent PIC elevation reflects heightened respiratory pressures that are consistent with the elevated ILI occurrences observed post-5 weeks.
5. Disrupted healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI surveillance reliability, as outlined in all summarized reports due to the COVID-19 pandemic, likely contributed to delayed or under-reported ILI trends in the earlier weeks, with eventual compensatory surges manifesting in the future occurrences.
6. Despite low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.3% in Week 41, 2020, and 0.2% in Week 45, 2020), alternative respiratory illnesses, or pathologies driven by seasonal factors amid pandemic disruptions, likely contributed to the gradual rise in observed ILI activity and subsequent peak in future data.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence of 1263 (Week 50, 2020) is supported by the upward trend in Weeks 44-45, 2020, sustained increases in outpatient ILI visits, persistently high PIC-related mortality, and the cumulative effects of altered healthcare-seeking behavior and respiratory illness dynamics amidst the ongoing pandemic.
