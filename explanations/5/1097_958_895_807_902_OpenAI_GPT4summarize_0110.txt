1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week8 to Week12, 2023, are 1154, 1212, 1308, 1174, and 1129. The trend indicates a mild increase from Week8 (1154) to Week10 (1308), followed by a decline in Week11 (1174) and Week12 (1129). This pattern reflects an overall fluctuating trend with no sustained rises.
2. Week22, 2023, falls into the off-season, as U.S. off-season months typically span from Week01 to Week31, 2023. Moreover, influenza positivity rates, hospitalization statistics, and outpatient visit numbers from Week8 to Week12, 2023, remain below baseline levels, consistent with off-season trends.
3. The time-series data from Week8 to Week12, 2023, suggest a stabilization of occurrences after Week10 combined with a declining phase by Week12, 2023. Projecting this generally declining trend forward, a value of 902 reflects a stable-to-slightly decreasing trend aligned with off-season predictability.
4. Influenza activity remains low nationally, with positivity rates ranging from 0.8% to 1.0% for clinical specimens during Week8 to Week12, 2023. Stable low activity in the off-season hints at minimal ILI occurrences (Week8, 2023 #1; Week11, 2023 #1; Week12, 2023 #1).
5. Influenza vaccinations are antigenically well-matched to circulating influenza strains, and over 99% of tested viruses remain susceptible to antiviral medications (Week8, 2023 #9; Week9, 2023 #9; Week11, 2023 #7; Week12, 2023 #8). This lowers the likelihood of significant outbreaks, further supporting the predicted reduction in ILI counts.
6. Continued co-circulation of multiple pathogens (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, RSV) influences respiratory illness trends. However, no novel variants or significant surges were reported, suggesting that non-flu factors will not strongly drive ILI rises (Week9, 2023 #10; Week10, 2023 #12; Week12, 2023 #10).
7. The ILI forecast of 902 for Week22, 2023, reflects the overall declining and fluctuating trend in recent occurrences, the established off-season classification, effective vaccination coverage, stable antiviral susceptibility, and the absence of novel influenza strains or sharp increases in respiratory illnesses.
