1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1261', '1512', '1701', '1940', '2032']. There was an increase from 1261 (Week 8, 2022) to 1512 (Week 9, 2022), with subsequent steady rises to 2032 by Week 12, 2022. This pattern indicates a notable escalation in ILI activity throughout this period, with the largest increase observed between Week 10 and Week 12.
2. A positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the upward trajectory observed toward the latter weeks (Weeks 11-12, 2022) aligns with the reported future increase to 2443 occurrences by Week 17, 2022. This consistent growth in the past occurrences reflects sustained respiratory illness activity, culminating in the amplified future ILI levels.
3. Influenza positivity rates rose progressively, with clinical lab specimens testing positive increasing from 4.1% in Week 8, 2022, to a peak of 7.7% in Week 11, 2022. This sustained rise in lab-confirmed influenza cases underlines the ongoing escalation in flu activity driving higher future ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza hospitalizations consistently increased over the 5-week period, with rates rising from 5.2 per 100,000 in Week 8, 2022, to 7.2 per 100,000 in Week 12, 2022. This ongoing burden of severe cases indicates expanding influenza-related morbidity that foreshadows the reported future ILI surge.
5. Antigenic differences in dominant Influenza A(H3N2) strains, noted throughout the period (Week 8-Week 12, 2022), likely reduced vaccine effectiveness, compounding the increase in overall flu activity. Additionally, co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) further contributed to heightened disease spread, aligning with the observed rise to 2443 future occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 2443 future ILI occurrences (Week 17, 2022) can be attributed to the consistent upward trend in ILI activity in Weeks 8-12, 2022, increasing lab influenza positivity rates, escalating influenza-associated hospitalizations, antigenic mismatches reducing vaccine efficacy, and continuous co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses.
