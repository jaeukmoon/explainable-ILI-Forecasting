1. The reported ILI counts from Week42 to Week46, 2023 are 19370, 21978, 23656, 28832, and 30047. The data indicate a consistent and significant upward trend, with ILI occurrences steadily increasing across these five weeks. The largest week-over-week increase occurred between Week43 and Week44 (+5180 cases), followed by a smaller but still noticeable growth between Week45 and Week46 (+1215 cases). Overall, this pattern strongly suggests escalating ILI activity.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans from Week46 to Week6. Given that the target week, Week51, 2023, falls within this timeframe and that increasing ILI trends were observed in the recent weeks (Week42 to Week46, 2023), Week51 aligns with the peak season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent increases in ILI occurrences over the last five weeks demonstrate a clear upward trajectory, indicative of the ongoing acceleration of flu activity. If this trend continues at a similar rate, with each subsequent week experiencing additional growth in line with recent upward patterns, a future occurrence of 51808 by Week51, 2023 aligns well with the extrapolated progression.
4. Influenza activity and positivity rates have risen sharply, with clinical test positivity increasing from 1.7% in Week42, 2023, to 4.9% in Week46, 2023 (Week42, 2023 #1; Week46, 2023 #7). This strengthens the expectation of sustained growth into the peak season.
5. Hospitalization rates for influenza are climbing quickly, reaching 2.6 per 100,000 by Week46, the second highest rate for Week46 since 2010 (Week46, 2023 #4). This reflects increasing severity, driving higher ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, such as Influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, continues to complicate attribution of ILI but overall contributes to increasing respiratory illness activity levels across multiple regions (Week42, 2023 #8; Week43, 2023 #7; Week46, 2023 #9).
7. The upward trajectory in ILI occurrences, classification of Week51, 2023, in the peak season, high positive test rates, increasing hospitalizations, and co-circulation of respiratory pathogens justify the prediction of 51808 cases in Week51, 2023. Together, these factors indicate continuously rising flu activity aligned with peak season dynamics.
