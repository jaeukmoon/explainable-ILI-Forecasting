1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks (Week16, 2021 to Week20, 2021) show a generally increasing trend. Starting at 1358 in Week16, the occurrences rise to 1759 in Week17, then briefly decrease to 1626 in Week18, before increasing to 1786 in Week19, and peaking at 1856 in Week20. This trend demonstrates a steady upward movement with minor fluctuations. The average weekly increase between consecutive weeks, calculated as [(1759-1358) + (1626-1759) + (1786-1626) + (1856-1786)]/4 = 106.25, suggests an upward progression in ILI activity, maintaining the pattern of slight growth into future weeks.
2. Forecasting target week (Week25, 2021) belongs to the "Off-season." Based on U.S. flu season cycles, Week25, 2021 falls after the peak season (Week46 of the prior year to about Week6 of the current year) and before the peak onset period (Week32 onward). Given the low intensity of ILI activity reported in CDC surveillance and historical baselines during off-seasons, Week25 aligns with typical off-season behavior.
3. Analyzing the historical trend, the progression of ILI occurrences suggests that Week25, 2021 will likely reflect the cumulative impact of mild growth in ILI occurrences seen from Week16 to Week20. Extending the observed average weekly growth rate (106.25) over the next 5 weeks implies an estimate of approximately 1856 + (106.25 × 5) = 2387. However, adjustments must be made to account for the season (off-season) and mitigating factors from CDC reports (such as the extremely low flu activity and impacts of COVID-19). Scaling down by estimated seasonal suppression (approximately 25%, typical of off-season patterns), the final adjusted value becomes 1790.25, approximated to 1791.
4. Factors from the CDC reports that influence the prediction include:
5. 1. Influenza activity remains unusually low across all jurisdictions; only 0.1% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza across Weeks16 to Week20, 2021. This strongly suggests that flu-related ILI activity is not expected to surge, limiting potential growth in occurrences despite the observed upward time-series trend.
6. 2. Healthcare-seeking behaviors for respiratory illnesses continue to be impacted by COVID-19, as reported in all weeks (e.g., Week16, 2021), leading to lower-than-usual detection and reporting biases for influenza. This factor further moderates the projected ILI values despite historical increases in time-series data.
7. 3. Minimal influenza-associated hospitalization rates (0.8 per 100,000 population throughout Weeks16 to Week20), combined with stable outpatient visits for ILI (1.1–1.3% during this timeframe, repeatedly reported below the 2.6% baseline), support the prediction of subdued ILI occurrence levels despite localized increases.
5. Week25, 2021, is predicted to have 1791 ILI occurrences in Region 6 due to a combination of an increasing historical trend (+106.25 weekly growth) and seasonal suppression effects characteristic of off-season flu dynamics (-25% adjustment). This prediction is further supported by CDC reports indicating unusually low influenza activity, sustained low hospitalization and outpatient rates, and the moderating influence of concurrent public health changes due to COVID-19.
