1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an upward trend with some fluctuations. Starting with 1802 in Week 43, 2021, there was a sharp rise to 2296 in Week 44 and a slight increase to 2297 in Week 45, followed by a noticeable peak of 2658 in Week 46, and then a marginal decline to 2589 in Week 47. This trend demonstrates an overall increase in ILI activity toward the latter weeks of the observed period (Weeks 45–46), indicative of growing respiratory illness activity. 

2. A clear positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is observed. The heightened ILI activity during Weeks 46 and 47 (peaks of 2658 and 2589) aligns with the increase to 6147 occurrences by Week 52, 2021. The upward trajectory in Weeks 46–47 suggests a build-up in ILI trends, serving as a precursor to the significant rise after 5 weeks.

3. Several factors from the summarized reports correlate with the future increase in ILI occurrences:  
   - Outpatient visits for ILI gradually increased from 2.1% in Week 44 to 2.4% in Week 47, approaching the 2.5% national baseline. This incremental rise reflects increasing respiratory illness activity across multiple regions and age groups, particularly among children and young adults (ages 0–4 and 5–24).  
   - Influenza A(H3N2) cases were dominant in detected specimens, comprising over 90% of positive flu cases during Weeks 44–47. This strain's concentrated spread among younger populations (5–24 years) and in localized outbreaks suggests a higher contribution to overall ILI trends.  
   - Deaths from pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, ranging from 14.1% in Week 44 to 15.5% in Week 47. This sustained elevation highlights the compounding impact of multiple respiratory illnesses during the period, contributing to increased ILI activity.

4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 6147 in Week 52, 2021, can be attributed to the overall escalating trend of ILI occurrences during Weeks 46–47, the steady rise in ILI-related outpatient visits approaching the baseline threshold, the dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) cases in key age groups, and the heightened PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds. The alignment of these factors points to a convergence of growing respiratory illness activity leading to the significant increase reported after 5 weeks.
