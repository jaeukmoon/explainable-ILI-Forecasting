1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent downward trend, with values decreasing from 1397 (Week25, 2024) to 874 (Week29, 2024). This decline highlights reduced influenza-like illness activity across this period, with a sharper drop in Week28 and Week29 compared to earlier weeks, indicating suppressed ILI levels by the end of the observed timeframe.
2. A weak correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the continuous declining trend in past ILI occurrences from 1397 to 874 (Weeks25–29, 2024) contrasts with the future occurrences of 785 (Week34, 2024). The further slight reduction suggests only a marginal continuation of the downward trend beyond the observed period.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness remained low, at 1.5% (Week25, 2024) and gradually declining to 1.4% (Weeks26–29, 2024), staying below the baseline throughout. This consistent low activity is in line with suppressed ILI levels, contributing to the observed decline in occurrences.
4. Hospitalization rates for influenza stayed minimal, at 0.2 per 100,000 (Week25, 2024), reducing further to a steady 0.1 per 100,000 during Weeks26–29, 2024. This stable and minimal hospitalization burden reflects the limited impact of ILI throughout the 5 weeks, connecting to the reduced future ILI occurrences.
5. Nationwide clinical testing revealed declining influenza positivity rates, from 1.1% (Week25, 2024) to 0.7% (Week29, 2024). This persistent downtrend in influenza positivity aligns with both the declining past occurrences and the low reported future occurrence level of 785.
6. In summary, the reported future occurrence of 785 (Week34, 2024) is primarily a continuation of the downward trend observed in the past, influenced by sustained reductions in ILI outpatient visits, minimal hospitalization rates, and decreasing nationwide influenza positivity. These factors collectively explain the low value for ILI activity after 5 weeks.
