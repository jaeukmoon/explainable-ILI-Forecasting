1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week31 to Week35, 2022 are 11626, 11715, 13526, 15614, and 15856. The trend indicates a steady increase in ILI cases through this period, with a notable sharp rise starting in Week33, 2022 (13526) and continuing into Week35, 2022 (15856). This presents a clear upward trajectory in the five-week trend without any significant plateauing or decline.
2. Week40, 2022 aligns with the peak onset season based on historical U.S. influenza timing, spanning from Week32/35 to Week46. The increasing activity in Weeks31–35, 2022 supports this classification as the ILI activity shifts from a low baseline level toward climbing rates typical of the onset phase.
3. From a time-series perspective, the sustained increase in ILI counts from Week31 (11626) to Week35 (15856) strongly implies that ILI occurrences will continue growing as the seasonal flu emerges within the peak onset season. Projecting this forward five weeks to Week40, 2022, and maintaining this upward trajectory, the expected value of 18479 reflects a continuation of the rising trend.
4. Surveillance data shows that influenza positivity rates remained low but gradually increased from 0.4% in Week31, 2022 (#1) to 0.6% in Week35, 2022 (#1), indicating slow but steady viral activity increases nationally, consistent with seasonal growth trends.
5. Children aged 0–4 consistently showed the highest rates of outpatient visits for ILI, rising from 6.1% in Week31, 2022 (#5) to 7.2% in Week35, 2022 (#5). This persistent elevation among a key age group suggests increased community spread contributing to growing ILI cases.
6. Hospitalizations due to influenza showed a gradual increase, rising from 506 in Week31, 2022 (#7) to 509 in Week35, 2022 (#6), signifying a shift toward more severe outcomes within the population, aligning with the transition to seasonal flu activity.
7. The projected value of 18479 for ILI occurrences in Week40, 2022 is justified by the observed rising trend in past weeks, the classification of Week40 in the peak onset season, and supportive CDC surveillance data. These factors collectively underscore a continued increase in ILI activity as the flu season progresses toward its peak.
