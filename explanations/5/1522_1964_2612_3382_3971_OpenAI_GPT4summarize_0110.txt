1. The reported ILI counts from Week11 to Week15, 2022 show a consistent and sharp increase: 1522, 1964, 2612, 3382, and 3971. This trend illustrates sustained growth, with significant weekly rises, indicating an upward trajectory in influenza-like illness occurrences over the observed period.
2. Forecasting Week20, 2022 aligns with the off-season period. Although Week20, 2022 may experience some late-season influenza activity, its classification as off-season is consistent with U.S. influenza trends after Week19, which generally shows diminishing activity following localized increases.
3. From a time-series perspective, the significant weekly increases up to Week15, 2022, suggest a peak in activity may occur soon, followed by stabilization. Projecting forward five weeks, a decrease from Week15's sharp growth curve is expected, aligning with historical patterns of decline after peaks or plateaus. This results in the forecasted ILI count of 3551 for Week20, 2022, reflecting sustained but waning activity.
4. Influenza activity has been increasing nationally and regionally, with highest levels observed in central, south-central, and northeast U.S. regions. The ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 complicates attribution to influenza but reinforces overall respiratory illness trends (Week11, 2022 #10; Week13, 2022 #14; Week15, 2022 #13).
5. Vaccine effectiveness against A(H3N2) shows some mismatch due to antigenic differences but remains adequate against B/Victoria strains. Vaccination is ongoing at stable rates, providing moderate population immunity that could slow rapid upward trends (Week11, 2022 #7; Week14, 2022 #8; Week15, 2022 #13).
6. Trends in outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses have increased gradually but remain below baseline thresholds nationally, indicating consistently high levels of respiratory illness without significant surges (Week11, 2022 #4; Week13, 2022 #4; Week15, 2022 #4). This factor suggests steady but slightly declining ILI occurrences over time.
7. The projection of 3551 ILI occurrences for Week20, 2022 reflects the interplay of the initial steep upward trend, tapering vaccine protection, regional variation in influenza activity, and co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses. Collectively, these factors indicate slightly reduced, yet still elevated activity compared to Week15, 2022.
