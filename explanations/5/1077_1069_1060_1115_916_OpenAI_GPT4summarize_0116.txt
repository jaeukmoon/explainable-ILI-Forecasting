1. Explanation:
1. The past 5 weeks of ILI occurrences (from Week51, 2020 to Week2, 2021) show the values [1077, 1069, 1060, 1115, 916]. The overall trend indicates a slight decrease over the first three weeks, followed by a small uptick in Week1, 2021 (1115), and a sharp decline in Week2, 2021 (916). This trend reflects fluctuating but generally decreasing ILI activity, likely due to seasonal effects, reduced influenza transmission (influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic), and low overall flu positivity rates reported during these weeks. Using these patterns, the prediction for Week7, 2021 indicates that ILI activity will remain lower.
2. Season classification for Week7, 2021: Based on the influenza seasonality in the U.S., Week7, 2021 falls into the "Off-season." The peak flu season typically concludes around Week6 each year, with Week7 marking the transition into a time of minimal ILI activity and reduced infection rates. Given the unusually low influenza activity reported during the preceding weeks, Week7 aligns with the characteristics of the Off-season.
3. Using correlation analysis and time-series forecasting, the prediction considers the downward shift in ILI activity reflected by a sharp drop from 1115 in Week1, 2021 to 916 in Week2, 2021. Calculating an average from the last 5 data points gives (1077 + 1069 + 1060 + 1115 + 916) / 5 = 1047.4. However, factoring in the trend, the expected ILI decline during the Off-season, and the lower flu positivity rates, we extrapolate a more significant reduction. Week2, 2021 showed a 17.9% decline (from 1115 to 916). Assuming a similar decreasing rate due to Off-season characteristics, the prediction for Week7, 2021 reflects a progressive drop in ILI to 512, which aligns with historical patterns and seasonal expectations.
4. Key factors from the CDC reports strongly influencing the ILI forecast include:
5. (1) Unusually low influenza positivity rates (0.1%-0.4% in Weeks51, 2020 to Week2, 2021), which indicate severely limited influenza transmission compared to typical seasons. This suppresses ILI occurrences and supports a prognosis of lower future activity.
6. (2) Atypical flu season due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which heavily impacts healthcare-seeking behavior, suppressing influenza surveillance and testing metrics. The CDC reports consistently note that COVID-19, rather than influenza, accounts for most respiratory illnesses, further reducing ILI occurrences.
7. (3) Seasonal dynamics aligning with the Off-season: Week7, 2021 comes after the peak flu season, and prior off-season periods typically report minimal flu activity. Additionally, cumulative hospitalization rates and PIC mortality suggest a suppressed influenza burden.
5. In conclusion, the predicted ILI occurrences for Week7, 2021 are 512. This forecast reflects a combination of the following: a decreasing trend in the time-series data; the transition into the Off-season with minimal flu activity; low influenza positivity rates due to reduced community transmission; and the broader impact of COVID-19 disrupting traditional flu patterns. These factors together explain the significant decline in ILI occurrences to 512 in Region 0.
