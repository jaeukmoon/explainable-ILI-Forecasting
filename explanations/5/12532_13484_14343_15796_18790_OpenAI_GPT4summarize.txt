1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, starting from 12,532 in Week 15, 2022, and steadily increasing to 18,790 in Week 19, 2022. This represents a substantial rise in ILI activity over the observed period, with the largest week-to-week increase occurring between Week 18 (15,796) and Week 19 (18,790), indicative of escalating respiratory illness activity.

2. A strong positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the sharp and consistent rise in ILI cases through Week 15 to Week 19, 2022, aligns with the reported future surge to 17,486 occurrences by Week 24, 2022. The trajectory of steadily increasing activity in the final weeks of the observed period serves as a precursor to the amplified ILI activity recorded after 5 weeks.

3. Several summarized report factors correlate highly with future ILI occurrences:  
   - The percentage of outpatient visits for ILI increased consistently from 2.1% in Week 15, 2022, to 2.4% in Week 19, 2022, after remaining below baseline earlier. This gradual growth reflects heightened ILI-related healthcare interactions, contributing to the future rise.  
   - The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza rose significantly from 9.8 per 100,000 in Week 15 to 14.4 per 100,000 in Week 19, 2022. This increase in severe cases indicates expanded influenza activity impacting future ILI trends.  
   - The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded epidemic thresholds throughout the 5 weeks, rising from 7.1% in Week 15 to 7.5% in Week 19, 2022. This elevated mortality due to respiratory illness underscores the broader impact of viral activity driving future ILI cases.  
   - The regional increase in positivity rates for influenza (e.g., 7.8% in Week 16 to 8.6% in Week 18, 2022) and the dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) (accounting for over 98% of cases across all weeks) suggest robust viral spread fueling ILI trends.

4. In summary, the reported 17,486 future ILI occurrences (Week 24, 2022) are primarily attributable to the consistent upward trend in ILI cases observed in Weeks 15–19, 2022. The increasing outpatient visits, rising hospitalization rates, and sustained PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds further corroborate this trend. The widespread and increasing influenza activity during the observed weeks, along with the dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), directly supports the sharp rise in future ILI cases.
