1. The past time-series ILI occurrences across 5 weeks showed significant fluctuations, ending with an overall increase. Values rose from 1623 (Week43, 2020) to 2139 (Week45, 2020), followed by a slight decrease to 2066 (Week46, 2020). The peak in Week45, 2020, combined with the second-highest value in Week46, 2020, reflects persistent elevated activity near the end of the period, suggesting an increasing pressure on ILI-related healthcare.
2. The upward trend observed toward the end of the past time-series data pairs with the rise to 2028 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks. The observed peak in Week45, 2020, along with sustained elevated values, serves as a precursor to the heightened ILI occurrences in Week48, 2020.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually increased from 1.2% (Week43, 2020) to 1.6% (Week47, 2020), remaining below the national baseline but showing sequential weekly growth. This uptick in ILI healthcare encounters is directly associated with the rise in future ILI outcomes.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, rising from 8.2% (Week43, 2020) to 11.3% (Week47, 2020). This high PIC mortality indicates increased severe respiratory outcomes, likely linked with broader respiratory illness activity contributing to the future ILI rise.
5. The CDC emphasized disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI surveillance systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic across all reports. This instability can cause underreporting during the observed weeks, with a delayed rebound materializing in the future data.
6. Although influenza positivity rates remained low (e.g., 0.2% in Weeks43 and 47, 2020), the CDC anticipated potential increases in flu activity (Week46, 2020). Such potential activity paired with non-specific respiratory illnesses can lead to a delayed surge, explaining the observed jump to 2028 occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 2028 future ILI occurrences align with the past data’s rising trend (especially in Weeks45 and 46, 2020), upward ILI outpatient visits, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, pandemic-related disruptions in surveillance, and expected influenza increases.
