1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating yet overall upward trend, with values of ['2067', '1800', '1802', '2296', '2297']. After a decline from 2067 (Week 41, 2021) to 1800 (Week 42, 2021) and a slight increase to 1802 in Week 43, 2021, there was a sharp rise to 2296 (Week 44, 2021) and stabilization at 2297 (Week 45, 2021). This pattern indicates escalating ILI activity by the latter weeks leading into the projection period.

2. A positive correlation is observed between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the upward trajectory in Weeks 44–45, 2021, correlates with the significant increase to 3957 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 50, 2021). The sharp rise in activity during the final weeks acts as a precursor for the amplified ILI levels reported later.

3. Key factors from the summarized CDC reports also correlate with the jump in future ILI occurrences:
   - Outpatient visits for ILI increased from 1.8% (Week 41, 2021) to 2.1% (Weeks 44–45, 2021). Although still below the national baseline of 2.5%, this steady rise may indicate growing respiratory illness activity, contributing to higher future ILI occurrences.
   - Influenza A(H3N2) cases rose significantly, with public health labs reporting 100% H3N2 positivity in Weeks 44–45, 2021, primarily affecting ages 5–24. This concentration of cases, coupled with outbreaks in specific regions such as Michigan, points to localized drivers of rising ILI cases.
   - PIC mortality rates exceeded epidemic thresholds throughout the period, with Week 41 at 17.5% and declining to 14.4% by Week 45, 2021. The persistent high percentage of deaths due to respiratory illnesses, despite a decreasing trend, reflects underlying respiratory disease burden aligning with future ILI growth.

4. In summary, the reported increase to 3957 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 50, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trend in past ILI activity during Weeks 44–45, increasing outpatient visits for ILI, the regional concentration of Influenza A(H3N2) outbreaks, and persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds. This escalation was likely influenced by localized outbreaks, shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors, and underlying respiratory illness trends.
