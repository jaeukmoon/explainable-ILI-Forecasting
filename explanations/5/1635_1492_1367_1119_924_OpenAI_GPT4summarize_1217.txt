1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values of ['1635', '1492', '1367', '1119', '924']. Starting from 1635 in Week 20, 2024, the trend exhibited a steady reduction to 924 by Week 24, 2024. This downward trajectory highlights a sustained decrease in ILI activity during the observed period, reflecting the overall low influenza activity reported in the CDC summaries.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 769 in Week 29, 2024, correlates with the observed downward trend in past occurrences (Weeks 20–24, 2024), where values consistently decreased. This progressive decline suggests that the reported future occurrence aligns with the continuation of this diminishing trajectory, reaching a lower level by Week 29.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently below the national baseline, with percentages between 2.0% and 1.6% (Weeks 20–24, 2024). The gradual reduction in outpatient visits for ILI reflects declining activity, supporting the low future ILI occurrences. Weekly hospitalization rates dropped significantly, from 0.2 per 100,000 in Week 20, 2024, to 0.1 per 100,000 by Week 24, 2024, further indicating reduced ILI-related severity. Clinical lab positivity for influenza steadily declined from 2% in Week 20, 2024, to 1.4% in Week 24, 2024, reflecting overall decreased influenza circulation.
4. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, was consistently reported across the 5 weeks but did not demonstrate significant fluctuations. The low activity levels of these respiratory illnesses align with the overall declining ILI trend. Minimal antiviral resistance, as noted in Weeks 20–24, 2024, suggests effective treatment options, contributing to the further reduction in respiratory illness burden. The CDC's consistent emphasis on vaccination and the genetic match of current circulating viruses to vaccine components highlight a controlled influenza season, reducing the potential for future ILI spikes.
5. In summary, the reported 769 future ILI occurrences (Week 29, 2024) result from the sustained downward trend in past ILI cases, declining outpatient visits, reduced clinical positivity and hospitalization rates, and the impact of controlled influenza activity with minimal antiviral resistance, effective vaccination, and subdued co-circulating respiratory virus activity.
