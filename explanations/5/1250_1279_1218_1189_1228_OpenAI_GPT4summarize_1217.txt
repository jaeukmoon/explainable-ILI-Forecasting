1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating but overall stable trend, with values of ['1250', '1279', '1218', '1189', '1228']. There was an initial increase from 1250 (Week 40, 2021) to 1279 (Week 41, 2021), followed by a decline to 1189 (Week 43, 2021). A slight recovery to 1228 in Week 44, 2021, shows moderate oscillations in ILI activity during the period.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 1325 align with the generally steady ILI range observed in the 5 preceding weeks, suggesting consistency in transmission dynamics between Weeks 40–44, 2021, and Week 49, 2021. The slight rebound in Week 44, 2021, reflects potential precursors to the reported increase after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed minor fluctuations, from 1.9% in Week 40, 2021, to 2.1% in Week 44, 2021, remaining below the national baseline of 2.5%. However, localized increases noted in specific regions (e.g., Region 7 exceeding the baseline) suggest growing activity that likely contributed to the heightened future ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) detections increased significantly between Weeks 43 and 44, 2021, with over 90% of cases affecting younger age groups (5–24 years) and outbreaks concentrated in specific regions like Michigan. This emerging regional activity likely acted as an accelerator for future ILI occurrences.
5. Behavioral shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic complicated data reporting and care patterns, as noted in all 5 weeks, potentially underestimating immediate ILI activity while creating room for delayed recognition and future spikes in cases. This impact aligns with the elevated future occurrence of 1325 in Week 49, 2021.
6. In summary, the reported 1325 future ILI occurrences (Week 49, 2021) are attributable to the stable but fluctuating trend in Weeks 40–44, slight increases in outpatient ILI visits, regional surges due to Influenza A(H3N2), and pandemic-driven data disruptions amplifying future case recognition.
