1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks reveal a consistent decline: '11653' (Week 52, 2021), '9458' (Week 1, 2022), '7190' (Week 2, 2022), '5344' (Week 3, 2022), and '3944' (Week 4, 2022). This steady decrease indicates waning ILI activity over the observed period, suggesting reduced transmission or healthcare-seeking behaviors by Week 4, 2022.
2. A strong correlation between past and future occurrences is evident, as the continuous decline observed during the past 5 weeks culminates in significantly lower future ILI occurrences (3671 by Week 9, 2022). This sustained reduction aligns with the trend of diminishing ILI activity reported in past weeks.
3. A decline in outpatient respiratory illness visits is observed, from 4.8% (Week 52, 2021) to 2.0% (Week 4, 2022). This drop, coupled with fewer jurisdictions reporting high ILI activity, suggests a broad decrease in respiratory illness, contributing to reduced future occurrences. A reduction in positive influenza test percentages, from 3.8% (Week 52, 2021) to 1.7% (Week 4, 2022), reflects lower flu activity as a significant driver of ILI. The prevalence of COVID-19 and co-circulation with other pathogens, as indicated by PIC deaths consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds (e.g., 19.9% in Week 52, 2021, to 28.6% in Week 4, 2022), may complicate predictions but signifies a shift in respiratory disease burden not fully attributable to ILI. Lower vaccination rates, compared to prior seasons (reported in all weeks), could affect flu seasonality, but the declining ILI trend suggests reduced overall susceptibility or transmission.
4. The future occurrence of 3671 (Week 9, 2022) reflects the continuation of the sharp and sustained downward trend in ILI occurrences observed over the past 5 weeks, supported by decreasing outpatient visits, declining positivity rates, and reduced flu activity across jurisdictions. Other factors, including persistent PIC mortality and low vaccination rates, may add variability, but the overall trajectory supports a significant reduction in ILI cases.
