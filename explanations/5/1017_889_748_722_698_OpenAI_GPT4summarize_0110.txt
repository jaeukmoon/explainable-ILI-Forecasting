1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week24 to Week28, 2023 were 1017, 889, 748, 722, and 698. This trend demonstrates a consistent decline in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks, with no significant spikes or fluctuations. The continued decrease suggests reduced transmission levels and minimal activity.
2. Based on the historical definitions, Week33, 2023 falls into the Peak onset season as it occurs after the off-season period (which ends around Week31) and aligns with the transitional phase when ILI activity may begin to rise towards the peak season.
3. From a time-series forecasting model perspective, the steady decline in ILI occurrences suggests that Week33, 2023 will likely follow an upward adjustment as the Peak onset season begins. Historical patterns indicate that while occurrences might initially remain close to recent off-season lows, they could experience an uptick reflecting seasonal dynamics by Week33. Thus, a projection of 800 future ILI cases aligns with this gradual shift.
4. Influenza positivity rates from Weeks24–28, 2023 have consistently remained low (1.1%, 1.0%, 1.2%, 0.8%, and 0.9%), paired with minimal activity across jurisdictions nationwide. This low baseline activity supports gradual upward movement but does not indicate immediate or significant surges (Week24–28, 2023 #1, #8, #11).
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, continues to influence ILI trends (Week24–28, 2023 #9, #10, #11). These factors complicate precise ILI attribution but are not currently driving significant increases, maintaining subdued levels of activity.
6. Hospitalization and outpatient visit rates are declining, with ILI-related outpatient visits falling from 1.5% in Week24 to 1.2% in Week28, 2023. Hospital admissions for influenza dropped from 779 in Week24 to 689 in Week28. These trends indicate reduced disease severity and broader community spread during the off-season (Week24–28, 2023 #5, #4, #6).
7. Considering the consistent decline in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks, the transition into the Peak onset season post-Week31, and the continued presence of co-circulating respiratory pathogens without significant increases in activity, projecting 800 ILI cases in Week33, 2023 is justified. This aligns with seasonal dynamics and gradual re-emergence of influenza activity characteristic of the Peak onset period.
