1. The past time-series ILI occurrences showed a fluctuating but mostly decreasing trend over the 5-week period, with values of ['1892', '825', '618', '1031', '862'] from Week 5 to Week 9, 2021. A sharp decline occurred from 1892 (Week 5, 2021) to 618 (Week 7, 2021), followed by a modest rebound to 1031 (Week 8, 2021) before settling at 862 (Week 9, 2021). Overall, this inconsistent trend reflects suppressed ILI activity during this time.

2. The correlation between past and future ILI occurrences demonstrates some delayed recovery in ILI activity. While the past time-series data do not display consistent upward momentum, the modest rebound between Week 7 and Week 8 aligns with the future reported increase to 1464 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 14, 2021). This indicates a potential lag effect in respiratory illness reporting or activity resurgence.

3. Several factors from the CDC summarized reports correlate with the future rise in ILI occurrences. First, pediatric ILI trends showed slight increases over several weeks (starting Week 7, 2021), particularly in children aged 0–4 years, which could have driven the observed resurgence in ILI. Second, ongoing disruptions to healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance due to the COVID-19 pandemic were reported consistently in all weeks, potentially delaying recognition and amplifying ILI activity later. Third, historical trends of unusually low influenza activity and cumulative hospitalization rates (e.g., 0.7 per 100,000 by Week 9, 2021) imply underdetection in earlier weeks, which may have been captured in the subsequent weeks. Finally, while influenza positivity remained low (0.1% of respiratory specimens), concurrent COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses might have contributed to delayed ILI spikes.

4. In summary, the future rise to 1464 ILI occurrences (Week 14, 2021) is likely attributable to the slight rebound in past ILI trends (Weeks 7–8, 2021), increasing pediatric ILI cases, pandemic-related constraints on healthcare-seeking and surveillance, inadequate influenza detection earlier in the season, and non-influenza respiratory illnesses contributing to ILI activity. These factors, combined with atypical flu season dynamics, culminated in the reported increase.
