1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week19 to Week23, 2024 are 12644, 12615, 12081, 12014, and 11077. A clear declining trend is observed over the five weeks, showing consistent reductions in ILI occurrences. The data indicates a slow but steady decrease rather than abrupt changes, suggesting stabilization as influenza activity moves deeper into the off-season.
2. In the U.S., the typical off-season spans from the end of the peak season through the beginning of the next peak onset season (Week9, 2024 to Week30, 2024). Week28, 2024 is well within this off-season period, which aligns with the reported low positivity trends and minimal outpatient respiratory visits. Thus, Week28, 2024 is classified as part of the off-season.
3. The historical trend of decreasing ILI occurrences over the past five weeks informs the projection of Week28, 2024 occurrences. The consistent decline suggests that influenza activity is tapering further. Time-series models would extend such a declining pattern forward, adjusted for seasonality and typical off-season baselines. This justifies a future ILI occurrence prediction closer to 10762, consistent with off-season activity.
4. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza, COVID-19, and RSV, continues to contribute to overall respiratory illness trends (Week19, 2024 #9; Week21, 2024 #12; Week23, 2024 #9). These contribute variably but are not driving significant influenza activity spikes in current conditions.
5. Minimal hospitalization and death trends: Weekly hospitalization rates are low at only 0.1-0.2 per 100,000, and influenza-related deaths are steady at 0.1%, with no signs of a resurgence (Week19, 2024 #5, #7; Week23, 2024 #4, #6). Low severity aligns with the forecast of ongoing declines.
6. Vaccination: Although vaccination rates are not specifically highlighted in recent reports, genetic characterization indicates that circulating viruses match vaccine components (Week21, 2024 #10; Week22, 2024 #13). This likely mitigates additional severe cases or sharp increases in spread, especially in the off-season.
7. The decreasing ILI trend (Week19 to Week23, 2024), classification of Week28, 2024 as off-season, stable hospitalization/death rates, co-circulating respiratory trends, and effective vaccine-virus match collectively support the forecast of 10762 ILI occurrences. This aligns with expected off-season baseline fluctuations.
