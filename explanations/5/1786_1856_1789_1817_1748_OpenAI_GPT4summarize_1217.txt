1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited relatively stable values, fluctuating within a narrow range of ['1786', '1856', '1789', '1817', '1748']. This pattern indicates no clear upward or downward trend across Weeks 19–23, 2021, suggesting low and stable ILI activity during this period. Week-to-week variations were minimal, with a maximum deviation of 108 between Weeks 20 (1856) and 23 (1748), further reinforcing the low influenza activity during this timeframe.
2. A correlation between past and future ILI data signifies that despite the consistently low past ILI activity, broader public health dynamics may result in increased ILI occurrences. The future value of 2546 (Week 28, 2021) represents a notable uptick from Week 23 (1748). While the data itself lacks a direct trend indicating such an increase, compounding factors such as potential delayed effects of healthcare patterns linked to COVID-19 or non-influenza respiratory infections could align with this increase.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently below the national baseline of 2.6% across Weeks 19–23, 2021, fluctuating narrowly from 1.1% to 1.3%. While stable, these low values still suggest ongoing respiratory illness activity capable of contributing to the eventual rise in future occurrences. Additionally, disruptions in ILI monitoring systems due to altered healthcare-seeking behavior (Weeks 19–23, 2021) might mask actual trends, leading to underreporting before eventual increases.
4. Persistent elevations in PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds (ranging from 10.1% in Week 19 to 7.6% in Week 23, 2021) ground the overall respiratory illness severity context. Although COVID-19 remains the dominant contributor, elevated PIC mortality percentages reflect an environment where respiratory illnesses, including non-specific ILI cases, sustain a baseline level that could fuel subsequent increases.
5. The minimal influenza circulation reported—evident from 0.1% positive respiratory specimens and sparse lab detections across Weeks 19–23, 2021—underscores reduced flu transmission. However, the concurrent contribution of non-influenza pathogens or secondary respiratory illnesses due to pandemic-related health shifts likely explains the eventual rise in ILI to 2546. Combined with altered data reliability, these factors suggest a potential underestimation of current ILI activity before the sharp future increase.
6. In summary, the increase to 2546 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 28, 2021) can be attributed to underlying respiratory illness activity as seen in consistently elevated PIC mortality, stable ILI-related outpatient visits, and healthcare disruptions skewing ongoing surveillance. While past data shows stability, the eventual rise reflects a delayed impact of non-influenza respiratory pathogens and pandemic healthcare dynamics.
