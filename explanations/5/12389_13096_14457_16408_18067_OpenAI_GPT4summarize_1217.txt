1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['12389', '13096', '14457', '16408', '18067']. This gradual increase began at 12389 (Week42, 2023) and culminated in 18067 (Week46, 2023), representing a near-linear growth pattern. Such a sustained rise suggests an escalation in ILI activity as the period advanced.
2. There is a strong correlation between past and future ILI occurrences. The upward trajectory recorded in the past weeks, culminating with the highest value of 18067 in Week46, 2023, foreshadowed the sharp rise to the reported future occurrence of 29922 after 5 weeks (Week51, 2023). This future surge aligns with the observed momentum in the past trend of increasing ILI cases.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI substantially increased from 2.5% (Week42, 2023) to 3.7% (Week46, 2023), surpassing the national baseline of 2.9% in Week44, 2023. This sustained and accelerating growth is a significant contributor to the future peak in ILI occurrences.
4. The cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rate rose consistently from 0.5 per 100,000 (Week42, 2023) to 2.6 per 100,000 (Week46, 2023), reflecting a progressive strain on healthcare systems and correlating with the increased ILI activity trends.
5. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza during this time, as highlighted in every weekly report, compounded the respiratory illness burden. This co-circulation further drove outpatient visits and hospitalizations, laying the foundation for the future ILI surge to 29922.
6. The rise in influenza positivity rates over the period, from 1.7% (Week42, 2023) to 4.9% (Week46, 2023), with consistently high proportions of Influenza A (primarily A(H1N1)), suggests intensified viral activity contributing to the increase in overall ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 29922 after 5 weeks (Week51, 2023) can be attributed to the consistent upward trend in past ILI occurrences, increasing outpatient visits exceeding baseline levels, escalating hospitalization rates, co-circulating respiratory pathogens, and higher influenza positivity rates over the observed 5-week period.
