1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks consistently showed an upward trend: ['1358', '1759', '1626', '1786', '1856']. After starting at 1358 (Week16, 2021), there was a sharp rise to 1759 (Week17, 2021), followed by a slight decrease to 1626 (Week18, 2021), and then a steady increase to 1786 (Week19, 2021), culminating at 1856 (Week20, 2021). This overall ascending trajectory reflects an intensifying ILI activity over the observed period.
2. The upward movement in past ILI occurrences correlates positively with the future occurrence of 1791 after 5 weeks (Week25, 2021). The peak in Week20, 2021, at 1856 provides a baseline for the sustained elevation in ILI activity, leading to 1791, slightly lower but within a comparable range, suggesting residual high activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI in the summarized CDC reports also displayed a subtle upward trend, rising from 1.1% (Week16, 2021) to 1.3% (Week20, 2021). The stable increase in healthcare encounters indicates an ongoing respiratory illness activity that drives the continuation at elevated levels in Week25, 2021.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) hovered between 11.8% (Week16, 2021) and 9.5% (Week20, 2021), consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds. These persistent PIC mortality levels demonstrate an indirect signal of heightened respiratory illnesses, contributing to sustained future ILI occurrences.
5. Behavioral changes during the COVID-19 pandemic as documented throughout the past 5 weeks disrupted ILI surveillance and data accuracy. With healthcare-seeking affected and traditional monitoring skewed, delayed recognition or reporting of earlier cases likely carried forward, boosting the observed future occurrences at 1791.
6. Despite extremely low influenza virus activity (e.g., only 0.1% positivity across weeks, plus low hospitalization rates), other non-specific respiratory conditions or pathogens likely contributed significantly to the reported ILI levels. Changes in healthcare data capture due to concurrent COVID-19 effects further complicated traditional interpretations.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1791 (Week25, 2021) are attributed to the upward trajectory in past time-series ILI trends, increasing ILI-related outpatient visits, consistently elevated PIC mortality rates, pandemic-induced surveillance challenges, and non-specific respiratory factors amidst continued low influenza virus activity.
