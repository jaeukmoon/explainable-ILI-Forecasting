1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating yet nearly stable trend, ranging from 1714 (Week 5, 2021) to 1532 (Week 9, 2021). There was a slight decrease from 1714 (Week 5, 2021) to 1503 (Week 7, 2021), followed by a modest rebound to 1532 (Week 9, 2021). This pattern reflects minimal change in ILI activity during the observed period, suggesting a low baseline.

2. The correlation between past and future ILI occurrences appears to be influenced by external factors rather than a direct trend. Despite the stable past occurrences, the future increase to 2087 (Week 14, 2021) suggests potential surges driven by external dynamics not strictly reflected in the past data but hinted at in the summarized reports.

3. Minimal ILI activity was consistently reported across all jurisdictions, with ILI outpatient visit percentages remaining significantly below the national baseline (e.g., 1.1% in Week 5 and 0.8% in Week 9, 2021). However, localized increases, such as the slight upward trends in ILI among children aged 0-4 years observed across multiple weeks, may have contributed to the future rise in ILI occurrences.  

4. The impact of pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC)-related deaths remaining elevated (e.g., 25% in Week 5, gradually declining to 14.6% in Week 9) reflects persistent respiratory illness activity amidst the pandemic. As COVID-19-driven PIC mortality dominates, it may signal increased respiratory illness susceptibility, indirectly contributing to the eventual ILI surge to 2087 cases.

5. Altered healthcare-seeking behaviors reported across all weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional ILI monitoring, potentially delaying recognition of accumulated cases. This dynamic likely explains the eventual spike in future occurrences despite continued low positivity rates for influenza.

6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 2087 (Week 14, 2021) can be accredited to the slight increases in pediatric ILI trends, persistent PIC mortality activity, disruptions in traditional healthcare-seeking and surveillance systems, and external respiratory illness dynamics catalyzed by pandemic-related behaviors, which were not immediately apparent in the stable past weeks of low ILI activity.
