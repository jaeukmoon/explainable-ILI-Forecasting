1. The ILI occurrences from Week1 to Week5, 2024 show an initial decline from Week1 (14312) to Week3 (9785), followed by a rebound in Week4 (11429) and Week5 (13019). This trend suggests fluctuating activity with a recent upward trend in ILI reports over the last two weeks, possibly signaling a resurgence driven by post-holiday transmission or changing viral dynamics.
2. In the U.S., the typical peak season spans from about Week46 of one year to Week6 of the next. By Week10, 2024, the peak season is likely nearing its conclusion, transitioning toward the off-season. However, given the uptick in ILI occurrences in recent weeks and CDC projections of a possible second peak, Week10, 2024 aligns more closely with the tail end of the peak season.
3. The past few weeks indicate a fluctuating pattern, with a recent sharp increase in ILI occurrences. By Week5, 2024, ILI activity rose to 13019, about a 35% increase from the recent low in Week3 (9785). Extrapolating this trend, the time-series model anticipates further growth, albeit at a moderated pace over the next five weeks, resulting in the forecasted value of 16477 for Week10, 2024.
4. Influenza activity remains elevated nationwide without a significant drop in positivity; 15.8% of lab specimens tested positive for influenza in Week5, 2024, supporting a continued high level of transmission. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 remains the dominant subtype, contributing to sustained ILI occurrences (Week5, 2024 #1, #3).
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and RSV continues to complicate influenza dynamics. High rates of respiratory co-infections were reported nationally, which likely amplify reported ILI rates (Week5, 2024 #10).
6. Regional trends indicate rising positivity in several areas, particularly in regions 2, 5, 6, 7, and 10. This likely reflects localized transmission hotspots, which could contribute to increasing national ILI counts over subsequent weeks (Week5, 2024 #2).
7. The forecasted ILI value of 16477 for Week10, 2024 reflects the recent upward trend in reported occurrences, ongoing elevated positivity rates nationally, and CDC warnings of potential secondary peaks following the winter holidays. These trends, combined with prevalent co-circulation of respiratory viruses and regional fluctuations, justify a continued high level of ILI activity during the late peak season.
