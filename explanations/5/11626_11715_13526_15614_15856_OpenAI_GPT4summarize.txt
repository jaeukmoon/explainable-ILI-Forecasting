1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a clear upward trend, with values of ['11626', '11715', '13526', '15614', '15856']. Beginning at 11626 (Week 31, 2022), there was a gradual but consistent increase, culminating at 15856 by Week 35, 2022. This steady rise reflects a growing level of ILI activity over the observed weeks.

2. A positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the progression toward the higher ILI levels in the last observed weeks (Week 34-35, 2022) aligns with the further increase to 18479 after 5 weeks (Week 40, 2022). The consistent rise in Weeks 34-35 signals a continuation of this trend, reflected in the amplified levels of future ILI occurrences.

3. Respiratory-related outpatient visits for ILI showed minor but noticeable increases, from 1.5% (Week 31, 2022) to 1.9% (Week 35, 2022). This incremental growth, particularly among children aged 0-4 years with the highest rates (rising from 6.1% in Week 31 to 7.2% in Week 35), parallels the increases in ILI occurrences, underscoring increased morbidity in higher-risk demographics as a contributor to the future rise.

4. Hospitalizations due to ILI also exhibited a steady increase during the observed period, with weekly admissions growing from 506 (Week 31, 2022) to 509 by Week 35, 2022. The consistent rise in hospital-level activity signals an ongoing and expanding burden of severe ILI cases, an indicator that correlates with the higher expected future ILI statistics.

5. Elevated percentages of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) persisted across Weeks 31-35, 2022, consistently surpassing the epidemic threshold of 5.5%. For example, PIC-attributed mortality was 10.0% in Week 31, which remained high at 9.6% by Week 35. This sustained excess mortality underlines heightened respiratory illness activity, aligning with the observed and future ILI surge.

6. The uncertain flu activity outlook and changing healthcare-seeking behavior compound the situation. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, complicated traditional surveillance efforts and may have contributed to delayed recognition of cases, amplifying the observed cumulative rise in ILI occurrences, reaching 18479 by Week 40, 2022.

7. In summary, the increase in the future ILI occurrences (18479 by Week 40, 2022) stems from a steadily rising trend in past ILI occurrences, increased ILI-related outpatient visits and hospitalizations, sustained PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-era disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior and respiratory surveillance systems.
