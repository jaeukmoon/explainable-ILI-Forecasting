1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week23 to Week27, 2024 are 11270, 10231, 9807, 9192, and 7806. This indicates a consistent declining trend over the past five weeks, starting from a relatively higher count in Week23 and ending with a significantly lower count in Week27. The pattern reflects a steady decrease in ILI activity during this time frame without significant fluctuations or spikes.
2. Based on U.S. seasonality, Week32, 2024 marks the beginning of the peak onset season, where ILI activity typically starts to rise from the off-season baseline as influenza transmission begins to increase. Forecasting that Week32, 2024 belongs to the peak onset season aligns with this seasonal classification.
3. The time-series data exhibits a downward trend during Weeks23 to Week27, 2024. However, transitioning into the peak onset season, historical patterns from prior years suggest an uptick in ILI activity is likely to occur. Expecting a moderate rebound in ILI cases due to seasonality and potential increases in viral transmission rates, the projection of 7091 aligns with a slight upward adjustment from the steep decline observed.
4. Nationwide influenza positivity rates have remained low, with Week27 reporting only 0.9% positivity (Week23, Week27 #1), indicating minimal current transmission. However, slight increases may begin as the peak onset season approaches.
5. Vaccine effectiveness remains high, with circulating strains exhibiting high antigenic similarity to vaccine targets (Week25 #8; Week26 #7; Week27 #7). This vaccine congruence may moderate the anticipated rise in ILI cases, keeping them below the historical average for this time period.
6. The influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, persists (Week23 #9; Week24 #9; Week26 #10). Such co-circulation complicates respiratory illness data while potentially contributing to fluctuations in ILI reporting.
7. Combining the observed declining trend from Week23 to Week27, 2024, the seasonal shift into the peak onset period (Week32, 2024), and additional factors such as low positivity, effective vaccines, and co-circulation of respiratory viruses, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 7091 reflects a gradual rebound in activity consistent with historical onset trends.
