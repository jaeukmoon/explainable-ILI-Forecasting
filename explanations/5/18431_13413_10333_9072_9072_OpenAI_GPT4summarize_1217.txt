1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over 5 weeks demonstrated a clear downward trend, with values of ['18431', '13413', '10333', '9072', '9072'], starting from 18431 in Week 3, 2022, and declining steadily to 10333 in Week 5, 2022. The trend plateaus at 9072 in Weeks 6 and 7, 2022, suggesting a stabilization of ILI activity at lower levels by the end of the 5-week period.
2. Despite the significant decline in past ILI occurrences over the observed weeks, the future ILI reports of 9475 in Week 12, 2022, reflect a slight increase from the plateau observed in Week 7, 2022, suggesting a shift in activity likely influenced by external factors highlighted in the reports rather than continuity of the declining trend.
3. Hospitalization rates for respiratory illnesses exhibited consistent increases, rising from 4.3 per 100,000 in Week 3, 2022, to 4.9 per 100,000 in Week 7, 2022. This escalating trend, coupled with higher hospitalizations among vulnerable populations (adults aged 65+ and children), suggests underlying disease activity contributing to the post-5-week increase in reported ILI.
4. Influenza testing positivity rates displayed sporadic but overall ascending trends, rising from 1.9% in Week 3, 2022, to 4.2% in Week 7, 2022, driven mainly by Influenza A(H3N2). This gradual increase in flu positivity reflects rising viral activity, which likely influenced the future ILI occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, highlighted during Weeks 3–7, 2022, and lower vaccination coverage underscored throughout the reports, created susceptibility to spikes in ILI activity, further contributing to the observed rise to 9475 future ILI occurrences in Week 12, 2022.
6. In summary, the observed 9475 future ILI occurrences (Week 12, 2022) can be attributed to the stabilization of ILI activity at lower levels by Week 7, 2022, concurrent increases in hospitalization rates and flu positivity, significant co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, and low vaccination coverage, which collectively influenced the moderate resurgence in ILI trends post the 5-week period.
