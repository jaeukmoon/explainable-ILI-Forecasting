1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week11, 2024 to Week15, 2024 are 19661, 17840, 16878, 16091, and 15163. The trend shows a consistent and steady decline over the past five weeks, suggesting a waning activity of influenza-like illness. This decline aligns with the seasonal reduction expected after peak influenza activity during the winter months. No significant spikes or anomalies were recorded.
2. Based on the season classification, Week20, 2024 falls during the off-season period for influenza activity in the U.S., occurring well after the typical peak season window (Week46 to approximately Week6). This classification is further supported by the declining influenza test positivity rates and below-baseline outpatient respiratory illness visits in the past weeks. Hence, Week20, 2024 corresponds to the off-season.
3. The declining pattern in ILI occurrences observed in Week11 to Week15, 2024 indicates a consistent downtrend in case numbers. Time-series forecasting based on this trend suggests a continued reduction in ILI activity over the next five weeks. The sustained decline and absence of any reversal or spike in the data provide a basis for projecting that Week20, 2024 will exhibit lower ILI occurrences compared to Week15, 2024, specifically 12615.
4. The emergence of co-circulating respiratory viruses, such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2, remains significant but does not present substantial drivers for an influenza resurgence (Week11, 2024 #10; Week12, 2024 #8; Week14, 2024 #8). These factors contribute to overall respiratory illness but coincide with declining influenza activity.
5. Vaccination coverage and antiviral effectiveness are critical in mitigating future cases (Week11, 2024 #8; Week12, 2024 #9; Week15, 2024 #6). CDC reports confirm the circulating influenza strains are well-matched to the seasonal vaccine, and antiviral drugs showed minimal resistance, which likely contributes to the steady decrease in ILI rates.
6. Declining national hospitalization rates for influenza, reduced subtyped positivity rates, and low influenza-attributed deaths reinforce the downward trend in flu activity (Week12, 2024 #3; Week14, 2024 #4; Week15, 2024 #4, #5). Such indicators reflect limited influenza burden and forecast ongoing reductions in ILI occurrence.
7. In summary, the consistent decline in ILI occurrences over recent weeks, off-season timing (Week20, 2024), sustained vaccine and antiviral effectiveness, and lack of significant novel variant emergence collectively justify the projected ILI occurrence of 12615 for Week20, 2024.
