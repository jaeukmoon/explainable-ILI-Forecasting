1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a steady and significant upward trend, starting at 2088 (Week 43, 2020) and progressively increasing to 3017 (Week 47, 2020). This represents a consistent rise in occurrences, with the largest week-over-week increase occurring between Week 45 (2399) and Week 46 (2830). The overall pattern suggests a sharp escalation in ILI activity.
2. A strong positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident as the trend of consistent increases, particularly substantial in the latter weeks (Weeks 46–47, 2020), culminates in the future value of 2836 occurrences by Week 52, 2020. Notably, the slope of the past data aligns closely with the reported future outcome.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily increased from 1.2% in Week 43 to 1.6% in Week 47, 2020, reflecting growing healthcare encounters for respiratory illnesses. This gradual rise indicates expanding ILI activity, which likely translated into higher future occurrences.
4. Persistent deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) significantly exceeded epidemic thresholds each week, climbing from 8.2% in Week 43 to a high of 11.3% in Week 47, 2020. This sustained elevation in PIC mortality signals an amplified burden of respiratory illnesses, correlating with the future increase in ILI occurrences.
5. The COVID-19 pandemic's ongoing impact on healthcare-seeking behavior, as reported across the weeks, disrupted traditional ILI surveillance, potentially leading to underreported cases in prior weeks that materialized sharply in future data.
6. Although positivity rates for influenza remained minimal (e.g., 0.2% in Week 43 and Week 47, 2020), the increase in ILI occurrences suggests contributions from other respiratory pathogens or behavioral/reporting artifacts amid the pandemic. Low positivity but rising activity hints at a broader impact on non-specific ILI trends.
7. In summary, the reported 2836 future ILI occurrences (Week 52, 2020) can be explained by the consistent upward trend in prior weeks, rising ILI-related outpatient visits, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-driven shifts in surveillance and healthcare utilization. This reflects a cumulative impact of escalating occurrences and healthcare challenges from the preceding weeks.
