1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but overall upward trend, with values of ['1396', '1702', '1472', '1860', '1961']. There was a notable rise from 1396 (Week43, 2023) to 1702 (Week44, 2023), followed by a slight drop to 1472 in Week45, 2023. However, the next weeks revealed a sustained increase to 1860 (Week46, 2023) and then 1961 (Week47, 2023), the highest in the period, indicating a persistent rise in activity by Week47, 2023.
2. A strong positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is demonstrated, as the escalation observed from Week46 to Week47, 2023, aligns with the reported jump to 4320 future occurrences by Week52, 2023. The progression toward higher ILI values by Week47 signals the beginning of a sharper increase reflected in the future data.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI also showed progressive growth, moving from 2.7% (Week43, 2023) to 3.9% (Week47, 2023), steadily surpassing the national baseline of 2.9% and reflecting increased respiratory illness activity. This consistent rise suggests substantial contributions to future ILI numbers.
4. Rising hospitalization rates associated with influenza underscore the heightened severity of respiratory illnesses. This rose from 0.8 per 100,000 in Week43 to 3.7 per 100,000 in Week47, 2023, with elderly adults (65+ years) driving the highest increases. These trends strongly correlate with the continued illness surge observed in future occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses like RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza through Weeks43–47, 2023, played a significant role in amplifying respiratory illnesses and related healthcare visits, as highlighted in CDC reports. Such compounding impacts were pivotal in boosting future ILI occurrences to 4320.
6. In summary, the reported 4320 future ILI occurrences (Week52, 2023) can be attributed to the upward trajectory in Weeks46–47, 2023, increasing outpatient ILI visits, surging hospitalization rates, and the compounded effect of co-circulating respiratory viruses across the observed period.
