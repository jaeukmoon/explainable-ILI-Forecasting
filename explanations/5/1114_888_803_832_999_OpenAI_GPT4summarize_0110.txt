1. The past ILI occurrences (Week5 to Week9, 2022: 1114, 888, 803, 832, 999) demonstrate a fluctuating but generally declining trend until Week8, followed by a slight increase in Week9. While there is no consistent significant upward or downward trajectory, the observed changes indicate moderate variability.
2. Week14, 2022 falls within the off-season as it occurs well after the typical peak season (Week46 through Week6) and no indicators from the preceding weeks suggest a late-season surge. Sporadic levels of influenza activity (Week9, 2022 #1; Week7, 2022 #1) also reinforce this classification.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the fluctuating but generally declining ILI occurrences followed by Week9’s slight increase predicts a regression toward stability. Based on these trends, the model projects a moderate decline in future occurrences, balancing fluctuations and historical patterns, resulting in a forecast of 972 occurrences for Week14, 2022.
4. The steady dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) (Week5, 2022 #2; Week7, 2022 #2; Week9, 2022 #2) and antigenic differences from the vaccine may reduce vaccine effectiveness and lead to modest but not severe activity increases.
5. Low flu vaccination coverage compared to prior seasons (Week5, 2022 #8; Week7, 2022 #8; Week8, 2022 #8) continues to influence susceptibility in the population, despite vaccine availability and CDC recommendations.
6. Increasing flu positivity rates (Week5, 2022 #1; Week6, 2022 #1; Week9, 2022 #1) and rising hospitalizations (Week9, 2022 #6) suggest ongoing influenza presence but do not indicate a sharp uptick in ILI, aligning with the off-season characterization.
7. Taking into account the fluctuating trends of ILI reports, off-season timing (Week14), geographic variability in activity, increasing flu positivity, low vaccine coverage, and mild antigenic mismatches, the model reasonably forecasts an ILI occurrence of 972 for Week14, 2022.
