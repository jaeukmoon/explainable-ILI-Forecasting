1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a steady and significant upward trend, with values of ['16160', '17810', '18374', '19370', '21978']. Starting from 16160 (Week 39, 2023), there was an increase in ILI occurrences week after week, culminating in 21978 (Week 43, 2023), which represents a sustained growth trajectory over this period. This pattern signals consistent escalation in ILI activity, likely influenced by growing respiratory viral activity.
2. A strong positive correlation is observed between the upward trend in past ILI occurrences and the increase to 30264 future ILI occurrences by Week 48, 2023. The compounded weekly increases leading to 21978 in Week 43 served as a baseline, predicting continued growth over the next 5 weeks and aligning with the eventual sharp rise in ILI occurrences.
3. The percentage of outpatient visits for ILI rose steadily from 2.1% (Week 39, 2023) to 2.7% (Week 43, 2023), indicating increased healthcare-seeking for respiratory illness. This consistent rise in ILI-related visits correlates with the anticipated peak in future ILI counts.
4. A significant increase in hospitalization rates was evident, climbing from 0.1 per 100,000 in Week 40 to 0.8 per 100,000 by Week 43, with weekly hospitalizations rising from 1127 (Week 40) to 1607 (Week 43). This reflects heightened ILI severity and health system impact, suggesting a direct contribution to elevated future ILI occurrences.
5. Regional variations in ILI activity intensified, with moderate-to-high activity reported in increasing jurisdictions, growing from a few areas in Week 39 to six moderate and two high-activity jurisdictions by Week 43, 2023. This regional expansion further aligns with rising future ILI cases, signaling geographically spread-out influenza transmission.
6. In summary, the reported 30264 future ILI occurrences (Week 48, 2023) can be attributed to the clear upward trajectory in past ILI data, increasing outpatient visits and hospitalizations for respiratory illness, and geographic intensification of ILI activity. These factors collectively exacerbate the burden of ILI occurrences, explaining the sharp rise in future cases.
