1. The ILI counts from Week40 to Week44, 2023 are 10136, 10629, 12389, 13096, and 14457. The data show a consistent upward trend, with weekly increases in occurrences. This steady rise indicates an active progression toward higher transmission levels, reflecting escalating influenza-like illness activity over the past five weeks.
2. In the U.S., the target week (Week49, 2023) falls into the typical peak season, which usually spans from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the following year. The steady increases in ILI counts (Week40–Week44, 2023) and CDC's expectations for rising flu activity (Week44, 2023 #9) support classifying Week49, 2023 as part of the peak season.
3. Analyzing the time-series data, the consistent growth in ILI counts from Week40 to Week44 suggests a robust seasonal progression toward a peak. Extrapolating from this pattern and accounting for the ongoing rise in respiratory activity, it is consistent with forecasting further increases over the next five weeks, culminating in 22,735 ILI occurrences in Week49.
4. Nationwide influenza activity shows increasing positivity rates, rising from 1.1% in Week40 to 3.0% by Week44, with growth anticipated to persist into the coming weeks (Week44, 2023 #1, #9).
5. Hospitalization rates have shown consistent weekly increases, reaching 1.2 per 100,000 in Week44—the second-highest for this point in the season since 2010 (Week44, 2023 #3). This trend aligns with the anticipated peak season rise in ILI occurrences.
6. Despite the presence of co-circulating respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2, no novel influenza-like virus detections were reported (Week44, 2023 #6). This stability allows a clearer forecast based primarily on rising influenza activity.
7. Given the consistent upward trajectory in past ILI data, alignment with the peak influenza season timeline, and CDC projections of continued increases in flu activity, outpatient visits, and hospitalizations, the forecast of 22,735 ILI cases for Week49, 2023 is justified.
