1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week24 to Week28, 2024, are 10231, 9807, 9192, 7806, and 8129. The data exhibits a consistent downward trend from Week24 (10231) to Week28 (8129), although there is a slight rebound between Week27 (7806) and Week28 (8129). This overall reduction with minor fluctuations suggests declining activity rather than a resurgence.
2. Forecasting that Week33, 2024, belongs to the off-season aligns with historical seasonality and current CDC-reported indicators. The U.S. off-season commonly extends through Week31 to Week32 each year, and with influenza activity remaining low as of Week28, 2024, the target week is best classified within the off-season.
3. Past trends indicate a significant drop in ILI occurrences over Weeks24 to Week28, 2024. This consistent decline suggests a projected continuation of low ILI counts into Week33, 2024, albeit at a stabilized or minimally fluctuating level, given the slight rebound in Week28. Time-series forecasting supports this gradual decline with minimal perturbation, justifying the ILI estimate of 7319 occurrences in Week33, 2024.
4. Influenza positivity rates consistently decreased over these weeks, with Week24 reporting 1.4%, which reduced steadily to 0.8% in Week28 (#1 of each report). This low positivity correlates directly with reduced ILI occurrences in the upcoming weeks.
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory illnesses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, was noted, though influenza activity remains secondary among respiratory viruses per the CDC’s summarized reports for Week24 to Week28, 2024 (#9-#10 of each week). The dominance of mild influenza subtypes (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Victoria lineage), alongside high vaccine strain similarity and minimal antiviral resistance, promotes a decreased influenza burden (#3, #9 of each report).
6. Hospitalization and mortality rates due to influenza remained exceptionally low throughout the monitoring period (Week24 to Week28, 2024) (#5-#6). These trends highlight the stable influenza season with no significant surges in severe cases to influence future ILI occurrences. Furthermore, the low outpatient visit percentages (roughly 1.4%-1.6%) underline manageable community transmission levels (#4).
7. Combining the broadly declining ILI patterns, low influenza positivity rates, minimized impact from hospitalizations and deaths, effective vaccine coverage, and off-season classification, the projected ILI occurrences for Week33, 2024, are rationalized at 7319, reflecting consistent low-level activity during this period of reduced influenza prevalence.
