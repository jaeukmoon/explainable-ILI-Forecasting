1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed fluctuating trends, starting at 1124 (Week 40, 2021) and decreasing to 969 by Week 42, 2021. This was followed by a steady increase to 1008 (Week 43, 2021) and then to 1084 (Week 44, 2021). While there was an initial decline, the increase in the last two weeks suggests renewed growth in ILI activity.

2. A correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the uptick in Weeks 43 and 44, 2021, aligns with the continued rise to 1772 future ILI occurrences by Week 49, 2021. The upward movement in late past-week data seems to serve as the basis for the amplified ILI activity observed after 5 weeks.

3. Outpatient ILI visits increased modestly from 1.8% in Week 41 to 2.1% in Week 44, 2021, with some regions (e.g., Region 7) exceeding the baseline. This increase in ILI-related medical consultations reflects heightened ILI activity, likely contributing to the rise in future occurrences.

4. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained above the epidemic threshold across Weeks 40–44, 2021, though the percentage decreased from 18.0% in Week 40 to 14.1% in Week 44, 2021. This persistent PIC mortality underscores an ongoing burden of respiratory illnesses, aligning with the increased future ILI cases.

5. The marked emergence of localized Influenza A(H3N2) outbreaks, particularly in regions affecting younger age demographics (5–24 years), and the gradual increase in positive influenza detections (e.g., clinical lab positivity rates rose from 0.1% in Week 40, 2021, to 0.3% in Week 44, 2021) indicate an upward trend in influenza spread, which may have synergistically amplified ILI activity in the following weeks.

6. Other respiratory viruses co-circulating with influenza and COVID-19, and the disruption of traditional healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the pandemic, created complexities in ILI surveillance and reporting. These factors could lead to delay or underestimation of current ILI trends, amplifying reported future occurrences as surveillance catches up.

7. In summary, the reported 1772 future ILI occurrences (Week 49, 2021) reflect the convergence of factors including the upward trend in ILI occurrences in Weeks 43 and 44, 2021, increased ILI-related outpatient visits, persistent PIC mortality rates, localized influenza outbreaks (A(H3N2)), and the compounding effects of pandemic-driven healthcare and surveillance disruptions.
