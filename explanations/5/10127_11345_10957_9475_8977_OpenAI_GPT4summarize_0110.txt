1. The reported ILI counts from Week4 to Week8, 2024 are 10127, 11345, 10957, 9475, and 8977. The trend shows an initial rise from Week4 (10127) to Week5 (11345), followed by a gradual decline from Week6 (10957) to Week8 (8977). This represents a transition from moderate activity during the peak season to declining levels indicative of the approaching off-season.
2. Considering the influenza activity timeline in the U.S., Week13, 2024 falls within the off-season, as it is beyond the typical peak season (Week46 to Week6) and aligns with the declining trend in ILI occurrences. Thus, Week13, 2024 can be forecasted as part of the off-season.
3. From a time-series perspective, projections indicate that the observed downward trend from Week6 (10957), Week7 (9475), and Week8 (8977) will persist, suggesting continued gradual reduction in cases. Combined with the seasonal transition to off-season, this trend supports forecasting an ILI count of 5003 for Week13, 2024.
4. Influenza positivity has been steadily decreasing over the past weeks, with clinical lab test positivity rates dropping from 16.2% in Week4, 2024, to 14.2% in Week8, 2024. This reduced positivity rate, coupled with an off-season context, supports the expected decline in cases.
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2, has impacted overall respiratory illness trends but has not caused a significant uptick in ILI (Week4 #8, Week5 #10, Week7 #9, Week8 #10). These co-infections contribute to stable but declining ILI activity rather than significant growth.
6. Vaccination efforts remain ongoing, with CDC strongly encouraging vaccinations throughout the season (Week4 #7, Week6 #7, Week7 #7). This ongoing vaccination drive likely mitigates severe influenza outcomes and lowers ILI occurrences over time.
7. In summary, the declining trend in ILI counts, the seasonal transition to off-season as of Week13, 2024, the waning influenza positivity rates, the stabilizing effect of vaccination, and the lack of significant impact from respiratory co-infections collectively justify the forecasted ILI count of 5003 for Week13, 2024.
