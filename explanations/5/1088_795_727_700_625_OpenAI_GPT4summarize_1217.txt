1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, moving from 1088 in Week17, 2024, to 625 in Week21, 2024, with sequential values of 795, 727, and 700 in between. This clear downward trend indicates a steady decrease in ILI activity over the observed period, consistent with the summarized reports highlighting declining influenza trends nationwide.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The steady decline in ILI cases during Weeks 17–21, 2024, contrasts with the relatively lower future occurrence of 330 after 5 additional weeks (Week26, 2024). The decreasing trend in the preceding weeks likely set the stage for a continuation of subdued ILI activity into the future period.
3. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza consistently decreased from 3.9% in Week17, 2024, to 1.7% in Week21, 2024. This persistent reduction in positivity rates suggests diminishing flu transmission and closely aligns with the future decrease to 330 ILI occurrences.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline, starting from 2.2% in Week17 and decreasing to 1.9% in Week21, demonstrating sustained low ILI-related healthcare engagement, contributing to low future occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, likely diluted the impact of influenza in driving ILI activity, as indicated in all weekly reports. This multifactorial suppression of ILI-related trends contributed to the low future occurrence.
6. Mortality attributed to influenza steadily decreased, from 0.2% in Week17 to 0.1% in Week21, alongside stable or declining hospitalization rates. These indicators of milder disease activity further justify the drop to 330 ILI occurrences in Week26, 2024.
4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence of 330 (Week26, 2024) reflects the consistent downward trend in Weeks 17–21, 2024, as evidenced by declining ILI reports, reductions in positive influenza specimens, low and decreasing outpatient ILI visits, suppressed co-circulating respiratory illness activity, and milder clinical outcomes documented in reports. Together, these factors logically explain the observed decline to 330.
