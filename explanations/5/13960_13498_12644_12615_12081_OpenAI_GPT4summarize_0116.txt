1. The ILI occurrences of the past 5 weeks show a consistent downward trend: Week17 (13,960) to Week21 (12,081). Week18 saw a drop of 462 (-3.31%), Week19 a drop of 854 (-6.33%), Week20 a small decline of 29 (-0.23%), and Week21 by 534 (-4.24%). This indicates a declining trend in flu activity over the 5 weeks with a progressively stabilizing rate of decrease. Using the average week-on-week percentage reduction over these weeks (~3.78%) and extending the trend forward, we estimate ILI occurrences in Week26 as follows: starting from Week21 (12,081), applying a 3.78% decrease for each subsequent week (Week22: ~11,621, Week23: ~11,183, Week24: ~10,764, Week25: ~10,364, Week26: ~9,984). Aligning this trend with adjusted external factors indicates stabilization above this naive projection.
2. Season classification: Week26, 2024 belongs to the "off-season." According to established influenza trends for the United States, the off-season spans from early February (after the peak season ends) to mid-to-late summer. Given the consistent decline and low activity reported in preceding weeks, Week26 aligns with this minimal ILI activity period when illnesses generally remain near baseline.
3. Correlation analysis between past trends and future ILI occurrences confirms the relevance of the observed decline. Historically, ILI occurrences follow a seasonal trend where off-season sees gradual reductions or plateaus. The downward trajectory in the past 5 weeks aligns with historical patterns, suggesting ILI activity is unlikely to deviate significantly upward. Additionally, the slower rate of decrease in Week20 and Week21 (~4.24% compared to earlier ~6% drops) implies a flattening curve—this stabilization near a baseline supports predictions of sustained low ILI occurrences.
4. Three CDC-reported factors strongly influence this forecast:
5. 1) Declining influenza activity nationally, with clinical lab specimen positivity rates dropping from 3.9% in Week17 to 1.7% by Week21, reinforces a slowing infection rate heading into the off-season. This decline aligns quantitatively with the historic off-season downward trajectory, contributing to the prediction of 10,087 cases, adjusted closer to stabilized decline.
6. 2) Minimal changes in outpatient ILI visits (2.2% in Week17 to 1.9% in Week21), all remaining below the baseline nationally and regionally, indicate reduced flu transmission. This stability further supports the notion that ILI cases will remain minimal.
7. 3) Ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., COVID-19, RSV) may compete with or reduce influenza transmission rates, culminating in further suppression during the off-season.
5. The forecast for Week26, 2024 (10,087) blends statistical trends and CDC-reported context. A persistently declining trend in ILI cases, classification of Week26 within the off-season, historical model patterns, and external factors like vaccination stabilization and competing respiratory illnesses collectively justify the prediction. The adjusted rate of decline reconciles typical off-season behavior with current epidemiological data.
