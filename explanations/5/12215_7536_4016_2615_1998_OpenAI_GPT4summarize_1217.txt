1. The past time-series ILI occurrences show a consistent and sharp decline from 12215 (Week 52, 2021) to 1998 (Week 4, 2022), with values decreasing significantly each week (12215 → 7536 → 4016 → 2615 → 1998). This sharp reduction in ILI reflects a steep drop in activity during this five-week period.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 2040 (Week 9, 2022) display a subtle increase from the lowest point of 1998 (Week 4, 2022). This indicates a stabilization in ILI activity, with a slight uptick after the sharp decrease, likely influenced by persistent regional variations and prolonged influenza activity mentioned in reports for Weeks 3 and 4, 2022.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses showed a consistent decline over the weeks, from 4.8% in Week 52, 2021, to 2.0% in Week 4, 2022, with ILI activity dropping below baseline by Week 4. The decline in visits supports the downward trend in occurrences but suggests sporadic activity that may have contributed to the slight rise to 2040 after 5 weeks.
4. Cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza, while steadily increasing (2.6 per 100,000 in Week 52, 2021, to 4.4 per 100,000 in Week 4, 2022), remained lower than pre-COVID seasons. This steady rate, coupled with sporadic influenza activity, indicates sustained illness intensity correlating with the future ILI count.
5. Lower vaccination rates, as repeatedly emphasized in the reports, likely contributed to extended regional influenza activity. The regional variability in activity, ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2, and emerging antigenic differences in Influenza A(H3N2) collectively align with the stabilization and slight rise in occurrences to 2040 in Week 9, 2022.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 2040 (Week 9, 2022) aligns with the past trend of steep decline followed by stabilization (Weeks 52, 2021–4, 2022), regional variations in sporadic activity, consistent hospitalization rates, declining outpatient visits, and the persistent influence of lower vaccination rates and co-circulation of respiratory pathogens.
