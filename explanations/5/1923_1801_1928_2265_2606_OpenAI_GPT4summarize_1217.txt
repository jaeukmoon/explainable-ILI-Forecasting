1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5-week period showed a consistent upward trajectory, with values of ['1923', '1801', '1928', '2265', '2606']. Starting from 1923 in Week31, 2022, and decreasing slightly to 1801 in Week32, 2022, the trend reversed sharply from Week33 to Week35, 2022, culminating at 2606 in Week35, 2022, the highest value during this interval. This steady increase toward the latter weeks of the observed period indicates an escalation in ILI activity.
2. The steadily increasing trend observed in the final weeks of past occurrences (Weeks 34-35, 2022) correlates positively with the reported future ILI value of 8852 after 5 weeks. The sharp rise in Weeks 34-35 acts as a precursor and predictive indicator of the substantial increase in ILI activity after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI saw a gradual climb over the 5 weeks, from 1.5% in Week31 to 1.9% in Week35, 2022, consistently below baseline yet showing a rising trend. The highest rates were consistently observed among children aged 0-4 years, peaking at 7.2% in Week35, 2022. This increase in ILI-related outpatient visits supports the subsequent surge in ILI occurrences.
4. Weekly hospitalizations due to influenza also continuously increased, from 506 in Week31, 2022, to 509 in Week35, 2022, reflecting a gradual intensification of moderate-to-severe influenza cases. This upward trend in hospitalizations corresponds closely with the heightened future ILI occurrences.
5. Increasing percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) indicate the persistent impact of respiratory illnesses. PIC mortality remained above the epidemic threshold of 5.5% throughout the period, ranging from 10.0% in Week31 to 9.6% in Week35, dominated by COVID-19 but with some contribution from influenza. This consistent respiratory disease burden aligns with surging ILI activity.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens (e.g., Influenza A, H3N2, SARS-CoV-2) and altered healthcare behaviors during the post-pandemic recovery directly influenced ILI trends, creating an unpredictable trajectory. Low positivity rates in clinical specimens (<0.6% in all weeks), contrasted with increasing symptomatic cases, highlight the multiplex effect of reporting and healthcare-seeking changes affecting future data.
7. In summary, the reported 8852 future ILI occurrences can be explained by the steadily increasing trends in ILI cases across Weeks 34-35, 2022, rising ILI-related outpatient visits, heightened hospitalizations, consistently high PIC mortality, and the compounding effects of co-circulating pathogens and pandemic-driven healthcare changes.
