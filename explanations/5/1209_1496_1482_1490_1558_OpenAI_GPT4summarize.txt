1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall upward trend, beginning at 1209 (Week 13, 2021) and culminating at 1558 (Week 17, 2021). While there was a minor dip from 1496 (Week 14, 2021) to 1482 (Week 15, 2021), the trend resumed its incline through Weeks 16 (1490) and 17 (1558). This steady rise toward the end of the observed period suggests a potential continuation of increasing ILI activity in subsequent weeks.

2. A positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the observed consistent increase during Weeks 16 and 17, 2021, aligns with the future reported rise to 1504 occurrences after 5 weeks. The heightened activity in the latter weeks of the past data serves as a precursor to the continued elevation in ILI numbers.

3. Stability in outpatient ILI visits, persistently at 1.1% across Weeks 14–17, 2021, below the national baseline of 2.6%, reflects underlying respiratory illness activity amidst fluctuating influenza surveillance patterns, which likely influenced the observed future ILI rise.  
Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained high, consistently above epidemic thresholds (ranging from 11.2% in Week 14, 2021, to 11.7% in Week 17, 2021) and driven primarily by COVID-19, signaling elevated respiratory illness burden that correlates with the future ILI trend.  
Ongoing disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, compounded by changes in data interpretation standards reported weekly by the CDC, likely impacted ILI surveillance and reporting, leading to a delayed recognition of ILI cases that surfaced as the increase to 1504.  

4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1504 (Week 22, 2021) can be attributed to the observed upward trend in ILI occurrences nearing the end of Week 17, 2021; stable but impactful outpatient ILI visits; persistently high PIC mortality; and pandemic-driven disruptions in healthcare behavior and surveillance. These trends collectively suggest a continuation of heightened ILI activity into the future period.
