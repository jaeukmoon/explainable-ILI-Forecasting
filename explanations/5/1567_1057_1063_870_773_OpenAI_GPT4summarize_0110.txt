1. The ILI occurrences from Week4, 2022 to Week8, 2022 show a clear decreasing trend: 1567, 1057, 1063, 870, and 773. After a significant drop from Week4 (1567) to Week5 (1057), the decline continues consistently, albeit at a slower pace, reaching its lowest at Week8 (773). No notable spikes or fluctuations are observed, indicating a steady decline in ILI activity.
2. Week13, 2022 falls well beyond the typical peak season in the U.S., which spans from Week46 of the prior year to Week6 of the current year. Considering the consistent decline in ILI activity (Week4, 2022 to Week8, 2022) and low positivity in surveillance data, Week13, 2022 is most consistent with the off-season.
3. Based on past ILI occurrences and a time-series trajectory, the observed steady decline suggests a continuation of reduced activity into Week13, 2022. While the decrease slows over time, no indicators suggest an impending spike. Using this gradual decline as a predictor, the model forecasts a modest increase to 1117 ILI occurrences, reflecting stabilization near off-season baselines.
4. Low vaccination coverage compared to previous seasons and the lower vaccine uptake are evident (Week4, 2022 #6; Week5, 2022 #8; Week6, 2022 #8; Week7, 2022 #8; Week8, 2022 #8), potentially moderating a sharper decline in ILI cases.
5. Antigenic differences in circulating Influenza A(H3N2) strains from the vaccine strain persist, with evolutionary changes reducing the vaccine’s effectiveness (Week5, 2022 #10; Week6, 2022 #10; Week8, 2022 #8).
6. Despite sporadic increases in influenza activity in some regions, the overall positivity rate remains stable and low nationally (Week4, 2022 #3; Week5, 2022 #3, #9; Week6, 2022 #3, #9; Week7, 2022 #3, #9; Week8, 2022 #3, #9), supporting predictions of limited nationwide ILI activity.
7. In conclusion, the consistent downward trend in ILI counts, the classification of Week13, 2022 as off-season, limited vaccine effectiveness due to antigenic mismatches, and low vaccination rates collectively project a stabilization of ILI occurrences at 1117. This reflects ongoing but moderated off-season influenza activity with no expected sudden surges.
