1. The reported ILI counts from Week12 to Week16, 2022 are 1931, 1902, 1977, 2104, and 2309. The data shows a steady upward trend in ILI occurrences, with a continuous increase in the last three weeks (Week14 to Week16, 2022). This suggests moderately rising transmission and growing activity levels within the analyzed timeframe.
2. Week21, 2022 belongs to the off-season. In the U.S., the off-season typically spans after the peak season up to the next peak onset. Even though influenza activity is increasing (Week16, 2022 #1), the trend remains below expected peak thresholds (Week12 to Week16, 2022 #4, #6, #9). Therefore, the timing of Week21, 2022 corresponds to the off-season.
3. Based on the time-series trend analysis, the consistent week-by-week increase in ILI values (Week14 to Week16, 2022) implies a progression toward moderately higher activity over the next several weeks. Extrapolating this pattern to Week21, 2022, a value of 3593 ILI occurrences is consistent with a continued slow but measurable upward trajectory.
4. Several distinct factors from the CDC reports strongly influence forecasting:
4. 1. Influenza activity is primarily driven by Influenza A(H3N2), representing 98.8-100% of subtyped influenza-positive specimens and a consistent majority in hospitalizations (Week12 to Week16, 2022 #3, #8, #10). This dominance contributes to climbing ILI cases.
4. 2. National outpatient respiratory illness visits remain below baseline but are steadily increasing, reaching 2.1% in Week16, 2022 after consistent gradual rises since Week12, 2022 (Week12 to Week16, 2022 #4, #6).
4. 3. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses (5.0%-5.4% co-positive rates) complicates the overall trend in respiratory illnesses but supports a gradual increase in respiratory infection activity (Week12 to Week16, 2022 #9, #13).
5. Influenza-related hospitalization rates have been rising weekly for 11 consecutive weeks, reaching 11.1 per 100,000 in Week16, 2022, indicating sustained community-level spread (Week12 to Week16, 2022 #5, #7). This further corroborates the upward trajectory of ILI occurrences over the coming weeks.
6. Vaccination coverage remains stable, with no reported significant increases in uptake. However, the circulating H3N2 strain shows some antigenic differences from the vaccine strain, potentially leading to reduced protection and elevated ILI cases (Week12 to Week16, 2022 #8, #9, #10).
7. In conclusion, the five-week trend of increasing ILI occurrences, combined with dominant H3N2 viral activity, rising outpatient visits and hospitalizations, and stable but less effective vaccination protection, justifies the forecasted ILI occurrence of 3593 in Week21, 2022. The steady increase aligns with the off-season classification but reflects heightened influenza transmission within this period.
