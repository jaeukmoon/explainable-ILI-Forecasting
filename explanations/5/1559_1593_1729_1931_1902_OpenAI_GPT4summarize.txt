1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a steady upward trend, beginning with 1559 in Week 9, 2022, and peaking at 1931 in Week 11, 2022, followed by a slight decline to 1902 in Week 13, 2022. This progression indicates an overall rise in ILI activity, demonstrating increasing transmission potential during this period.

2. A clear positive correlation exists between the upward trajectory of ILI occurrences during Weeks 9–11, 2022, and the reported future value of 2895 (Week 18, 2022). The heightened ILI levels seen in Weeks 11–13, 2022, correspond with the observed future surge, as increased activity at the tail end of the observed weeks likely continued into the subsequent period.

3. Several factors in the CDC summarized reports strongly correlate with the future increase to 2895 ILI occurrences:  
   - Hospitalizations due to influenza rose consistently throughout the observed period, with cumulative rates climbing from 5.5 per 100,000 in Week 9, 2022, to 8.0 per 100,000 in Week 13, 2022. This trend underscores increasing severity and burden of ILI cases.  
   - Influenza A(H3N2), a dominant strain known for high transmissibility and potential vaccine mismatch, accounted for nearly all circulating influenza cases across Weeks 9–13, 2022, which likely fueled rising ILI numbers.  
   - Continuous co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, compounded illness prevalence, with coinfection rates remaining notable, such as 3.2–5.9% in various weeks, potentially driving non-influenza-related ILI reporting.  

4. In summary, the future rise to 2895 ILI occurrences (Week 18, 2022) can be attributed to the consistent upward trend observed in Weeks 9–11, overall increase in influenza-related hospitalizations, dominance of highly transmissible A(H3N2) strains, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and growing transmission activity evident across U.S. regions during the 5-week period.
