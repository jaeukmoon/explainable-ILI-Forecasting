1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Week19–Week23, 2024) saw a consistent downward trend, with occurrences progressively decreasing from 1769 in Week19, 2024 to 1119 in Week23, 2024. This decline indicates diminishing activity of ILI, reflecting reduced respiratory illness trends as the season approached its end.
2. Despite the downward trend observed in past ILI occurrences, the future occurrences after 5 weeks (Week28, 2024) reached 841. This shows a continued reduction in ILI activity, consistent with the observed decline in past weeks, albeit at a slower rate. The stable reductions in outpatient ILI visits (decreasing from 2.0% in Week19 to 1.7% in Week23, 2024) and low influenza positivity rates reinforce this correlation.
3. Low influenza positivity rates across Weeks19–23, 2024 (declining from 2.4% in Week19 to 1.6% in Week23) indicate limited flu contributions to ILI. Concurrently, co-circulating respiratory viruses such as COVID-19 and RSV continued to contribute variably, potentially sustaining a residual level of ILI activity.
4. Pediatric influenza-associated deaths rose gradually over the weeks, with seasonal totals increasing from 167 (Week19) to 175 (Week23, 2024). This steady mortality suggests that while influenza activity was low, severe cases persisted, likely contributing to ongoing ILI occurrences.
5. Genetic characterization of circulating viruses consistently matched vaccine components, minimizing widespread influenza activity but still leaving a baseline ILI occurrence driven by regional variability and non-influenza respiratory pathogens.
6. In summary, the reported 841 future ILI occurrences (Week28, 2024) correlate with the steep downturn in past occurrences, low influenza positivity rates, stable outpatient ILI percentages, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and residual severe cases contributing to the sustained but markedly reduced ILI activity.
