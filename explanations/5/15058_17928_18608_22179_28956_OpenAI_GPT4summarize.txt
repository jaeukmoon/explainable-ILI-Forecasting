1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks consistently demonstrated an upward trend, with values of ['15058', '17928', '18608', '22179', '28956']. Starting at 15058 in Week 47, 2021, the number steadily increased, reaching 28956 by Week 51, 2021, with substantial growth in the final weeks. This pattern indicates a significant escalation in ILI activity over the observed period.

2. A clear positive correlation exists between the past ILI trajectory and the future occurrence of 13413 in Week 5, 2022. Although there is a decrease in numbers after Week 51, the rapid and sharp increases observed in the final weeks of the past period (Weeks 50–51, 2021) potentially created a high baseline for future ILI activity, leading to elevated levels even in the subsequent weeks.

3. Several factors from the summarized CDC reports align with the future ILI occurrences:
   a. Rising influenza positivity rates were observed, increasing from 1.5% in Week 47, 2021, to 6.2% in Week 51, 2021, with Influenza A(H3N2) predominantly detected. The continuous rise in virologic positivity indicates escalating influenza transmission.
   b. Outpatient visits for ILI climbed steadily, exceeding the national baseline in Week 50, 2021 (3.1%), and reaching 3.8% by Week 51, 2021. This consistent increase in healthcare visits signals heightened activity across the population.
   c. A persistent winter surge in deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) – increasing from 15.5% (Week 47, 2021) to 19.2% (Week 51, 2021) – reflects widespread respiratory illness-associated severity, likely influencing ILI trends.

4. In summary, the future occurrence of 13413 (Week 5, 2022) can be attributed to the sharp upward trajectory in past ILI activity during Weeks 47–51, 2021, the concurrent rise in outpatient ILI visits and influenza positivity rates, and elevated PIC mortality as an indicator of respiratory illness severity. These factors collectively explain the subsequent ILI activity surge, despite a reduction from the peak levels observed in Week 51, 2021.
