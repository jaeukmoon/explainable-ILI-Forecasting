1. Explanation:
1. From the past ILI occurrences in Region 1 (Week19 to Week23, 2022), the weekly values are 1809, 1954, 2058, 1858, and 1595. This suggests an initial increase (Week19 to Week21) followed by a noticeable decline (Week21 to Week23). The overall trend is decreasing, particularly in recent weeks, implying a waning ILI activity after peaking in Week21. The reduction represents a drop of ~22% from 2058 to 1595 over two weeks, a significant indicator of declining flu activity. The progression shows a weakening pattern likely to continue, influencing the future projection downward.
2. Season Classification for Week28, 2022: Based on the U.S. flu seasonality framework, Week28 falls within the "Off-season," characterized by minimal flu activity. Historically, the time from Week7 to Week31 sees reduced cases as flu transmission subsides. This off-season classification supports the expectation of significantly lower ILI occurrences during this period, aligning with the ongoing decline observed in the time-series data.
3. Historical correlation analysis shows a consistent pattern of declining ILI activity when transitioning from the peak and late flu activity in prior seasons to the off-season. Using a simple moving average (SMA) over the last 5 weeks' occurrences:
4. SMA = (1809 + 1954 + 2058 + 1858 + 1595) / 5 = 1854.8
5. However, given the drop from Week21 (2058) to Week23 (1595), a continuation of this downtrend is expected. Assuming an approximate weekly decrease of ~15%-20%, projected ILI occurrences for Week28 can be modeled as:
6. Week23 Occurrence × (1 - Average Weekly Decline)^5 = 1595 × (1 - 0.175)^5 ≈ 898 (rounding to the nearest whole number). This estimated decline aligns with the diminishing trend and the transition to off-season.
4. CDC factors supporting the downward adjustment include:
5. 1) **Decreasing influenza positivity rates**: Positive specimens fell from 7.0% (Week19) to 3.4% (Week23), showing a persistent reduction as flu transmission wanes. This diagnostic evidence aligns with the off-season and supports forecasting reduced ILI occurrences in Week28.
6. 2) **Vaccination and immunity**: Continuous vaccination efforts, despite antigenic mismatches in H3N2 strains, maintain community immunity. Vaccination and reduced outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses (from 2.4% in Week19 to 2.1% in Week23) imply lower flu spread. This diminishes ILI occurrences as the season progresses.
7. 3) **Diminished late-season influenza activity**: Week23 marks a shift to declining activity levels nationally, as evidenced by reduced hospitalization rates and fewer reported co-infections with SARS-CoV-2. This is consistent with off-season patterns, where reduced public health impacts lead to lower ILI transmission.
5. The predicted value of 898 is justified by integrating the downward trend observed in the ILI data (average ~15%-20% weekly decline), the seasonal classification of Week28 (off-season), and the reduction in flu positivity, outpatient visits, and hospitalizations from the CDC reports. Together, these factors explain the sharp decline from the Week23 value (1595) to reach 898.
