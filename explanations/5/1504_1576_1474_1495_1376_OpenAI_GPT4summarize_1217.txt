1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 22–26, 2021) exhibit a fluctuating yet overall downward trend, with values of ['1504', '1576', '1474', '1495', '1376']. There is an initial increase from 1504 (Week 22, 2021) to 1576 (Week 23, 2021), followed by a consecutive decrease to 1376 (Week 26, 2021), marking the lowest point in the observed period. This pattern indicates declining ILI activity over the 5 weeks.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the declining pattern across the past data (Weeks 22–26, 2021) contrasts with the substantial increase to 2285 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 31, 2021). This divergence suggests external influences not captured by past trends contributed to the spike in future occurrences.
3. Respiratory deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds during Weeks 22–26, 2021, such as 7.5% (Week 22, 2021) and 6.2% (Week 26, 2021). Despite low direct influenza activity, the persistent PIC mortality points to broader respiratory illness impacts, potentially fueling the observed future ILI surge to 2285.
4. Healthcare-seeking behavior disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, repeatedly documented across all reports, likely complicated ILI surveillance and led to delayed recognition of cases. As pandemic patterns evolved, these changes may have increased reported ILI activity and contributed to the future surge.
5. Minimal influenza virus positivity rates across clinical labs during Weeks 22–26, 2021 (e.g., <0.1% positivity, Week 24, 2021), alongside limited public health lab detections, suggest non-influenza respiratory illnesses were likely drivers of ILI activity. The later increase to 2285 occurrences may reflect a combined effect of pandemic-related healthcare changes and an uptrend in other non-influenza respiratory conditions.
6. In summary, the reported 2285 future ILI occurrences (Week 31, 2021) can be linked to discrepancies in past trends versus future data, the persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, disruptions in healthcare behaviors and surveillance accuracy during the pandemic, and potential non-influenza respiratory illness contributions amidst evolving pandemic conditions.
