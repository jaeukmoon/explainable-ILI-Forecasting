1. The reported ILI counts from Week12 to Week16, 2022 are 1964, 2612, 3382, 3971, and 3532. The trend from Week12 to Week15 was sharply increasing before a slight decrease in Week16. This suggests a generally rising trajectory with a potential peak during Week15 and a mild reduction afterward, signaling a transition toward stabilization rather than further rapid growth.
2. Week21, 2022 aligns with the off-season phase based on historical season classifications. While ILI counts recently increased (Week12–Week16, 2022), broader epidemiological trends and the timing (post-Peak season, pre-Peak onset season) suggest that Week21 is likely within the off-season, with reduced community spread compared to peak periods.
3. From the time-series perspective, the rapid growth seen between Week12 and Week15 (rising from 1964 to 3971) followed by a slight decline in Week16 (3532) indicates a tapering off of activity. Projecting forward five weeks to Week21, 2022, the model anticipates further stabilization of ILI occurrences. This is consistent with off-season behavior, where ILI activity remains lower compared to peak periods. The forecasted value of 2739 reflects a moderate decrease from Week16, aligning with this expected trend.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, impacts influenza trends, with coinfection rates ranging from 5.0% to 5.4% in tested specimens (Week12, 2022 #9; Week14, 2022 #9; Week15, 2022 #11). This persistent co-circulation may reduce the relative contribution of influenza to ILI figures in the coming weeks.
5. Ongoing vaccinations and antiviral susceptibility remain crucial factors. Despite some antigenic differences in Influenza A(H3N2), the vaccine provides significant protection (Week13, 2022 #9; Week15, 2022 #10; Week16, 2022 #10). Additionally, no widespread resistance to recommended antivirals has been reported (Week12, 2022 #10; Week13, 2022 #10). Together, these factors likely help suppress peak influenza activity during Week21, 2022.
6. The proportion of outpatient visits attributed to ILI remains below the national baseline throughout Week12 to Week16, 2022 (1.8% to 2.1%) (Week12, 2022 #4; Week15, 2022 #4; Week16, 2022 #6). This suggests that influenza is not yet dominating respiratory illness trends, reinforcing the likelihood of a more stable and reduced ILI count by Week21, 2022.
7. Given the decreasing trajectory after Week15, the timing in the off-season, stabilization patterns in the time-series data, low national influenza-attributed outpatient visits, co-circulation of respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2, and the mitigating effects of vaccination and antiviral efficacy, the forecasted value of 2739 for Week21, 2022 is reasonable and consistent with off-season expectations.
