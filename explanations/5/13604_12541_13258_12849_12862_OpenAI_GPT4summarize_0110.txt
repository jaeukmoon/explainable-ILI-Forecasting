1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week15 to Week19, 2024 were 13604, 12541, 13258, 12849, and 12862. This trend illustrates a consistently fluctuating pattern, with no clear upward or downward trajectory. While there was a slight decrease from Week15 to Week16 and a subsequent rise in Week17, occurrences stabilized between Week18 and Week19, indicating a steadying rather than a volatile spread of ILI.
2. Week24, 2024 falls within the off-season in the U.S., which occurs after the peak season and before the peak onset season. The baseline positivity percentages and cumulative data from Week15 to Week19, 2024 reflect declining flu activity, aligning with off-season characteristics.
3. The fluctuating yet stable ILI trend in the data from Week15 to Week19, 2024 aligns with projections of reduced future activity during the off-season. From a time-series forecasting perspective, this pattern, coupled with the ongoing decline indicated in CDC reports, supports a projected decrease in ILI occurrences, leading to a forecast value of 10231 in Week24, 2024.
4. Influenza positivity rates declined steadily across the weeks, from 5.9% in Week15, 2024 to 2.4% in Week19, 2024, indicating reduced community transmission levels. Regional trends remain below baseline with stable outpatient visit percentages, further confirming lower ILI activity ahead (Week15, 2024 #3; Week18, 2024 #9; Week19, 2024 #4).
5. The cumulative hospitalization rate stabilized at 80.6 per 100,000 by Week19, 2024 (Week15, 2024 #4; Week19, 2024 #5). Although this is one of the highest on record for this point in the season, the leveling off of hospitalizations suggests a declining phase rather than a resurgence phase.
6. Primary circulating strains (A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and Influenza B) are well-matched to vaccines, and antiviral susceptibility remains high (Week15, 2024 #5, #9; Week18, 2024 #7). Vaccination efforts continue, although population-wide uptakes remain static (Week16, 2024 #9; Week19, 2024 #10). These factors contribute to limiting substantial spikes in ILI activity.
7. In summary, the combination of fluctuating but stable ILI trends, off-season timing, declining positive specimen rates, stable hospitalization rates, and effective vaccination mitigates the likelihood of sharp rises in ILI activity. Thus, a projection of 10231 for Week24, 2024 aligns with these contributing dynamics.
