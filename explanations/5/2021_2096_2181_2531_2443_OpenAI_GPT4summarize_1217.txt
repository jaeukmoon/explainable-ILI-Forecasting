1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating trend, with values ['2021', '2096', '2181', '2531', '2443']. There was an initial steady increase from 2021 (Week 13, 2022) to 2531 at Week 15, 2022, reaching the peak during this period. A small decline to 2443 (Week 17, 2022) followed, yet overall, the observed trend highlighted sustained elevated ILI activity.
2. A clear relationship between past and future ILI occurrences is visible, as the increase through Week 15, 2022, aligns with the reported future ILI occurrences of 1695 (Week 22, 2022). The highest values in recent weeks suggest residual or lagged effects contributing to continued transmission and ILI activity after 5 weeks, despite the slight drop in Week 17.
3. Cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza showed a steady increase from 8.0 per 100,000 (Week 13, 2022) to 12.2 per 100,000 (Week 17, 2022). The ongoing rise in hospitalizations directly reflects sustained community transmission and is indicative of future ILI occurrences.
4. Outpatient respiratory illness visits marginally increased from 1.9% (Week 13, 2022) to 2.2% (Week 17, 2022). This consistent rise, albeit below the baseline, suggests heightened healthcare-seeking for ILI-like symptoms, especially in younger demographics, which likely sustained future ILI activity.
5. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, particularly Influenza A(H3N2) and SARS-CoV-2, was prevalent across all weeks, with notable overlap (e.g., 5.1% dual positivity in Week 14, 2022). This combined respiratory burden likely explains the persistence of elevated future ILI trends.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1695 (Week 22, 2022) can be explained by a trending rise in past ILI cases during Weeks 13–15, 2022, sustained hospitalization rates reaching 12.2 per 100,000 in Week 17, rising outpatient visits, and the compounding effect of co-circulating respiratory viruses, most notably Influenza A(H3N2) and SARS-CoV-2.
