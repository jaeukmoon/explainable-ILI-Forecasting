1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, starting with 15796 in Week18, 2022, and climbing steadily to 23985 by Week22, 2022. The sharp increase from 15796 to 23985 represents a 51.9% growth over the 5-week period, with a particularly notable surge in the final two weeks (from 21269 in Week20, 2022 to 23985 in Week22, 2022), indicating heightened influenza activity.
2. The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (14344) represent a significant decrease from the peak of 23985 in Week22, 2022. However, the sharp drop aligns with the tapering of influenza positivity rates and outpatient visits for ILI observed toward Week22, indicating a correlation between declining late-season trends and the lower recorded future ILI occurrences. This rebound from an intense peak closely follows the season’s regional variability in activity.
3. Hospitalization rates progressively rose over the observed weeks from 13.4 per 100,000 in Week18, 2022 to a cumulative 16.7 per 100,000 in Week22, 2022, with older adults (65+) and young children (0-4 years) being the most affected groups. Although hospitalizations were high, the steady rise suggests a delayed seasonal culmination that impacted regional variations in future occurrences.
4. Influenza positivity rates dropped from 8.6% in Week18, 2022 to 5.9% by Week22, 2022, showing a late-season slowdown. The consistent dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) (99% or higher positivity across all weeks) could influence the aligning trajectory of future ILI occurrences due to vaccine mismatches, co-circulating viruses, and reduced SARS-CoV-2 co-infection rates stabilizing later activity.
5. Respiratory co-virus trends such as SARS-CoV-2 co-infections (ranging from 4.7% in Week18, 2022 to a reduced 4.3% by Week22) and contributing factors like RSV likely impacted variations in regional ILI occurrences. Combined with declining vaccine effectiveness noted during peak H3N2 prevalence, these factors underline the fluctuating nature of post-peak trends reflected in reduced ILI counts in future weeks.
6. In summary, the recorded future ILI occurrences of 14344 align with overall late-season declines in positivity rates and outpatient visits, regional leveling of coinfections, and reduced antigenic match from vaccines. While the initial rapid rise during Weeks18-22 anticipated sustained high activity, the decreasing trajectory in lab positivity and hospitalizations suggests a marked downturn leading to lower future ILI occurrences.
