1. The reported ILI counts from Week50, 2023 to Week2, 2024 are 12450, 15156, 14304, 12648, and 9164. Initially, the trend increased from Week50, 2023 (12450) to Week51, 2023 (15156) but slightly declined to Week52, 2023 (14304) and further reduced in Week1, 2024 (12648). A significant decrease occurred in Week2, 2024 (9164). This overall trend demonstrates a sharp peak in Week51, 2023, followed by a steady decline, indicating a transition toward subsiding activity.
2. The target Week7, 2024 falls just after the typical peak season window (Week46 to Week6). With declining ILI trends in recent weeks and the CDC forecasting stable-to-reducing flu activity after Week2, 2024, Week7, 2024 is consistent with off-season timing.
3. From a time-series perspective, the ILI counts peaked in Week51, 2023 before steadily declining through Week2, 2024. This suggests that future occurrences are unlikely to escalate significantly, aligning with an overall reduction. Projecting forward five weeks, the time-series model anticipates stabilization of ILI counts around 9475 as activity subsides.
4. Historical CDC data shows that flu positivity peaked in Week52, 2023 (17.5%) and declined in Week2, 2024 (13.7%), mirroring ILI count reductions (Week50, 2023 #1; Week52, 2023 #1; Week2, 2024 #1). National hospitalization rates also peaked in Week1, 2024, followed by stabilization in Week2, 2024 (Week1, 2024 #4; Week2, 2024 #4).
5. Vaccination efforts remain robust, with late-season benefits expected to reduce influenza complications despite existing co-circulation of respiratory viruses (Week1, 2024 #8; Week2, 2024 #8). Antiviral susceptibility remains high, ensuring effective treatment availability (Week50, 2023 #10; Week2, 2024 #9).
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV continue influencing ILI trends but do not indicate a major new variant or surge in Week2, 2024. The CDC forecasts an overall stable flu landscape while monitoring for potential holiday-driven increases (Week1, 2024 #10; Week2, 2024 #7, #11).
7. Given the declining ILI trend, off-season timing (Week7, 2024), the positive early effects of vaccination, and manageable co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, the projected ILI occurrence stabilizes at 9475 for Week7, 2024.
