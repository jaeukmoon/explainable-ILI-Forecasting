1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1972' (Week 16, 2024), '1835' (Week 17, 2024), '1887' (Week 18, 2024), '1769' (Week 19, 2024), '1635' (Week 20, 2024)]. While Week 18, 2024, showed a slight increase from the prior week, the overall pattern indicates a sustained decline in ILI activity by the end of the period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the declining trend in Weeks 16–20, 2024, contrasts sharply with the recorded value of 879 for future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks. This shift suggests a major reduction in ILI activity influenced by ongoing factors by Week 25, 2024.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily decreased, from 2.3% in Week 16, 2024, to 2.0% by Week 20, 2024, consistently remaining below the national baseline. This sustained reduction in ILI-related healthcare encounters is a strong indicator of waning respiratory illness activity, contributing to the decline in future ILI occurrences. Influenza positivity rates dropped nationally, from 4.8% in Week 16, 2024, to 2% in Week 20, 2024, consistent with the overall decrease in flu activity, directly correlating with reduced ILI cases after 5 weeks. Low hospitalization and mortality rates due to influenza, with mortality attributed to flu at just 0.1% in Week 20, 2024, further signify diminished ILI activity, supporting the future value of 879 occurrences. Minimal Influenza B activity and the dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), which tends to cause localized outbreaks rather than widespread surges, likely contributed to reduced nationwide ILI impacts over this time.
4. Despite co-circulating respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and RSV, no significant novel influenza strains were detected, limiting additional surges. Stable vaccination campaigns and high antiviral efficacy reported in Weeks 16–20, 2024, further suppressed flu activity. Improving public health measures, regional variability, and decreasing flu positivity collectively contributed to the observed reduction in ILI after 5 weeks.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 879 (Week 25, 2024) reflects the declining trend in Weeks 16–20, 2024, decreasing flu positivity and outpatient visits, low hospitalization and mortality rates, absence of novel strains, and strong vaccination and antiviral efforts driving the continued reduction in ILI activity.
