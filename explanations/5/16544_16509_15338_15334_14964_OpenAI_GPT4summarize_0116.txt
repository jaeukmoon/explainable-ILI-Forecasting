1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks (Week8, 2024 to Week12, 2024) in Region 9 demonstrate a progressively decreasing trend: ['16544', '16509', '15338', '15334', '14964']. From Week8 to Week12, the occurrence dropped by approximately 1.1% from Week8 to Week9, 7.1% from Week9 to Week10, remained stable from Week10 to Week11 (a negligible 0.03% decrease), and finally declined by approximately 2.4% from Week11 to Week12. The average weekly percentage decrease over this period is roughly 2.9%. This steady declining trend suggests that ILI activity is beginning to wane in Region 9, possibly due to seasonal effects or increasing vaccination coverage.
2. Week17, 2024 falls within the "Off-season" as per Background Knowledge. In the U.S., the off-season spans from immediately after the Peak season (typically Week6) to the start of the next Peak onset season (typically around Week32). Since Week17 is well beyond the Peak season and falls within the interval characterized by declining or minimal ILI activity, it is categorized as the off-season.
3. The correlation analysis indicates that ILI occurrences in Week17, 2024 are heavily influenced by the observed pattern of steady decline in past weeks. Time-series forecasting models using regression or weighted averages would project this downward trend forward. First, the percentage decrease trend is calculated across Week8 to Week12 (-2.9% weekly decline). Applying this average weekly decline iteratively for 5 weeks (Week12 to Week17) results in:
4. Week13: 14964 × (1 - 0.029) = 14531
5. Week14: 14531 × (1 - 0.029) = 14117
6. Week15: 14117 × (1 - 0.029) = 13720
7. Week16: 13720 × (1 - 0.029) = 13332
8. Week17: 13332 × (1 - 0.029) = 12955
9. Adjusting this result for off-season conditions, which typically see slower drops in activity compared to earlier weeks in the season, we temper the decline slightly and forecast Week17, 2024 ILI occurrences at 13258.
4. Three CDC factors strongly influence the forecast:
5. 1) The flu season is naturally waning as exemplified in Week12, 2024 when ILI positivity dropped to 10.5% from the Week10 level of 15.4%. Additionally, outpatient visits for ILI declined from 4.4% in Week8 to 3.1% in Week12. Such declines are consistent with the seasonal transition to the off-season. This reduces the ILI occurrence rate further.
6. 2) Vaccination efforts remain encouraged and effective per CDC reports. There are no indications of vaccine mismatches with circulating strains, leading to reduced spread and fewer cases. The continued vaccination benefits across Weeks8 to Week12 would diminish ILI activity further as we progress into Week17, 2024.
7. 3) Co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV and SARS-CoV-2) pose some influence but are not leading contributors to ILI trends. No novel, transmissible ILI variants (e.g., A(H1N2)v) were detected with human-to-human transmission, minimizing the chances of sudden rises in ILI cases by Week17. This sustains the overall downward trend.
5. In conclusion, the ILI forecast for Week17, 2024 is 13258, based on a steady declining trend in occurrences, the classification of Week17 as the off-season, correlation analysis of past trends, and factors from CDC reports. Key factors include declining positivity rates, ongoing vaccination efforts, and the absence of novel transmissible variants. The adjusted forecast incorporates the observed trends, seasons, and contextual factors, justifying the predicted value.
