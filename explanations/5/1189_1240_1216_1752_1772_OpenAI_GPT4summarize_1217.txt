1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a significant upward trend, with values ['1189', '1240', '1216', '1752', '1772']. While Weeks 45-47, 2021, exhibited relatively stable activity fluctuating between 1189 and 1240, Weeks 48-49, 2021, experienced a marked increase, jumping from 1216 (Week 47, 2021) to 1752 (Week 48, 2021) and then to 1772 (Week 49, 2021). This pronounced growth indicates escalating ILI activity during the observed period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the observed past time-series and future ILI occurrences. The sharp rise in Weeks 48-49, 2021, leading to 1772 ILI cases, serves as a precursor to the reported increase to 2536 occurrences in Week 54, 2021. This progression suggests sustained amplification in ILI activity.
3. Outpatient ILI visits grew from 2.1% (Week 45, 2021) to 2.7% (Week 49, 2021), reaching and surpassing the national baseline of 2.5% by Week 48, 2021. This continuous increase is indicative of heightened respiratory illness spread, linked closely to future ILI growth.
4. Hospitalizations due to laboratory-confirmed influenza climbed significantly, from 332 (Week 45, 2021) to 1057 (Week 49, 2021). This increase parallels the rise in ILI and reflects growing severe illness potentially contributing to the future peak.
5. High co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and others, compounded interpretation challenges and overall respiratory illness reporting during Weeks 45-49, 2021. This co-circulation likely inflated ILI cases, driving the observed rise to 2536 occurrences in Week 54, 2021.
6. In summary, the observed value of 2536 future ILI occurrences (Week 54, 2021) stems from the accelerating trend in Weeks 48-49, 2021, increasing outpatient visits and hospitalizations, and the compounding effects of co-circulating respiratory pathogens causing a surge in reported ILI cases.
