1. The reported ILI counts from Week8 to Week12, 2024 are 18,059, 18,300, 16,477, 14,164, and 12,267. This data indicates a consistent decline over the five weeks, suggesting a trend of steadily decreasing ILI occurrences after peaking earlier in the season. No sharp spikes or significant plateaus were detected, reflecting a waning stage of flu activity.
2. Since Week17, 2024 falls well beyond the typical peak season (Week46 to Week6) and into the time defined as the off-season (Week9 to Week30), the target week is classified as part of the off-season. This is consistent with the observed declining ILI patterns in the preceding weeks.
3. Based on time-series analysis, the consistent decline in the ILI occurrences from Week8 to Week12, 2024 projects a continuation of this decreasing trajectory, aligning with the historical pattern for off-season weeks. Applying this trend over five additional weeks (to Week17, 2024), a further reduction is expected, leading to the forecasted 6,169 occurrences.
4. The decline in national influenza positivity rates from 14.2% (Week8, 2024) to 10.5% (Week12, 2024) aligns with the waning trend in flu activity, reaffirming the expectation of further reduction in ILI occurrences.
5. Despite active co-circulation of influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, influenza continues to dominate respiratory illness trends. However, the declining hospitalization rates and the absence of significant new or highly transmissible influenza variants (Week9: #12; Week12: #6) suggest reduced community spread and ILI incidence going forward.
6. Vaccination efforts are ongoing, and seasonal vaccines remain well-matched to circulating strains, offering continued protection against severe outcomes (Week8: #8; Week11: #8; Week12: #9). These vaccinations play a critical role in mitigating future influenza burden, particularly in the off-season.
7. In conclusion, the steadily declining ILI occurrences, the classification of Week17, 2024 as off-season, favorable vaccination alignment, and the reduced positivity rates collectively justify the projected ILI count of 6,169 for the target week.
