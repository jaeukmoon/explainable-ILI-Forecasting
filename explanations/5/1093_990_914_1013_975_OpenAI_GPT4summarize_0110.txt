1. The reported ILI counts from Week5 to Week9, 2021 are 1093, 990, 914, 1013, and 975, respectively. The trend indicates a gradual decline in ILI occurrences from Week5 to Week7 (1093 to 914), then a slight temporary increase in Week8 (1013) followed by a decrease again in Week9 (975). Overall, this pattern demonstrates a fluctuating but declining trajectory over the last five weeks.
2. Week14, 2021 falls well outside the typical U.S. peak seasonal influenza activity window, which generally spans Week46 to Week6. Given the sustained low activity observed (Week5, 2021 #1, Week6, 2021 #1, Week7, 2021 #1, Week8, 2021 #1, Week9, 2021 #1) and minimal influenza transmission, Week14, 2021 is categorized as belonging to the off-season.
3. The past time-series data illustrates a declining trend with minor fluctuations, suggesting a likely stabilization at low levels moving forward. This pattern, combined with historically low influenza activity amid the COVID-19 pandemic, informs the projected slight increase in ILI occurrences over the next five weeks, culminating in 1496 occurrences for Week14, 2021.
4. Influenza activity remains historically low for this period, with only about 0.1% positivity in respiratory specimens across Weeks5-9, 2021 (Week5, 2021 #1; Week6, 2021 #1; Week7, 2021 #1; Week8, 2021 #1; Week9, 2021 #1), suggesting limited transmission and a reduced likelihood of outbreaks in the immediate future.
5. Despite CDC recommendations encouraging vaccination, no notable increases in vaccination uptake or widespread immunization effects are reported that could significantly influence ILI occurrences (Week5, 2021 #8; Week6, 2021 #8; Week7, 2021 #8, Week8, 2021 #9, Week9, 2021 #8).
6. COVID-19 continues to dominate respiratory illness trends, with elevated pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) death percentages (Week5, 2021 #6; Week6, 2021 #6; Week7, 2021 #6; Week8, 2021 #7; Week9, 2021 #6). Healthcare-seeking behaviors remain significantly influenced by the pandemic (Week5, 2021 #9; Week6, 2021 #9; Week7, 2021 #9; Week8, 2021 #10; Week9, 2021 #10), impacting traditional surveillance and contributing to the forecast for slightly increased yet muted ILI activity.
7. Given the declining ILI trends, the off-season designation for Week14, 2021, low influenza positivity rates, and the influence of COVID-19 on healthcare dynamics, it is reasonable to project 1496 ILI occurrences for Week14, 2021, reflecting a slight increase from Week9, 2021 levels due to minor fluctuations within a constrained range.
