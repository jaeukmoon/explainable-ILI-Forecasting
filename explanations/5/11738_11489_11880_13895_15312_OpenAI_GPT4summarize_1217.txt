1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a clear upward trend, starting at 11738 in Week 41, 2021, and ending at 15312 in Week 45, 2021. While there is slight fluctuation (e.g., a decrease from 11738 in Week 41 to 11489 in Week 42 followed by subsequent growth), the overall increase from Week 43 (11880) through Week 45 (15312) indicates a baseline escalation in ILI activity heading into the future period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences. The rise in ILI activity seen during Weeks 43–45, 2021, aligns with the significant future increase to 22179 (Week 50, 2021). The sharp uptick during the latter weeks of the historical period suggests that the trajectory of activity observed then would likely continue into the future weeks, explaining the surge after 5 weeks.
3. ILI-related outpatient visit percentages, which climbed from 1.8% in Week 41, 2021, to 2.1% in Week 44, 2021, and plateaued at this level in Week 45, highlight increased respiratory illness activity. This incremental rise, especially above the national baseline in specific regions (e.g., Region 7), signals amplifying trends contributing to the future occurrence jump.
4. The prevalence of Influenza A(H3N2) from Week 43–45, primarily affecting ages 5–24, correlates with increased ILI hospitalizations during this period (282 in Week 43, 295 in Week 44, and 332 in Week 45). These trends point to the escalating public health impact of flu and other respiratory viruses as contributing factors to the future surge.
5. The overlap of multiple circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) during Weeks 41–45, 2021, further complicated the interpretation of ILI surveillance data. Such co-circulation likely obscured the complete burden of illness in preceding weeks, further inflating future ILI counts as these cases were systematically recognized and reported.
6. In summary, the reported 22179 ILI occurrences in Week 50, 2021, result from the observed upward trend in Weeks 43–45, 2021, rising outpatient ILI visits, surging Influenza A(H3N2) activity and hospitalizations, and the compounding effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses alongside delayed or evolving surveillance practices.
