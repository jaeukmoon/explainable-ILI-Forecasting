1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a clear downward trend, with values of ['1847', '1762', '1753', '1592', '1546']. This decrease began from 1847 (Week 20, 2023) and consistently dropped to 1546 by Week 24, 2023, reflecting a consistent reduction in ILI activity throughout the observed period.
2. A significant correlation exists between the decrease in past ILI occurrences and the future reduction to 1092 ILI cases (Week 29, 2023). The steady decline during Weeks 20–24, 2023, suggests a continuation of this downward trajectory into the future.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily decreased week by week: 2.0% (Week 20, 2023), 1.9% (Weeks 21 and 22, 2023), 1.6% (Week 23, 2023), and 1.5% (Week 24, 2023). This consistent reduction in healthcare-seeking for ILI aligns with and likely contributes to future reduced occurrences.
4. Declining influenza positivity rates among clinical specimens (e.g., 1.2% in Week 21, 2023, dropping to 1.0% in Week 23, 2023) indicate reduced overall viral activity. Similarly, influenza-related hospitalizations fell from 939 (Week 20, 2023) to 779 (Week 24, 2023), both factors correlating with decreased ILI activity.
5. Ongoing seasonal decline in influenza virus circulation, combined with minimal new virus detections and decreasing ILI activity reported in all jurisdictions during Weeks 23–24, 2023, supports the reduced future ILI cases at 1092. This reflects expected seasonal trends, coalescing largely around reduced pathogen prevalence.
