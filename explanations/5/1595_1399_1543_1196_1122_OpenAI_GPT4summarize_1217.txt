1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a sharp decline, with values decreasing consistently from '1595' (Week23, 2022) to '1122' (Week27, 2022). Significant reductions were observed in Week24 (1399) and Week25 (1196), reflecting a consistent downward trend in ILI activity throughout the 5-week period. This trend highlights decreasing respiratory illness incidences approaching Week27, 2022.
2. A strong negative correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the declining pattern in Weeks23–27, 2022 (1595 to 1122), contrasts sharply with the lower reported future value (664). This indicates continued diminishing ILI activity beyond Week27, 2022, resulting in significantly reduced future occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a continual decline from 2.1% (Week23) to 1.7% (Week27, 2022), with children aged 0-4 years being the most affected group across all weeks. This steady drop in ILI-related healthcare visits demonstrates reduced transmission or illness activity, contributing to the lower future ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza positivity in clinical specimens progressively decreased across the weeks, from 3.4% (Week23) to 0.7% (Week27, 2022). This decline underscores significantly lower influenza circulation, directly impacting reduced future disease burden.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic were reported throughout the 5 weeks. These shifts complicated traditional surveillance and likely reduced the reporting of milder ILI cases, contributing to the future decline in occurrences to 664.
6. In summary, the reported 664 future ILI occurrences (5 weeks after Week27, 2022) directly result from the persistent decline in past ILI occurrences, reduced outpatient ILI visits, diminishing influenza positivity rates, and pandemic-induced disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior and surveillance systems.
