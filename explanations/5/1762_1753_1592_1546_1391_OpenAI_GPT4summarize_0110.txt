1. The ILI occurrences from Week21 to Week25, 2023 are 1762, 1753, 1592, 1546, and 1391. Over the five weeks, a clear downward trend is evident, with week-over-week decreases. This suggests a consistent decline in influenza activity without significant fluctuation, indicating the seasonal winding down typical of off-season influenza patterns.
2. Week30, 2023 falls within the off-season, which typically spans from Week1 to Week31 in the U.S., marked by minimal ILI activity. CDC reports (Week21–Week25, 2023 #1, #10) consistently highlight low influenza positivity rates and minimal flu activity, confirming that Week30, 2023 belongs to the off-season.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, a steady decline in ILI occurrences is observed leading up to Week25, 2023. Extrapolating this trend five weeks forward predicts a continued reduction in ILI counts, stabilizing at a lower baseline consistent with off-season levels. The forecasted value of 1142 reflects this declining trajectory.
4. Nationwide influenza positivity rates declined gradually, from 1.2% in Week21 to 1.0% in Week25, 2023 (Week21–Week25, 2023 #1), and remain well below the national baseline, indicating progressively reduced transmission.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV persists (Week21–Week25, 2023 #8, #9, #10). These viruses contribute to ILI activity but do not show a sharp upward influence, aligning with stable or declining ILI trends typical of the off-season.
6. Flu activity expectations from CDC remain minimal throughout summer, as consistently emphasized in all five weekly reports (Week21–Week25, 2023 #10). This further supports the prediction of low ILI counts for Week30.
7. In summary, the diminishing ILI cases (Week21–Week25, 2023), off-season classification of Week30, 2023, ongoing low influenza positivity, negligible viral surges, and CDC expectations all align with a projected ILI occurrence of 1142 for Week30, 2023.
