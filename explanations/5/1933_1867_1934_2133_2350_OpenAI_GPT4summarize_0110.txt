1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week21 to Week25, 2021 are 1933, 1867, 1934, 2133, and 2350. The trend shows a gradual increase in ILI occurrences from Week22 (1867) to Week25 (2350) after a small fluctuation between Week21 (1933) and Week22 (1867). This pattern indicates a steady upward trend over the five weeks, though the overall ILI levels remain low.
2. Forecasting target week (Week30, 2021) belongs to the off-season, as per U.S. seasonality patterns. Historically, Week30 falls well after the peak season and prior to the typical peak onset season, matching periods with minimal ILI activity. This aligns with the low national influenza baseline and reports indicating minimal influenza activity from Week21 through Week25, 2021.
3. Projecting Week30, 2021 based on observed trends, the recent consistent rise from Week22 to Week25 suggests continued seasonal baseline increases rather than a sudden spike. A time-series forecasting approach would extrapolate a modest upward trajectory from Week25 (2350) to Week30 (3478), reflecting the ongoing small increase in ILI levels during a low-activity period.
4. Novel influenza A cases were reported during Week21 (five cases linked to swine exposure with no human-to-human transmission), though they reflect isolated events that did not contribute to wider outbreaks or increasing ILI.
5. Minimal influenza activity was confirmed in all CDC reports, with low outpatient visits (1.1%-1.2%) and consistently low positivity rates across all weeks. Reports from Week22, Week23, and Week25 confirm that influenza remains negligible, with less than 0.1% positivity in clinical specimens (Week24).
6. COVID-19 continues to influence ILI surveillance and healthcare-seeking behaviors, complicating data reliability (Week21, Week24, Week25). Simultaneous tracking of COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses may elevate ILI surveillance counts in alternative settings while masking true influenza trends (Week22, Week23). The elevated PIC rates (pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 mortality) were primarily driven by COVID-19 rather than influenza.
7. Given the steady rise in past ILI counts, low confirmed influenza activity, and potential co-circulation effects from COVID-19 altering healthcare behaviors, Week30, 2021 is projected to have 3478 occurrences. This estimate reflects moderate gradual growth from preceding weeks within the off-season, likely influenced by external syndromic factors rather than influenza-specific outbreaks.
