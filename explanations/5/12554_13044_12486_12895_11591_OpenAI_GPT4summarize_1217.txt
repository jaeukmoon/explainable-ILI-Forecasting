1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed fluctuations, with values of ['12554', '13044', '12486', '12895', '11591']. The data showed an initial increase from 12554 in Week 3, 2024 to 13044 in Week 4, 2024, followed by a decrease to 12486 in Week 5, 2024, a slight rise to 12895 in Week 6, 2024, and then a sharp drop to 11591 in Week 7, 2024. This pattern suggests overall declining activity by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the declining trend toward Weeks 6 and 7, 2024 corresponds with the significantly reduced future ILI occurrences of 9168 after 5 weeks. The persistent decrease in ILI activity in the later weeks serves as a precursor for the lower ILI levels observed in the future.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained above the national baseline, ranging from 4.3% (Week 3, 2024) to 4.5% (Week 7, 2024). While increases were noted in specific regions (e.g., regions 3, 5, and 7), the national positivity rate decreased from 16.2% (Week 4, 2024) to 14.8% (Week 7, 2024), reflecting an overall reduction in influenza activity, which likely influenced the future ILI drop to 9168.
4. The cumulative hospitalization rate peaked at 58.2 per 100,000 in Week 7, 2024 but demonstrated a slowing growth toward the end of the period. Additionally, influenza-attributed mortality consistently declined over the 5 weeks, from 1.1% (Week 3, 2024) to 0.8% (Week 7, 2024). These reductions in severe influenza metrics align with the observed future ILI decrease.
5. Despite the predominance of A(H1N1)pdm09 and increasing Influenza B activity in some regions, national trends showed a tapering in respiratory illness intensity. Moreover, high vaccination emphasis and minimal antiviral resistance likely tempered the ILI rates. Persistent regional variability without widespread escalation further supports the future decline to 9168.
6. In summary, the reported 9168 future ILI occurrences (Week 12, 2024) can be explained by the declining trend in past ILI occurrences during Weeks 6 and 7, 2024, reductions in influenza positivity and attributed mortality, gradual stabilization in hospitalization rates, and successful mitigation efforts such as vaccination, all contributing to the lower future ILI activity.
