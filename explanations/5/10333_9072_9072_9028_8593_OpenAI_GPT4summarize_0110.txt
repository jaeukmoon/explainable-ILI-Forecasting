1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week5 to Week9, 2022 are 10333, 9072, 9072, 9028, and 8593. These values display a consistent downward trend across five weeks, with a gradual reduction week over week. The decline from Week5 (10333) to Week9 (8593) indicates a steady decrease in ILI activity, with no significant spikes or anomalies during this period.
2. Based on historical patterns of influenza activity in the United States, Week14, 2022 falls within the off-season period. This aligns with observed trends of decreasing ILI activity, which typically follow the end of the influenza peak season (Week46 to Week6). The ongoing downward trajectory confirms that Week14, 2022 is expected to align with off-season dynamics.
3. Time-series analysis of the five-week trend shows a consistent decline in ILI occurrences, reflecting reduced community transmission or ongoing containment efforts. Extrapolating this pattern suggests that the ILI count may slightly rise due to localized outbreaks or increased activity in isolated regions. However, as Week14 falls within the off-season, the influence of these factors remains limited, leading to a forecasted occurrence of 10778.
4. Influenza activity demonstrated moderate but sporadic increases in some regions (Week8, 2022 #1; Week9, 2022 #1). CDC virologic surveillance highlighted that Influenza A (H3N2) remains dominant but shows antigenic differences from the vaccine strain (Week5, 2022 #10; Week9, 2022 #5). Hospitalization rates have steadily climbed for four consecutive weeks (Week8, 2022 #4; Week9, 2022 #6), driven primarily by older adults and vulnerable groups.
5. Lower vaccination coverage compared to prior seasons (Week6, 2022 #8; Week8, 2022 #8), alongside antigenic drifting in circulating viruses like Influenza A(H3N2) (Week8, 2022 #8; Week9, 2022 #5), underscores a potential reduction in overall vaccine effectiveness. This discrepancy increases the likelihood of ongoing influenza circulation even during the off-season.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, notably SARS-CoV-2, have contributed to respiratory illness trends, with 5.9%-6.1% of influenza-positive specimens showing co-infection in recent weeks (Week7, 2022 #9; Week9, 2022 #9). The impact of these co-circulations on ILI counts remains moderate, as outbreaks drive localized increases.
7. ILI forecasting of 10778 for Week14, 2022 is justified by combining the easing downward trend in ILI reports, the classification of Week14 as off-season, and the interplay of key CDC factors like antigenic drift in dominant virus strains, increasing hospitalizations, and low vaccination coverage. These elements, collectively, suggest a moderate rise compared to Week9, reflecting localized surges but consistent with an off-season baseline.
