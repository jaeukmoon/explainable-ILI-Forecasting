1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a clear upward trend, with values of ['1117', '1021', '1166', '1474', '1676']. Starting with a slight dip from 1117 (Week 13, 2022) to 1021 (Week 14, 2022), the data then showed consistent increases, climbing significantly to 1166 (Week 15, 2022), 1474 (Week 16, 2022), and finally peaking at 1676 (Week 17, 2022). This upward pattern indicates rising respiratory illness activity as the observation period progressed.

2. A strong positive correlation is evident between the upward trend in past ILI occurrences and the future value of 1858. The consistent increase in the latter weeks of the past data (Weeks 16–17, 2022) closely aligns with the rise to 1858 (Week 22, 2022), signaling that the observed trajectory acted as a predictor for heightened ILI activity after 5 weeks.

3. Influenza activity progressively increased across all regions during the 5-week period, with clinical labs reporting rising influenza positivity rates, from 8.3% (Week 13, 2022) to 8.9% (Week 15, 2022), and eventually 8.1% (Week 17, 2022). Influenza A(H3N2), the dominant strain, was responsible for nearly all positive influenza cases (≥99%) throughout, indicating widespread and accelerating transmission, which likely contributed to future ILI cases.

4. Pediatric influenza-associated deaths continuously rose, increasing from 16 deaths (Week 13, 2022) to 24 (Week 17, 2022), indicating increased viral severity and spread, particularly among vulnerable populations. This trend corresponds to heightened overall disease burden and aligns with the future increase to 1858 ILI occurrences.

5. Cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rates climbed steadily during the observation period, from 8.0 per 100,000 (Week 13, 2022) to 12.2 per 100,000 (Week 17, 2022), reflecting increased severity of influenza cases. Weekly hospitalizations followed the same upward trajectory, which is indicative of growing illness severity and healthcare usage, serving as a precursor to the future ILI surge.

6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, compounded respiratory disease trends. Reports noted that 3–5% of specimens positive for influenza also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, adding complexity to ILI patterns and amplifying overall illness activity. This co-circulation likely inflated ILI cases leading to 1858 occurrences after 5 weeks.

7. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 1858 (Week 22, 2022) can be attributed to the consistent upward trend in past ILI data (Weeks 13-17, 2022), coinciding with increasing influenza positivity and hospitalization rates, escalating pediatric deaths, and the co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, all of which collectively signaled rising respiratory illness burden.
