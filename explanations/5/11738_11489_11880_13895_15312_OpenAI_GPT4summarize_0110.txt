1. The ILI occurrences from Week41 to Week45, 2021, show a clear upward trend: starting at 11738 in Week41, increasing through 11489, 11880, and 13895, peaking at 15312 in Week45. This consistent growth indicates rising influenza activity in this period, suggesting an entering phase into higher-prevalence weeks.
2. Given that Week50, 2021 is within the typical peak season window in the U.S. (Week46 to Week6 of the following year), and the observed increase in ILI occurrences, it is most plausible that Week50 belongs to the peak season.
3. The sustained weekly increases in ILI occurrences from Week41 to Week45, combined with the ascending positivity percentages for influenza in Week43 (0.2%), Week44 (0.3%), and Week45 (0.7%), suggest that the rise in activity will likely persist. Extrapolating this trend forward, it is reasonable to project a higher ILI value such as 22179 in Week50, 2021, aligning with peak-season intensity.
4. An increasingly dominant Influenza A(H3N2), which accounted for 97.3% of detected cases by Week44 and 100% by Week45, is linked to two significant factors: localized outbreaks (Week44 #11) and disproportionate incidence in ages 5–24 (Week45 #3). This strain’s rapid spread likely accelerates ILI occurrences heading into the peak weeks.
5. The percentages of influenza-positive clinical and public health specimens rose from 0.1% in Week41 to 0.7% in Week45 (Week41 #1, Week45 #1), reflecting growing viral circulation. The correlation between increasing positivity rates and ILI counts reinforces a continued rise in future weeks.
6. Concurrent circulation of respiratory viruses and behavior impacted by COVID-19 complicates healthcare-seeking patterns, potentially contributing indirectly to ILI reporting increases (Week41 #10, Week44 #12, Week45 #10). However, the observations confirm that influenza-specific trends continue to strengthen.
7. In summary, the consistent upward trend in cases, the transition to peak season, dominance of a highly transmissible influenza strain (H3N2), rising specimen positivity rates, and co-factors influencing reporting reliability justify projecting an ILI occurrence of 22179 for Week50, 2021.
