1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited fluctuations with a slight upward trend overall, with values of ['2078', '2222', '1994', '2028', '2169']. There was a rise from 2078 (Week49, 2020) to 2222 (Week50, 2020), followed by a decline to 1994 (Week51, 2020). The subsequent weeks showed recovery, with occurrences increasing to 2028 (Week52, 2020) and peaking at 2169 (Week53, 2020). This pattern indicates a potential stabilization in ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the slight upward trend toward the latter weeks of the 5-week time-series (Weeks 52–53, 2020) appears to precede the decrease to 1714 after 5 weeks. The stabilization in Weeks 52 and 53 likely contributed to the observed moderating activity in the future occurrence.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at 1.6% across Weeks 49–53, 2020, consistently staying below the national baseline (2.6%). The extended plateau in healthcare-seeking for ILI suggests limited variability in illness activity, potentially contributing to the decline to 1714, reflecting a continuation of lower influenza activity.
4. PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) deaths consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, accounting for 14.3% (Week49, 2020) to 14.5% (Week53, 2020). However, most were attributed to COVID-19 rather than influenza, which likely constrained the rise in ILI occurrences, leading to the observed drop after 5 weeks.
5. The unusually low positivity rates for influenza in respiratory specimens (ranging from 0.1% to 0.3% across Weeks 49–53, 2020) and minimal lab-confirmed cases of influenza underline the subdued circulation of influenza viruses. This limited influenza activity is closely tied to the low future ILI occurrence of 1714, as non-specific respiratory illnesses drive much of the activity.
6. The significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance systems, as frequently cited across every week, likely reduced traditional ILI case reporting. These disruptions would have contributed to a diminished representation in future occurrences, aligning with the observed 1714 ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 1714 (Week5, 2021) is attributable to the stabilization in Weeks 52–53, 2020, consistently low outpatient ILI visit rates, persistently elevated PIC mortality predominately due to COVID-19, limited influenza positivity and lab-confirmed cases, and pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare-seeking and surveillance reliability.
