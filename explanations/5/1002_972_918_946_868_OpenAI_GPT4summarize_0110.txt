1. The reported ILI counts from Week13 to Week17, 2022, are 1002, 972, 918, 946, and 868. The trend shows an overall decreasing pattern, with a consistent decline from Week13 (1002) to Week17 (868), though there is a slight uptick between Week15 (918) and Week16 (946). This indicates a general reduction in ILI occurrences over time with minor, short-lived variances.
2. Week22, 2022 belongs to the off-season as it occurs well after the regular peak season (Week46 of the prior year to Week6 of the current year) and does not coincide with significant activity levels seen in peak onset or peak seasons. Reports from Week13 to Week17, 2022, confirm low-to-decreasing respiratory activity and ILI below baselines, consistent with off-season trends.
3. The overall decline in past ILI occurrences suggests low activity projection into Week22, 2022. Based on the time-series model, the historical reduction from Week13 (1002) to Week17 (868) supports a further decrease in occurrences with stabilization around lower values, leading to the forecasted 689 ILI cases.
4. Influenza positivity rates remain low nationwide (Week13, 2022 #2; Week14, 2022 #2; Week15, 2022 #2; Week16, 2022 #1; Week17, 2022 #1) and show either minor fluctuations or reductions, suggesting reduced transmission into the target week.
5. Vaccination trends and mitigation measures continue to offer protection, though H3N2 strains show some antigenic differences (Week13, 2022 #9; Week14, 2022 #8; Week15, 2022 #10; Week16, 2022 #10; Week17, 2022 #8). This limits significant spikes in influenza cases and contributes to lower ILI forecasts.
6. Co-circulation of non-influenza respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, contributes variably to respiratory illness visits but does not dominate trends (Week13, 2022 #14; Week14, 2022 #12; Week15, 2022 #12; Week16, 2022 #11; Week17, 2022 #9). These factors, alongside reduced influenza A(H3N2) activity, support a lower ILI baseline.
7. Given the declining historical ILI cases, off-season classification, stabilizing influences of vaccination, low influenza positivity, and reduced co-circulation impact on ILI, the forecasted ILI count of 689 in Week22, 2022, is consistent with expected trends.
