1. The reported ILI counts from Week48, 2023 to Week52, 2023 demonstrate a steady and significant increase, starting at 10447 in Week48 and rising to 16604 in Week52. This consistent uptrend aligns with heightened influenza activity nationwide over these weeks, reflecting an active transmission phase.
2. Week5, 2024 falls within the peak season, as the typical peak season in the U.S. spans from Week46 of one year to approximately Week6 of the next. The increasing activity observed in the CDC reports from Week48, 2023 through Week52, 2023 further confirms that Week5, 2024 likely aligns with the ongoing peak influenza transmission period.
3. Time-series analysis shows strong momentum in ILI occurrences across the past five weeks, with an average weekly increase of approximately 1550 cases. If this trajectory were to continue without significant deviation, ILI counts would be expected to grow further. However, Week52, 2023 CDC reports (within the peak season) suggest that activity may stabilize slightly due to vaccination efforts and antiviral measures. Based on this, projecting from Week52's 16604 occurrences, a moderate decline or plateau is anticipated, resulting in 13019 occurrences by Week5, 2024, reflecting typical peak season dynamics.
4. Several factors from the CDC reports contribute to the forecasting: (1) Nationwide influenza activity is at its highest, with 17.5% testing positive for influenza in Week52, 2023, the peak percentage observed this season. This robust activity signals the continuation of high ILI levels into the coming weeks. (2) Hospitalizations and influenza-related deaths have been progressively increasing; as of Week52, the cumulative hospitalization rate is 22.3 per 100,000, with sharp rises in admissions across most regions, suggesting widespread transmission and severe cases peaking. (3) Vaccination uptake continues, with a significant number of the population unvaccinated despite CDC recommendations; this delayed protection likely contributes to sustained transmission, especially in high-prevalence regions like the southeast, south-central areas, and Regions 8, 4, and 6.
5. Respiratory illness trends are exacerbated by concurrent circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) and RSV, as per Week52, 2023 reports. This co-circulation creates compounded ILI pressures, sustaining elevated activity levels beyond what influenza alone might drive.
6. Influenza variants, particularly Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, dominate this season, representing 87.7% of Influenza A viruses in Week52, 2023 and showing strong genetic and antigenic consistency with available vaccines. However, the mild resistance to older antiviral treatments such as adamantanes might create challenges in treatment efficacy for specific cases.
7. In summary, the projected ILI occurrence for Week5, 2024 of 13019 corresponds to the expected peak-season dynamics. This value reflects a deceleration in the weekly growth trajectory observed from Week48 to Week52, 2023, influenced by continued vaccination efforts, active antiviral use, and seasonal co-circulation with other respiratory viruses while still representing high influenza prevalence typical of the U.S. peak season.
