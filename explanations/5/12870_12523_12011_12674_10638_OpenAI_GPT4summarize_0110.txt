1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week19 to Week23, 2023 are 12870, 12523, 12011, 12674, and 10638. The trend shows an overall gradual decrease in ILI occurrences, with a sharp decline observed in Week23 (10638) following a consistent reduction in earlier weeks. This represents a general downward trajectory, indicating diminishing ILI activity over the five-week period. Notable dips, such as the considerable drop in Week23, may signal reduced disease transmission or changes in reporting.
2. Week28, 2023 falls within the off-season, as defined by reduced flu activity occurring between Week1 to Week31. The low percentage of ILI positivity and below-baseline outpatient visits (Week19 to Week23, 2023 observations) further confirms that Week28 is part of this low-activity off-season period.
3. Historical ILI occurrences indicate a decreasing trend during the observed weeks (Week19 to Week23, 2023). Projecting forward using time-series forecasting, a continuation of this gradual reduction aligns with ILI activity tapering off during the off-season. The forecasted value of 7983 reflects this declining pattern, with co-factors like reduced influenza positivity and outpatient visits reinforcing this projection.
4. National influenza activity remains minimal, with influenza positivity at or near 1.0% consistently across Week19 to Week23, 2023. This low positivity indicates limited transmission and supports a continued decline in ILI occurrences into Week28, 2023.  Vaccination effectiveness in controlling disease spread is highlighted throughout the CDC reports, with circulating strains closely matching the vaccine and high levels of antiviral susceptibility maintained (Week19 to Week23, 2023 reports). Additionally, decreased outpatient visits for ILI (falling below the baseline of 2.5%) from Week19 (1.9%) to Week23 (1.6%) reveal diminished community-level respiratory illness, which directly correlates with lower ILI forecasts.
5. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and RSV adds complexity to respiratory illness patterns (Week19 to Week23, 2023 reports). However, their stable prevalence without significant spikes further supports a declining trajectory in overall ILI cases. Minimal or stable flu activity coupled with these co-factors helps sustain reduced ILI forecasts for Week28, 2023.
6. The consistent decrease in ILI occurrences from Week19 to Week23, 2023 aligns with the off-season timing of Week28, showing reduced influence from influenza and associated respiratory illnesses. Additionally, CDC flu activity expectations predict continued minimal influenza occurrence during summer weeks, including Week28 (Week19 to Week23, 2023 reports).
7. The projected future ILI occurrence of 7983 for Week28, 2023 is justified by the observed declining trend in prior weeks, the off-season classification, low influenza positivity, effective vaccination coverage, reduction in outpatient visits, and stable co-circulation of other respiratory viruses. Together, these factors signal a continued decline in ILI cases during this period.
