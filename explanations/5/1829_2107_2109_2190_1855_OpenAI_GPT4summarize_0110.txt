1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week43, 2021 to Week47, 2021 are 1829, 2107, 2109, 2190, and 1855. Initially, the numbers showed a gradual increase from Week43, 2021 (1829) to Week46, 2021 (2190). However, there was a slight decrease in Week47, 2021 (1855). This trend indicates mild fluctuations, with an overall pattern of increasing activity followed by a small decline.
2. Forecasting Week52, 2021 aligns with the peak season, as the U.S. typically experiences peak influenza activity from Week46 to Week6 of the following year. Week47, 2021 already exhibited growing influenza detections and outpatient ILI visits approaching the baseline, suggesting that Week52, 2021 is within this peak period.
3. The correlation between past trends and the forecast suggests that the gradual rise in ILI activity from Week43 to Week46, 2021, followed by a minor drop in Week47, 2021, projects an overall increase in ILI cases moving closer to the peak season. Based on historical patterns, the slight dip does not indicate a sustained decline but rather a short-term fluctuation consistent with seasonal intensification.
4. Key factors influencing the future ILI occurrences:
5. - Influenza A(H3N2) dominated positivity rates (Week43, 2021 #3; Week44, 2021 #3; Week45, 2021 #2; Week47, 2021 #3), with increasing detections and substantial transmission observed among younger populations (Week46, 2021 #10; Week47, 2021 #4). This dominant strain historically correlates with higher ILI burdens.
6. - Outpatient ILI visit percentages, though below the national baseline of 2.5%, have steadily increased, rising from 1.9% in Week43, 2021 (Week43, 2021 #4) to 2.4% in Week47, 2021 (Week47, 2021 #5). Such patterns suggest growing community-level activity in line with the approaching peak season.
7. - Limited vaccination uptake trends and delayed vaccination data reporting (Week43, 2021 #8; Week44, 2021 #9; Week47, 2021 #9) may leave portions of the population vulnerable, particularly as co-circulating respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 complicate immunity (Week43, 2021 #10; Week45, 2021 #10; Week47, 2021 #10).
5. The cumulative impact of increasing Influenza A(H3N2) cases, rising outpatient ILI visits, and the proximity to the peak season suggests that Week52, 2021 will likely see higher ILI occurrences compared to the preceding weeks. These factors underline the projected ILI count of 3231.
6. The predicted value of 3231 reflects a continuation of influenza intensification consistent with peak season trends. The time-series pattern, the dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), increasing outpatient ILI indicators, and suboptimal vaccination coverage collectively support this forecast.
