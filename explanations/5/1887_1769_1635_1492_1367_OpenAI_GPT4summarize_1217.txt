1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values of ['1887', '1769', '1635', '1492', '1367']. There was a steady and continuous decrease over the weeks, from 1887 in Week18, 2024, to 1367 in Week22, 2024, indicating diminishing ILI activity during this period. This downward trend aligns with the seasonal tapering off referred to in CDC summaries.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the continually declining ILI values from Week18–22, 2024, contrast with a substantial drop to 727 in future occurrences (Week27, 2024). The progressive decline observed in the past portends consistent reductions, leading to the low future outcome.
3. Influenza positivity rates declined across the 5-week period, from 3.1% (Week18, 2024) to 1.8% (Week22, 2024). This reduction indicates reduced viral circulation, contributing directly to lower future ILI occurrences. Hospitalization rates stabilized at 0.2 per 100,000 in Weeks20–22, 2024, from the earlier peak, signifying reduced illness severity. Additionally, outpatient ILI visit rates decreased slightly from 2.1% (Week18, 2024) to 1.9% (Week22, 2024), remaining below baseline levels. Co-circulating respiratory viruses (RSV, COVID-19, etc.) did not show significant waves, keeping ILI trends stable or declining. Stable pediatric influenza-associated mortality, with only isolated cases over five weeks, reflects the low sustained activity during the time frame.
4. The overall decline in influenza positivity and stable or reducing hospitalization and mortality rates collectively match the observed fall in future ILI occurrences to 727. Minimal ILI activity across all jurisdictions (not surpassing baseline levels) and the absence of significant activity spikes, alongside effective vaccination coverage and antiviral effectiveness, further reinforce the declining trajectory to 727.
