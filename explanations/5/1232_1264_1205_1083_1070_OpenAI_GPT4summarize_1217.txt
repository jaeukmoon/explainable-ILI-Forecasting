1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the observed 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values decreasing from 1232 (Week15, 2023) to 1070 (Week19, 2023). This reflects a downward trend, with the largest drop occurring between Week16, 2023 (1264) and Week17, 2023 (1205), followed by a more gradual reduction in subsequent weeks. This suggests waning ILI activity over the 5-week period.
2. A negative correlation is evident between past and future ILI occurrences, as the declining trend in past weeks (Week15-19, 2023) contrasts with the stabilization at 996 occurrences projected after 5 weeks (Week24, 2023). Although past data indicate a decrease, the leveling at 996 signals consistent but reduced activity, likely stemming from broader seasonal influences or other respiratory viruses.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline of 2.5% throughout the 5-week period, fluctuating minimally between 1.9% and 2.0% (Week15-19, 2023). This stable low activity suggests the future value is primarily influenced by continued respiratory illness circulation but without a substantial resurgence.
4. Deaths attributed to PIC consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, albeit showing a slight decline from 7.5% (Week15, 2023) to 6.8% (Week19, 2023). These sustained PIC proportions may contribute to maintaining the ILI occurrence level around 996, reflecting lingering respiratory illness impacts.
5. Ongoing circulation of co-infecting respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, was cited in reports (Week17-19, 2023) as adding complexity to the interpretation of ILI data, potentially stabilizing future ILI occurrences despite the decreasing trend in influenza activity.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 996 (Week24, 2023) result from counterbalancing trends: a consistent decline in past ILI occurrences (Weeks15-19, 2023) contrasted by stable outpatient ILI visits, sustained PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and the compounding influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses.
