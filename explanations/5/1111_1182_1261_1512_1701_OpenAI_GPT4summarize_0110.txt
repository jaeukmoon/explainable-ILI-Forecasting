1. The reported ILI counts from Week6 to Week10, 2022 are 1111, 1182, 1261, 1512, and 1701. The trend shows a steady increase over these weeks, with a significant rise between Week9 (1512) and Week10 (1701), reflecting growing influenza activity without fluctuations or declines. This consistent upward trajectory suggests continued growth in upcoming weeks.
2. Week15, 2022 falls outside the typical peak season (Week46, 2021 to Week6, 2022) and does not correlate with the longer off-season period starting after the peak. Given observed increasing activity levels and evidence of rising hospitalizations and positivity rates (Week10, 2022 #1, #2, #6), this week is more characteristic of a peak-onset season as ILI activity begins surging toward potentially higher levels.
3. The past trends in ILI data imply a strong time-series correlation where the rising numbers predict continued growth. Based on the steady and almost linear increase in ILI counts over the five-week period, projecting forward five weeks to Week15, 2022, the ILI occurrences are estimated to grow to 2181 due to this consistent upward trajectory.
4. Flu vaccination rates remain lower than the previous season, with adherence challenges during the ongoing pandemic (Week6, 2022 #8; Week8, 2022 #8; Week10, 2022 #10). Reduced vaccination coverage could further exacerbate the spread and impact of influenza activity.
5. Antigenic differences in circulating Influenza A(H3N2) strains from the vaccine strain indicate potential vaccine mismatches, limiting vaccine effectiveness (Week6, 2022 #10; Week7, 2022 #7; Week9, 2022 #5). This reduces herd immunity, contributing to the upward trend in ILI cases.
6. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including Influenza A (H3N2), SARS-CoV-2, and RSV, adds complexity to illness patterns and may intensify respiratory illness presentations in the population (Week6, 2022 #9; Week9, 2022 #10; Week10, 2022 #12). This factor, together with regional hotspots of ILI activity (Week9, 2022 #1; Week10, 2022 #1), supports rising flu activity forecasted for Week15, 2022.
7. In summary, the steady upward trend in ILI occurrences, classification of Week15, 2022 as part of the peak-onset season, reduced vaccination rates, antigenic mismatch of the vaccine with dominant Influenza A(H3N2) strains, and the compounding effect of co-circulating viruses all contribute to projecting a continued rise in ILI cases, reaching 2181 by Week15, 2022.
