1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week19 to Week23, 2023 are 1070, 1056, 644, 1006, and 1121. This data indicates a fluctuation rather than a consistent trend. The ILI occurrences decreased significantly in Week21 (644) from the preceding week (1056) but rose again in Week22 (1006), followed by a slight increase to Week23 (1121). Overall, this pattern suggests moderate instability with intermittent increases, likely influenced by external factors and not a systematic rise or decline.
2. Forecasting Week28, 2023 aligns with the off-season period, as this week falls outside historical peak and peak-onset seasons (which span from Week46 to Week6 and Week32 to Week46, respectively). Week23, 2023 CDC data indicates overall low influenza activity, with nationwide reports of "minimal" ILI activity and influenza positivity below the national baseline, reinforcing the off-season categorization for the forecasted period.
3. The fluctuating but gradually declining pattern observed up to Week23, 2023 suggests a continued decrease in occurrences leading into Week28, 2023. Using a time-series forecasting model, projecting forward from Week23 aligns with the off-season conditions, where ILI occurrences historically stabilize at lower levels. While short-term spikes might occur, extended forecasting prioritizes the broader off-season equilibrium, yielding the predicted value of 722.
4. Influenza positivity in respiratory specimens has been consistently low, ranging from 1.0% to 1.2% in Weeks19 through Week23 (Week19, 2023 #1; Week20, 2023 #1; Week21, 2023 #1; Week22, 2023 #1; Week23, 2023 #1). No significant spikes were observed, and the CDC anticipates minimal influenza activity for the summer (Week22, 2023 #10).
5. Vaccination trends and viral susceptibility indicate a protective effect against influenza. CDC reports that most circulating viruses match the vaccine, and nearly all tested viruses remain susceptible to antiviral medications (Week19, 2023 #7, #10; Week20, 2023 #9; Week23, 2023 #10). This limits the potential for sudden influenza surges.
6. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory viruses continues to mildly influence ILI trends but does not indicate a significant shift in influenza dynamics or a surge via novel variants (Week19, 2023 #9; Week21, 2023 #8; Week23, 2023 #10). This, combined with the off-season timing, supports the expectation of lower ILI occurrences.
7. In conclusion, fluctuating yet relatively low ILI occurrences, the off-season categorization for Week28, 2023, successful vaccination alignment with circulating strains, low influenza positivity rates, and stable co-circulation trends together justify the prediction of 722 ILI occurrences for Week28, 2023.
