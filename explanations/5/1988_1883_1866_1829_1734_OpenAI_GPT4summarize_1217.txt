1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent downward trend, with values ['1988', '1883', '1866', '1829', '1734']. Starting in Week15, 2023, the occurrences decreased steadily from 1988 to 1734 in Week19, 2023, reflecting a continuous decline in ILI activity over the observed period. This decline aligns with the reported low influenza activity nationwide and stable trends in respiratory illnesses during these weeks.
2. A negative correlation is evident between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the steady decline observed through Week19, 2023, transitions into a sharp reduction to 1017 after 5 weeks. The consistent downward pattern suggests a continuation of reduced ILI activity, culminating in significantly lower future occurrences.
3. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained slightly above the epidemic threshold but decreased from 7.5% in Week15, 2023, to 6.8% in Week19, 2023, mirroring the overall drop in ILI occurrences. This gradual decline in severe respiratory outcomes likely contributed to the lowered future ILI occurrences.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at rates consistently below the national baseline of 2.5%, ranging from 2.0% in Week15, 2023, to 1.9% in Week19, 2023. The lack of significant increases in outpatient visits indicates minimal upward pressure on ILI occurrences, aligning with reduced future numbers.
5. The high vaccine effectiveness against circulating influenza strains, reported as near 100% antigenic similarity, and stable antiviral susceptibility played a critical role in suppressing ILI activity during the observed weeks. Vaccination efforts likely further contributed to the decline in ILI occurrences, ensuring a reduction to 1017 future occurrences after Week19, 2023.
6. In summary, the reported 1017 future occurrences can be explained by the consistent downward trend in past ILI data, the decline in PIC-related deaths, stable outpatient visit rates below national baselines, and the positive impacts of widespread vaccination and antiviral susceptibility. These factors collectively maintained low influenza activity and contributed to the significant reduction in future ILI occurrences.
