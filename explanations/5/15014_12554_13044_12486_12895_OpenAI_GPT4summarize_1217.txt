1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a generally declining trend, with values of ['15014', '12554', '13044', '12486', '12895']. There was an initial significant drop from 15014 (Week2, 2024) to 12554 (Week3, 2024), followed by slight fluctuations from 13044 (Week4, 2024) to 12486 (Week5, 2024). The final value in Week6, 2024, 12895, remained notably lower than Week2. This downward trajectory indicates a reduction in ILI activity during this period.
2. A strong negative correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences; while the past weeks show a clear decline, the future occurrences drop even further to 9207 in Week11, 2024. This continuation of the downward trend suggests a consistent deceleration in ILI activity as the season progresses.
3. Hospitalizations remained high but showed signs of stabilization, with a cumulative rate increasing modestly from 37.3 per 100,000 (Week2, 2024) to 54.9 per 100,000 (Week6, 2024). The decline in weekly hospital admissions (e.g., 12382 in Week3 compared to slight drops in subsequent weeks) likely contributed to the reduction in ILI occurrences.
4. Outpatient ILI visits showed minimal fluctuations but remained steady and above the national baseline (4.7% in Week2 and 4.5% in Week6). The lack of sharp rises coupled with stabilization in positivity rates (e.g., 15.7% in Week6 vs. 16.2% in Week4) suggests effective mitigation steps and decreased overall transmission.
5. Enhanced vaccination efforts reported in all weeks likely played a role in gradually reducing the severity and spread of influenza. With the predominant strain well-matched to the vaccine, the seasonal efficacy in curbing disease spread aligns with the reduced ILI levels after five weeks.
6. In summary, the reported 9207 future ILI occurrences (Week11, 2024) align with the observed declining trend in Weeks2–6, 2024, stabilization in outpatient ILI visits, decreasing positivity rates, modest hospitalization reductions, and effective vaccination measures that contributed to overall reduced activity nationwide.
