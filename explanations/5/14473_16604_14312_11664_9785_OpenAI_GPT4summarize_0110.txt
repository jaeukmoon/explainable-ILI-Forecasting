1. The ILI counts for Week51, 2023 to Week3, 2024 are 14473, 16604, 14312, 11664, and 9785. The trend shows an initial increase from Week51, 2023 (14473) to Week52, 2023 (16604), followed by a steady decline through Week3, 2024 (9785). Overall, the pattern reflects a post-peak season downturn in ILI occurrences, indicative of diminishing activity after significant early spikes.
2. Forecasting Week8, 2024 falls within the off-season. Peak season typically ends by Week6, and the decreasing activity in Week2, 2024 and Week3, 2024 supports the conclusion that influenza is transitioning into lower levels as expected in the off-season.
3. The historical data suggests a strong correlation between the declines observed in Week2 and Week3, 2024 and the projected drop in ILI occurrences during the next five weeks. This consistent downward momentum aligns with trends typically observed during the post-peak phase of influenza seasons, reinforcing the model's estimate of 18059 for Week8, 2024 as a likely gradual stabilization or minor rebound.
4. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 remains dominant (Week51, 2023 #3; Week52, 2023 #2; Week2, 2024 #6; Week3, 2024 #2) but poses limited upward pressure due to high vaccine efficacy against this strain, moderating transmission rates.
5. Vaccination continues to be promoted as a preventive measure (Week51, 2023 #8; Week1, 2024 #8; Week3, 2024 #9). This reduces population susceptibility and likely limits future ILI occurrences despite moderate activity levels persisting now.
6. The co-circulation of influenza with other respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (Week51, 2023 #9; Week1, 2024 #9; Week3, 2024 #10) contributes to ILI trends but has shown stabilization or declines in recent weeks. These factors, coupled with decreasing positivity rates and hospital admissions, suggest no significant resurgence within five weeks.
7. In conclusion, the forecast of 18059 ILI occurrences for Week8, 2024 reflects the observed decline from peak-season highs, vaccine-driven mitigation, and entry into the off-season. These factors combined substantiate the projection as plausible for post-peak stabilization.
