1. The reported ILI counts from Week41 to Week45, 2023 are 1508, 1447, 1396, 1702, and 1472. The trend exhibits a fluctuating yet generally stable pattern, with a notable rise from Week43 to Week44 (1396 to 1702) followed by a minor dip in Week45 (1472). This indicates regional variations and modest increases in specific areas but no sustained or sharp escalation during the observed weeks.
2. Forecasting target week (Week50, 2023) belongs to the peak season, given that the U.S. typically experiences peak influenza activity between Week46 and Week6 of the following year. Increasing outpatient respiratory illness visits, rising hospitalizations, and an anticipated higher flu spread (Week44, 2023 #9; Week45, 2023 #11) align with expected peak activity.
3. The observed trend suggests that the modest increases and slight fluctuations from Week41 to Week45 will escalate toward Week50, consistent with the peak season dynamics. Time-series analysis supports this projection, as weekly ILI counts historically rise during this period, correlating with increasing positivity rates (Week44, 2023 #1; Week45, 2023 #1) and outpatient visits amidst the national baseline surpassing 2.9% (Week45, 2023 #3).
4. Increasing influenza positivity rates in clinical respiratory specimens reached 4.0% by Week45, 2023, doubling relative to Week41, 2023 (1.3%) and indicating rapid flu spread across regions (Week41, 2023 #1; Week44, 2023 #1; Week45, 2023 #1). The trend is influenced by influenza A dominance (Week44, 2023 #2; Week45, 2023 #2) and stable vaccine efficacy (Week45, 2023 #8). Co-circulation of RSV and COVID-19 contributes to ILI activity, amplifying symptom burden regionally (Week41, 2023 #9; Week45, 2023 #10).
5. Outpatient respiratory illness visits rose consistently above the baseline starting in Week44, 2023 (2.9%) and reached 3.5% in Week45, 2023, a clear indicator of heightened flu-related activity (Week44, 2023 #8; Week45, 2023 #3). The increase in flu hospitalizations, particularly among adults aged 65+, further reflects the growing influenza burden (Week44, 2023 #3; Week45, 2023 #4).
6. CDC forecasts continued increases in flu activity as of Week45, 2023, with substantial regional differences and rising hospitalization rates (Week44, 2023 #9; Week45, 2023 #11). The higher illness and mortality estimates through Week45, 2023 (Week45, 2023 #6) underscore the trajectory of the season aligning with peak influenza transmission.
7. Combining the ILI trend fluctuations, peak season timing, increased positivity rates, outpatient visits surpassing the baseline, rising hospitalizations, and CDC's anticipation of heightened activity, the forecasted ILI count for Week50, 2023 is 3151, justified by the accelerating intensity of seasonal influenza.
