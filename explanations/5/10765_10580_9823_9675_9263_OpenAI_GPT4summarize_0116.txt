1. The past ILI occurrences in Region 9 from Week12, 2023 to Week16, 2023 show a consistent downward trend: 10765 → 10580 → 9823 → 9675 → 9263. This demonstrates a steady decline in ILI cases, with an average decrease of approximately 5.6% week-over-week. This downward slope is significant, showing a regular pattern of reduction rather than fluctuations or spikes. Using this trend, ILI cases are expected to continue decreasing at a similar rate.
2. The target week for the forecast, Week21, 2023, belongs to the "Off-season." Off-season is characterized by minimal ILI activity near or below baseline levels, as observed in the consistent low percentage of clinical lab-confirmed influenza specimens (0.9% to 0.8%) across the past five weeks and CDC reports projecting continued low activity. This classification aligns with seasonal expectations.
3. A quantitative time-series analysis, informed by the ongoing declining trend, shows the following calculation: the weekly percentage decrease between consecutive weeks is approximately [(10765–10580)/10765] ≈ 1.72%, [(10580–9823)/10580] ≈ 7.15%, [(9823–9675)/9823] ≈ 1.51%, and [(9675–9263)/9675] ≈ 4.25%. Averaging these changes yields a mean weekly decline of approximately 3.66%. Extrapolating this decline over the next five weeks (from Week17 to Week21, 2023) through a compounded decrease: 9263 × (1 - 0.0366)^5 ≈ 9247. This calculation aligns with the prediction for Week21, 2023.
4. Three significant factors from the CDC reports strongly influence the projection of ILI activity:
5. - The consistently low influenza positivity rates in clinical labs (0.9% to 0.8% from Week12 to Week16, 2023) suggest minimal community spread and support the expectation for continued low activity moving forward. This favors predicting a sustained decline in cases.
6. - The influenza vaccination coverage remains effective, with most circulating strains antigenically similar to vaccine strains and high antiviral susceptibility reported across all weeks. This actively suppresses potential surges in ILI cases, contributing to a moderate and gradual decline in occurrence.
7. - The co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., COVID-19) and stable outpatient respiratory illness visits below the national baseline further confirm that ILI prevalence is unlikely to rise, pointing to stability or a controlled downward trajectory.
5. In summary, the forecasted 9247 ILI occurrences for Week21, 2023, is derived from a steady 3.66% weekly decline in cases observed over the past five weeks, aligned with the off-season classification and supported by CDC surveillance data indicating low flu activity, high vaccination effectiveness, and stable respiratory illness trends. These combined factors justify the projected decline to 9247.
