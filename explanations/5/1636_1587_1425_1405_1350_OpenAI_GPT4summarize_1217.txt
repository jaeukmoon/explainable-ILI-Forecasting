1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a steady decline, with values of ['1636', '1587', '1425', '1405', '1350']. Week23, 2024 started with the highest value of 1636, progressively decreasing each week to 1350 by Week27, 2024. This consistent downward trajectory reflects a reduction in ILI activity over the period.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 1504 seen after 5 weeks (corresponding to Week32, 2024) reveal a partial reversal of the declining trend observed in the past data. This suggests potential stabilization or slight resurgence of respiratory illness activity, likely influenced by the low but steady percentage of positive influenza detections and co-circulation of respiratory viruses documented during Weeks23–27, 2024.
3. Weekly outpatient visits for influenza-like illnesses remained consistently below the national baseline but showed minor fluctuations, ranging from 1.7% (Week23, 2024) to 1.4% (Week27, 2024). These small-scale variations align with the stabilization or modest uptick toward Week32, 2024.
4. Continued co-circulation of influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 during Weeks23–27, 2024, indicated by CDC reports, may have contributed to the observed future ILI occurrences. These interplaying viruses likely sustained ongoing respiratory illness activity despite low influenza positivity rates.
5. Downward-trending but persisting hospitalizations (0.1–0.2 per 100,000 across Weeks23–27, 2024), coupled with stable mortality rates attributed to influenza (0.1% or lower) and consistent low antiviral resistance, created conditions that allowed for sustained low-level transmission of influenza and respiratory illnesses, contributing to the reported future ILI count of 1504.
6. In summary, the reported 1504 future ILI occurrences (Week32, 2024) can be attributed to the gradual decline in past data stabilizing post-Week27, 2024, minor fluctuations in outpatient ILI visits, co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, and ongoing low-level influenza activity reflected in hospitalizations and mortality trends.
