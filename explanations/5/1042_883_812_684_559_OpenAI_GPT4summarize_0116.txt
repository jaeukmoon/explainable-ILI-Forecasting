1. Explanation:
1. The time-series data for ILI occurrences from Week3, 2021 to Week7, 2021 shows a steady declining trend: 1042 → 883 → 812 → 684 → 559. The weekly percentage decrease was calculated as follows:
2. - Week4: ((1042 - 883) / 1042) = 15.26%
3. - Week5: ((883 - 812) / 883) = 8.04%
4. - Week6: ((812 - 684) / 812) = 15.76%
5. - Week7: ((684 - 559) / 684) = 18.31%
6. On average, the weekly decline percentage is approximately 14.34%. This consistent decline indicates ongoing suppressed flu activity due to pandemic effects and minimal seasonal influenza spread. To project Week12, 2021 (5 weeks forward), we iteratively reduce the values by 14.34% per week:
7. Week8: 559 × (1 - 0.1434) ≈ 479
8. Week9: 479 × (1 - 0.1434) ≈ 410
9. Week10: 410 × (1 - 0.1434) ≈ 351
10. Week11: 351 × (1 - 0.1434) ≈ 301
11. Week12: 301 × (1 - 0.1434) ≈ 258.
12. However, additional CDC factors and the season modify this baseline prediction, as detailed below.
2. Week12, 2021 falls into the "Off-season," based on U.S. flu seasonality guidelines (from Background Knowledge). The flu peak season typically ends by Week6, followed by the Off-season that extends until the next Peak onset season (Week32). Off-seasons are characterized by diminished flu activity, generally near the baseline level. The consistent low positivity rates, minimal hospitalizations, and suppressed influenza trends observed in CDC reports for the preceding weeks confirm that Week12 lies within the Off-season.
3. The summarized CDC reports identify three key drivers influencing future ILI activity:
4. - Minimal influenza activity nationwide: Positivity rates for flu tests remain significantly low (e.g., 0.3% in Week3, dropping to 0.1% in Week4–Week7), with influenza B predominantly detected. This reflects an ongoing lack of widespread influenza transmission.
5. - Low hospitalization rates: Cumulative influenza-related hospitalizations remained at 0.5–0.6 per 100,000 across Week3–Week7, the lowest in decades. This reinforces the expectation of continued muted flu activity.
6. - Pandemic-induced behavioral changes (e.g., healthcare-seeking suppression, masking, and distancing): These factors continue to suppress flu transmission and ILI outpatient visits, which remained at 1.0–1.3%, well below the national baseline of 2.6%. The impact of these changes likely extends into Week12 and contributes to lower-than-typical ILI counts.
7. Quantitatively, these factors combined suppress typical decline rates. The 14.34% weekly reduction from historical data is therefore adjusted upward by approximately 2–3% per week due to these suppressive effects. Applying a compounded adjustment of -16% per week instead of -14.34%, the projection becomes:
8. Week8: 559 × (1 - 0.16) ≈ 470
9. Week9: 470 × (1 - 0.16) ≈ 395
10. Week10: 395 × (1 - 0.16) ≈ 332
11. Week11: 332 × (1 - 0.16) ≈ 279
12. Week12: 279 × (1 - 0.16) ≈ 234.
4. However, slight upward adjustments are factored into the final prediction due to an emerging trend in pediatric ILI visits. CDC reports for Week7 note a mild increase in ILI activity among children aged 0–4 years, which may modestly offset the decline. A conservative adjustment of +13% to account for this demographic trend modifies the Week12 estimate as follows:
