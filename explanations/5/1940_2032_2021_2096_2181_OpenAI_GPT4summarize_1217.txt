1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1940', '2032', '2021', '2096', '2181']. The data indicates a progressive rise, starting from 1940 in Week11, 2022, to 2181 in Week15, 2022, with minor fluctuations in the third week. This consistent increase reflects escalating ILI activity throughout the observed period and sets the stage for further growth.
2. A positive correlation exists between the past time-series ILI occurrences and the future value of 2211 in Week20, 2022. The steady increase in Weeks11–15 suggests a sequential continuation of the trend, further supported by the consistent hospitalization and outpatient ILI visit increases reported in the summarized data. This highlights how the observed past rise corresponds closely to the future reported occurrences.
3. Hospitalization rates for influenza steadily rose across the 5-week period, increasing from 6.5 per 100,000 in Week11, 2022, to 9.8 per 100,000 in Week15, 2022. This sustained elevation underscores escalating ILI impacts in the subsequent weeks. Outpatient ILI visits steadily rose over time, reaching 2.1% in Week15, 2022, still below the baseline but reflecting rising healthcare encounters for respiratory symptoms. A predominance of Influenza A(H3N2) with ongoing genetic and antigenic evolution was noted, suggesting influenza's continued contribution to rising ILI patterns. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses impacted ILI trends, as 5.0% of influenza-positive specimens also tested positive for COVID-19 by Week15, 2022, adding complexity to the overall respiratory illness landscape.
4. Increasing ILI outpatient visits and hospitalizations from Week11 to Week15, 2022, combined with a rising percentage of influenza positivity in clinical specimens (7.7% in Week11 to 8.9% in Week15) and the continued circulation of A(H3N2), align with expected future growth in ILI numbers. Co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and the contribution of other respiratory illnesses further amplify the observed increases.
5. In summary, the reported 2211 ILI occurrences in Week20, 2022, are explained by the consistent upward trend in past ILI occurrences, coupled with rising outpatient and hospitalization rates, predominance of A(H3N2), co-circulating respiratory viruses, and the persistent escalation in influenza positivity rates observed over the 5-week summary period.
