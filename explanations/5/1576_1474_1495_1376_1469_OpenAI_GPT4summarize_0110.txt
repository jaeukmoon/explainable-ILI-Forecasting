1. The reported ILI counts from Week23 to Week27, 2021 are 1576, 1474, 1495, 1376, and 1469. The trend shows a moderate decline from Week23 (1576) to Week27 (1469) with minor fluctuations across the weeks. This indicates a generally decreasing trend in ILI occurrences during this period, with no sharp increases or pronounced changes in activity levels.
2. Week32, 2021 falls within the peak onset season when ILI activity gradually begins to increase from the baseline in preparation for higher transmission rates seen in the peak season. Based on historical seasonality patterns in the U.S., Week32 aligns with the transition period of increasing influenza transmission.
3. The time-series trend analysis from Week23 to Week27, 2021, which shows a declining trend with fluctuations, suggests that the overall low activity is stabilizing. However, given the seasonal transition to the peak onset period and historical patterns of flu activity, the slight rise in ILI occurrences forecasted for Week32, 2021 (2456) reflects an expected seasonal increase from baseline activity.
4. The low influenza positivity rates reported (Week23, 2021 #1, #2; Week24, 2021 #2; Week25, 2021 #1; Week26, 2021 #1; Week27, 2021 #1) indicate minimal influenza circulation, but the transition to the peak onset season could contribute to gradual increases in ILI activity.
5. Challenges in healthcare-seeking behavior and data interpretation due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic complicate trends (Week23, 2021 #8, #10; Week24, 2021 #7, #8; Week26, 2021 #6; Week27, 2021 #7). Increased respiratory illness activity due to overlapping flu and COVID-19 trends may lead to higher ILI cases being reported.
6. The presence of a mixed subtype distribution—Influenza B (70.6%) and Influenza A (29.4%)—observed in positive cases during Week27, 2021 (Week27, 2021 #2) highlights potential changes in virologic activity that could influence the seasonal uptick in ILI occurrences.
7. Based on the combination of a declining trend stabilizing at low levels in the off-season (Week23 to Week27, 2021), the seasonal transition to the peak onset period (Week32, 2021), potential increases due to shifts in healthcare behaviors, and the interplay of Influenza A and B dynamics (Week27, 2021 #2, #10), the focus on 2456 ILI occurrences reflects an expected seasonal rise as activity begins to increase from baseline levels.
