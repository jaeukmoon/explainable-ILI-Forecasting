1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed fluctuating trends with an initial increase followed by a decline. Specifically, the values were ['1171', '1320', '1416', '1293', '1230']. The ILI occurrences reached a peak of 1416 in Week 46, 2020, indicating a transient surge before declining to 1293 in Week 47, 2020, and further to 1230 in Week 48, 2020. This downward trend in the last two weeks reflects a temporary reduction in ILI activity.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 1060 aligns with the downward trend seen in Weeks 47–48, 2020, suggesting that the peak ILI activity observed in Week 46, 2020, did not sustain and further reductions unfolded. The correlation suggests that the observed low levels of ILI occurrences in the weeks leading up to 48 acted as a precursor to the lower future occurrence.
3. The continued low levels of outpatient ILI visits over the 5-week period, remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%, highlight minimal respiratory illness activity, with percentages at 1.3% (Week 44, 2020), 1.5% (Weeks 45–46, 2020), and 1.6% (Weeks 47–48, 2020). These stable and low levels of outpatient visits are consistent with the reduced future occurrence of 1060 ILI cases.
4. The unusually low influenza activity reported in the CDC summaries, with positivity rates between 0.1% and 0.2% across Weeks 44–48, 2020, underscores a reduced circulation of influenza viruses, contributing to the diminished ILI occurrences in future weeks. These reduced positivity rates, in combination with low detection rates in public health and clinical laboratories, signal a suppressed influenza burden influencing the future data.
5. High PIC mortality percentages (8.1% in Week 44, 2020, increasing to 12.8% in Week 48, 2020) were primarily driven by COVID-19, with minimal contribution from influenza. This indicates that non-influenza respiratory illnesses and other underlying factors dominated healthcare dynamics, while true influenza activity remained constrained, reflecting in the lower future ILI numbers.
6. Pandemic-induced changes in healthcare-seeking behavior, widely noted across CDC summaries, and reduced ILI surveillance reliability played critical roles. As healthcare systems were dominated by COVID-19, influenza cases and non-specific ILI occurrences may have been underreported, contributing to the subdued future occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 1060 future ILI occurrences by Week 53, 2020, can be attributed to the downward trend in Weeks 47–48, 2020, persistently low ILI outpatient visit percentages, suppressed influenza activity due to low virus positivity rates, dominance of COVID-19 in PIC mortality, and disruptions in traditional ILI surveillance during the pandemic context.
