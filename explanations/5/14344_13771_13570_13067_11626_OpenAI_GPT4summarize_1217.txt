1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend with values ['14344', '13771', '13570', '13067', '11626']. Starting from 14344 (Week 27, 2022), there was a steady decline each week, reaching the lowest value at 11626 in Week 31, 2022. This pattern indicates decreasing ILI activity during this period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the consistent downward trend observed in the past 5 weeks does not align with the notable increase to 15839 future occurrences by Week 36, 2022. This suggests that factors beyond the observed data drove the future rise.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI declined steadily from 1.7% (Week 27, 2022) to 1.5% (Week 31, 2022), pointing to waning ILI activity. Yet the persistence of high outpatient visit rates among children aged 0-4 years (e.g., 6.1% in Week 31, 2022) reflects localized vulnerability to increasing respiratory illnesses, potentially contributing to future occurrences.
4. Mortality due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained significantly above the epidemic threshold, rising from 8.8% (Week 27, 2022) to 10.0% (Week 31, 2022). This sustained PIC mortality indicates an ongoing burden of respiratory illnesses, predominantly COVID-19, which could signal an amplification of ILI occurrences later.
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and RSV, was reported consistently across the 5 weeks, complicating ILI surveillance. These factors, compounded by disruptions in healthcare dynamics during the lingering pandemic, may have masked or delayed reporting, leading to a future spike in occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported future rise to 15839 ILI occurrences in Week 36, 2022, is inconsistent with the observed downward trend but aligns with persistent PIC mortality, high localized outpatient visits for ILI in children, and the compounding effects of viral co-circulation and pandemic-driven disruptions in reporting and healthcare-seeking behaviors.
