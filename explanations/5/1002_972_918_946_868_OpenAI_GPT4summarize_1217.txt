1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a declining trend, with values of ['1002', '972', '918', '946', '868']. From Week13, 2022 to Week17, 2022, there was an initial decrease from 1002 to 918 (Week15, 2022), followed by a slight rebound to 946 in Week16, 2022, and then another decrease to 868 in Week17, 2022. This downward trajectory suggests a general reduction in ILI activity over the 5-week period, punctuated by minor variability.
2. The decreasing trend in past ILI occurrences does not directly correlate with the reported future ILI occurrences of 689 after 5 weeks. The declining pattern observed in Week17, 2022, aligns more with the reduced future value of 689 but could suggest that external factors might have further suppressed ILI activity during this period.
3. Multiple CDC-reported factors influenced the suppressed future ILI occurrences. (1) Outpatient visits for respiratory illness remained consistently below baseline (2.0% in Week14, 2022, and 2.2% by Week17, 2022), indicating controlled lower respiratory illness activity, likely contributing to reduced future ILI cases. (2) Mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) generally exceeded epidemic thresholds, remaining stable or declining slightly to 7.2% by Week17, 2022, suggesting greater under-control of influenza-related outcomes. (3) Influenza positivity rates in clinical labs remained steady yet low, ranging from 7.8% (Week16, 2022) to 8.1% (Week17, 2022), indicating moderate transmission. (4) Weekly hospital admissions for influenza decreased for the first time since January by Week17, 2022, which aligns with waning severe flu activity and may project reduced ILI counts.
4. Persistent co-circulation of non-influenza respiratory viruses, variations in age group infection trends (e.g., increasing in very young ages), and possible vaccine mismatch impacts may have additionally influenced lower overall ILI activity.
5. In summary, the decline to 689 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks reflects the overarching downward trend observed in past data, complemented by consistently low outpatient visit rates, stable PIC-related metrics, declining hospitalization trends, and diminishing influenza positivity rates. This combination of factors collectively contributed to the reduced ILI occurrences by Week22, 2022.
