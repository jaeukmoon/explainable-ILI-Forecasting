1. The reported ILI counts from Week45 to Week49, 2021 are 1203, 1223, 1170, 1408, and 1325. The time-series trend observed indicates first a modest rise from Week45 (1203) to Week46 (1223), a slight decline in Week47 (1170), then a sharp increase in Week48 (1408), followed by a mild decline in Week49 (1325). The overall trend suggests low but gradually increasing ILI activity toward Week49.
2. Based on the timing, Week2 of 2022 falls within the peak season, which typically spans from Week46 of one year through Week6 of the next year. This alignment with increasing influenza activity and outpatient visits above baseline (Week48, 2021 #3) supports the classification of Week2, 2022 as part of the peak season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the preceding incremental increase in ILI occurrences (e.g., Week47 to Week48) and upward trajectory in outpatient ILI visits (Week48, 2021 #3; Week49, 2021 #3) tend to project forward during peak season. These historical patterns suggest a continued upward trend or stabilization at a higher level, leading to the forecasted value of 2895 for Week2, 2022.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) continues to dominate nationally, with significant activity among younger individuals aged 5-24 and increasing cases in adults (Week48, 2021 #2; Week49, 2021 #8). This sustained prevalence during a time of rising transmission supports higher ILI counts.
5. Vaccination uptake shows a lower trend compared to the previous season (Week48, 2021 #7; Week49, 2021 #6), potentially reducing protection in communities and contributing to increasing ILI activity.
6. Multiple respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are co-circulating (Week48, 2021 #3; Week49, 2021 #10), complicating assessments and amplifying ILI occurrences, especially during the peak season where flu transmission intensifies.
7. In conclusion, the increasing ILI trend observed in past weeks, coupled with peak-season timing, higher circulation of Influenza A(H3N2), suboptimal vaccination uptake, and the influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses, justifies the projected ILI occurrence of 2895 for Week2, 2022.
