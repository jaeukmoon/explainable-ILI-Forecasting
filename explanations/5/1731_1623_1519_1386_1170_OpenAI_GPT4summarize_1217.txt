1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent declining trend, with values decreasing steadily from 1731 (Week24, 2022) to 1170 (Week28, 2022). This downward trajectory reflects a waning period of ILI activity, likely influenced by reduced influenza activity as indicated in the CDC reports.
2. A negative correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences. The continuous decline in past occurrences leading to 1170 (Week28, 2022) aligns with the sustained lower future ILI level of 1207 after 5 weeks (Week33, 2022). This indicates that the low baseline of ILI activity established by Week28 persisted into later weeks with slight increases, due to external factors.
3. Influenza hospitalization rates showed a significant decline over these weeks, decreasing from 1736 (Week24, 2022) to 722 (Week28, 2022). This reduction mirrors the decline in ILI occurrences. The ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (highlighted in Week28 reports) may have stabilized ILI activity at a slightly elevated level into the future.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI declined from 1.9% (Week24, 2022) to 1.6% (Week28, 2022) but remained above the national baseline in specific younger age groups. The gradual reduction in outpatient ILI visits corresponds to the observed decrease in ILI activity but supports a consistent residual level of occurrences, as seen in the future data.
5. The co-occurring disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior and traditional influenza surveillance approaches (referenced across Weeks24–28, 2022) likely contributed to reported ILI fluctuations, rather than an actual decrease in respiratory illness. These systemic challenges, combined with lingering respiratory viruses, may explain the slight resurgence to 1207 in Week33, 2022, despite the preceding decline.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1207 (Week33, 2022) result from the consistent decreases observed in Weeks24–28, 2022, balanced by lingering respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, increasing outpatient visits among specific age groups, and pandemic-related healthcare-seeking patterns that maintained residual ILI activity.
