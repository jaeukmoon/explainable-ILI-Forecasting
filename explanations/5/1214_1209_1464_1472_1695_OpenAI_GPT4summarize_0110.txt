1. The reported ILI counts from Week45 to Week49, 2020 are 1214, 1209, 1464, 1472, and 1695. The trend shows a significant increase starting in Week47, 2020, rising sharply through Week49, 2020 (1464 to 1695). This reflects a marked upward trend in ILI occurrences during the given time frame, suggesting the movement toward peak flu transmission.
2. Forecasting target week (Week1, 2021) belongs to the peak season. The rise in ILI occurrences, coupled with influenza season trends in the U.S., indicates Week1 typically falls within the peak season window. This aligns with historical timing for high flu activity (Week46 to Week6 of following year, Background Knowledge #1).
3. From the time-series perspective, the upward trend from Week47 to Week49, 2020 projects forward into future weeks, suggesting continued high activity. While the increase from Week48 (1472) to Week49 (1695) is noticeable, the level stabilizes between Weeks48-49, suggesting a moderate peak. Extending this steady trend five weeks forward leads to an expectation of 1475 ILI occurrences in Week1, 2021 as it normalizes near a peak activity range.
4. Reported low influenza test positivity (e.g., 0.2% Week45-49, 2020 #1; Week48, 2020 #1), while indicative of unusual mitigation impacts from COVID-19 measures, illustrates that actual flu cases are underrepresented due to diagnostic challenges (Week45-49, 2020 #9).
5. The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (Week45-49, 2020 #6, #9) continues to distort data collection and healthcare-seeking behavior but does not fully suppress ILI trends, which remain poised for future increases as CDC anticipates (Week46-49, 2020 #9).
6. Flu vaccination remains insufficient in altering trends conclusively due to stable or unreported uptake (Week45-48, 2020 #8). Coupled with overlap from SARS-CoV-2, true flu activity is partially masked but still rising (Week45-49, 2020 #8).
7. Given the upward-trending ILI reports, proximity to peak season (Week1, 2021), moderate flu activity below baseline with potential increases, and overlapping healthcare-seeking distortions from COVID-19, the projected ILI occurrence aligns with 1475 as an estimate for Week1, 2021.
