1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline: 16544 (Week 8, 2024) to 16509 (Week 9, 2024), followed by 15338 (Week 10, 2024), 15334 (Week 11, 2024), and 14964 (Week 12, 2024). This decrease suggests a tapering trend in ILI activity over the observation period, indicating a subsiding influenza wave.
2. The decline in past ILI occurrences correlates with the lower reported future ILI occurrence of 13258 (Week 17, 2024). The observed drop over the 5 weeks likely reflects the continued decrease, consistent with seasonal influenza tapering toward stability.
3. Nationwide outpatient visits for ILI decreased steadily from 4.4% (Week 8, 2024) to 3.1% (Week 12, 2024), mirroring the broader decline in ILI occurrences. This declining healthcare engagement with ILI aligns with the lower future value of 13258.
4. The mortality due to influenza reduced from 0.7% (Week 8, 2024) to 0.5% (Week 12, 2024), alongside the slowing influenza-positive test rates from 14.2% (Week 8, 2024) to 10.5% (Week 12, 2024). These reductions reflect a waning influenza season and foreshadow the continued lower ILI numbers seen in Week 17, 2024.
5. Regional variability in flu activity, with increases in certain areas like the Pacific Northwest in Week 11, 2024, and co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV and SARS-CoV-2) introduced inconsistencies but did not overshadow the overall national downward trend. These factors contributed to the stabilization reflected in the future ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 13258 (Week 17, 2024) arises from a consistent decline in past ILI trends, concurrent decreases in outpatient ILI visits and positivity rates, reduced influenza-related mortality, and the tapering seasonal influenza impact as influenced by regional and multi-viral dynamics.
