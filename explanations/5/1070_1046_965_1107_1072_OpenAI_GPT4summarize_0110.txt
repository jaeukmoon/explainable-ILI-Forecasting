1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week24 to Week28, 2021 are 1070, 1046, 965, 1107, and 1072. The trend shows a slight decrease from Week24 (1070) to Week26 (965), followed by a minor rebound in Week27 (1107) and remaining stable in Week28 (1072). Overall, this trend indicates a mild fluctuation but lacks significant growth or decline, reflecting steadiness in ILI activity.
2. Week33, 2021 falls within the off-season period as ILI activity and positivity rates are consistently below the national baseline (2.6%), and influenza activity remains minimal according to CDC reports (Week24, 2021; Week25, 2021; Week26, 2021; Week27, 2021; Week28, 2021). Historically, off-season spans from after peak season to early onset, consistent with Week33, 2021.
3. Based on time-series patterns, the slightly fluctuating but relatively stable occurrences over the past five weeks suggest no significant spike or decline is expected in the near term. Projecting the observed stability forward five weeks, the future count of 1543 aligns with the previously observed mild increase from Week26 to Week28, albeit with adjustments for seasonality and virologic stability.
4. Minimal influenza positivity rates remain steady at or below 0.1% over the past five weeks (Week24, 2021 #2; Week25, 2021 #1; Week26, 2021 #1; Week27, 2021 #1; Week28, 2021 #1), with limited influenza circulation indicated by public health surveillance data.
5. The continued dominance of COVID-19 as a major contributor to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) deaths—accounting for over 6% of deaths each week—overshadows influenza contributions (Week24, 2021 #5; Week25, 2021 #5; Week26, 2021 #4; Week27, 2021 #5; Week28, 2021 #4), limiting influenza spread.
6. Healthcare behaviors altered by the COVID-19 pandemic, including alternative care settings, continue impacting ILI surveillance and reporting accuracy, further contributing to the minimal and stable observed trends (Week24, 2021 #7; Week25, 2021 #8; Week26, 2021 #6; Week27, 2021 #7; Week28, 2021 #6).
7. In conclusion, the unchanged influenza positivity, reduced transmission during the off-season, continued dominance of COVID-19, and stable past ILI trends collectively justify the forecast of 1543 ILI occurrences for Week33, 2021, reflecting a likely stable but low influenza activity profile.
