1. The reported ILI counts from Week4 to Week8, 2021 were 1117, 1093, 990, 914, and 1013. A consistent decline in ILI occurrences was observed from Week4 (1117) through Week7 (914), followed by a slight rebound in Week8 (1013). This general trend demonstrates a predominantly decreasing trajectory with a minor rise toward the end of the period.
2. Based on typical influenza seasons in the U.S., Week13, 2021 occurs well past the traditional peak season (Week46 to Week6) and aligns with the off-season period. Additionally, influenza activity and ILI indicators remain minimal (Week4 to Week8, 2021 #1, #4, #10, #11), strongly suggesting that Week13, 2021 belongs to the off-season category.
3. The time-series data illustrates a declining ILI trend in Weeks4-7, 2021, with a minor increase in Week8, 2021. Projections forward suggest a stabilization or slight rise in ILI activity, consistent with the observed minor rebound. This trend, along with the low influenza activity during the off-season, likely predicts ILI occurrences of 1209 in Week13, 2021.
4. Influenza activity remains historically low nationwide, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive across Weeks4-8, 2021 (Week4, 2021 #1; Week5, 2021 #1; Week6, 2021 #1; Week7, 2021 #1; Week8, 2021 #1). This reflects minimal flu transmission and reduced ILI activity across regions.
5. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 has altered healthcare-seeking behavior and surveillance trends, reflected in low ILI reporting and uncertainty in data interpretation (Week4, 2021 #8, #10; Week5, 2021 #9; Week6, 2021 #9; Week8, 2021 #10). This disruption continues to limit widespread influenza transmission.
6. Despite CDC recommendations for vaccination, no significant changes in vaccination coverage are reported (Week4, 2021 #9; Week5, 2021 #8; Week6, 2021 #8; Week7, 2021 #8; Week8, 2021 #9). The lack of a notable increase in immunity through vaccination further contributes to the projected low ILI activity.
7. In summary, the persistent decline in ILI occurrences (Weeks4-8, 2021), the off-season timing (Week13, 2021), minimal influenza activity, COVID-19-related disruptions, and unchanged vaccination trends justify the forecasted ILI occurrences of 1209 in Week13, 2021. This aligns with an overall stable or modestly increasing trend amid historically low transmission levels.
