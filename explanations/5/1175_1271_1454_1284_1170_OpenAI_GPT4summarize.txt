1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating yet overall downward trend, with values of ['1175' (Week 51, 2020), '1271' (Week 52, 2020), '1454' (Week 53, 2020), '1284' (Week 1, 2021), and '1170' (Week 2, 2021)]. While there was an initial increase from 1175 to 1454 (Week 53, 2020), this was followed by a consistent decrease over the subsequent two weeks. The declining trajectory near the end of the observation period reflects diminished ILI activity heading into Week 3, 2021.

2. A significant positive correlation is observed between the past and future ILI occurrences. Despite the decline in the latter weeks of the observed data (Weeks 1–2, 2021), the initial peak at 1454 (Week 53, 2020) suggests a lagging impact of ILI activity, consistent with a subsequent rise to 1013 future occurrences in Week 7, 2021. This suggests that the earlier peak established a baseline for the reported future ILI values despite short-term declines thereafter.

3. Several key factors from the CDC reports correlate highly with the future ILI occurrences:
   - Outpatient visits for ILI, which remained stable at or below 1.6% across all past weeks, experienced regional fluctuations (e.g., slight decreases to 1.4% in Week 2, 2021). Such fluctuations may have contributed to delayed transmission dynamics and indirectly supported the rise in Week 7, 2021.
   - Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, rising to 17.2% in Week 1, 2021, despite a majority being due to COVID-19. The ongoing burden of respiratory illnesses from both influenza and COVID-19 likely influenced broader ILI activity downstream.
   - Healthcare-seeking behavior shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic consistently disrupted ILI surveillance accuracy across all weeks. The underreporting or delayed reporting of ILI cases during these weeks likely contributed to the observed rise to 1013 future ILI occurrences.

4. In summary, the reported 1013 ILI occurrences in Week 7, 2021, can be explained by the earlier peak noted in Week 53, 2020, the sustained impact of elevated PIC mortality levels during the observation period, pandemic-driven healthcare-seeking and reporting disruptions, and regionally fluctuating outpatient ILI visits. The short-term downward trend near Weeks 1–2, 2021, may have obscured some of this underlying activity, but lagging effects and reporting irregularities from the pandemic environment help account for the eventual rise in future occurrences.
