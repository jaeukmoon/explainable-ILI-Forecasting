1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks revealed a fluctuating trend, with values of ['12648', '9164', '8046', '10127', '11345']. The data indicates an initial significant decline from 12648 (Week1, 2024) to 8046 (Week3, 2024). However, a subsequent rebound is observed in Week4, 2024 (10127), continuing an upswing to 11345 in Week5, 2024. These fluctuations reflect changing flu activity, with a notable recovery in ILI occurrences toward the end of the observed period.
2. A clear correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the resurgence evident in Weeks 4–5, 2024, culminated in an eventual decline to 7019 occurrences after 5 weeks. While a rise was observed at the end of the 5-week period, the slight downward shifts in Week3, 2024, alongside the CDC's caution about post-peak seasonality, align with the gradual reduction in activity reflected by the future data.
3. Outpatient respiratory illness rates experienced consecutive weekly decreases, from 5.7% (Week1, 2024) to 4.3% (Week3–4, 2024), and stabilized at 4.4% in Week5, 2024. This consistent decline in healthcare-seeking for respiratory illnesses coincided with the eventual drop to 7019 occurrences after 5 weeks.
4. Cumulative hospitalization rates peaked mid-period, rising from 31.7 per 100,000 (Week1, 2024) to 51.5 per 100,000 by Week5, 2024, before showing reduced weekly hospital admissions. This peak and subsequent stabilization forecast the gradual dampening observed in future occurrences.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, persisted across all weeks, complicating trends. While initially contributing to elevated ILI activity, these factors appeared to stabilize toward the end of the 5-week period, aligning with declining future occurrences to 7019.
6. In summary, the reported 7019 future ILI occurrences can be attributed to the fluctuating trend in the past data, stabilization of outpatient respiratory visits and hospitalization rates, as well as the reduced impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses. The CDC's projections of post-peak stabilization periods also align with the gradual drop characteristic of the future observed data.
