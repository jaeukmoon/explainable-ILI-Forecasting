1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated fluctuating but relatively stable values of ['2003', '2066', '1968', '2118', '2022']. Despite week-to-week variability, the overall trend remained consistent, with values oscillating between 1968 (Week16, 2021) and 2118 (Week17, 2021). This lack of significant change suggests a stable baseline in ILI activity during this period.
2. A moderate positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is suggested. The stability in the last two weeks (Weeks 17–18, 2021, with values of 2118 and 2022) reflects a plateau that aligns with the slightly decreased future occurrence value of 1934 after 5 weeks (Week23, 2021). Such stability may act as an intermediate precursor to the slight decline in future ILI values, likely due to persistent low flu detection in the observed weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained steady at 1.1% across Weeks14–17, 2021, before a minor increase to 1.2% in Week18, 2021. This marginal change reflects sluggish influenza activity but hints at potential non-specific respiratory illness trends minimally influencing future ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained well above epidemic thresholds, fluctuating from 11.2% (Week14, 2021) to 10.9% (Week18, 2021), primarily due to COVID-19. This ongoing respiratory illness burden may indirectly affect future ILI occurrences through overlapping healthcare data impacts or confusion in attributing ILI versus COVID-19 cases.
5. Minimal positivity rates for influenza (e.g., 0.1% across clinical labs in all weeks) and low hospitalization rates (0.8 per 100,000, consistent for Weeks14–18, 2021) highlight negligible influenza transmission. Despite this, concurrent surveillance challenges due to altered healthcare behaviors and COVID-19 may have contributed to underreported cases or inclusion of non-specific ILI cases, influencing the recorded future ILI occurrence of 1934.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1934 (Week23, 2021) are explained by the stable past trend of ILI values, plateauing healthcare-seeking behaviors measured in outpatient visits, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and overlapping impacts of COVID-19 and altered surveillance, which likely shaped the slight decline in future ILI reporting.
