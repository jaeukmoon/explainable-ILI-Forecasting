1. The past ILI data from Week50, 2021 to Week2, 2022 show an overall upward trend, with counts increasing from 1874 in Week50, 2021 to 2919 by Week52, 2021. However, this growth slows slightly in Week1, 2022 (2533) and Week2, 2022 (2536), indicating a plateau after the initial sharp rise.
2. Forecasting Week7, 2022 aligns with the off-season period. By Week2, 2022, ILI activity had plateaued at a moderate level, marking the early transition from the peak season to the off-season. While activity is still elevated, slight declines indicate a movement past the peak window into stabilization.
3. The past trend suggests a decline or stabilization of activity after the peak during Week50, 2021 to Week1, 2022. This plateau was evident by Week2, 2022, supported by reduced outpatient respiratory visits and declining positivity rates. A time-series model projecting forward five weeks incorporates this stabilization and expects a significant drop in occurrences to 803 by Week7, 2022.
4. Influenza activity remains highly elevated but showed slight decreases by Week1, 2022 and Week2, 2022 (#1). This decline, following the peak in Week52, 2021, signals the expected reduction in ILI trends as the off-season approaches.
5. Flu vaccination rates were reported to be lower compared to previous seasons (#7, Week50, 2021; #8, Week2, 2022); however, the close genetic match of circulating A(H3N2) strains to the vaccine likely provides partial collective immunity, preventing sustained high levels of ILI activity.
6. Co-circulation of influenza and other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, persists but does not drive additional influenza spikes (#9, Week50, 2021; #10, Week2, 2022). Moreover, declining healthcare visits for respiratory illness support a projected ILI reduction.
7. Combining the stabilization observed by Week2, 2022 with the typical off-season effects, decreased flu activity, and lower transmission of Influenza A(H3N2), the predicted ILI occurrence of 803 in Week7, 2022 reflects the expected off-season trend.
