1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['16509', '15338', '15334', '14964', '13834']. Starting from 16509 (Week 9, 2024), there was a steady decline in ILI activity each week, reaching 13834 in Week 13, 2024, the lowest in the observed period. This pattern indicates a decreasing ILI activity during the 5-week span.
2. A moderately positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the decline in ILI activity over Weeks 9–13, 2024, aligns with a subsequent lower occurrence of 12849 after 5 weeks (Week 18, 2024). The consistent downward slope in past numbers reasonably matches the reduced value of future occurrences.
3. Decreasing outpatient visits for ILI from 4.1% in Week 9, 2024, to 3.0% in Week 13, 2024, indicates waning healthcare encounters for respiratory illnesses. This continued decline correlates with the observed reduced ILI occurrences of 12849 in Week 18, 2024.
4. Percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza decreased steadily, from 13.9% in Week 9 to 9.1% in Week 13, 2024. This reduction in influenza positivity mirrors the decreasing ILI occurrences, supporting the lower future value.
5. Cumulative influenza-related hospitalization rates showed consistent increases, from 64.8 per 100,000 (Week 9, 2024) to 74.2 per 100,000 (Week 13, 2024), while weekly admissions continued to decline. This indicates that new severe cases diminished, aligning with the lower ILI occurrences of 12849 reported after 5 weeks.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, such as RSV and COVID-19, persisted but showed a decline in weekly influenza mortality (0.7% in Week 9 to 0.5% in Week 13, 2024). These diminishing impacts likely contributed to the lower ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
7. In summary, the decrease to 12849 future ILI occurrences (Week 18, 2024) resulted from the consistent downward trend in Weeks 9–13, 2024, declining outpatient visits for ILI, reductions in influenza positivity and mortality rates, and diminishing impacts from co-circulating respiratory viruses.
