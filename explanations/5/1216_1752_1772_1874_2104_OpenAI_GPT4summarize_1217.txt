1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5-week period demonstrated a clear upward trend, increasing steadily from 1216 (Week47, 2021) to 2104 (Week51, 2021). This progression includes incremental rises each week: 1216 to 1752 (Week48), 1772 (Week49), 1874 (Week50), and finally peaking at 2104 in Week51, 2021. This consistent upward trajectory signifies escalating ILI activity during this time frame.
2. The correlation between the past ILI occurrences and the future ILI occurrences is evident, as the sustained rise in ILI incidence from Week47 through Week51, 2021, aligns with the eventual decrease to 1484 future ILI occurrences after Week56, 2021. This reduction suggests that the initial surge observed in the past culminated before stabilizing due to situational factors such as population-level immunity, behavioral adjustments, or reduced viral spread.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a steady rise in the reports, from 2.4% (Week47, 2021) to 3.8% (Week51, 2021), exceeding the national baseline by Week50. This steady increase in outpatient ILI visits signals higher respiratory illness activity, correlating with both rising past cases and the subsequent stabilization to 1484 occurrences after 5 weeks.
4. Hospitalization rates rose significantly during this time, with weekly admissions increasing from 495 (Week47, 2021) to 1825 (Week51, 2021). This marked rise in flu-related hospitalizations reflects escalating flu activity, which would have influenced the peak in ILI occurrences before their eventual decline after Week51, 2021.
5. Mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) persistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, increasing from 15.5% (Week47, 2021) to 19.2% (Week51, 2021). The high PIC mortality rate, driven largely by respiratory illnesses, highlights the heightened respiratory burden during the past weeks, likely contributing to the observed past and future ILI patterns.
6. The impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) and antigenic differences within detected A(H3N2) viruses further complicated ILI assessments and likely drove variations in activity. The influence of vaccine uptake, which was reportedly lower than previous seasons, also played a role in the fluctuation of ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 1484 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks can be attributed to the consistent rise in past occurrences peaking at Week51, 2021, increased outpatient visits and hospitalizations for ILI, persistently high PIC mortality, the influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses, and evolving influenza virus patterns that ultimately led to a stabilization after the peak.
