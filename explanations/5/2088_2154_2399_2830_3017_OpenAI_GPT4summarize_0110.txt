1. The reported ILI counts from Week43 to Week47, 2020 are 2088, 2154, 2399, 2830, and 3017. The trend shows a steady increase week-over-week, with a more noticeable rise between Week45 (2399) and Week47 (3017). This upward trajectory indicates growing influenza-like illness activity, though still below typical peak baseline thresholds.
2. Given that None (forecasting week) would fall during the peak season (as the peak season spans roughly from Week46 through Week6 of the following year), and ILI activity is steadily rising (Week43 to Week47, 2020), the target week is forecasted to belong to the peak season.
3. The five-week upward trend suggests strong seasonality, consistent with the typical ILI increases during the onset and progression of the peak flu season. The growth trend from 2088 in Week43 to 3017 in Week47 projects forward a continued incremental rise. Using the time-series trajectory, it aligns with a moderate ILI increase by None (2836), reflecting slower growth as the target week approaches potential stabilization.
4. Influenza positivity remains extremely low (ranging from 0.1%-0.2%, Week43-Week47, 2020), limiting significant flu spread. However, the rising trend in outpatient ILI visits, from 1.2% (Week43, 2020) to 1.6% (Week47, 2020), despite being under the 2.6% baseline, indicates increasing healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory illness (Week43, 2020 #4; Week47, 2020 #2).
5. COVID-19-related healthcare-seeking behaviors dominate and impact traditional ILI reporting accuracy, complicating precise influenza activity interpretation (Week43, 2020 #9; Week44, 2020 #9; Week47, 2020 #6). This overlap also potentially masks or dampens influenza-related cases while keeping the overall ILI trajectory stable but increasing.
6. Despite low influenza positivity, CDC predicts potential increases in activity in the coming months due to circulation shifts, continued flu surveillance, and vaccinations being widely recommended and available (Week46, 2020 #9; Week47, 2020 #9). This aligns with anticipating incremental growth in ILI counts rather than a sharp spike.
7. The steady rise in ILI counts, ongoing COVID-19 impacts on healthcare behavior, and CDC predictions of increasing flu activity—amid stable outpatient visits and low positivity—collectively justify forecasting future occurrences to reach 2836, reflecting a moderate rise within the typical peak season trajectory.
