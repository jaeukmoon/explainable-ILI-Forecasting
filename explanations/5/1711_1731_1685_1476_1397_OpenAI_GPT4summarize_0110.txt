1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week21 to Week25, 2024 are 1711, 1731, 1685, 1476, and 1397. The overall trend shows a gradual decline, with an initial slight increase from Week21 (1711) to Week22 (1731), followed by a consistent drop through Week25 (1397). This indicates a downward trajectory in ILI activity as the influenza season progresses into the off-season phase.
2. Week30, 2024 belongs to the off-season, considering that it falls between the typical peak season (ending around Week6) and peak onset (beginning as early as Week32). CDC reports indicate sustained low influenza positivity and minimal activity (Week21–Week25, 2024), further supporting this classification.
3. A time-series projection incorporates the steady decline observed in the data (1711 → 1397) and aligns this pattern with the off-season's generally low-level activity. Historical patterns favor stabilization or further reduction in ILI counts. Projecting forward using this trajectory, Week30 anticipates approximately 930 ILI occurrences.
4. Laboratory-confirmed influenza positivity has remained consistently low (Week21, 2024: 1.7%; Week22, 2024: 1.8%; Week23, 2024: 1.6%; Week24, 2024: 1.4%; Week25, 2024: 1.1%). These values reflect declining transmission rates and reduced risk of significant activity increases.
5. Vaccination coverage appears effective based on genetic characterization matching vaccine components to circulating strains (Week21, 2024 #10; Week22, 2024 #13; Week25, 2024 #8). Low antiviral resistance further supports efficient disease control measures.
6. Multiple respiratory viruses (RSV, SARS-CoV-2, influenza) co-circulate (Week21, 2024 #12; Week23, 2024 #9; Week25, 2024 #10), but their variable contributions and lack of a significant novel variant suggest no notable surges in ILI occurrences ahead.
7. Based on the declining ILI trend, off-season classification, effective vaccine alignment, low positivity rates, absence of concerning novel variants, and stable co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, the projected ILI count for Week30, 2024 is reasonably forecasted as 930, consistent with expected off-season activity levels.
