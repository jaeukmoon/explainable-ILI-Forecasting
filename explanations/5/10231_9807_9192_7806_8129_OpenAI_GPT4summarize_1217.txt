1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over 5 weeks revealed a consistent downward trend, starting from 10231 in Week 24, 2024, and decreasing to 8129 in Week 28, 2024, despite a slight rebound in the final week. This decline indicates a sustained reduction in ILI activity during the observed period, with the data pointing to an overall weakening of influenza-like illness trends.
2. The future ILI occurrences at 7319 (Week 33, 2024) align with the observed declining trend in the past data. The steady reduction across Weeks 24–28, coupled with no significant resurgence, correlates with the lower future occurrence, as the prior pattern suggests no immediate escalation in ILI activity.
3. Weekly outpatient respiratory illness visits remained consistently below the national baseline across all five weeks, dropping marginally from 1.6% (Week 24, 2024) to 1.4% (Week 28, 2024). The low outpatient activity aligns with the reported future decline in ILI cases.
4. Hospitalization rates remained minimal throughout the five-week period, at or near 0.1 per 100,000, emphasizing the limited impact of influenza on severe cases. This stable and low hospitalization burden supports the projection of relatively low future occurrences.
5. Minimal positivity rates for respiratory specimens in clinical labs (decreasing from 1.4% in Week 24, 2024, to 0.8% in Week 28, 2024), combined with stable mortality data (0.1% for influenza-related deaths across all weeks), reflect subdued influenza transmission and activity. This low viral prevalence is consistent with the anticipated future ILI reduction.
6. In summary, the future occurrence of 7319 ILI cases (Week 33, 2024) is a result of the downward trend observed across Weeks 24–28, 2024, marked by declining outpatient visits, low hospitalization rates, and minimal positivity for respiratory specimens, all of which suggest minimal influenza activity and contribute to the reduced future figures.
