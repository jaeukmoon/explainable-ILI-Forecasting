1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend with values ['1687', '1639', '1540', '1679', '1721']. After an initial decrease from 1687 (Week36, 2021) to 1540 (Week38, 2021), a rebound occurred, climbing to 1721 by Week40, 2021. The varying trend with an upward shift in the latter weeks signals a slow recovery in ILI activity despite overall low levels.
2. A positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences. The increase in ILI activity from Week39 to Week40, 2021 (1679 to 1721), aligns with the subsequent future rise in occurrences to 2109 after 5 weeks, indicating that elevated activity in the latest weeks serves as a precursor to the subsequent surge.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistent at 1.9% from Week38 to Week40, 2021, below the national baseline but signaling potential stabilization in respiratory activity. Other reports link the increase in outpatient respiratory illnesses to non-influenza pathogens, creating conditions associated with future ILI growth.
4. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) persisted at high levels, ranging from 21.0% (Week36, 2021) to 18.0% (Week40, 2021), consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds. A substantial portion of PIC mortality is driven by COVID-19 and linked to respiratory illness trends, reflecting elevated overall conditions conducive to future ILI occurrences.
5. COVID-19 pandemic-related behavioral and surveillance shifts, as noted in all 5-week reports, disrupted traditional ILI tracking. These shifts and overlaps in respiratory pathogen trends likely suppressed reported ILI data in the short term while compounding future activity, contributing to the observed rise to 2109 occurrences.
6. Despite low influenza circulation (e.g., 0.1% positivity in Week36 and Week40, 2021) and minimal directly attributable influenza activity, the predominant role of non-influenza respiratory pathogens, coupled with complex healthcare dynamics, is evident in driving future ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the rise to 2109 future ILI occurrences (Week45, 2021 or later) is based on the observed recovery in Weeks39–40, 2021, persistent elevated PIC deaths, healthcare-seeking disruptions during the pandemic, and heightened non-specific respiratory pathogen activity overriding low influenza virus detection.
