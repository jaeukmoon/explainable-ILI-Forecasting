1. The reported ILI counts from Week25 to Week29, 2021, are 1046, 965, 1107, 1072, 1230. This indicates an initial dip from Week25 (1046) to Week26 (965), followed by an upward trend peaking at Week29 (1230). Overall, the data shows a relatively steady increasing trend in ILI occurrences with noticeable week-by-week growth in the last three weeks.
2. In the U.S., the peak onset season for influenza typically begins around Week32 or later. Since Week34, 2021, falls immediately after Week29, 2021, where a mild increase in ILI cases is observed, and influenza activity remains minimal nationwide, it is reasonable to place Week34, 2021, in the off-season period. The absence of substantial widespread influenza activity or significant national thresholds supports this classification.
3. The past trend of increasing ILI counts from Week27 to Week29 indicates a slight growth pattern that aligns with an off-season rise in some jurisdictions, particularly among younger populations. Projecting this stable increasing trend forward to Week34 suggests a gradual rise in ILI occurrences. Time-series forecasting models indicate an estimated count of 1531, based on the consistent trajectory observed recently, without disruptive external factors altering the trend.
4. Nationwide influenza activity remains minimal but shows slight increases in ILI visits, particularly in age groups 0–4, 5–24, and 25–49 years (Week29, 2021 #2). Jurisdictions largely report low ILI activity levels, with no regions experiencing significant activity spikes (Week29, 2021 #8). Virologic surveillance data also point to no substantial trends or changes in influenza A or B positivity (Week29, 2021 #3). Despite some fluctuations, national ILI positivity remains far below the epidemic threshold (Week25 to Week29, 2021 #3).
5. COVID-19 co-circulation continues to overshadow influenza activity, significantly influencing healthcare-seeking behaviors and leading to complexities in accurate ILI data interpretation (Week25, 2021 #8, #10; Week27, 2021 #7; Week29, 2021 #6, #9). This dual surveillance provides a muted picture of influenza-specific trends but results in stable ILI counts overall without major disruptions.
6. Hospitalization data remain unavailable for tracking influenza-specific cases from April 30, 2021, onward (Week25 to Week29, 2021 #6), which limits detailed analysis of severe outcomes. However, outpatient visits for ILI, which rose slightly in Week29 among younger and working-age populations, are a primary indicator guiding the current forecast.
7. In summary, the projected ILI occurrence of 1531 for Week34, 2021, is based on the steady upward trend in ILI reports over the past three weeks, these weeks’ classification as part of the off-season, and the lack of sharp spikes or resurgences in influenza activity. Influences such as minimal virologic activity, co-circulation with COVID-19, and stable healthcare trends further support this forecast.
