1. The reported ILI counts from Week16 to Week20, 2024 are 12541, 13258, 12849, 12862, and 13038. The trend indicates a slight fluctuation with an overall decline in Week17, 2024 (13258) followed by relative stabilization through Week20, 2024. While occurrences remain elevated compared to baseline, there are no significant spikes or consistent increases, suggesting a gradual downward trend.
2. The target Week25, 2024 belongs to the off-season. Typically, the off-season spans after Week6 to about Week31, aligning with the decline in influenza positivity (Week16, 2024 #1; Week18, 2024 #1; Week20, 2024 #1) and outpatient ILI rates below the baseline for seven consecutive weeks (Week16, 2024 #3; Week20, 2024 #3). Given this, Week25, 2024 is forecasted as part of the off-season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the historical ILI data (Week16 to Week20, 2024) demonstrates stabilization despite slight oscillations. Projecting forward, the declining trajectory in reported positive rates and outpatient visits (Week16 to Week20, 2024 #1, #3) implies a further reduction in ILI occurrences. Week25, 2024 is forecasted at 9807 occurrences as part of this continuation of the established downward trend.
4. Influenza positivity rates are steadily decreasing, from 4.8% in Week16, 2024 to 2.0% in Week20, 2024 (Week16, 2024 #1; Week20, 2024 #1), driven by declining circulation of both Influenza A and B and overall flu activity.
5. Outpatient visits for ILI remain consistently below the national baseline from Week16 to Week20, 2024, further reflecting sustained low flu activity. By Week20, 2024, it dropped to 2.0%, marking the seventh consecutive week below baseline (Week16, 2024 #3; Week20, 2024 #3).
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (Week16, 2024 #10; Week20, 2024 #10), contributes to the minor fluctuations observed but does not lead to significant spikes in flu activity given their manageable levels and individual impacts.
7. In summary, the projected count of 9807 by Week25, 2024 is justified by the declining trend in ILI occurrences, confirmation of off-season classification, reduced positivity rates, sustained low outpatient ILI visits below baseline, and stable but low co-circulation of other respiratory viruses. These factors collectively align with the expected dip in ILI activity.
