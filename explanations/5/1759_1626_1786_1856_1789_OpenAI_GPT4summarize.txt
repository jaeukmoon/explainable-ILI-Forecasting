1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a slight fluctuating pattern but remained relatively stable. The values were ['1759', '1626', '1786', '1856', '1789'], starting with 1759 in Week 17, 2021, decreasing to 1626 in Week 18, 2021, and then showing a steady increase to 1856 in Week 20, 2021, before a minor decline to 1789 in Week 21, 2021. The overall trend suggests a modest oscillation, with a general stabilization around 1780+ by the later weeks.

2. The correlation between the past and the future data indicates a stable continuity in ILI activity. The relatively consistent ILI occurrences during Week 19–21, 2021, align with the future occurrence of 1794, suggesting that the observed stability in the 5-week pattern formed a basis for the reported future value.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily hovered around 1.1%–1.3% between Week 17 and Week 21, 2021, remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%. This persistence in minimal ILI activity likely contributed to the stability in the future ILI occurrences. Additionally, low influenza positivity rates (<0.1% across all 5 weeks) support the observed minimal flu-related respiratory illness impact, reinforcing the steady ILI trend.

4. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, ranging from 11.7% in Week 17 to 8.3% in Week 21, 2021. However, the majority of PIC deaths were driven by COVID-19, rather than influenza, suggesting that while ILI-related factors persisted, they did not disproportionately escalate.

5. Data collection challenges, influenced by changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, were consistently noted in CDC reports. Such disruptions may have caused underreporting or stabilized fluctuations in ILI data, aligning with the continued steadiness observed in future occurrences.

6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1794 in Week 26, 2021, reflect the stable ILI activity observed across Week 17–21, 2021, as evidenced by minimal outpatient visits for ILI (1.1%–1.3%), low influenza positivity rates (<0.1%), sustained PIC mortality driven by COVID-19 rather than flu, and the stability of reported weekly ILI occurrences. Pandemic-related surveillance challenges further supported the consistent continuation into future trends.
