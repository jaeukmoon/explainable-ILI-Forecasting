1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an inconsistent yet moderately rising trend. Initial values increased from 1196 (Week38, 2023) to 1500 (Week40, 2023), followed by a minor peak at 1508 (Week41, 2023), and then a slight decline to 1447 (Week42, 2023). This pattern signifies an overall escalation in respiratory illness activity during this period, despite minor fluctuations.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the past trend and future occurrences, with the gradual elevation in ILI activity in Weeks40–42, 2023, serving as a precursor to the higher future occurrence of 1961 after 5 weeks (Week47, 2023). The consistent growth near the latter weeks indicates a building trajectory leading to the notable surge.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed steady weekly increments from 2.0% (Week38, 2023) to 2.5% (Week42, 2023), reflecting increasing patient-reported respiratory illness activity, which closely aligns with and contributes to the amplified future occurrences.
4. While influenza positivity in clinical labs increased slightly, from 1.0% (Week38, 2023) to 1.7% (Week42, 2023), the concurrent co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, may have aggravated the overall respiratory burden, fueling higher future ILI activity.
5. Hospitalizations due to laboratory-confirmed influenza consistently rose during the period, from 880 (Week38, 2023) to 1228 (Week42, 2023). This steady increase in severe cases correlates with a broader rise in overall ILI occurrences, suggesting escalating respiratory illness severity over time.
6. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, rising from 7.2% (Week38, 2023) to 7.8% (Week42, 2023). This sustained mortality above critical levels reflects heightened illness activity and its contribution to future ILI-related healthcare metrics.
7. In summary, the future occurrence of 1961 (Week47, 2023) results from the observed increasing ILI trends, marked outpatient visit growth, rising hospitalizations, sustained PIC mortality rates, and co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens, all of which collectively demonstrated mounting illness severity during Weeks38–42, 2023.
