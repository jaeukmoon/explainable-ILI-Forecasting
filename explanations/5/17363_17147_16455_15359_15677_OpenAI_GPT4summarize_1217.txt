1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show an overall gradual decline, with values of ['17363', '17147', '16455', '15359', '15677']. After a steady drop from 17363 in Week 34, 2023, to 15359 in Week 37, 2023, there was a minor increase to 15677 in Week 38, 2023. This downward trend with a slight rebound in Week 38 suggests a primarily decreasing trajectory but signals a potential fluctuation in ILI activity.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is supported by the observation that the minor rise from Week 37 to Week 38 (15359 to 15677) acts as an early indicator of the subsequent increase to 21978 future ILI occurrences by Week 43, 2023. This correlation suggests that fluctuations in the later weeks of the past trend may align with the amplified rise in Week 43.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently increased during the 5-week period, from 1.7% in Week 34, 2023, to 2.0% in Week 38, 2023. Children aged 0-4 years consistently represented the highest ILI rates (e.g., 5.8% Week 34 to 6.8% Week 38), indicating heightened pediatric viral activity, which is a likely driver of the future increase to 21978 cases.
4. PIC deaths consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold across all five weeks, rising from 6.5% in Week 34, 2023, to 7.2% in Week 38, 2023. Although PIC deaths are primarily attributed to causes other than influenza, this persistent elevation reflects underlying respiratory illness activity that may have contributed indirectly to higher future ILI figures.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV as reported across all weeks, likely exacerbated ILI activity by contributing to non-specific symptoms captured in ILI data. For instance, the CDC highlighted that such co-circulation continues to affect ILI patterns through Week 38, 2023, creating variability in regional case numbers.
6. Despite low influenza positivity rates across the 5 weeks (0.6%-0.9%), the overall increase in ILI activity suggests the involvement of a broader range of respiratory illnesses. Shifts in healthcare-seeking behavior (e.g., prioritizing alternative care settings) further influenced reporting, indirectly contributing to a surge in recorded ILI occurrences in Week 43, 2023.
7. In summary, the reported 21978 future ILI occurrences (Week 43, 2023) can be attributed to the gradual decrease followed by a small rebound in ILI trends, consistent growth in ILI-related outpatient visits, sustained PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and pandemic-related healthcare-seeking behaviors. These factors together explain the sharp increase to 21978 occurrences.
