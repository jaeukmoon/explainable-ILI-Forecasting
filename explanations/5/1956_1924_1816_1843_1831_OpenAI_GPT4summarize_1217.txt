1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a stable but slightly decreasing trend, with values of ['1956', '1924', '1816', '1843', '1831']. There was a decline from 1956 (Week15, 2021) to 1816 (Week17, 2021), followed by a marginal increase to 1843 (Week18, 2021) and 1831 (Week19, 2021). This generally stable pattern reflects low levels of ILI activity throughout the observed period.
2. Considering the stable trend in past ILI occurrences, the uptick to 2198 future occurrences after 5 weeks suggests an external influence since the past weeks' data showed no meaningful increase. The observed minor fluctuations (Weeks18-19, 2021) may have acted as a baseline around which future increases could occur.
3. Weekly outpatient visits for ILI, consistently recorded at approximately 1.1–1.2%, remained below the national baseline of 2.6% over the period (Week15–Week19, 2021). Even though minimal, the persistent presence of outpatient visits for ILI highlights ongoing respiratory illnesses, potentially contributing to the reported rise in future occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed epidemic thresholds, ranging from 12.4% (Week15, 2021) to 10.1% (Week19, 2021). The prevalence of respiratory mortality may have correlated with the increased vulnerability of the population to ILI-like conditions, contributing to future occurrences.
5. The concurrent COVID-19 pandemic and its influence on healthcare-seeking behaviors disrupted ILI surveillance, altering data accuracy and trends. This disruption might have suppressed immediate case reporting and contributed to the unexpected sharp rise to 2198 future occurrences following 5 weeks.
6. Despite minimal overall influenza activity (testing positivity of 0.1% and consistently low hospitalization rates of 0.8 per 100,000), the dynamic interplay of COVID-19, altered healthcare systems, reporting delays, and co-circulating respiratory pathogens likely contributed to the future ILI increase.
7. In summary, the reported 2198 future ILI occurrences despite stable trends in Weeks15–19, 2021, can be attributed to a baseline of outpatient ILI activity, sustained PIC mortality rates surpassing epidemic thresholds, the disruptive influence of COVID-19 on surveillance and reporting, and the cumulative impacts of coexisting respiratory pathogens and delayed healthcare responses.
