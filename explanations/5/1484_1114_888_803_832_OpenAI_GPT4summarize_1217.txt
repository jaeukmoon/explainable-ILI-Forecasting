1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent downward trend initially, with values declining from 1484 (Week 4, 2022) to 803 (Week 6, 2022), followed by a slight increase to 832 in Week 8, 2022. This trend indicates an overall reduction in ILI activity, with a minor resurgence during the later weeks.
2. A clear correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, with the eventual stabilization of the decrease in Week 7 and the subsequent slight rise in Week 8 signaling a potential reversal in ILI dynamics, likely contributing to the reported future ILI occurrence of 1002 in Week 13, 2022.
3. Hospitalization rates due to influenza, noted to rise steadily in the summarized CDC reports (from 4.4 per 100,000 in Week 4, 2022, to 5.2 per 100,000 in Week 8, 2022), reflected increasing severe cases, setting the stage for higher future ILI activity. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, with co-infection rates reported at 5.7% to 6.1% in Week 4–Week 8, 2022, likely contributed to increased respiratory illness-related healthcare visits. Persistently low vaccination coverage throughout the period further impaired population-level immunity, compounding risk for elevated ILI activity.
4. Trends indicating a slow rise in Influenza A(H3N2) positivity (e.g., from 1.7% in Week 4, 2022, to 4.1% in Week 8, 2022) and antigenic differences reported in circulating H3N2 viruses from vaccine strains underscore ongoing transmission and reduced vaccine efficacy, potentially driving higher ILI cases in Week 13, 2022.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1002 (Week 13, 2022) are attributed to the initial downward trend followed by stabilization and resurgence in past ILI activity, rising hospitalization rates, increasing co-circulation of respiratory viruses, low vaccination rates, and the evolution of antigenically divergent influenza strains.
