1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating but upward trend overall, with values of ['1706', '1484', '1623', '1558', '1873']. A decline was observed from 1706 (Week 41, 2020) to 1484 (Week 42, 2020), followed by increments in subsequent weeks, reaching the highest value of 1873 in Week 45, 2020. This progression indicates a recovery and escalation in ILI activity by the end of the five-week period.

2. A positive correlation is evident between the past and future time-series ILI occurrences. The upward trajectory toward the final weeks of the observed past data, particularly Weeks 44 and 45, 2020, parallels the sharp rise to 2222 future occurrences after five weeks (Week 50, 2020). This suggests a continuity of increasing respiratory illness burden.

3. The following factors across the CDC summaries correlate strongly with the observed future rise to 2222 ILI occurrences:  
   - Outpatient visits for ILI incrementally increased from 1.2% (Weeks 41–43, 2020) to 1.5% by Week 45, 2020. This steady growth reflects higher respiratory illness activity, likely contributing to the future surge.  
   - Persistent PIC mortality surpassed the epidemic threshold throughout the reporting period, rising from 7.2% (Week 41, 2020) to 8.9% (Week 45, 2020). This suggests a worsening respiratory illness burden, aligning with the projected ILI spike.  
   - Modifications in healthcare-seeking patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as repeatedly highlighted, disrupted ILI surveillance. These disruptions may have delayed case documentation, resulting in a more pronounced future ILI rise.

4. In summary, the reported 2222 future ILI occurrences (Week 50, 2020) reflect the upward trend in ILI activity during Weeks 44 and 45, 2020, increasing outpatient ILI visits, sustained epidemic-level PIC mortality, and pandemic-driven surveillance challenges impacting ILI reporting. This convergence of factors explains the observed escalation.
