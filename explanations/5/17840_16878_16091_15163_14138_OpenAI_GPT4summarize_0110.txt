1. The reported ILI counts from Week12 to Week16, 2024 are 17840, 16878, 16091, 15163, and 14138. This trajectory reveals a consistent week-over-week decline in ILI occurrences, indicating a steady downward trend in influenza-like illness during this period. There are no signs of significant spikes or unusual fluctuations, suggesting that illness activity is on a clear decreasing path.
2. Based on historical trends and classifications, Week21, 2024 occurs after the typical peak season (Week46, 2023 through Week6, 2024) and falls into the off-season, characterized by minimal community spread and lower incidence of influenza activity. This classification is reinforced by the continuing declines in positivity and ILI-related indicators (Week16, 2024 #1, #3).
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent decline in ILI occurrences over five weeks suggests a predictable trend. Extrapolating this pattern forward, based on the average weekly reduction observed (approximately 1701 cases per week), the projection for Week21, 2024 anticipates a further substantial decrease, stabilizing at 12081 occurrences. This aligns with the seasonal off-peak trend and the absence of disruptive variables in the reports.
4. CDC data highlights several key factors influencing the forecast: (a) Decreasing influenza positivity rates over weeks (Week12, 2024 #1; Week13, 2024 #1; Week16, 2024 #1), indicating lower infection rates. (b) Regional and population-specific variability in activity and hospitalization rates, with older adults and certain racial/ethnic groups bearing the highest burden (Week14, 2024 #9; Week15, 2024 #10). (c) Deliberate vaccination efforts and well-matched vaccine strains continue to mitigate cases effectively (Week14, 2024 #7; Week15, 2024 #6; Week16, 2024 #9).
5. The declining outpatient respiratory illness visit rates below baseline (Week14, 2024 #3; Week15, 2024 #3; Week16, 2024 #3) further corroborate low ongoing ILI activity. This downward trajectory supports a sustained reduction in ILI cases leading to Week21, 2024.
6. Virus co-circulation, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2 alongside influenza, complicates the attribution of ILI trends (Week12, 2024 #8; Week14, 2024 #8; Week16, 2024 #10). However, no novel influenza or significant variant emergence is reported (Week12, 2024 #6; Week15, 2024 #8; Week16, 2024 #8), removing the likelihood of sudden spikes in cases.
7. In summary, given the consistent decline in ILI occurrences, classification of Week21, 2024 as off-season, and contributing factors like decreasing positivity rates, high vaccination impacts, and reduced outpatient visits, the prediction of 12081 ILI occurrences for Week21, 2024 is justified and aligns with current trends and historical patterns.
