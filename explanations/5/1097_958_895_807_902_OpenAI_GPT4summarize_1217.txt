1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating but overall decreasing trend, with values of ['1097', '958', '895', '807', '902']. A decline occurred from 1097 (Week13, 2023) to 807 (Week16, 2023), followed by a small uptick to 902 (Week17, 2023). This trend indicates a predominantly downward trajectory in ILI activity over the observed weeks, with a slight rebound toward the end.
2. A correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the predominantly downward trend (Weeks 13–16, 2023) followed by stabilization (Week17, 2023) corresponds to the reported future decrease to 618 occurrences by Week22, 2023. The continued downward momentum, coupled with stable values in the later weeks, likely influenced the lower future ILI occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily declined from 2.3% (Week13, 2023) to 1.9% (Week16, 2023) and remained flat at 2.0% (Week17, 2023), consistently below the national baseline of 2.5%. This decreasing pattern of healthcare encounters reflects waning respiratory illness activity and aligns with the observed lower future value.
4. PIC mortality percentages consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold but decreased from 7.9% (Week13, 2023) to 7.3% (Week17, 2023). This reduction indicates an improvement in severe respiratory illness outcomes, reducing future ILI impacts.
5. Stable low influenza positivity rates, hovering between 0.8% and 1.0% from Weeks 13–17, 2023, reflect limited influenza transmission. Coupled with decreasing ILI-associated hospitalization rates (e.g., 61.1 per 100,000 in Week13, 2023, versus 61.9 per 100,000 in Week17, 2023), these indicators further support low future ILI occurrences at 618.
6. The co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses had a minimal impact on ILI trends, as reported co-infection rates (3.8% in Week15, 2023) remained consistently low. Decreasing burden from non-influenza factors contributed to reduced ILI reporting.
7. In summary, the reported 618 future ILI occurrences (Week22, 2023) can be attributed to the decreasing trend in past ILI occurrences, declining outpatient visits for ILI, reduced PIC mortality percentages, stable and low influenza positivity rates, and minimal impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses.
