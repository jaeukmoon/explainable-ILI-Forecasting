1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited an initial increase followed by a gradual decline. Specifically, the values were ['1793', '2148', '2576', '2716', '2430'], with the peak at 2716 in Week 45, 2020, followed by a decrease to 2430 in Week 47, 2020. This trend indicates a potential plateau or slight reduction in ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period.  

2. A declining trajectory in the latter part of the past ILI time-series (Weeks 46–47, 2020), from 2716 to 2430, correlates with the future occurrence of 1175 ILI cases in Week 52, 2020. This suggests a continuing decrease in respiratory illness activity, aligning with the observed drop in ILI cases after the peak in Week 45, 2020.  

3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a steady but minimal increase, starting at 1.2% in Week 43, 2020, and reaching 1.6% by Week 47, 2020. This subtle rise remained well below the national baseline of 2.6%, reflecting low but slightly increasing healthcare-seeking behavior despite low influenza activity. This mild increase aligns with a gradual tapering-off in ILI activity.  

4. Death percentages attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, rising from 8.2% in Week 43 to 11.3% in Week 47, 2020. However, this elevation was primarily driven by COVID-19, not influenza, as confirmed by minimal influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.2% in Weeks 43, 45, and 47, 2020). The minimal contribution of influenza to the PIC percentages suggests that non-influenza respiratory illnesses contributed to the ILI activity but did not sustain significant increases.  

5. Healthcare disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic were consistently reported across Weeks 43–47, 2020. These disruptions, including alternative care settings and overlap with COVID-19 symptoms, likely impeded traditional ILI surveillance, thereby reducing the accuracy of detecting true influenza-related illnesses. This may have contributed to a continued decline in future ILI occurrences.  

6. The lower influenza circulation rate, with only 0.1-0.2% positivity across Weeks 43–47, 2020, and minimal public health lab detections (e.g., 6 positive specimens in Week 47, 2020), underscores the limited role of influenza in overall ILI counts. This aligns with the observed decline to 1175 future ILI cases in Week 52, 2020.  

7. In summary, the reported 1175 future ILI occurrences (Week 52, 2020) can be traced to the declining trend in past ILI occurrences following the peak in Week 45, 2020. This decrease is consistent with low flu positivity rates, minimal influenza activity, persistently disrupted healthcare-seeking behavior, and a stable yet low percentage of ILI-related outpatient visits. The compounded impact of these factors, alongside the primary influence of COVID-19 on PIC mortality, explains the reduced ILI cases observed after 5 weeks.
