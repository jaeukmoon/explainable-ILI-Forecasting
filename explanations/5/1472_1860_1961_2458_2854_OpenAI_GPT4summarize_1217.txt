1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 45–49, 2023) displayed an unambiguous upward trend, with values increasing sequentially from 1472 in Week 45 to 2854 in Week 49, marking a cumulative rise of 93.9%. This consistent growth indicates a sustained escalation in ILI activity throughout the observed period, with no interruptions in the increase.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is demonstrated by the continuous upward trajectory of Weeks 45–49, 2023, which aligns with the reported increase to 3059 occurrences by Week 54, 2023. The steady growth during the observed period serves as a direct precursor to the elevated ILI activity reported after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily rose, exceeding the national baseline (2.9%) in all 5 weeks and reaching 4.4% in Week 49, 2023. This growth reflects increasing respiratory illness reporting, which likely contributed to the subsequent rise in ILI occurrences.
4. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza rose weekly during Weeks 45–49, 2023, from 1.7 per 100,000 in Week 45 to 8.0 per 100,000 in Week 49, indicating heightened severity and healthcare burden. This surge in severe outcomes correlates strongly with the ultimate rise to 3059 future ILI occurrences.
5. Concurrent co-circulation of influenza and other respiratory pathogens (e.g., RSV and SARS-CoV-2) was noted in all weeks, with influenza positivity rates climbing from 4.0% in Week 45, 2023, to 10.2% in Week 49, 2023. This multifactorial increase in respiratory activity aligns with the additive effect on future ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 3059 future ILI occurrences (Week 54, 2023) can be attributed to the persistent upward trend of Weeks 45–49, 2023, increasing outpatient ILI visits consistently above baseline, rising influenza-associated hospitalizations, and co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens, all of which compounded to amplify respiratory illness activity.
