1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks illustrated a rapid declining trend, with values ['18300', '16477', '14164', '12267', '11544']. There was a consistent decrease from 18300 in Week 8, 2024, to 11544 by Week 12, 2024, indicating a significant reduction in ILI activity during this period. This pattern reflects a waning phase of the flu season.
2. The sharp decreasing trend in the past weeks correlates with the lower future ILI occurrences of 5698 in Week 17, 2024. The declining trajectory observed during Weeks 8-12, 2024, suggests a continued reduction in ILI activity over the subsequent weeks, leading to the markedly low occurrence in future data.
3. Influenza positivity rates declined steadily from Week 9 (13.9%) to Week 13 (9.1%), indicating a reducing viral load in the community, which contributed to the drop in ILI cases. Similarly, outpatient ILI visits trended down from 4.1% in Week 9 to 3.0% in Week 13, aligning with the future reduction in ILI. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like RSV and COVID-19, though persistent, likely played a diminishing role as influenza activity declined.
4. Hospitalizations due to influenza also decreased across the observed weeks, with hospitalization rates rising slightly from 64.8/100,000 in Week 9 to 74.2/100,000 by Week 13; however, weekly hospital admissions showed a consistent decline from January onwards. This suggests a reduced burden of severe cases over time, which aligns with the reduced occurrences of ILI in the future.
5. The CDC reported a consistent decrease in influenza-associated mortality (e.g., deaths attributed to influenza dropped from 0.7% in Week 9 to 0.5% in Week 13). This declining fatality rate reflects the broader reduction in flu activity and severe respiratory illness, reinforcing the expectation of lower ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
6. In summary, the reduction in future ILI occurrences to 5698 in Week 17, 2024, is consistent with the steeply declining past ILI trend from Week 8-12, 2024, falling influenza positivity rates, decreasing outpatient visits and hospitalizations, and a reduction in associated mortality. These factors collectively reflect a waning flu season and reduced respiratory illness burden leading to the observed drop in cases.
