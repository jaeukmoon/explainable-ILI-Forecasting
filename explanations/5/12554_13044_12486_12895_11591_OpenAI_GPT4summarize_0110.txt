1. The past ILI occurrences from Week3, 2024 to Week7, 2024 (12554, 13044, 12486, 12895, 11591) show a fluctuating trend with no consistent upward or downward trajectory. A moderate rise is seen from Week3 (12554) to Week4 (13044), followed by a slight decline in Week5 (12486), another rise in Week6 (12895), and a sharp drop to Week7 (11591). This variability reflects unstable transitions toward decreased activity in recent weeks.
2. Forecasting target week (Week12, 2024) belongs to the off-season, as it follows the peak season that generally spans until Week6 in the U.S. The decreasing overall ILI trends in positivity and hospitalization, combined with this temporal pattern, suggest that influenza activity will align with the off-season by Week12, 2024.
3. Correlation analysis indicates a downward swing in the most recent weeks (Week6, 2024: 12895 to Week7, 2024: 11591), consistent with diminishing flu activity early in the off-season. Based on historical patterns, this decline aligns with projections for reduced ILI occurrences five weeks forward. Considering this, the future projection of 9168 for Week12, 2024 reflects continued seasonal decline.
4. Influenza A continues as the predominant virus, accounting for 60.7% to 78.9% of influenza cases across recent weeks and showing a gradual decrease in positivity rates (Week3, 2024 #2; Week6, 2024 #3; Week7, 2024 #3). Influenza B activity has slightly increased regionally, but its contribution remains secondary, which lowers the potential for future surges (Week5, 2024 #9; Week6, 2024 #10; Week7, 2024 #8).
5. Vaccination continues to be advised universally, and circulating influenza strains match well to the vaccine, which helps reduce severe cases and overall transmissibility (Week3, 2024 #9; Week4, 2024 #7; Week7, 2024 #7). With vaccination efforts ongoing, this contributes to declining ILI activity despite some regional variations.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (COVID-19, RSV) persists but has not substantially amplified ILI occurrences beyond local trends (Week4, 2024 #8; Week5, 2024 #10; Week7, 2024 #9). Limited reports of novel viruses or resistance to antivirals during the past five weeks further support a steady decline in transmission (Week3, 2024 #10; Week6, 2024 #8).
7. In summary, the downward trend in recent ILI activity, alignment with the off-season for Week12, effective vaccination coverage, and stable resistance patterns collectively support the projected ILI occurrence of 9168. This value aligns with expected reductions as influenza transitions into low seasonal activity.
