1. The reported ILI counts from Week43 to Week47, 2020 are 1793, 2148, 2576, 2716, and 2430. This shows a general upward trend from Week43 (1793) to Week46 (2716), peaking in Week46. However, a slight decline is observed in Week47 (2430). The overall trajectory reflects a steady increase followed by a marginal dip, indicative of fluctuating but mostly stable activity.
2. Week52, 2020, which is 5 weeks after Week47, falls within the typical U.S. peak season (Week46 to Week6). Given the observed ILI patterns and CDC reports indicating potential increases in activity (Week46, 2020 #9; Week47, 2020 #10), it aligns with the peak season classification.
3. The time-series pattern suggests that ILI occurrences may decrease slightly in the short term, as seen from Week46 (2716) to Week47 (2430). Based on the earlier steady rise and CDC's anticipation of potential increases in flu activity (Week46, 2020 #9; Week47, 2020 #10), projecting forward to Week52, 2020 suggests moderate activity around 1175, reflecting a seasonal trough.
4. Flu activity remains unusually low for this time of year, with <1% positivity rates and minimal Influenza A/B detections (Week43, 2020 #1, #3; Week46, 2020 #1, #2; Week47, 2020 #1).
5. COVID-19's continued dominance in PIC deaths (Week43, 2020 #6; Week46, 2020 #4; Week47, 2020 #4) and its impact on behavior have complicated ILI trends, likely contributing to lower traditional flu dynamics and healthcare-seeking patterns (Week43, 2020 #9; Week44, 2020 #9; Week47, 2020 #6).
6. Vaccination campaigns are emphasized (Week43, 2020 #8; Week46, 2020 #7; Week47, 2020 #8), but no significant changes in vaccination uptake or antiviral susceptibility are reported, suggesting vaccination plays a neutral role in the immediate decrease/increase prediction.
7. In conclusion, fluctuating ILI counts with a recent dip, alignment with the peak season, unusually low flu activity influenced by COVID-19, and stable vaccination trends justify projecting future ILI occurrences at 1175.
