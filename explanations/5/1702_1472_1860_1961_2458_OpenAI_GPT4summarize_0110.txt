1. The reported ILI counts for Weeks 44 to 48, 2023 are 1702, 1472, 1860, 1961, and 2458. The trend indicates a consistent increase, particularly from Week45 (1472) to Week48 (2458), with a notable sharp rise in Week48. This progression suggests an ongoing escalation in ILI activity, reflective of seasonal virus spread during the peak season.
2. Week1, 2024 is within the typical U.S. peak season for influenza activity, which generally spans Week46 of one year through Week6 of the next year. Given the rising ILI occurrences and CDC reports indicating heightened positivity and severe cases during the preceding weeks, Week1, 2024 belongs to the peak season.
3. Time-series data shows an upward trajectory in ILI occurrences from Week44, 2023 to Week48, 2023. Based on this historical trend, projecting forward suggests continued growth during the subsequent five weeks. By Week1, 2024, ILI activity is expected to peak at 3911 occurrences, consistent with the elevated ongoing trend and seasonal intensity.
4. First, an increase in positive influenza specimens has been observed nationwide, rising from 3.0% in Week44, 2023 to 6.8% in Week48, 2023 (Week44, 2023 #1; Week48, 2023 #1). This reflects active viral circulation and suggests continued rise in ILI activity. Second, rising hospitalization rates (1.2 per 100,000 in Week44 to 5.5 per 100,000 in Week48) and severity among older adults (Week44, 2023 #10; Week48, 2023 #4), indicate intensified disease burden, coinciding with rising ILI rates. Third, co-circulation of respiratory viruses like RSV and COVID-19, alongside influenza, is compounding ILI activity (Week44, 2023 #10; Week48, 2023 #9). These overlapping viruses likely increase outpatient and hospitalization figures, further contributing to the rise in ILI activity.
5. Vaccination trends indicate stable availability, but no significant surge in coverage has been noted. Current vaccines are well-matched to circulating strains, offering protective benefits, though flu activity continues to grow (Week45, 2023 #6, Week48, 2023 #8).
6. Regional variation in increased Influenza B proportions, particularly in regions 4 and 6, alongside Influenza A(H1N1) dominance, suggests expanding spread catered by diverse influenza strains (Week44, 2023 #1; Week48, 2023 #10). This contributes to the nationwide upward trend.
7. Given the sharp rise in ILI occurrences, the U.S. peak influenza season, ongoing escalations in severity indicators, and co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, Week1, 2024 is projected to see elevated ILI activity, aligning with the forecast of 3911 cases. This reflects the combined effects of historic growth trends, peak seasonal timing, and heightened viral prevalence contributing to the prediction.
