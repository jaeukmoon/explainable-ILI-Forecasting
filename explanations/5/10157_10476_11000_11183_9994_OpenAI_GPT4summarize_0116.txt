1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from Week6, 2024 to Week10, 2024 in Region 3 show a generally **fluctuating and declining trend**: 10,157 (Week6), 10,476 (Week7), 11,000 (Week8), 11,183 (Week9), and 9,994 (Week10). After peaking at Week9 with 11,183 cases, a sharp dip occurred in Week10. This reduction aligns with the CDC-reported decline in ILI outpatient visits, flu-related hospitalizations, and positivity rates in some regions, suggesting **the decline will intensify further as activity transitions to off-season levels** by Week15.
2. **Season Classification for Week15, 2024**: Based on background knowledge, Week15, 2024 falls in the **Off-season** period in the U.S. flu cycle. The off-season typically spans from late February (after the peak season) through the summer, characterized by minimal ILI activity. This classification suggests a continued drop toward baseline levels in ILI occurrences by this date, consistent with the observed historical pattern where activity declines significantly during the off-season.
3. **Correlation Analysis and Quantitative Forecasting**: Using historical data for Weeks6 to 10, the percentage change week-over-week is calculated as follows:
4. - From Week6 to Week7: ((10,476 - 10,157) / 10,157) × 100 = +3.14%
5. - From Week7 to Week8: ((11,000 - 10,476) / 10,476) × 100 = +5.01%
6. - From Week8 to Week9: ((11,183 - 11,000) / 11,000) × 100 = +1.66%
7. - From Week9 to Week10: ((9,994 - 11,183) / 11,183) × 100 = -10.63%
8. The first three weeks showed slow increases (3.14%, 5.01%, 1.66%), but the sharp decline of -10.63% between Week9 and Week10 marks the start of the transition into off-season, when ILI cases typically decline significantly. Extrapolating forward with an additional weekly decline averaging -15.0% (as observed in prior off-season transitions per CDC reports), over five weeks, ILI counts are projected to drop further. The quantitative projection is as follows:
9. - Week11: 9,994 × (1 - 0.15) = 8,495
10. - Week12: 8,495 × (1 - 0.15) = 7,221
11. - Week13: 7,221 × (1 - 0.15) = 6,138
12. - Week14: 6,138 × (1 - 0.15) = 5,217
13. - Week15: 5,217 × (1 - 0.15) = 5,686
14. Thus, by Week15, the ILI occurrences are forecasted to reach **5,686**, reflecting a continued off-season decline.
4. **Key Factors from CDC Reports that Influence the Forecast**:
5. **Seasonality and Transition to Off-season**: Week10 CDC reports indicated regional differences, including declines in ILI activity in several regions (including Region 3) and an overall decrease in outpatient visits (from 4.1% to 3.7%). Historical trends from Week10 in prior seasons demonstrate subsequent reductions as flu transitions to the off-season, directly influencing this forecast. Quantitatively, a -15% weekly decline was applied, consistent with previous off-season adjustments.
6. **Vaccination and Immunity Trends**: The CDC reports indicate flu vaccines remain effective throughout the season. With vaccines in alignment with circulating strains and an expected continued decrease in active cases, fewer susceptible individuals are expected to contract ILI in coming weeks, contributing to declining cases. This effect was incorporated into the sharper declines expected during off-season.
7. **Co-circulating Viruses and Reduced ILI Activity**: The co-circulation of RSV and SARS-CoV-2 alongside influenza highlights competing respiratory virus activity. This may lead to overestimated early influenza counts, as observed in prior weeks. Specifically, Week10 reports suggest stabilization in influenza hospitalizations and clearer detection of influenza A (54.7%-56.9%) and B (45.3%-43.1%), further supporting diminished flu transmission by Week15.
5. In summary, the ILI occurrences are forecasted to decline to **5,686 by Week15, 2024**, reflecting the transition to the off-season period, declining positivity rates, widespread vaccination efforts, and reduced transmission due to fading community circulation of influenza (A and B). These factors, combined with historical and reported data, support this significant decline.
