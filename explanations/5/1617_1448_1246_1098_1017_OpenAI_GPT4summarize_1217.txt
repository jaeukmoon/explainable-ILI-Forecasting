1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values of ['1617', '1448', '1246', '1098', '1017']. This consistent downward trend reflects diminishing ILI activity, with Week20, 2023 reporting the highest value (1617) and Week24, 2023 the lowest (1017). The steady decrease indicates a seasonal decline in influenza activity as the weeks progress.
2. There is a clear positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences. The gradual decrease in ILI values over the 5-week period precedes the lower future occurrence of 662 (Week29, 2023). The sustained decline in the past weeks forms a predictive pattern of further reduction in future ILI occurrences.
3. Hospitalization rates decreased consistently over the weeks, with 939 in Week20, 2023 dropping to 779 in Week24, 2023. This declining trend reflects reduced severe influenza impacts, correlating with lower future ILI occurrences. Outpatient ILI visit rates progressively declined, starting at 2.0% in Week20, 2023 and reaching 1.5% by Week24, 2023. This reduction in healthcare visits for ILI aligns with the declining ILI occurrences. Declining virologic positivity rates for influenza were recorded, from 1.1% in Week20, 2023 to 1.1% in Week24, 2023, with minimal variability. This persistent low positivity supports the low future ILI occurrence of 662.
4. Death percentages attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) hovered near the epidemic threshold during Weeks20–24, 2023 (ranging from 6.1%-7.0%), showing stability or slight reductions over time. The lack of significant increases in PIC deaths suggests reduced ILI severity over subsequent weeks.
5. In summary, the reported 662 future ILI occurrences (Week29, 2023) are a result of the consistent downward ILI trend in past weeks, supported by decreasing hospitalization rates, outpatient visit rates, low virologic positivity, and plateauing PIC mortality rates. These interconnected factors substantiate the low influenza-like activity projected in the future.
