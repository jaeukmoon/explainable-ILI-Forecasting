1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a gradual decline, with values of ['1975', '2118', '1805', '1714', '1706']. After peaking at 2118 in Week2, 2021, a downward trend persisted across the subsequent weeks, reaching the lowest value at 1706 in Week6, 2021. This decline indicates reduced respiratory illness activity in the observed period.
2. The five-week decreasing trend in the past ILI data correlates with the future ILI occurrences, which remained low at 2021. The lack of significant fluctuation and the stabilization of ILI activity after Week6, 2021, align with the subdued level of future occurrences, suggesting continuity of this low activity.
3. Reports consistently highlighted unusually low influenza activity, with respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza staying around 0.1% (Week2 to Week6, 2021). This minimal detection indicates a suppressed flu season, correlating with the muted future ILI occurrences.
4. Cumulative hospitalization rates for laboratory-confirmed influenza were reported as historically low, at 0.5 per 100,000 (Week2–Week4, 2021) and slightly increasing to 0.6 (Week5 and Week6, 2021). These figures are some of the lowest in recent years, reflecting reduced severe ILI cases and contributing to the subdued future trend.
5. Persistent disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including altered healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance challenges, were noted across all weeks. Limited reporting and changes in behavior likely masked traditional influenza trends and constrained the escalation of ILI activity into the future.
6. Data consistently showed that deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained driven predominantly by COVID-19, with PIC mortality tracking above epidemic thresholds (e.g., 14.7% in Week2, 28.4% in Week4, and 22.3% in Week6, 2021). The absence of significant influenza contribution to PIC mortality supports the reduced ILI emergence.
7. In summary, the reported 2021 future ILI occurrences (Week11, 2021) result from the declining trend in past data, exceptionally low influenza detection rates, minimal hospitalization trends, and suppressed traditional respiratory illness activity caused by the dominance of COVID-19 and its profound impact on healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance accuracy.
