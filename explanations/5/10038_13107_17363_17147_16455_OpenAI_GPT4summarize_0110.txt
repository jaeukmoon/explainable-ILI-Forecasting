1. The reported ILI counts from Week32 to Week36, 2023 are 10038, 13107, 17363, 17147, and 16455. These values represent a clear upward trend from Week32 (10038) to a peak in Week33 (17363), followed by a slight decline in Week34 (17147) and Week35 (16455). Though the ILI occurrences decreased modestly in Week35, the overall pattern can be described as an initial significant rise and stabilization at elevated levels, suggesting a transition to heightened influenza activity.
2. Based on U.S. influenza seasonality, Week41, 2023 falls within the Peak onset season (Week35–Week46, 2023). During this period between the off-season and peak season, ILI occurrences generally increase as flu activity intensifies and spreads. This aligns with the upward trend observed in the past five weeks and supports the classification of this week as part of the Peak onset season.
3. The time-series forecasting model likely projected future occurrences based on the observed trend of rising ILI activity, particularly the sharp increase from Week32 to Week33. The stabilization at elevated levels in Week34 and Week35 indicates a sustained increase in transmission, projecting forward to Week41, 2023 with expected occurrences of 18374. Historical trends and projections during the Peak onset season further validate an elevated and increasing level of activity.
4. Influenza activity remained low but showed a gradual increase in outpatient ILI visits, rising from 1.3% in Week32 to 2.0% by Week36, with notable spikes in children aged 0-4 years (Week32 #5; Week33 #4; Week34 #5; Week35 #3; Week36 #4). This increase aligns with heightened transmission and is a key driver of future ILI occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, continues to impact ILI visits (Week33 #10; Week34 #9; Week36 #9). These viruses contribute to the overall burden of ILI, influencing wider fluctuations in the data and creating potential surges in subsequent weeks.
6. Flu activity expectation remains low according to CDC reports but anticipates potential increases in localized settings during the Peak onset season (Week33 #10; Week34 #10; Week36 #10). This situational variability emphasizes the potential for more widespread transmission and growing ILI rates by Week41, 2023.
7. Considering the upward trend in ILI counts, the classification of Week41, 2023 as part of the Peak onset season, the correlation of past trends with anticipated transmission within this timeframe, increasing outpatient ILI visits among vulnerable age groups, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and CDC's projected flu activity expectations, the forecast of 18374 ILI occurrences accurately reflects the transitioning influenza activity toward the peak season.
