1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show a general decline followed by stabilization, with values of ['12979', '11487', '11116', '11730', '11738']. The ILI cases decreased from 12979 (Week37, 2021) to 11116 (Week39, 2021) before slightly increasing and stabilizing at 11738 (Week41, 2021). This pattern suggests a period of low but steady respiratory illness activity by the end of the observed timeframe.
2. A positive correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences, with stabilization in the latter weeks (Week40–Week41, 2021) acting as a potential precursor to the surge in future ILI occurrences (16729, five weeks later). The lack of a rapid decline and signs of leveling off in the past weeks suggest preparatory conditions for the subsequent increase.
3. Outpatient ILI visits remained consistently low across Week37–Week41, 2021, with percentages ranging from 2.1% (Week37, 2021) to 1.8% (Week41, 2021), all below national baselines. However, the identification of non-influenza respiratory pathogens during these weeks likely contributed to a latent buildup of respiratory illnesses, aligning with the future surge in ILI occurrences.
4. The percentage of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained significantly above epidemic thresholds across all 5 weeks (e.g., 21.1% in Week37, 2021, to 17.5% in Week41, 2021). The consistently high PIC mortality rates indicate persistent underlying respiratory illness activity, which likely influenced the later increase in ILI cases.
5. The summarized reports highlighted the overlapping presence of multiple respiratory pathogens alongside low influenza activity. This dynamic, coupled with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, further complicated surveillance efforts and data interpretation, likely masking early indicators of future ILI surges.
6. Healthcare-seeking behavior shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as repeatedly emphasized, disrupted traditional ILI surveillance systems. Such disruptions could have delayed the recognition of respiratory illness trends, resulting in a sharp rebound in future ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the increase to 16729 future ILI cases (Week46, 2021) is attributed to the stabilization of ILI activity during Week40–Week41, 2021, latent respiratory illness trends driven by non-influenza pathogens, persistently high PIC mortality rates, and compounded surveillance challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
