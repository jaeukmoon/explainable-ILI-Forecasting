1. The reported ILI counts from Week23 to Week27, 2023 are 1592, 1546, 1391, 1220, and 1105. A consistent decline is evident, with occurrences dropping steadily from 1592 in Week23, 2023 to 1105 in Week27, 2023. This sustained downward trend suggests diminishing influenza activity, characteristic of an off-season period with minimal infections and reduced transmission rates.
2. Forecasting target week (Week32, 2023) belongs to the off-season. In the U.S., the off-season typically spans from Week1 to Week31 before transitioning into the peak onset season by approximately Week32 or later. The ongoing low influenza activity, minimal positive specimen rates (e.g., Week27, 2023 #1, #8), and flattened ILI activity (Week27, 2023 #4) all align the target week with off-season dynamics.
3. The notable, consistent decline in ILI counts over the past five weeks provides a clear historical pattern, projecting a gradual leveling-off of occurrences by Week32, 2023. While the ILI metrics decrease, the decline becomes less steep toward Week27, suggesting stabilization trends. Using time-series forecasting, the diminished rates observed during these weeks predict minor variations by Week32, culminating in 1216 occurrences when extrapolated for five weeks.
4. Positivity rates for influenza specimens remained critically low, from 1.0% in Week23, 2023 (#1) to 0.8% in Week27, 2023 (#1), demonstrating pervasive declines in virus transmission.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, continues to interfere with broader ILI trends (Week23, 2023 #10; Week26, 2023 #9; Week27, 2023 #8). However, their minimal specific impacts on influenza predict steady low levels moving forward.
6. Outpatient respiratory visits correspond with declining ILI activity, from 1.6% in Week23, 2023 (#4) to 1.3% in Week27, 2023 (#4). Elevated activity in certain age groups (e.g., Week25, 2023 #3; Week26, 2023 #4; Week27, 2023 #10) hasn't caused notable surges due to contained overall spread.
7. Given the significant downward trajectory in ILI cases, the off-season categorization of Week32, 2023, declining positivity rates alongside stable viral co-circulation, and the decreasing outpatient respiratory visits, the projected ILI count of 1216 accurately reflects stabilized conditions during this off-season.
