1. The past ILI occurrences from Week34 to Week38, 2021, show a consistent decline: 20189, 17987, 16276, 12979, and 11487. This trend reflects a steady decrease without any significant fluctuations or spikes over the five weeks. The declining trajectory suggests diminishing ILI activity during this period.
2. Week43, 2021, belongs to the Peak onset season. Based on historical timing for the U.S. influenza seasons, Week43 typically occurs within the Peak onset season (Week32 to Week46). Current data from Week34 to Week38, 2021, reflects low influenza circulation, consistent with a gradual rise or low-level plateau that typically heralds the buildup toward the peak season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent decline in ILI cases across Week34 to Week38, 2021, indicates the absence of any sudden resurgence or abrupt changes in activity. However, considering the seasonal timing (approaching Peak onset), a modeled projection suggests that the ongoing decline would stabilize and set a baseline near Week38 levels before potential increases begin. Thus, the forecast anticipates a slower declining trend leveling to 11880 occurrences by Week43, 2021.
4. The dominant contributing factors include: (1) Minimal influenza activity, with ILI below the national baseline and low influenza positivity rates (Week34, 2021 #1; Week38, 2021 #1–#2), reducing the likelihood of an abrupt spike. (2) Healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to COVID-19 and concurrent co-circulation of non-influenza viruses (Week34, 2021 #8; Week36, 2021 #2; Week37, 2021 #5; Week38, 2021 #8), which influence overall ILI occurrences disproportionately. (3) Seasonality alignment with low influenza positivity; despite being in the Peak onset season, there are no indications of a significant influenza resurgence in the CDC-reported data (Week34, 2021 #4; Week36, 2021 #10; Week38, 2021 #9).
5. Limited influenza virus circulation is evident nationwide, with respiratory specimen positivity rates consistently at 0.1% (Week34, 2021 #1; Week36, 2021 #3; Week37, 2021 #6). This signifies an environment where influenza is not driving ILI activity, keeping projected occurrences low.
6. Concurrent COVID-19 impact remains a key consideration, with high percentages of PIC deaths driven by COVID-19 versus influenza (Week36, 2021 #6; Week37, 2021 #3; Week38, 2021 #3). This indicates continued dominance of COVID-19 and related respiratory viruses in influencing ILI trends at this stage.
7. Vaccination trends were not highlighted in the reports. However, low influenza circulation and low baseline activity suggest vaccines are not yet critical contributors in modifying ILI trends (Week34, 2021 #7; Week36, 2021 #8; Week38, 2021 #6). Summary: The predicted occurrence of 11880 for Week43, 2021, arises from observing the steady decline in ILI cases over past weeks, alignment with the Peak onset season, minimal influenza positivity, continued COVID-19 dominance, limited vaccination influence, and the time-series pattern stabilizing at a lower baseline.
