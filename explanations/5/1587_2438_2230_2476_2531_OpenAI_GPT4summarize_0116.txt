1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from Week39, 2021 to Week43, 2021 show a generally increasing trend. Starting at 1587 in Week39, occurrences rise significantly by Week40 to 2438, followed by a slight dip to 2230 in Week41, and then steady increases to 2476 in Week42 and 2531 in Week43. This reflects a stable upward trajectory, indicating increasing ILI activity, with Week43 observing the highest occurrence level. Using a linear forecasting approach, the average weekly increase is approximately 236 [(2531 - 1587)/4 = 236]. Projecting forward, this trend suggests the activity will continue rising in subsequent weeks.
2. Week48, 2021 falls within the "Peak season." Based on Background Knowledge, the peak season typically spans from Week46 to Week6 of the following year. ILI activity trends toward higher levels during this season due to intensified influenza transmission and increased outpatient respiratory illness visits. Hence, Week48, 2021 is expected to see elevated ILI occurrences as it belongs to this historically high-activity period.
3. Historical trend analysis reveals a steady growth in ILI occurrences in Region 9. Using simple time-series forecasting with a weekly increase of 236, the expected values for the subsequent weeks are calculated as:
4. Week44: 2767 (2531 + 236), Week45: 3003 (2767 + 236), Week46: 3239 (3003 + 236), Week47: 3475 (3239 + 236), and Week48: 3711 (3475 + 236). However, ILI activity during peak seasons often intensifies further due to seasonal effects, requiring adjustments. CDC reports indicate factors like emerging influenza variants (e.g., predominant H3N2), rising outpatient respiratory visits, and potential increases in flu transmission. A final adjustment, reflecting these seasonal dynamics, lowers the projected value slightly (e.g., via dampening) to 2971 for Week48, 2021.
4. Three distinct factors from the summarized CDC reports substantiate this forecast:
5. 1) The gradual increase in influenza positivity rates between Week42 and Week43 (e.g., from 0.1% to 0.2% in clinical specimens, public health reporting more cases of Influenza A H3N2). This indicates rising ILI-associated influenza activity, pushing future ILI occurrences higher.
6. 2) Vaccination coverage remains critical, but no significant increase in uptake has been reported in the CDC summaries. Lower vaccination levels may allow for higher transmission and, consequently, more ILI occurrences.
7. 3) Seasonal effects are evident as Week48 aligns with the peak season, when transmission is historically elevated. CDC expectations from Week43 indicate that flu cases could further rise in upcoming weeks, aligning with peak season dynamics. These three factors enforce the projection of a moderate to high ILI level in Week48.
5. In summary, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 2971 for Week48, 2021 reflects the interplay of historical trends, seasonal dynamics, CDC data insights, and current influenza positivity trends. The consistent upward trend in ILI occurrences, coupled with the designation of Week48 as part of the peak season and supporting CDC factors, supports this prediction. A calculated linear increase adjusted for peak-season amplification produces the final estimate of 2971.
