1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show a fluctuating pattern with an initial rise from 1598 (Week 19, 2021) to 1645 (Week 20, 2021), a sharp decline to 1383 in Week 21, 2021, and a subsequent rebound to 1504 in Week 22, 2021, followed by a further increase to 1576 in Week 23, 2021. This pattern of fluctuation, alongside the rise in Weeks 22 and 23, suggests a potential resurgence in ILI activity despite generally low influenza transmission.

2. A correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The rise in Weeks 22 and 23, 2021, aligns with the eventual increase to 1659 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 28, 2021). This consistency indicates that the observed rebound in ILI activity during the latter weeks of the 5-week period likely contributed to the increase in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.

3. Minimal and stable outpatient visits for ILI, consistently below the national baseline of 2.6% across all 5 weeks (1.2%–1.3%), highlight low influenza activity but do not exclude contributions from other respiratory illnesses, particularly in light of emerging healthcare-seeking behavior shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic.

4. Persistent PIC (pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19) mortality rates above epidemic thresholds (e.g., 10.1% in Week 19, 2021, declining to 7.6% in Week 23, 2021) indicate ongoing respiratory illness burden. While largely driven by COVID-19, these elevated PIC rates point to sustained respiratory-related health issues, which could align with increasing ILI occurrences.

5. The CDC consistently emphasizes disrupted healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI surveillance challenges due to the overlapping impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This disruption may reflect under- or over-reporting of ILI activity, complicating trend predictions and contributing to the rebound in ILI occurrences observed in the future.

6. In summary, the observed 1659 future ILI occurrences (Week 28, 2021) can be attributed to the fluctuating but rising trend toward the latter weeks (Weeks 22–23, 2021), low but stable outpatient ILI rates, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and the compounded effects of pandemic disruptions on ILI surveillance and healthcare behaviors, which likely influenced reporting patterns and future case recognition.
