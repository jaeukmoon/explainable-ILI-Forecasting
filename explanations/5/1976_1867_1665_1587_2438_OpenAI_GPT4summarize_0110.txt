1. The reported ILI counts from Week36 to Week40, 2021 are 1976, 1867, 1665, 1587, and 2438. Initially, the trend showed a steady decline from Week36 to Week39. However, Week40 experienced a sudden and significant spike to 2438, driven likely by increased outpatient respiratory illnesses attributed to non-influenza pathogens (Week40, 2021 #10). This mixed behavior suggests potential fluctuations or emerging activity in the following weeks but no clear evidence of a sustained increase.
2. Week45, 2021 belongs to the peak onset season. As per U.S. influenza seasonality, the peak onset phase generally spans Week35 to Week46, and Week45 aligns directly within this window. Additionally, while influenza virus circulation remains limited, mounting outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses (Week40, 2021 #10) and vaccination efforts nearing their target timeline of late October (Week40, 2021 #8) suggest an environment where ILI appears to transition from off-season lows.
3. From the time-series perspective, the sharp rise in Week40 (2438) breaks the preceding stabilizing trend observed in Week36 to Week39. Projecting this forward, the volatile increase suggests an intermediate growth in ILI occurrences, likely influenced by ongoing respiratory illness trends and seasonal changes. Based on this progression, the model forecasts a moderate rise in ILI to 2671 for Week45, 2021, consistent with emerging activity during the peak onset season.
4. The presence of non-influenza respiratory viruses continues to drive increases in respiratory illnesses as evidenced in Week36 (#2) and Week40 (#10), where most ILI activity remains unrelated to influenza virus circulation.
5. Vaccination campaigns are emphasized to conclude by late October (Week40 #8). Vaccination coverage, though encouraged, may not yet fully mitigate ILI growth by Week45, 2021.
6. Healthcare behavioral changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to distort data interpretation and tracking of ILI trends (Week36 #9 and Week40 #9). These factors complicate real-time assessments of ILI activity and contribute to unexpected fluctuations.
7. Based on historical trends, elevated ILI occurrences influenced by non-influenza viruses, limitations in current vaccination coverage, and seasonality entering the peak onset phase, the projected ILI count of 2671 aligns with the moderate increase expected during Week45, 2021.
