1. The reported ILI counts from Week51, 2020 to Week2, 2021 are 1994, 2028, 2169, 2367, and 1975. The trend initially showed a steady increase from Week51, 2020 (1994) to Week1, 2021 (2367), followed by a significant dip in Week2, 2021 (1975). This overall pattern indicates moderate fluctuation—a rising trend that peaked in Week1, 2021, followed by a sharp decline in Week2, 2021.
2. The target week, Week7, 2021, is within the typical peak season range (spanning Week46, 2020 to Week6, 2021). However, given the low ILI counts in Week2, 2021 and the CDC reports indicating suppressed influenza transmission, Week7, 2021 aligns with the off-season, characterized by reduced ILI activity after the typical peak.
3. From a time-series perspective, the observed peak in Week1, 2021 aligns with the seasonal trend, and the subsequent decline in Week2, 2021 suggests the waning of ILI activity. Projecting this pattern forward, the dip in ILI counts reflects stabilization at lower levels, leading to a forecast of 1503 occurrences in Week7, 2021, consistent with off-season expectations.
4. According to CDC surveillance, influenza activity remains at historic lows in clinical and public health labs, with positive rates of ≤0.4% across Weeks51, 2020 to Week2, 2021. Despite increased testing, influenza cases remain below seasonal expectations throughout (Week51, 2020 #9; Week53, 2020 #11; Week2, 2021 #13), indicating minimal transmission and a reduced likelihood of significant surges.
5. Widespread vaccination encouragement (Week51, 2020 #7; Week1, 2021 #8; Week2, 2021 #8) has likely mitigated more severe transmission despite limited data on uptake. A well-matched vaccine with the predominant strain A(H1N1)pdm09 (Week53, 2020 #3) has further contributed to subdued ILI activity.
6. ILI trends remain influenced by healthcare-seeking behavior changes and COVID-19, which limit traditional surveillance accuracy (Week51, 2020 #8; Week53, 2020 #9; Week2, 2021 #9). COVID-19 accounted for the majority of PIC deaths, shaping the season's ILI data trends and reflecting suppressed influenza transmission (Week51, 2020 #4; Week53, 2020 #10; Week2, 2021 #14).
7. The projected ILI occurrence of 1503 for Week7, 2021 is justified by the declining trend in ILI counts, the classification of Week7, 2021 as off-season, the minimal influenza circulation reported by CDC, widespread vaccination efforts, and the combined impact of pandemic conditions. Together, these factors account for the continued suppression of ILI activity.
