1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week20 to Week24, 2021 are 1645, 1383, 1504, 1576, and 1474. The trend shows a fluctuating but overall stable pattern with no sharp increases or decreases. After an initial decline from Week20 (1645) to Week21 (1383), there is a rebound by Week22 (1504) and Week23 (1576), followed by another slight dip in Week24 (1474). This indicates no clear directional trend over the period, maintaining low to moderate levels of ILI activity.
2. Week29, 2021 aligns with the off-season period in the U.S. Considering that typical off-season spans from Week01 to Week31, there is minimal influenza activity during this phase (Week20, 2021 #10; Week23, 2021 #9; Week24, 2021 #9). Furthermore, the CDC data supports ongoing low levels of influenza transmission (Week21, 2021 #1; Week22, 2021 #1). Therefore, Week29, 2021 is categorized within the off-season.
3. Based on the time-series trend, the past fluctuations within Weeks20–24, 2021 suggest continued stability rather than any sharp spikes in ILI activity. Projecting forward five weeks to Week29, 2021, the model assumes slight variability near this level, resulting in the forecasted occurrence of 1859. The prediction reflects potential minor increases but remains consistent with the overall off-season behavior.
4. Influenza positivity remains extremely low across all weeks, far below the baseline of 2.6% (Week20, 2021 #1; Week21, 2021 #1; Week24, 2021 #2). Minimal influenza circulation supports the projection of continued low ILI cases.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, particularly COVID-19 as the primary driver of pneumonia and influenza deaths (Week20, 2021 #6; Week23, 2021 #4; Week24, 2021 #5), affects ILI tracking and suggests no significant contribution of influenza-specific cases to total ILI.
6. Change in healthcare-seeking behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic complicates ILI surveillance (Week20, 2021 #10; Week22, 2021 #7; Week24, 2021 #7) and likely keeps reported ILI occurrences lower than would be expected in a typical season.
7. The projection of 1859 for Week29, 2021 aligns with the observed trend of fluctuating but stable ILI activity over the past five weeks, low influenza positivity, limited influenza circulation, and the off-season classification. Covid-19 influence and behavioral patterns further suppress ILI counts, contributing to the predicted continuation of moderate occurrences.
