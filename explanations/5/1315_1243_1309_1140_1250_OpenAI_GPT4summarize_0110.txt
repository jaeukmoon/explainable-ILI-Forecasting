1. The ILI counts for the past five weeks show a fluctuating trend: Week36 (1315) decreased to Week37 (1243), followed by a slight rise in Week38 (1309). A notable dip occurred in Week39 (1140), but it rebounded to Week40 (1250). This irregular pattern of mild fluctuations does not indicate significant upward or downward momentum in activity over this period.
2. From Week36 to Week40, 2021, ILI activity remained below the national baseline (2.6%). Analyzing the target Week45, 2021, it falls near the transition from Peak onset season to Peak season. However, ongoing low influenza positivity and limited regional activity suggest it is consistent with Peak onset season rather than Peak season.
3. Extrapolating the fluctuating time-series data using a forecasting model, Week40's moderate rebound (1250) suggests a slight downward adjustment approaching Week45, 2021, yielding a value of 1203 ILI cases. This is primarily due to the absence of significant surges or infection increases in prior weeks.
4. A minimal influenza circulation was noted nationally. Testing positivity rates remain at 0.1%, with limited Influenza A and B activity (Week36, 2021 #3; Week40, 2021 #1, #2).
5. Other respiratory pathogens and COVID-19 overshadow ILI dynamics. COVID-19 continues to drive deaths, with PIC rates above epidemic thresholds (Week36, 2021 #6; Week39, 2021 #4). These co-circulating factors contribute to suppressed influenza activity overall.
6. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic impede traditional ILI surveillance accuracy. This factor affects forecasting certainty and contributes to flat or slightly declining ILI trends (Week36, 2021 #9; Week38, 2021 #7; Week40, 2021 #9).
7. The projected ILI occurrences at 1203 for Week45, 2021, reflect stable trends in the Peak onset season. The minor dip corresponds to suppressed influenza activity due to low positivity rates, ongoing competition from other respiratory viruses, reduced healthcare-seeking behaviors, and national vaccination efforts stabilizing disease spread.
