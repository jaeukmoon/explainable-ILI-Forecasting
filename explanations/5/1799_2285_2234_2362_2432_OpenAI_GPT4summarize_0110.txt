1. The reported ILI occurrences for Week27 to Week31, 2024 are 1799, 2285, 2234, 2362, and 2432. The trend demonstrates a gradual and consistent increase across the weeks, without notable fluctuations, suggesting the beginning of an upward trajectory toward higher ILI activity.
2. Week36, 2024 falls within the Peak Onset Season as this period typically spans from Week32 to Week46. The growing ILI trends (Week27 to Week31, 2024 #1) align with the initial gradual rise in activity observed during this seasonal phase, before reaching the Peak Season.
3. Analyzing time series data, the observed steady upward trend suggests continuity in this pattern for the following weeks. Early indications of gradual increases indicate a potential growth rate projecting forward to Week36, 2024. This supports forecasting of 3241 occurrences, which is a proportional continuation of past increments.
4. The positivity rate of clinical respiratory specimens testing for influenza has been gradually decreasing, from 0.9% in Week27 to 0.6% in Week31 (Week27, 2024 #1; Week31, 2024 #1). However, while positivity remains low, co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and RSV) persists and continues to contribute to respiratory illness burden, potentially amplifying ILI counts (Week27, 2024 #10; Week31, 2024 #8).
5. Influenza A consistently dominates ILI cases across reports, with a minor but steady presence of Influenza B (Week27, 2024 #2; Week31, 2024 #2). This indicates stable virulence trends with limited shifts, and the dominance of Influenza A (notably the A(H3N2) strain) suggests continued potential for increased ILI activity among unprotected or vulnerable populations.
6. Despite low hospitalization rates and outpatient visits remaining below baseline (Week27, 2024 #4; Week31, 2024 #6), the co-circulation of novel strains such as Influenza A(H3N2)v (Week31, 2024 #7) and the gradual onset of Peak Onset Season suggest amplifying risks for transmission and ILI increases in subsequent weeks.
7. Considering the rising trend observed in ILI occurrences, alignment with the Peak Onset Season, consistent dominance of Influenza A, and the impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses, the projected ILI count of 3241 for Week36, 2024 is supported by both historical data and epidemiological indicators.
