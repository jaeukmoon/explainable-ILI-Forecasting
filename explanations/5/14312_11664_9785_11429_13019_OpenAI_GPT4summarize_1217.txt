1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating trend, with values of ['14312', '11664', '9785', '11429', '13019']. There was an initial decline from 14312 (Week 1, 2024) to 9785 (Week 3, 2024), reaching the lowest point. This was followed by a steady increase, culminating at 13019 in Week 5, 2024. The overall pattern reflects a resurgence of ILI activity toward the end of the 5-week period.
2. A clear positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences. The rebound seen in Weeks 4 and 5, 2024, with an increase to 13019 cases, corresponds with the reported surge to 16477 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks. This aligns with the late upward trajectory in the observed period serving as an indicator for heightened future activity.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness consistently remained above baseline, with rates of 5.7% (Week 1, 2024) to 4.4% (Week 5, 2024). Despite slight decreases, high activity in key regions during Weeks 4–5 aligns with the increase in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
4. High hospitalization rates (e.g., 51.5 per 100,000 in Week 5, 2024) driven by influenza A contributed significantly to the elevated future ILI occurrences. The ongoing circulation of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and evolving resistance patterns, alongside co-circulation with COVID-19 and RSV, further complicated the disease burden.
5. CDC reports of a potential second post-holiday peak, highlighted in Week 2, 2024, are consistent with the surge observed in future ILI occurrences, reflecting anticipated trends given favorable conditions for flu activity increases.
4. Overall, the reported 16477 future ILI occurrences can be attributed to the late upward trajectory in the past 5 weeks, persistent high outpatient visitation rates above baseline, elevated hospitalization rates due to influenza A, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and the suspected post-holiday influenza peak which exacerbated disease spread and symptom reporting among populations.
