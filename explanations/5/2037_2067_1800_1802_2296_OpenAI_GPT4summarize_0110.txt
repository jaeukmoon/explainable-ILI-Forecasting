1. The ILI counts from Week40 to Week44, 2021 are 2037, 2067, 1800, 1802, and 2296. Initially, there was a slight increase from Week40 (2037) to Week41 (2067), then a notable drop from Week41 to Week42 (1800), followed by stabilization from Week42 to Week43 (1802) and an uptick in Week44 (2296). This sequence reflects a generally low but variable trend, balanced between occasional dips and moderate rises.
2. Week49, 2021 falls within the peak season, given that the U.S. peak period typically spans Week46 through approximately Week06 of the following year. Additionally, Week44's increasing influenza positivity (0.3%, mainly Influenza A H3N2) and related trends suggest the early phase of significant flu activity acceleration, consistent with peak seasonal characteristics.
3. Projecting forward, the time-series pattern suggests increasing ILI occurrence. The recent rise from Week43 to Week44 signals the onset of a likely seasonal increase, as the peak season progresses and flu activity gains momentum. Historical patterns of steady escalation during peak periods align with the forecasted ILI count of 4004.
4. Influenza A (H3N2) cases saw sharp increases, with Week44 showing 97.3% of public health detects as Influenza A, and 100% as H3N2. Regional activity intensifications, including outbreaks in Michigan, suggest growing transmission momentum.
5. CDC mention of higher age-specific ILI visits, particularly within 0–4 and 5–24 age groups, points to increased susceptibility and spread within key populations, amplifying future ILI counts.
6. The report of low vaccination uptake beyond Week44 adds vulnerabilities, particularly as the effectiveness of vaccines is yet to take full effect. Incomplete vaccination coverage alongside ongoing H3N2 spread supports ILI count escalation.
7. Combining these factors: increasing Influenza A (H3N2) activity, age-targeted susceptibility, regional early-season outbreaks, and limited vaccination protection, alongside the rising trend from Week44 within the context of peak season, justifies the projection of 4004 ILI occurrences for Week49, 2021.
