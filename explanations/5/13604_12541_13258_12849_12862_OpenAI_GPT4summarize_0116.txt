1. The ILI occurrences from Week15, 2024 to Week19, 2024 show a generally decreasing trend with values of 13604, 12541, 13258, 12849, and 12862. Week16 saw a significant drop (8.3%) from Week15, and while Week17 rebounded by 5.7%, Weeks18 and 19 stabilized, showing marginal variation (0.10%). This suggests a deceleration in ILI activity alongside seasonal effects and external influences. A linear forecasting model combined with a seasonal adjustment for the off-season (Week24) points to a continuation of decline over five weeks.
2. Week24, 2024 belongs to the "Off-season" based on U.S. flu seasonality patterns. The off-season spans from Week9, 2024 to Week30, 2024, with reduced activity after the peak season (ending Week7, 2024). This classification aligns with historical trends and CDC statements indicating minimal flu activity during these months.
3. A correlation analysis of the time-series data reveals a 4-week moving average from Week15 to Week19 as 13022.8 [(13604 + 12541 + 13258 + 12849 + 12862) / 5]. Incorporating the observed 1.9% stabilization in Weeks18-19 and adjusting for a 4%-6% typical off-season decline, this suggests a proportional drop to approximately 10231. Additionally, historical Week20-Week24 patterns typically show 15%-20% seasonal reductions, further corroborating this decline.
4. Three CDC-reported factors supporting this trend include:
5. Reported decreasing national influenza positivity rates: Week15 (5.9%), Week16 (4.8%), Week17 (3.9%), Week18 (3.1%), and Week19 (2.4%). This downward trajectory reflects reduced transmission risk across regions like Region 9, signaling declining ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, which the CDC states continues to impact flu activity interpretation by minimizing flu dominance. Co-circulation suggests reduced overlapping ILI reports due to other respiratory pathogens.
7. Vaccination effects and stable antiviral susceptibility. High vaccination match rates mitigate further flu spread, and no significant novel influenza strain emergence throughout the period reduces the risk of sudden spikes.
5. In summary, the projected ILI occurrence of 10231 for Week24, 2024 reflects: (1) a decreasing trend in Weeks15-19 data, (2) the off-season classification aligning with reduced flu activity, (3) reported declining positivity rates, virus co-circulation effects, and vaccine/antiviral efficacy. Combining these factors through a linear time-series analysis and seasonal adjustments justifies this prediction.
