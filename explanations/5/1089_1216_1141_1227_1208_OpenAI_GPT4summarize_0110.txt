1. The reported ILI counts from Week31 to Week35, 2023 are 1089, 1216, 1141, 1227, and 1208. The trend shows mild fluctuations with an overall slight increase from Week31 to Week35. Noteworthy is the peak in Week34 (1227), followed by a minor dip in Week35 (1208). This pattern represents a generally stable but slightly increasing trend.
2. Week40, 2023 falls within the Peak onset season, as it aligns with Week35, 2023, which marks the start of a gradual rise in ILI cases. This period typically leads to increased transmission until the peak season begins (around Week46, 2023).
3. The time-series trend suggests slightly increasing ILI occurrences, consistent with seasonal expectations during Peak onset. Historical patterns predict moderate growth in activity over five weeks, influenced by the increasing outpatient respiratory illness visits and co-circulating viruses. This pattern aligns with the projected rise to 2328 ILI occurrences in Week40, 2023.
4. Outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses steadily increased, reaching 1.9% in Week35, 2023, compared to 1.1% in Week31, 2023, with children aged 0-4 showing the highest vulnerability (Week35, 2023 #3; Week31, 2023 #3).
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses other than influenza (e.g., COVID-19 and RSV) and novel cases like H1N2v are influencing healthcare-seeking patterns, indirectly elevating ILI activity despite low influenza positivity (Week33, 2023 #3, #5, #10; Week35, 2023 #9, #10).
6. The elevated percentage of deaths due to PIC, consistently surpassing the epidemic threshold across all five weeks, suggests an increased burden of respiratory illnesses, which correlates with rising ILI visits (Week31, 2023 #5; Week34, 2023 #6; Week35, 2023 #4).
7. Taking into account the slightly increasing ILI trends over the past five weeks, the seasonal timing during the Peak onset season, increased outpatient rates, and co-circulation of other respiratory illnesses, the forecast of 2328 ILI occurrences for Week40, 2023 reflects anticipated seasonal growth.
