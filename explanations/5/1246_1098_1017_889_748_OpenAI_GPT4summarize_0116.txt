1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week22, 2023 to Week26, 2023) show a clear and consistent downward trend with values of 1246, 1098, 1017, 889, and 748. Each week, ILI occurrences decrease at an approximately uniform rate. The week-over-week reduction is calculated as follows: Between Week22 and Week23, a decrease of 148 (1246 - 1098) is observed; from Week23 to Week24, the reduction is 81 (1098 - 1017); from Week24 to Week25, the drop is 128 (1017 - 889); and from Week25 to Week26, a reduction of 141 (889 - 748) is recorded. On average, the weekly decrease is about 124.5 ([148 + 81 + 128 + 141] ÷ 4). Assuming this declining trend persists, we apply this average weekly reduction forward to project the ILI occurrence for five weeks after Week26, 2023 (i.e., Week31, 2023). Starting from Week26's value of 748, the estimated value for Week31, 2023 is calculated as: 748 - (5 × 124.5) ≈ 748 - 622.5 = approximately 619.
2. Season Classification for Week31, 2023: Week31, 2023 belongs to the "Off-season." Based on Background Knowledge, the off-season typically spans from immediately after the peak season (ending at Week6 of the year) to approximately Week31. As Week31 is within this low-activity period, and given that flu activity across the U.S. remains minimal, this period is expected to exhibit minimal ILI occurrences.
3. Historical patterns further support the declining trend in ILI occurrences toward off-season levels. Based on the average weekly rate of decline in prior weeks, the projected downward trend aligns with the larger seasonal cycle wherein activity typically tapers off during off-season months. Trends indicate a consistent pattern of reduction heading into Week31, consistent with epidemiological expectations for low ILI activity in off-season.
4. Three key CDC report factors also substantiate this forecast: (1) Influenza activity has been reported as low nationally across all five weeks (1.1%, 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.0%, and 1.2% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza each week). This indicates sustained low transmission rates reflective of off-season conditions. (2) The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV continues to contribute to ILI but has not resulted in significant surges of influenza-related activity. This suggests minimal influenza-specific contributions to ILI. (3) Outpatient visits for ILI have consistently declined, with rates below baseline levels in Week26 (1.4%) and an overall decline since Week22 (1.9%). These indicators reinforce the likelihood of continued reduction in ILI activity as influenza remains minimal during the off-season.
5. The combination of a strong decreasing trend in past ILI occurrences, the seasonal classification of Week31, 2023 as off-season, and supporting evidence from CDC reports about minimal influenza activity and declining outpatient visits justify the prediction of 619 ILI occurrences. The value reflects the sustained reduction expected within the broader seasonal and epidemiological context.
