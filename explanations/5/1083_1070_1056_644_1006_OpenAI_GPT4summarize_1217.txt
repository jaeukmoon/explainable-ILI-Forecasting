1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating trend, with values ['1083', '1070', '1056', '644', '1006']. There was a significant decline from 1083 (Week 18, 2023) to 644 (Week 21, 2023), followed by a rebound to 1006 in Week 22, 2023. This pattern indicates an early decline in ILI activity, with a modest resurgence toward the end of the observed 5-week period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the rebound in Week 22, 2023 (1006) may signal elevated respiratory illness action that aligns with the reported decrease to 828 occurrences by Week 27, 2023. The gradual stabilization in Week 21-22 appears as a precursor to the reduced ILI levels 5 weeks later.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI held steady below the national baseline over Weeks 18-22 (1.9%-2.0%). Despite stability, high rates in younger age groups (e.g., 6.1% in children aged 0-4 in Week 22, 2023) strongly reflect age-specific contributions to future ILI occurrences.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, was noted consistently across Weeks 18-22, complicating ILI trends and diluting influenza-specific data. Such overlap likely influences reductions in ILI occurrences by Week 27, 2023, reflecting diminished influenza activity amid broader respiratory illnesses.
5. Deaths from pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded or approached epidemic thresholds in Weeks 18-22, 2023, peaking at 7.0% in Week 21. This persistent respiratory illness mortality highlights consistent background activity, moderating the decline to 828 ILI occurrences by Week 27, 2023.
6. In summary, the reported 828 future ILI occurrences (Week 27, 2023) are attributed to the fluctuating past trend, steady outpatient visit rates below baseline, co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens, and consistent PIC mortality. The decline observed toward Week 27 reflects diminishing seasonal influenza activity and overlapping viral contributions.
