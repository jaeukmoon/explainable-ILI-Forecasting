1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend with an overall dip towards the end. Values ranged from '1874' in Week 50, 2021, to '2536' in Week 54, 2021. After an initial increase from 1874 (Week 50, 2021) to a peak of 2919 (Week 52, 2021), there was a decline to 2533 (Week 53, 2021) and stabilization at 2536 (Week 54, 2021). This pattern suggests a strong peak midway followed by a plateauing or slight decline by the end of the period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the sharp decline from the peak of 2919 (Week 52, 2021) to 2536 (Week 54, 2021) directly aligns with the significant reduction in future occurrences to 803 by Week 9, 2022. This suggests that the declining trajectory in the later weeks of the past data was a precursor to the continued reduction observed 5 weeks later.
3. Hospitalization rates for influenza rose progressively from 1.4 per 100,000 in Week 50, 2021, to 3.9 per 100,000 by Week 2, 2022, but never reached pre-COVID levels, indicating moderate rather than severe clinical burden. Mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold but was primarily driven by COVID-19, suggesting limited direct influenza impact. Additionally, flu vaccination rates remained lower compared to previous seasons across all weeks, potentially influencing reduced case numbers in future ILI data. The genetic match of circulating A(H3N2) viruses to vaccines, while close, showed antigenic differences, contributing to inconsistent preventive outcomes but not significantly worsening ILI occurrences.
4. Co-circulation of influenza and other respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 was consistently reported, with 1.8% of flu hospitalizations involving co-infections by Week 2, 2022. As SARS-CoV-2 activity decreased toward the latter weeks, overall respiratory illness activity, including ILI, might have been reduced, explaining the eventual drop to 803 ILI cases.
5. In summary, the dramatic reduction to 803 ILI occurrences by Week 9, 2022, stems from the observed decline in past ILI trends post-Week 52, 2021, moderate hospitalization rates below historical levels, and lower flu vaccination uptake coupled with declining co-infection rates with SARS-CoV-2. This aligns with the continued regional variations and decreasing respiratory activity reflected in CDC reports.
