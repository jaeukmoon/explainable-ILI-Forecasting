1. The past ILI occurrences from Week8 to Week12, 2022 show a clear upward trend: 1401, 1559, 1593, 1729, and 1931. This demonstrates consistent week-over-week increases, indicative of rising transmission rates in the population. There is no evidence of stabilization or decline, which suggests that ILI activity is escalating.
2. Forecasting the target week Week17, 2022 belongs to the peak onset season. While the peak season in the U.S. typically falls later in the year (Week46 through Week6), the rising ILI counts combined with other driving factors such as antigenic mismatches and low vaccination rates suggest that Week17, 2022 still falls within the peak onset phase.
3. The trend of increasing ILI in the past five weeks suggests higher future occurrences due to ongoing upward momentum. Extrapolating from past data through time-series forecasting, a sustained growth trajectory aligns with a value of 2654 for Week17, 2022. The time-series model assumes that disease transmission dynamics (e.g., transmission rates, co-infections) and external influences remain consistent.
4. The dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) (Week8, 2022 #1; Week9, 2022 #2; Week12, 2022 #3) with noted antigenic differences (Week8, 2022 #8; Week10, 2022 #9; Week11, 2022 #7) could reduce vaccine efficacy and accelerate spreading. This contributes to climbing ILI activity.
5. The cumulative rise in hospitalizations for influenza, increasing for seven consecutive weeks (Week8, 2022 #4; Week10, 2022 #7; Week12, 2022 #5), reflects intensifying illness severity and higher community transmission levels, supporting the projected higher ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (Week8, 2022 #6; Week10, 2022 #12; Week12, 2022 #9), complicates influenza trends and amplifies respiratory illness burden, compounding ILI activity and driving the upward trajectory.
7. Combining past ILI trends, antigenic differences in the dominant strain reducing vaccine effectiveness, increasing hospitalizations, and the impact of viral co-circulation, the projected future occurrence of 2654 for Week17, 2022 aligns with the anticipated continuation of growth during the peak onset phase.
