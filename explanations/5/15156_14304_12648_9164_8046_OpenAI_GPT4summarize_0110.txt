1. The reported ILI counts from Week51, 2023 to Week3, 2024 are 15156, 14304, 12648, 9164, and 8046, respectively. This indicates a downward trend in ILI occurrences, with a notable sharp decline from Week51, 2023 (15156) to Week3, 2024 (8046). Although the overall trend is a decline, the rates remain above baseline, suggesting ongoing elevated activity but at a diminishing intensity.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans from Week46 to about Week6 of the following year. Since Week8, 2024 falls just outside this window, the target week aligns with the off-season. The continuing decline in activity by Week3, 2024 further supports that Week8, 2024 is part of the off-season phase.
3. Time-series analysis shows a consistent decrease in ILI cases over the last five weeks, correlating with the seasonal shift toward reducing activity after the peak season. Extrapolating this trend forward, the ILI occurrences are expected to stabilize at a lower baseline by Week8, 2024. This projection aligns with the reported value of 8977.
4. The dominant influenza virus strain is A(H1N1)pdm09, which aligns well with current vaccines (Week52, 2023 #7; Week3, 2024 #10). Effective vaccination efforts, encouraged throughout the season (Week51, 2023 #8; Week3, 2024 #9), contribute to reducing transmission rates.
5. Outpatient visits for ILI have been declining, from 6.9% in Week52, 2023 to 4.3% in Week3, 2024 (Week52, 2023 #3; Week3, 2024 #5). This drop reflects a reduction in active cases presenting for care, signaling an overall downward trajectory.
6. Although co-circulation of RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza complicates ILI patterns (Week51, 2023 #9; Week2, 2024 #10), the substantial decrease in hospitalization rates and ILI-associated deaths in Week3, 2024 (Week3, 2024 #6, #7) indicates waning influenza activity, despite residual impacts from other respiratory viruses.
7. The projected Week8, 2024 ILI occurrence of 8977 is justified by the consistent decline in ILI cases, the transition to off-season activity, well-matched vaccines for circulating strains, regional reductions in outpatient ILI visits, and diminishing hospitalizations. These factors collectively support the ongoing reduction in ILI intensity as the season progresses into its off-season phase.
