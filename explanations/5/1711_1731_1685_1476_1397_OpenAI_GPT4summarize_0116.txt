1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks (Week21, 2024 to Week25, 2024) show a decreasing trend: 1711, 1731, 1685, 1476, and 1397. After a slight increase in Week22 (1731), occurrences decline steadily over the following weeks, indicating a waning phase of influenza activity. The weekly percentage decrease from Week22 to Week25 is approximately -3.3% [(1731-1685)/1731], -12.4% [(1685-1476)/1685], and -5.4% [(1476-1397)/1476], with an average weekly decrease of approximately -7%. This decreasing trend directly informs the forecast, as it suggests further declines over the next 5 weeks if these patterns persist.
2. Week30, 2024 falls within the "Off-season" for influenza activity. According to the U.S. flu season cycle, the off-season typically spans from Week6 to approximately Week31 or Week32, characterized by minimal influenza activity near baseline levels. The 5 weeks leading up to the target week do not indicate a transition to either the peak onset season or peak season, reinforcing the projection of continued low activity during the off-season.
3. Correlation analysis of past trends and time-series forecasting supports the prediction. Using the observed average weekly decrease of approximately -7%, the trend likely continues over the next 5 weeks, decreasing from the last value of 1397. Applying this average rate over 5 weeks with compounding effects results in a value close to 930. Specifically, 1397 × (1 - 0.07)^5 ≈ 929.7, which rounds to 930. This approach assumes consistent reduction rates without significant external disruptions.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports strongly influence the prediction:
5. a. National influenza activity remains low (Week21–Week25, 2024), with a downward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza (from 1.7% in Week21 to 1.1% in Week25) and outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses (Week21: 1.9%, Week22: 1.9%, Week23: 1.7%, Week24: 1.6%, Week25: 1.5%). This suggests reduced transmission and aligns with declining ILI occurrences.
6. b. Vaccination efforts and high antigenic match between circulating viruses and vaccines (Week21–Week25, 2024) mitigate further spread. Reports confirm effective vaccine protection against the current strains, keeping influenza activity suppressed during the off-season.
7. c. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, RSV) is noted in the CDC reports, but their combined contributions to ILI remain stable or declining, with no evidence of novel influenza strain surges or significant antiviral resistance. This stability reinforces expectations of continued low ILI activity into Week30, 2024.
5. In summary, the predicted value of 930 accounts for the observed decreasing trend in past ILI occurrences, off-season classification for Week30, 2024, and supportive CDC report insights (low current influenza activity, effective vaccination coverage, and absence of disruptive factors such as a novel virus strain). These combined factors justify a projection of further decline with a value of 930 for Week30, 2024.
