1. The reported ILI counts from Week20 to Week24, 2021 are 2025, 1777, 1831, 1929, and 2198. The trend indicates a slight initial decrease from Week20 (2025) to Week21 (1777), followed by a gradual increase through Week24 (2198). This pattern reflects a mild recovery from the earlier dip, suggesting a slightly upward trend in ILI activity during this period.
2. Week29, 2021 falls during the off-season in the U.S., as it lies well outside the typical peak-onset or peak season periods. The minimal influenza activity reported in the summarized CDC data confirms this classification.
3. From the time-series forecasting perspective, the recent upward trend, particularly the steady recovery over the four weeks from Week21 (1777) to Week24 (2198), suggests that ILI occurrences will likely continue increasing moderately over the next five weeks. This gradual rise aligns with the eventual prediction of 2809 occurrences by Week29, 2021.
4. Extremely low influenza activity and positivity rates are reported nationwide (Week20, 2021 #1; Week22, 2021 #2; Week24, 2021 #2). These low levels indicate limited virus spread but do not entirely eliminate ILI occurrences, as other respiratory illnesses and healthcare-seeking behaviors can still contribute to counts.
5. Disruptions in healthcare-seeking patterns and surveillance due to the COVID-19 pandemic remain an influencing factor, complicating reliable interpretations of ILI data (Week20, 2021 #10; Week23, 2021 #8; Week24, 2021 #7). This uncertainty could result in a slight skew or underestimation of recorded ILI trends.
6. ILI outpatient visits increased slightly in children aged 0–4 years for Week24, 2021 (Week22, 2021 #5; Week24, 2021 #4), hinting at a potential gradual rise in certain demographics, contributing to overall higher forecasted counts after five weeks.
7. In summary, the forecast of 2809 ILI occurrences for Week29, 2021 is justified by the observed upward trend from Week21 to Week24, demonstrated stability within the off-season framework, and the influence of factors such as low influenza activity with persistent alternative drivers of ILI events, alongside changes in healthcare behaviors and age-group patterns.
