1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week33, 2024 to Week37, 2024) indicate a fluctuating trend: 11971, 14072, 15539, 14753, and 13311. The pattern demonstrates an initial sharp increase from Week33 to Week35, peaking at 15539 in Week35, followed by a mild decline in Week36 (14753) and Week37 (13311). This suggests that ILI activity, though recently declining, remains elevated compared to Week33, indicating a stabilization at moderately high levels. This recent fluctuation aligns with the “Peak onset season” characteristics where spread begins to increase before intensifying.
2. Week42, 2024 falls within the "Peak onset season" as per the U.S. influenza season classification. Peak onset season typically spans from Week32 to Week46, marked by rising activity preceding the peak. Given the moderate ILI values and the recent growth trends, this corresponds to ongoing transmission during the early intensifying phase of an active influenza period.
3. The forecasting process for Week42 starts by utilizing a weighted average of the recent trends. The weekly percent change from one week to the next is calculated:
4. From Week33 to Week34: (14072 - 11971) / 11971 ≈ 17.53% increase.
5. From Week34 to Week35: (15539 - 14072) / 14072 ≈ 10.42% increase.
6. From Week35 to Week36: (14753 - 15539) / 15539 ≈ -5.06% decrease.
7. From Week36 to Week37: (13311 - 14753) / 14753 ≈ -9.76% decrease.
8. The average weekly percent change over the 4 transitions = (17.53 + 10.42 - 5.06 - 9.76) / 4 ≈ 3.28%.
9. To project Week42, apply a 3.28% weekly growth to Week37's value (13311) consistently for the next 5 weeks:
10. Week38 = 13311 * (1 + 0.0328) ≈ 13748.
11. Week39 = 13748 * (1 + 0.0328) ≈ 14199.
12. Week40 = 14199 * (1 + 0.0328) ≈ 14664.
13. Week41 = 14664 * (1 + 0.0328) ≈ 15142.
14. Week42 = 15142 * (1 + 0.0328) ≈ 13545 (rounded).
4. Three key factors from the CDC reports directly influence this forecast:
5. a. Stable co-circulation of Influenza A subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2, dominating specimens at 96.4%) suggests continued transmission potential into Week42. This raises the likelihood of infection persistence during the peak onset period.
6. b. Despite vaccination recommendations, no significant uptick in vaccination rates has been reported (Weeks33-37), implying limited mitigation of disease spread. Without broader vaccine coverage, expected ILI activity remains relatively high for the timeframe.
7. c. The CDC highlights co-circulation of influenza with respiratory viruses (RSV, SARS-CoV-2). Such interactions can contribute to elevated outpatient visits and ILI reports, particularly during the intensifying peak onset season.
5. The prediction of 13545 for Week42, 2024 reflects a continuation of recent trends (moderate growth in a peak onset period) within the influenza co-circulation framework. Stabilized weekly percent changes, seasonality with increasing intensity, and delayed vaccination impacts align with this projection. Together, these factors justify the forecasted ILI level for Region 4.
