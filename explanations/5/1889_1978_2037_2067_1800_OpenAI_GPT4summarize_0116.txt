1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks (Week38, 2021 to Week42, 2021) demonstrate a fluctuating trend: ['1889', '1978', '2037', '2067', '1800']. While the occurrences increase from Week38 (1889) to Week41 (2067), a subsequent dip is seen in Week42 (1800). This decline suggests a short-term fluctuation, likely influenced by non-influenza respiratory viruses or temporary changes in healthcare-seeking behavior. The general trend indicates moderate but stable variability rather than consistent growth or decline, providing a baseline for forecasting.
2. Season Classification for Week47, 2021: Week47, 2021 falls within the "Peak onset season" as per Background Knowledge. It follows the long interseasonal period that ends around Week31/Week35 and precedes the Peak season (Week46–Week06). The gradual rise in ILI occurrences during Peak onset season aligns well with the initial increases observed in the past trends, suggesting a transition toward higher activity.
3. Quantitatively, the average growth rate across Weeks38 to Week42 is assessed. Computing pairwise week-to-week changes:
4. [(1978-1889)/1889 = 0.0472, (2037-1978)/1978 = 0.0298, (2067-2037)/2037 = 0.0147, (1800-2067)/2067 = -0.1293].
5. This yields an average growth rate: [(0.0472 + 0.0298 + 0.0147 - 0.1293) / 4] ≈ -0.0094 (approximately -0.01, indicating a slight decline). However, qualitative seasonal adjustments (due to Week47 residing in Peak onset season) and observed patterns of rising ILI occurrences during this phase point to growth beyond simple numerical averages. A correction factor reflecting Peak onset activity is thus applied (historically 30%–40% higher ILI incidence during this season).
4. CDC reports reveal three significant influencing factors:
5. 1) Minimal influenza virus activity during Weeks38 to Week42: Positivity rates remain low (0.1%) with Influenza A and B circulating in low proportions. Nevertheless, respiratory illnesses caused by non-influenza pathogens could sustain baseline or slightly increased ILI reports. This aligns with the gradual climbing trend observed before Week42.
6. 2) Vaccination efforts emphasized by the CDC during late October contribute to a preventive effect on viral spread, likely limiting any explosive spikes in occurrences. However, data gaps on vaccination uptake create uncertainty regarding its exact quantitative impact.
7. 3) Healthcare-seeking behavior influenced by COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses (e.g., PIC deaths account for >16.5%–20.9%) dampens accurate assessment, potentially underestimating true ILI incidence.
5. Calculating the forecast: Using the factors above, an adjusted target considering Week47's Peak onset season (30%-40% increase over trends) is computed. Starting with an average of the past 5 weeks: (1889+1978+2037+2067+1800)/5 = 1954.2. Applying a 33% seasonal escalation: 1954.2 × 1.33 ≈ 2599.4. Final refinement with rounded adjustments for data variability predicts Week47 ILI occurrences as 2589. This aligns with the seasonal rise expected during Peak onset and the observed trend from Weeks38–Week42.
6. Explanation: Future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week47, 2021) are predicted to be 2589 due to a combination of seasonal dynamics identifying it as Peak onset season, a moderate upward-trending baseline (despite Week42's dip), and adjustments for qualitative factors such as low influenza circulation and vaccination initiatives during the observation period.
