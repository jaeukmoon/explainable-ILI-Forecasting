1. The reported ILI counts from Week44 to Week48, 2023 are 1024, 1277, 1403, 1331, and 1703. Influenza-like illness activity showed a clear upward trend with increases from Week44 (1024) to Week45 (1277) and further to Week46 (1403). While a slight dip occurred in Week47 (1331), Week48 saw a significant rise to 1703, indicating growing influenza activity. Overall, the trend reflects a steady and significant increase, particularly in the last reported week.
2. Forecasting that Week1, 2024 belongs to the peak season is consistent with the context, given that it falls in the traditional peak window (Week46 to Week6) and is characterized by rising ILI activity and intensified influenza transmission in the preceding weeks.
3. From the time-series perspective, the continuous upward trajectory indicates strong momentum in ILI growth. Week48, 2023 witnessed the highest ILI occurrences over five weeks, suggesting increasing activity in the near term. Projecting this trend forward, the model anticipates Week1, 2024 to maintain higher ILI counts, with a forecast aligned at 2287.
4. High positivity rates were observed in Week44 (3.0%), Week45 (4.0%), Week46 (4.9%), Week47 (6.2%), and Week48 (6.8%). An increasing proportion of Influenza A remained dominant (Week44 #5; Week45 #7; Week46 #7; Week47 #6; Week48 #6), highlighting rising viral circulation, which significantly drives future ILI occurrences.
5. Hospitalization rates are rising consistently, with the cumulative rate increasing from 1.2 per 100,000 (Week44 #3) to 5.5 per 100,000 (Week48 #4). Seniors (65+ years) remain disproportionately affected, with rates surging to 13.6 per 100,000 (Week48 #4), indicating severe ongoing transmission and higher severe case counts.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, is amplifying the burden of respiratory illness. Despite no emergence of novel influenza-like viruses (Week44 #6; Week46 #9; Week48 #9), this overlap is exacerbating outpatient ILI visits and maintaining a high baseline (Week44 #8; Week45 #3; Week46 #3; Week47 #5; Week48 #3).
7. Combining the upward ILI trend, peak season alignment in Week1, 2024, elevated virologic positivity, rising hospitalizations, and the impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses, the predicted ILI count of 2287 for Week1, 2024 is strongly justified. These factors collectively indicate sustained influenza activity and intensified transmission.
