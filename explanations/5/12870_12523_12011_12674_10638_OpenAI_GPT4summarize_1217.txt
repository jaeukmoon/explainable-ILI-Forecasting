1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a noticeable downward trend, with values of ['12870', '12523', '12011', '12674', '10638']. Week 19, 2023, recorded the highest value of 12870, which subsequently decreased to 10638 by Week 23, 2023 — the lowest during the observed period. Although there was a slight resurgence in Week 22 (12674), the overall trend suggests a steady decline in ILI activity.
2. A negative correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The decline in the past 5-week trend, culminating in 10638 (Week 23, 2023), contrasts with the sharp reduction reflected in the future ILI occurrences of 7983 after 5 weeks (Week 28, 2023). This suggests the sustained decrease in ILI activity was carried forward into the subsequent weeks due to diminishing contributing factors.
3. Several report factors align with the declining ILI activity. First, the outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below the national baseline of 2.5%, decreasing from 1.9% (Week 19, 2023) to 1.6% (Week 23, 2023). Second, influenza activity remained minimal throughout, evidenced by stable influenza positivity rates of 1.0%-1.2% across clinical labs (Week 19–Week 23, 2023) and low hospitalization counts (e.g., 850 in Week 23, 2023). Third, ongoing co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, likely interfered with and suppressed the seasonal influenza trends, keeping overall ILI occurrences low or stable.
4. Concurrently, other markers, such as deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), showed stabilization or slight declines. For instance, PIC-attributed deaths fluctuated around epidemic thresholds but remained relatively constant and ranged between 6.2%-6.8% during Week 19–Week 23, 2023, without indicating significant surges in respiratory illnesses.
5. In summary, the reported 7983 future ILI occurrences (Week 28, 2023) can be attributed to the clear downward trend in Weeks 19–23, 2023, alongside consistently low outpatient visits for ILI, minimal influenza activity, stable PIC mortality rates, and ongoing co-circulation with other respiratory viruses that further tempered ILI indicators over time.
