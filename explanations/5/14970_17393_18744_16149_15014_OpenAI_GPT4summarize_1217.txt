1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating trend, starting with 14970 in Week48, 2023, peaking at 18744 in Week50, 2023, and then declining to 15014 in Week52, 2023. While inflating in the middle weeks, the data demonstrated a general decrease in the last two weeks, indicating transient increases but no sustained escalation.
2. A positive correlation can be observed between past patterns and future ILI occurrences. The high peak of 18744 in Week50, 2023, followed by a decline to 15014 in Week52, 2023, aligns with the eventual stabilization at 11591 after 5 weeks in Week2, 2024, reflecting a lagged but declining activity trajectory.
3. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 dominance, consistently accounting for the majority of subtyped viruses (78.2%–89.2% during Weeks48–52, 2023), correlates with the continued albeit reduced ILI activity toward Week2, 2024, as A(H1N1)pdm09 has been less severe compared to other subtypes in prior patterns. Weekly outpatient ILI visits peaked at 6.9% in Week52, 2023, but decreased to 4.7% in Week2, 2024, indicating waning intensity. The vaccination push during Weeks48–52, 2023, and ongoing in Week1, 2024, likely dampened future occurrences, as evidenced by higher immunization rates reducing transmissibility.
4. Hospitalization rates increased substantially, reaching 37.3 per 100,000 in Week2, 2024, one of the highest levels reported for this week since 2010, signifying continued residual flu impact contributing to the elevated but lower ILI occurrences compared to peaks seen earlier.
5. In summary, the reported 11591 future ILI occurrences (Week2, 2024) can be attributed to the fluctuating but declining ILI trends in Weeks48-52, 2023, dominance and eventual stabilization of A(H1N1)pdm09 activity, the impact of vaccination reducing community disease transmission, and residual hospitalization rates reflecting lingering influenza activity.
