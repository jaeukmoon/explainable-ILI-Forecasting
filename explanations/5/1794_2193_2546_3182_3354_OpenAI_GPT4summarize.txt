1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 26–30, 2021) exhibited a consistent upward trend: from 1794 (Week 26, 2021) to 3354 (Week 30, 2021). This steady rise indicates an increasing rate of respiratory illnesses, likely driven by changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors or other contributing respiratory pathogens.

2. A positive correlation is evident between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the persistent growth in ILI numbers from Week 26 (1794) to Week 30 (3354) aligns with the future surge to 3452 after 5 weeks (Week 35, 2021). This suggests that the upward trajectory in the preceding weeks served as a precursor for the rise in ILI occurrences.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a steady increase over the past 5 weeks, climbing from 1.2% (Week 26, 2021) to 1.9% (Week 30, 2021). This reflects a growing pattern of respiratory illnesses, likely influenced by factors such as enhanced healthcare visibility or non-influenza respiratory pathogens. Furthermore, the consecutive weekly increases in ILI visits across all age groups, noted in Weeks 28–30, are indicative of escalating trends in respiratory illnesses.

4. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) deaths consistently remained above the epidemic threshold, rising from 6.2% (Week 26, 2021) to 9.0% (Week 30, 2021). The persistent elevation of PIC-related mortality, predominantly driven by COVID-19, suggests broader impacts on respiratory health, potentially contributing to the future rise in ILI occurrences.

5. The CDC repeatedly emphasized the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on altering healthcare-seeking patterns and surveillance accuracy over the 5-week period, likely delaying recognition of cases and amplifying underreported respiratory illnesses. This disruption is likely a contributing factor to the sharp increase in ILI occurrences documented after 5 weeks (Week 35, 2021).

6. Despite virologic surveillance showing minimal influenza positivity throughout the 5 weeks (e.g., only 0.1% positive in Week 27, 2021), non-specific respiratory illnesses or other pathogens (such as COVID-19) appear to be the driving factors for the rise in ILI occurrences, compounding pandemic-related disruptions.

7. In summary, the reported 3452 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 35, 2021) can be attributed to the steady increase in ILI activity over the past 5 weeks (Weeks 26–30, 2021), escalating outpatient visit percentages, persistently elevated PIC mortality, and the compounding effects of pandemic-driven healthcare disruptions on data capture and respiratory trends.
