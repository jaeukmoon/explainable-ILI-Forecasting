1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week5 to Week9, 2022, are '1057', '1063', '870', '773', and '893'. This indicates a noticeable downward trend from Week5 (1057) to Week8 (773). A minor rebound is observed in Week9 (893). Overall, the trend illustrates a significant decline followed by a slight increase, suggesting a reduced activity period with marginal fluctuations toward stabilization.
2. Week14, 2022, falls into the off-season period, as it follows the typical peak season (Week46 through Week6) in the U.S. The declining trends in positivity rates and ILI occurrences in Week5 through Week9, 2022, and the absence of significant outbreaks or indicators of sustained ILI activity, further validate its classification as an off-season.
3. Correlation analysis indicates that the steep decline in ILI occurrences from Week5 to Week8, 2022, coupled with a mild recovery in Week9, suggests a stabilization phase expected to persist into future weeks. The historical data points to ILI occurrences leveling off after Week9, 2022, with minimal fluctuation, supporting the forecasted value of 1021 for Week14, 2022.
4. Factors influencing this forecast include:
5. (1) Low influenza positivity rates observed consistently across Week5 (2.0%) to Week9 (5.8%), despite a slight increase by the latter (Week9, 2022 #1).
6. (2) Ongoing antigenic differences in the dominant A(H3N2) strain may modestly reduce vaccine effectiveness (Week5, 2022 #10; Week9, 2022 #5), combined with lower vaccination rates compared to prior seasons (Week7, 2022 #8; Week8, 2022 #8).
7. (3) Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, with limited co-infection impact, remains steady over the analyzed weeks (Week5, 2022 #7; Week8, 2022 #6; Week9, 2022 #9).
5. Influenza activity remained sporadic nationwide, increasing slightly in certain regions but below the national baseline for outpatient respiratory illnesses throughout Week5 to Week9 (Week6, 2022 #3; Week9, 2022 #4). Hospitalization rates showed a steady but modest rise in the same period, staying below pre-pandemic levels (Week9, 2022 #6), aligning with the overall low ILI incidence expectation.
6. The cumulative trend of declining influenza activity, antigenic mismatches, low vaccination uptake, and the persistent co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 with influenza suggests that ILI occurrences will stabilize near 1021 in Week14, 2022.
7. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrences of 1021 are justified by the observed downward trends in recent weeks, stabilization into the off-season, moderate antigenic drift in dominant strains, low vaccination rates, and limited co-infection impacts, all contributing to a consistent, reduced level of ILI activity.
