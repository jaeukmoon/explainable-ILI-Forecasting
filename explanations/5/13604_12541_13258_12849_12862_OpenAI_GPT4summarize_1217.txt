1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating, slightly declining trend, with values of ['13604', '12541', '13258', '12849', '12862']. There was an initial drop from 13604 (Week 15, 2024) to 12541 (Week 16, 2024), followed by a rise to 13258 (Week 17, 2024), and a slight decline but stabilization at 12849 (Week 18, 2024) and 12862 (Week 19, 2024). This indicates a marginal decline in ILI occurrences with stabilization by the last two weeks.
2. The slight decrease and stabilization over the last weeks of the past data align with the subsequent decline to 10231 after 5 weeks (Week 24, 2024). The diminishing trend in the latter observations echoes the waning ILI activity reflected in the future data.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline across all 5 weeks, consistently declining from 2.5% (Week 15, 2024) to 2.0% (Week 19, 2024). This steady reduction in ILI-related healthcare engagements aligns well with the lower future ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza positivity rates continued decreasing, from 5.9% (Week 15, 2024) to 2.4% (Week 19, 2024). Similarly, declining cumulative hospitalization rates per 100,000 were notable, rising minimally (e.g., 79.8 in Week 17, 80.3 in Week 18, and 80.6 in Week 19). These indicators collectively reveal lessening flu activity, correlating with lower ILI reports after 5 weeks.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including RSV and COVID-19, combined with declining influenza activity, contributed to shifting respiratory illness trends. This dynamic interplay likely affected the stabilization and subsequent drop in ILI occurrences to 10231 by Week 24, 2024.
6. In summary, the reported 10231 future ILI occurrences (Week 24, 2024) result from the declining and stabilizing trends in Weeks 15–19, 2024, the steady drop in outpatient visits for ILI, diminishing influenza positivity rates, reduced hospitalization impacts, and the influence of co-circulating respiratory illnesses.
