1. The reported ILI counts from Week22 to Week26, 2023, are 1006, 1121, 996, 978, and 856. A downward trend is evident after Week23, 2023, with a decline in occurrences from 1121 to 856 by Week26, 2023. This decline indicates reduced ILI activity during this period, consistent with off-season characteristics.
2. In the U.S., the off-season generally spans from Week1 to Week31, and historically low influenza positivity rates are reported during this time. Since the target week (Week31, 2023) aligns with the latter part of the U.S. off-season and the CDC continues to report minimal influenza activity, it is consistent to classify Week31, 2023, as part of the off-season.
3. The time-series forecasting model suggests that the declining trend observed in ILI counts from Week22 to Week26, 2023, will likely continue but at a slower rate as occurrences stabilize. By Week31, 2023, a plateau is projected, with future ILI occurrences smoothing out to a lower baseline value, such as the forecasted 678 ILI cases.
4. The CDC consistently reported minimal influenza activity nationwide from Week22 to Week26, 2023, with positivity rates at or near 1.0%-1.2%, indicating negligible transmission levels in this period.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (Week22 #9; Week23 #10; Week24 #9; Week25 #10; Week26 #9) continues to produce a mild impact on ILI rates, but no evidence suggests these are driving a significant increase in influenza-specific cases.
6. Hospitalizations and outpatient ILI visits are steadily declining over Weeks22-26, 2023, with outpatient ILI percentages dropping from 1.9% (Week22, 2023) to 1.4% (Week26, 2023) and hospitalizations decreasing from 953 (Week22, 2023) to 807 (Week26, 2023). These reductions align with decreasing influenza activity levels during the off-season.
7. Given the recent declining ILI trends, off-season timing (Week31, 2023), low influenza positivity rates, stabilization in co-circulating respiratory viruses, and reduced hospitalization and outpatient rates, the forecast of 678 for Week31, 2023, is consistent with continued off-season activity and reduced community spread.
