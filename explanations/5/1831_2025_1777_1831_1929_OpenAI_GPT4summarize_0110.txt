1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week19 to Week23, 2021 are 1831, 2025, 1777, 1831, and 1929. The data shows a fluctuating trend. There was a slight increase from Week19 (1831) to Week20 (2025), followed by a decrease in Week21 (1777), then another increase over Week22 (1831) and Week23 (1929). This pattern reflects mild, irregular fluctuations without consistent growth or decline.
2. In the U.S., the off-season typically spans from the end of the peak season through Week31. Given that the target week (Week28, 2021) falls in July, and influenza activity is minimal with consistently low ILI indicators through the observed period (Week19 to Week23, 2021), Week28, 2021 is classified as off-season.
3. The time-series fluctuations between Week19 and Week23 show no indication of significant increases or spikes, suggesting that ILI occurrences are relatively stable, albeit at low levels. Projecting five weeks forward, similar stability is expected with mild increases, leading to a forecasted value of 2386 ILI occurrences in Week28, 2021.
4. Novel Influenza A variants have been identified (Week20, 2021 #7; Week21, 2021 #3), but no evidence of human-to-human transmission has been established, minimizing immediate impact on widespread ILI activity.
5. COVID-19 continues to dominate respiratory illness trends (Week19, 2021 #5; Week20, 2021 #6; Week21, 2021 #4; Week22, 2021 #3; Week23, 2021 #4), contributing to elevated PIC mortality and altering healthcare-seeking behaviors, which may suppress ILI reports.
6. Influenza-positive specimens remain unusually low across clinical and public health labs (Week19, 2021 #1, #3; Week20, 2021 #1, #3; Week21, 2021 #1, #2; Week22, 2021 #2; Week23, 2021 #2), signaling sustained minimal ILI activity and low virus circulation during the observed period.
7. Given the fluctuating but stable ILI counts, identification of non-transmissible novel variants, dominant influence of COVID-19 on respiratory illness data, and minimal influenza positivity, the projected ILI occurrences for Week28, 2021 are anticipated to exhibit a slight increase reflective of typical low off-season variation, reaching 2386 cases.
