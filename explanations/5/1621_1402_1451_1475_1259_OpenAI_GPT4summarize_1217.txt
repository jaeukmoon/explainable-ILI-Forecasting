1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks depicted a fluctuating downward trend with values of ['1621', '1402', '1451', '1475', '1259']. After a notable drop from 1621 (Week51, 2020) to 1402 (Week52, 2020), there was a slight recovery to 1451 (Week53, 2020) and 1475 (Week1, 2021), only to decline sharply to 1259 (Week2, 2021). This overall decline reflects decreasing ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, given the sustained decrease in ILI cases from 1621 (Week51, 2020) to 1259 (Week2, 2021) followed by the sharp drop to 559 after 5 weeks (Week7, 2021). The declining trend in the observed weeks serves as a precursor to the low future occurrence figure.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%, with values at 1.6% (Week51–53, 2020), 1.7% (Week1, 2021), and 1.4% (Week2, 2021). This persistent and gradual decline in outpatient ILI reporting corresponds closely with the decrease in future occurrences, reflecting reduced healthcare encounters for respiratory illnesses.
4. Influenza positivity rates in clinical labs were exceptionally low throughout the period, dropping from 0.3% (Week51–52, 2020) to 0.1% (Week53, 2020, and Week2, 2021). The sporadic detection of positive influenza cases and constrained virus circulation due to pandemic interventions suggest minimal contribution of influenza to ILI activity, aligning with the reduction to 559 occurrences in the future.
5. PIC mortality, though consistently elevated beyond epidemic thresholds, remained predominantly influenced by COVID-19 rather than influenza. The proportion of deaths attributed to PIC was 13.6% (Week51–52, 2020), 14.5% (Week53, 2020), 17.2% (Week1, 2021), and 14.7% (Week2, 2021). This consistent attribution to COVID-19 highlights suppressed influenza activity, which directly links to sharper reductions in ILI future occurrences.
6. Pandemic-driven disruptions to healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance systems, cited across all summarized reports, reduced ILI reporting accuracy and visibility of milder influenza or respiratory illnesses. This context likely contributed to the sharp decrease in future ILI reports to 559, as cases were underreported or addressed outside traditional monitoring systems.
7. In summary, the reported 559 future ILI occurrences (Week7, 2021) stem from the observed downward trend in prior weeks, declining ILI-related outpatient visits, persistently low influenza positivity rates, and suppressed influenza activity due to pandemic disruptions. Compounded by distortions in healthcare-seeking and surveillance systems, these factors collectively explain the significant reduction in future occurrences.
