1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a clear and consistent decline from 1129 (Week12, 2023) to 807 (Week16, 2023). This downward trend reflects decreasing respiratory illness activities during this observation period, with weekly reductions in occurrences indicative of stabilizing or declining flu activity.
2. A negative correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences, as the consistent decline in Weeks12–16, 2023, precedes the drop to 689 future occurrences in Week21, 2023. The downward trajectory in prior weeks aligns with the continuation of reduced ILI activity shown in the future data.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently below the national baseline, starting at 2.3% in Week12, 2023, and progressively declining to 1.9% in Week16, 2023. This sustained reduction in outpatient ILI visits is strongly correlated with the diminishing ILI occurrences, including the future decrease to 689.
4. Deaths attributed to PIC (pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19) remained moderately above the epidemic threshold but trended downward, from 8.3% in Week12, 2023, to 7.5% in Week16, 2023. This decline in PIC-associated mortality reflects lessened overall respiratory illness severity, supporting the reduced future ILI occurrences.
5. Influenza positivity rates in clinical labs hovered consistently low (0.9%–1.0% across Weeks12–16, 2023), with no significant increases in virologic activity reported. This consistently minimal lab-based flu detection aligns with low ILI occurrences during Weeks12–16, 2023, and the subsequent decrease to 689 in Week21, 2023.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 689 (Week21, 2023) can be attributed to the consistent downward trend in Weeks12–16, 2023, decreasing outpatient visits for ILI, declining PIC-related mortality, and stable low influenza positivity rates, all reflecting minimal respiratory illness activity across this period.
