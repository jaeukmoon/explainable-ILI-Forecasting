1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited fluctuations within a narrow range, starting at 1496 (Week14, 2021), decreasing slightly to 1482 (Week15, 2021), then peaking at 1558 (Week16, 2021) before stabilizing to 1486 in Week18, 2021. While variability is noted, no significant upward or downward trend is observed, with values remaining relatively consistent over the period.
2. Despite the lack of a clear sustained trend in the past ILI occurrences, the slight increase in Week16, 2021, followed by stable values, correlates with the amplified future ILI activity, which may reflect the delayed impact of underlying factors such as surveillance or reporting anomalies, as hinted by the consistent fluctuations in the past weeks.
3. Outpatient ILI visits as a percentage of total visits remained constant at 1.1% for Weeks14–17, 2021, before a minor increment to 1.2% in Week18, 2021. This small uptick, though below the national baseline of 2.6%, indicates a subtle intensification in ILI activity that aligns with the rise to 1576 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week23, 2021).
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained above epidemic thresholds across Weeks14–18, 2021, decreasing from 12.4% in Week15, 2021, to 10.9% in Week18, 2021. The persistently high PIC mortality, primarily driven by COVID-19, reflects broader respiratory illness pressures that potentially impact ILI figures.
5. Factors such as low influenza positivity rates (steadily 0.1% in Weeks14–18, 2021), minimal ILI activity across jurisdictions, and altered healthcare-seeking behaviors during the pandemic contributed to suppressed reporting and delayed recognition of ILI trends, likely leading to a concentrated rise to 1576 occurrences by Week23, 2021.
6. In summary, the reported 1576 future ILI occurrences (Week23, 2021) are attributable to the consistent ILI levels over Weeks14–18, a slight increase in outpatient ILI visits, sustained PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-induced anomalies in healthcare-seeking and data interpretation, which combined to materialize as an amplified rise in future ILI activity.
