1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall decline following an initial increase, with values of ['18790', '21269', '23786', '23985', '19923']. ILI occurrences rose steadily from 18790 (Week18, 2022) to 23985 (Week21, 2022), peaking in Week21, 2022, and subsequently dropping markedly to 19923 in Week22, 2022. This decline suggests a waning phase despite prior elevated activity.
2. A direct correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The sharp decline in Week22, 2022, from its peak in Week21, 2022, precedes the notable reduction in ILI occurrences to 13771 after 5 weeks (Week27, 2022). This five-week lag reflects the sustained de-escalation seen in later weeks of the provided past data.
3. Respiratory viral co-infection rates (4.5% in Week20, 4.4% in Week21, 4.3% in Week22, and 4.2% in Week23, 2022) showed consistent yet slightly decreasing trends, reflecting reduced co-circulation of influenza and SARS-CoV-2, which likely contributed to a lower ILI burden by Week27, 2022.
4. Seasonal influenza activity, as indicated by the percentage of positive respiratory specimens, decreased over the observation period: 7.0% (Week19, 2022), 6.4% (Week20, 2022), 5.7% (Week21, 2022), 5.9% (Week22, 2022), and 3.4% (Week23, 2022). This steady decline in influenza prevalence aligns with the observed reduction in ILI occurrences to 13771 after 5 weeks.
5. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently declined during the observation period, from 2.4% (Week19, 2022) to 2.1% (Week23, 2022), staying below the national baseline. This decreasing trend in healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory illnesses signals reduced ILI activity and aligns with the future downturn to 13771 occurrences.
6. Key surveillance reports emphasized the waning late-season influenza activity, minimal antigenic matches in certain H3N2 vaccine strains, and diminishing geographic variability by Week22 and Week23, 2022. These factors contributed to a less sustained influenza season and subsequent lower ILI activity observed after 5 weeks.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 13771 (Week27, 2022) can be attributed to the declining trend in Week22, 2022, steady reductions in outpatient ILI visits and virus positivity rates, decreased respiratory co-infections, and diminishing late-season influenza activity.
