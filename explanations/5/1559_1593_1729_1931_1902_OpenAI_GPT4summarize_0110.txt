1. The reported ILI counts from Week9 to Week13, 2022 are 1559, 1593, 1729, 1931, and 1902. The trend displays a steady increase from Week9 (1559) to Week12 (1931), followed by a marginal decline in Week13 (1902). This suggests a generally rising trajectory, with a slight dip in the most recent week but no indication of a sharp downturn.
2. Week18, 2022 falls after the typical peak season (Week46-Week6) and within the off-season phase based on national seasonality patterns. Furthermore, CDC reports during Weeks9-13, 2022 indicate moderate ILI activity below baseline thresholds. Thus, Week18, 2022 is classified as part of the off-season.
3. The rising trend in ILI from Week9 to Week12, 2022, followed by the minor dip in Week13, 2022, indicates a gradual normalization rather than a sustained uptrend. Projected forward to Week18, 2022, this pattern suggests an expected moderate increase compared to Week13, reaching an ILI occurrence of 2895 in alignment with historical off-season trends where sporadic activity persists late in the season.
4. The progressively increasing positivity rates for Influenza A (from 5.8% in Week9 to 8.3% in Week13) align with the observed rise in ILI counts. Though positivity remains below peak-season levels, expectations for continued mild increases are consistent with the forecast.
5. Virus-specific factors, including the dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) with antigenic differences relative to the vaccine, point to reduced vaccine effectiveness, potentially contributing to sustained ILI activity (Week9 #3, Week10 #9, Week11 #7).
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, adds complexity to trends, with coinfections in a small but notable subset (Week9 #9, Week12 #9, Week13 #8). This co-circulation may amplify ILI cases beyond a typical off-season baseline.
7. While outpatient respiratory illness visits remain below baseline, increases among individuals aged 5-24 years (Week10 #4, Week13 #4) suggest localized spread within younger populations. Combined with higher activity in specific regions (Week13 #14), these factors support the moderate rise in ILI levels projected for Week18.
8. Given this analysis, the forecast of 2895 ILI occurrences by Week18, 2022 aligns with the observed rising trends, antigenic changes in H3N2, co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, and focused demographic and regional intensifications, characteristic of late off-season dynamics.
