1. The reported ILI counts from Week16 to Week20, 2023 are 1815, 1770, 1795, 1933, and 1847. The overall trend shows mild fluctuations—an initial decrease from Week16 (1815) to Week17 (1770), a slight increase to Week18 (1795), peaking at Week19 (1933), and then declining slightly by Week20 (1847). This aligns with a generally stable pattern with minor variations, characteristic of low influenza activity during off-season periods.
2. In the U.S., the typical off-season spans from Week1 to Week31 of any given year. Since Week25, 2023 falls within this range and influenza activity remains low nationwide (Week16, 2023 #1; Week17, 2023 #1; Week18, 2023 #1; Week19, 2023 #1; Week20, 2023 #1), the target week is best classified as off-season.
3. The time-series data exhibits mild fluctuations but no significant spikes or downward trends. Based on this stability, combined with the low ILI positivity and the off-season timing (Week20, 2023 #1, #3), the projection assumes a continuation of this general pattern. A reduction from Week20 (1847) to Week25 (1391) is expected as declining ILI counts stabilize closer to off-season baselines typically observed around Week25.
4. Influenza positivity remains below 1.5% in clinical and public health labs, with values consistently low week-to-week (Week16, 2023 #1; Week17, 2023 #1; Week18, 2023 #1; Week19, 2023 #1; Week20, 2023 #1). This reflects limited virus circulation, supporting a low ILI occurrence projection.
5. Vaccination effectiveness and antiviral susceptibility remain high, with most circulating viruses matching the vaccine strains and almost all remaining susceptible to antivirals (Week16, 2023 #7; Week17, 2023 #7; Week18, 2023 #9; Week19, 2023 #7; Week20, 2023 #8). This minimizes the risk of a widespread influenza outbreak during the projection period.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV continues to impact overall ILI activity (Week16, 2023 #11; Week17, 2023 #10; Week18, 2023 #10; Week19, 2023 #9; Week20, 2023 #10). However, no indication of a significant increase in respiratory infections or their contribution to ILI trends has been noted, suggesting no major upward deviation in ILI projections.
7. The projection of 1391 ILI occurrences for Week25, 2023 is grounded in the observed stable yet low-level ILI occurrences, classification of the target week as off-season, consistently low influenza positivity rates, protection afforded by vaccine effectiveness, and lack of significant disruption from co-circulating respiratory pathogens. These factors together support a gradual decline in ILI counts from Week20 to the target week.
