1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but overall increasing trend, with values of ['1544', '1705', '2092', '2178', '2157']. There was an initial rise from 1544 (Week 43, 2020) to 1705 (Week 44, 2020) and a sharper increase to 2092 (Week 45, 2020) before peaking at 2178 in Week 46, 2020. Although a minor decrease to 2157 occurred in Week 47, 2020, the overall trend suggests elevated levels of ILI activity by the end of the observed period.
2. A correlation is evident between the past and future ILI occurrences, with the consistently upward trajectory in Weeks 43–46, 2020, serving as a precursor to the observed future value of 1898 in Week 52, 2020. The gradual decline at Week 47 still maintains a high baseline, aligning with future ILI activity levels.
3. Elevated percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, progressively increasing from 8.2% (Week 43, 2020) to 11.3% (Week 47, 2020). This persistent PIC mortality reflects broader respiratory illness activity that aligns with the future ILI levels. Outpatient visits for ILI displayed a gradual increase over the weeks, rising from 1.2% (Week 43, 2020) to 1.6% (Week 47, 2020), with one region surpassing its baseline in Week 45. This growth in healthcare encounters indicates a consistent rise in ILI activity. Reports of overlapping symptoms and disruptions in ILI surveillance due to the COVID-19 pandemic across all weeks suggest underreported cases, which may explain the observed future ILI occurrences. Despite low influenza positivity rates in respiratory specimens across all weeks (e.g., 0.2% in clinical labs during Week 46, 2020), nonspecific respiratory illnesses and atypical healthcare-seeking behaviors likely fueled the sustained ILI activity.
4. Though influenza activity remained low, the consistent upward trend in ILI occurrences during Weeks 43–46, 2020, coupled with persistently elevated PIC mortality and increasing outpatient ILI percentages, foreshadows the future value of 1898 in Week 52, 2020. Reports of disrupted healthcare-seeking patterns and potential underreporting further compound the observed ILI activity.
