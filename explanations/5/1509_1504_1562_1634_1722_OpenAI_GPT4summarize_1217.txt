1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent upward trend, with weekly occurrences rising steadily from '1509' (Week 31, 2024) to '1722' (Week 35, 2024). Each week demonstrated minor but progressive increases, indicating a gradual escalation in ILI activity over this period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the continuous rise in the past weeks (Weeks 31–35, 2024) matches the subsequent increase to 2572 future occurrences by Week 40, 2024. The observed steady growth aligns with the amplified ILI activity reported after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI accounted for 1.5% during Weeks 31–33, rising slightly to 1.8% in Weeks 34–35, with notable increases in younger age groups (0-4 and 5-24 years). This progression in healthcare visits reflects growing ILI-related activity contributing to future occurrences. A gradual uptick in Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 detection was present, shifting from 42.2% (Week 31) to 61.7% (Weeks 34–35), combined with its co-circulation with A(H3N2) and B/Victoria subtypes, which likely influenced transmission dynamics. Reports of co-circulation of other respiratory viruses (COVID-19 and RSV) during all 5 observed weeks could have complicated ILI trends by contributing non-influenza cases to the overall burden.
4. Hospitalization and mortality rates remained low during Weeks 31–35, 2024, with minimal pediatric deaths reported. However, sporadic novel influenza cases linked to zoonotic spillover (e.g., A(H3N2)v, A(H1N1v), and A(H1N2v)) were documented, underscoring potential introduction of new viral elements that may augment ILI burden.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 2572 (Week 40, 2024) result from the consistent upward trend in Weeks 31–35, increasing outpatient visits for ILI, co-circulation of Influenza A subtypes with other respiratory pathogens, and the potential influence of novel influenza cases. These factors collectively explain the rise in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
