1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week14, 2021 to Week18, 2021) in Region 6 exhibit a fluctuating pattern: 1464, 1435, 1358, 1759, and 1626. Week14 to Week16 show a decreasing trend (1464 → 1435 → 1358), but Week17 experiences a significant spike to 1759, which slightly recedes to 1626 in Week18. These fluctuations suggest periodic variability rather than a distinct incremental or declining trend. The average weekly change between consecutive weeks is calculated as [(1435-1464)/1464 + (1358-1435)/1435 + (1759-1358)/1358 + (1626-1759)/1759]/4 = [-0.0198 -0.0537 +0.2953 -0.0756]/4 ≈ +0.0365 (approximately a +3.65% change per week). Applying this average weekly change to the value in Week18 (1626), and projecting it forward for 5 weeks: 1626 × (1 + 0.0365)^5 ≈ 1748. This reflects a moderate upward trend influenced by the Week17 spike, though tempered by other weeks of stability or decline.
2. Based on the background knowledge of U.S. flu seasonality, Week23, 2021 falls into the "Off-season." Since it occurs well after the usual Peak season (concluding around Week6 of each year) and prior to the typical Peak onset season (around Week32 or later), influenza activity is expected to remain minimal during this time. Off-season periods are generally associated with lower ILI occurrences, though pandemic-related factors may cause deviations.
3. A correlation analysis of past trends shows that ILI occurrences in Region 6 are influenced by occasional short-term surges (such as the Week17 spike) but revert to moderate levels thereafter, consistent with historical patterns in non-peak periods. The projection for Week23 (after five weeks) assumes this short-term variability continues but aligns with an overall stable trajectory. By incorporating historical fluctuations and using a 5-week forward projection of the observed weekly growth rate (+3.65%), we arrive at the predicted value of 1748.
4. Several factors from the CDC reports influence the forecast:
5. 1) Unusually low influenza activity. Across Week14 to Week18, 2021, influenza positivity rates in clinical labs remained steady at 0.1%. Public health labs also reported minimal positive cases, far below historical averages. This reinforces that ILI activity in Week23, 2021, is unlikely to deviate significantly, with the prediction remaining near recent averages, adjusted for moderate fluctuations.
6. 2) Altered healthcare-seeking behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CDC consistently notes that pandemic-driven changes complicate ILI data interpretation; reduced healthcare visits during off-season periods or changes in patient behavior may suppress observed ILI cases, thus constraining the rise in occurrences despite fluctuating weekly data. This contributes to keeping the forecast reasonably stable.
7. 3) Minimal variability in vaccination trends. While annual flu vaccination continues to be emphasized, no significant changes in uptake were reported from Week14 to Week18. The consistent efforts to vaccinate during periods of low influenza activity help prevent unexpected surges. Taking these factors collectively, ILI activity is expected to fluctuate modestly while remaining within a stable range.
5. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrences of 1748 for Week23, 2021, are based on a stable yet slightly increasing trajectory observed in recent weeks, tempered by the off-season classification and the influence of minimal influenza activity, altered healthcare-seeking behaviors, and vaccination trends according to CDC reports. The calculation incorporates a modest 3.65% average weekly change, adjusted by observed fluctuations, yielding a forecast consistent with both historical trends and present contextual factors.
