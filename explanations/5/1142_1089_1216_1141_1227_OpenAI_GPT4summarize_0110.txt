1. The ILI counts from Week30 to Week34, 2023 were 1142, 1089, 1216, 1141, and 1227. This trend shows minor fluctuations with an overall slight increase between Week30 and Week34, suggesting a gradual rise but not a significant spike or decline. These fluctuations point to the beginning of seasonal changes common in late off-season or early peak onset periods.
2. Week39, 2023 falls within the peak onset season, as it aligns with the typical U.S. timeline (Week32 through Week46) when ILI activity begins to rise from its minimal levels in the off-season and transitions toward the peak season.
3. From the time-series forecasting perspective, the mild variations in the past weeks combined with an incremental growth suggest a continuation of this gradual upward trend over the next five weeks. Given the transition into peak onset season, the projected increase to 2037 occurrences aligns with historical patterns of rising ILI as seasonal activity begins to intensify.
4. Gradual increases in influenza positivity were reported, rising slightly from 1.0% in Week30 to 1.7% by Week34. Higher pediatric outpatient ILI rates, up to 5.8% in Week34, signal increasing susceptibility among certain groups (Week30, 2023 #3; Week34, 2023 #5).
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and others, has been influencing ILI activity and healthcare utilization, creating minor upward pressure on reported ILI visits (Week30, 2023 #8; Week33, 2023 #10; Week34, 2023 #9).
6. Mortality rates attributed to influenza, pneumonia, or COVID-19 exceeded epidemic thresholds in multiple weeks, increasing from 5.7% in Week30 to 6.5% in Week34, indicating broader respiratory illness trends that could contribute indirectly to higher upcoming ILI counts (Week30, 2023 #6; Week34, 2023 #6).
7. The prediction of 2037 aligns with the observed ILI trend rising toward peak onset season, influenced by increasing positivity rates, pediatric vulnerability, co-circulating respiratory illnesses, and seasonal shifts. These factors collectively justify the upward projection from previous weeks into Week39, 2023.
