1. The ILI occurrences from Week51, 2020 to Week2, 2021 are 1077, 1069, 1060, 1115, and 916. This shows a generally declining trend, except for a moderate increase in Week1, 2021 (1115), followed by a sharp dip in Week2, 2021 (916). Overall, the pattern indicates decreasing ILI activity over the five weeks with a minimal short-term fluctuation.
2. Week7, 2021 occurs shortly after the typical peak season (Week6, 2021) in the U.S. The unusually low ILI activity observed across the data aligns with a continuation of minimal flu transmission, suggesting that Week7, 2021 corresponds to the off-season category.
3. Based on the time-series data, the sharp decline from Week1, 2021 (1115) to Week2, 2021 (916) combined with the steady downward trend indicates a continued weakening of ILI activity. Projecting forward five weeks, the forecasting model interprets this as a transition to a significantly reduced base level, aligning with the prediction of 512 occurrences for Week7, 2021.
4. Low influenza positivity rates (Week51, 2020 to Week2, 2021: not exceeding 0.4%) combined with suppressed influenza transmission due to overlapping COVID-19 effects restrict any substantial rise in ILI activity.
5. Healthcare-seeking behaviors, as impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, show reduced outpatient ILI visits and altered surveillance dynamics, leading to limited detection of influenza-like illnesses. This atypical seasonality is seen in Week51, 2020 #8, Week53, 2020 #11, and Week2, 2021 #9.
6. CDC warnings of potential increases in flu activity have not manifested. The cumulative hospitalization rate (129 by Week2, 2021) indicates ongoing suppressed influenza dynamics, far below historic averages for this time of the year (Week53, 2020 #7; Week2, 2021 #5).
7. The forecast of 512 occurrences for Week7, 2021 is consistent with the continued off-season classification, reduced positivity rates, limited hospitalizations, and disruptions to traditional flu transmission and reporting mechanisms due to competing COVID-19 impacts.
