1. The ILI occurrences from Week36, 2021 to Week40, 2021 were 1305, 1189, 1064, 975, and 1124. The trend indicates an initial decline from Week36 (1305) through Week39 (975), followed by a slight increase in Week40 (1124). This pattern represents a downward trajectory with minor fluctuations, suggesting that ILI activity remained low but showed small variability in the previous weeks.
2. Week45, 2021 is likely part of the peak onset season. Historical data and low baseline positivity indicate that it represents the transitional phase leading into the higher activity observed typically during the peak season starting around Week46.
3. Based on time-series patterns, the ILI counts appear to stabilize near 1124 by Week40, 2021, with no steep increases or decreases observed. Projecting this general stability and modest fluctuations forward to Week45, 2021 results in maintaining a forecast value of 1189, consistent with similar recent counts.
4. The influenza virus circulation remained minimal nationwide as clinical positivity was reported at a slight 0.1% or lower (Week36, 2021 #3; Week39, 2021 #5; Week40, 2021 #1). This ongoing low positivity level limits any significant expected increases in ILI.
5. Despite recommendations for increased vaccination efforts (Week36, 2021 #8; Week40, 2021 #8), vaccination trends were not widely reported, and ongoing behavioral changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact ILI care-seeking behavior and tracking (Week37, 2021 #9; Week39, 2021 #9; Week40, 2021 #9). The persistent pandemic effects suggest no abrupt rise in flu-specific ILI.
6. Co-circulating respiratory pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, contributed significantly to the ILI counts (Week36, 2021 #2; Week37, 2021 #5; Week40, 2021 #10). However, since non-influenza viruses were primarily driving respiratory illnesses, influenza is unlikely to spike significantly in Week45.
7. In summary, the decline in ILI counts, consistent observations of minimal influenza circulation, low vaccination data visibility, and ongoing dominance of other respiratory viruses alongside COVID-19 effects justify the forecast of 1189 for Week45, 2021. The gradual transition through the peak onset season into Winter further supports this moderate and stable projection.
