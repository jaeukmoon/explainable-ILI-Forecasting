1. The past time-series ILI occurrences demonstrated a consistent upward trend over the 5 weeks, with values rising from 1107 (Week27, 2021) to 1504 (Week31, 2021). There was an initial dip from 1107 (Week27, 2021) to 1072 (Week28, 2021), followed by a steady increase in Weeks29-31, culminating in the highest recorded value of 1504 in Week31, 2021, indicating a progressive rise in ILI activity during this period.
2. The positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the upward trajectory in past occurrences from Week29-31, 2021 (1230–1504), aligns with the elevated future ILI occurrences of 1743 after 5 weeks. The growth observed in the latter weeks provides a direct basis for the increased ILI activity reported in Week36, 2021.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased steadily, from 1.3% in Week27, 2021, to 2.0% in Week31, 2021. This continuous rise across age groups highlights a growing trend in respiratory illness activity, closely correlating with the subsequent surge to 1743 in future ILI occurrences.
4. PIC deaths climbed from 6.5% in Week27, 2021, to 11.9% in Week31, 2021, consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds across weeks. This significant increase in respiratory illness-related mortality aligns with the heightened ILI occurrences reported after 5 weeks.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the pandemic, documented repeatedly by the CDC across all 5 weeks, likely delayed ILI reporting while amplifying the future recognized cases as healthcare systems adapted. These behavioral shifts provided the groundwork for the observed increase to 1743 ILI occurrences.
6. Despite minimal influenza circulation reported throughout the period, the rising ILI outpatient visits and PIC deaths suggest contributions from other respiratory pathogens or non-specific illnesses driving the future ILI surge.
7. In summary, the reported 1743 future ILI occurrences (Week36, 2021) can be attributed to the steadily increasing ILI trends from Week29–31, 2021, rising outpatient visits for ILI, persistent PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, and healthcare-seeking behavioral disruptions amplifying non-specific respiratory illness reporting.
