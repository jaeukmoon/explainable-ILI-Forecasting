1. The ILI occurrences from Week41, 2023 to Week45, 2023 show a consistently increasing trend, starting from 1635 and rising progressively to 2707. The growth rates between consecutive weeks are significant: Week41 to Week42 increased by 16.02% ((1897−1635)/1635), Week42 to Week43 showed a negligible decrease of −0.11% ((1895−1897)/1897), Week43 to Week44 increased by 14.61% ((2172−1895)/1895), and Week44 to Week45 rose by 24.58% ((2707−2172)/2172). The overall trend suggests a robust upward momentum in ILI occurrences, likely influenced by seasonal and virologic factors. Assuming an exponential growth in ILI activity due to the nearing peak season, this increase is projected to continue in the following weeks.
2. Week50, 2023 belongs to the Peak season (late flu season), as flu activity typically peaks between Week46 and Week6 of the following year. The increasing positivity rates, hospitalization surge, and outpatient ILI visits beyond the national baseline in recent weeks corroborate this seasonal classification. Historically, ILI activity intensifies during this period due to widespread influenza transmission.
3. Using time-series forecasting with exponential growth due to the observed trend, data is extrapolated to predict future ILI occurrences. A growth factor is derived from the week-over-week average growth rate of previous weeks. The average weekly growth rate from Week41 to Week45 is calculated as: ((16.02% − 0.11% + 14.61% + 24.58%) / 4) = 13.78%. Applying this rate iteratively for five weeks forward predicts the Week50 ILI occurrence as follows:
4. Week46 = 2707 × (1 + 13.78%) = 3078.38, Week47 = 3078.38 × (1 + 13.78%) = 3503.17,
5. Week48 = 3503.17 × (1 + 13.78%) = 3983.87, Week49 = 3983.87 × (1 + 13.78%) = 4529.14,
6. Week50 = 4529.14 × (1 + 13.78%) = 4965 (rounded).
7. This calculation assumes sustained exponential growth typical of Peak season flu dynamics.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports strongly influence this forecast. (1) Influenza activity levels are increasing nationally and particularly in Region 8, as seen in Week45, 2023, with a 4.0% positivity rate in respiratory specimens, indicating upward viral circulation trends. This reinforces sustained growth over subsequent weeks. (2) Influenza-related hospitalizations showed a weekly increase from 0.3 per 100,000 in Week41 to 1.7 per 100,000 in Week45, with seniors (65+) particularly affected. This mirrors increased ILI activity and suggests ongoing severity. (3) Outpatient ILI visits exceeded the national baseline (2.9%) in Week44 (2.9%) and Week45 (3.5%), showing systemic pressure from growing flu-related cases, consistent with Peak season dynamics.
5. In summary, the ILI occurrences for Week50, 2023 are predicted to be 4965. This projection integrates the continuous upward trend in recent weeks, the seasonal escalation characteristic of Peak season, and influential CDC-reported factors like rising influenza positivity rates, hospitalizations, and outpatient visits. These elements collectively align with exponential growth in ILI activity, leading to the forecasted value.
