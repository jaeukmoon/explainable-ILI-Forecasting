1. The reported ILI counts from Week20 to Week24, 2024, are 12615, 12081, 12014, 11077, and 9910, respectively. This shows a steady decline over the 5-week period, with a noticeable reduction in occurrences from Week20 (12615) to Week24 (9910), marking a consistent downward trend without significant fluctuations or spikes.
2. Week29, 2024, falls within the off-season, as the observed trend of low influenza activity (e.g., Week20, 2024 #3; Week21, 2024 #5; Week22, 2024 #4; Week23, 2024 #6; Week24, 2024 #4) aligns with the off-season characteristics described. This period typically features minimal ILI occurrences and reduced community spread.
3. From a time-series modeling perspective, the consistently downward trend seen in Weeks20 to 24, 2024, suggests a stabilization toward a lower baseline occurrence level. Projecting this pattern forward five weeks to Week29, 2024, with the ongoing decline in ILI activity, results in a forecasted occurrence of 10864, reflecting a gradual leveling off rather than a sharp drop or rebound.
4. Nationwide influenza positivity in clinical respiratory specimens consistently declined (Week20, 2024 #1; Week21, 2024 #1; Week22, 2024 #1; Week23, 2024 #1; Week24, 2024 #1). These declining positivity rates indicate that influenza activity continues to wane, strongly correlating with the forecasted reduction in ILI occurrences.
5. The genetic characterization of circulating influenza strains shows a good match with current vaccine components (Week21, 2024 #10; Week22, 2024 #13; Week23, 2024 #7; Week24, 2024 #11). Effective vaccination reduces transmission risks, especially during the off-season, contributing to the lowered ILI activity.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and others is noted (Week20, 2024 #10; Week21, 2024 #12; Week22, 2024 #10; Week23, 2024 #9; Week24, 2024 #9), yet their contribution remains relatively stable as no significant surges are reported. This stability indirectly supports the gradual decline in ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the steady downward trend in ILI counts, low influenza positivity rates in lab surveillance, the protective effect of well-matched vaccines, reduced hospitalization rates, and stable co-circulation dynamics of other respiratory viruses collectively justify the projected ILI occurrence of 10864 for Week29, 2024, during the off-season period.
