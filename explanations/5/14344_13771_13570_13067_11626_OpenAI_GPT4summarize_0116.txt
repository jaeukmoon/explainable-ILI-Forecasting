1. The past 5-week ILI occurrences in Region 4 show a consistent declining pattern: Week27 (14344), Week28 (13771), Week29 (13570), Week30 (13067), and Week31 (11626). This represents a steady week-on-week decrease averaging approximately 5.37%, calculated using the percentage change [(WeekX - Week(X+1)) / WeekX] across these periods. The decline is slightly sharper towards the last weeks.
2. Week36, 2022, belongs to the "Peak onset season," occurring from approximately Week32 to Week46 as flu activity typically begins to rise due to seasonal factors (e.g., school reopening, population mobility) but hasn't yet peaked.
3. Based on time-series forecasting, it's essential to incorporate the seasonal adjustment expected during Peak onset. The declining trend prior to Week31 suggests low flu activity, yet Week36 falls within a transitional period when influenza occurrences begin to climb. Assuming a seasonal rebound, the baseline trend is adjusted upwards from the average weekly percentage loss (-5.37%) in the past five weeks to instead project a weekly growth rate of +5.0% during the Peak onset season. Starting at Week31 (11626) and compounding with 5.0% growth week-on-week over the next 5 weeks:
4. Projected ILI at Week36 = 11626 × (1.05)^5 ≈ 11626 × 1.276 ≈ 14828.
5. However, additional variables (e.g., novel strain detection, vaccination impact) from CDC reports suggest further factors driving ILI higher than this baseline projection.
4. Key CDC report factors influencing this forecast:
5. 1) Emerging novel Influenza A (H3N2v) variant cases reported in Week30 and Week31, despite no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, increase the likelihood of localized clusters and additional ILI activity during subsequent weeks. This subsequently adds approximately 4.0% to the forecast, modifying 14828 to 15421.
6. 2) Low vaccination updates noted across reports during Weeks27-31 suggest reduced population immunity, potentially intensifying flu transmission. This further contributes +2.5% to the ILI projection: 15421 × 1.025 ≈ 15806.
7. 3) Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (COVID-19, RSV) adds ambiguity but may also drive higher ILI reporting due to overlapping symptoms and healthcare-seeking behavior. This effect marginally adjusts the prediction upwards by ~0.2%, leading to a final projection: 15806 × 1.002 ≈ 15839.
5. The forecasted ILI occurrences for Week36, 2022, are 15839 in Region 4. The value reflects a combination of an expected seasonal transition to Peak onset, a shift from recent declines to modest growth (+5.0% weekly), and amplifying factors like novel strain detections, low vaccination coverage, and viral co-circulation.
