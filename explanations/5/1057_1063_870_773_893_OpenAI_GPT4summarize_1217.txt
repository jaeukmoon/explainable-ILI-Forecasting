1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks indicated a fluctuating trend with values of ['1057', '1063', '870', '773', '893']. The data started at a high in Week5, 2022 (1057), rose slightly in Week6, 2022 (1063), and then markedly declined to Week8, 2022 (773). However, a rebound was observed in Week9, 2022 (893), suggesting a partial recovery in ILI activity toward the end of the period.
2. Comparing the past and future ILI occurrences implies a correlation between the late rebound in past data and the reported 1021 occurrences in Week14, 2022. The increase from Week8 (773) to Week9 (893), mirroring a similar upward trajectory, hints at ILI resurgence within subsequent weeks.
3. An increase in influenza positivity rates from 2.0% (Week5, 2022) to 5.8% (Week9, 2022), driven mainly by Influenza A(H3N2), signaled heightened activity leading into future weeks. Similarly, hospitalization rates rose steadily, reaching 5.5 per 100,000 in Week9, 2022, reflecting escalating severity. Low vaccination uptake reported across all weeks further compounded ILI occurrences.
4. The persistent co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 with influenza (5.9% co-infection rate in Week9, 2022) likely contributed to increased ILI cases. Antigenic mismatches in circulating A(H3N2) strains may have reduced vaccine effectiveness, leaving more individuals susceptible to illness.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 1021 in Week14, 2022, stems from the rebound in past weeks (Week8–9, 2022), increased influenza detection and hospitalizations, co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, and low vaccination rates, all of which compounded the resurgence of ILI activity.
