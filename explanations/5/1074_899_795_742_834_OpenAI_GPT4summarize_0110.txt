1. The past ILI occurrences from Week4, 2022 to Week8, 2022 are as follows: 1074, 899, 795, 742, and 834. The trend from Week4 to Week8, 2022 shows a clear initial decline (1074 to 742) followed by a slight increase in Week8 (834). Overall, the trend represents a downward trajectory with a minor rebound in Week8, indicating reduced influenza activity but with potential for fluctuation.
2. Week13, 2022 falls under the off-season as it is significantly beyond the typical peak season (Week46 of the previous year through Week6 of the following year). Indicators from the past 5 weeks reveal sporadic flu activity with no sustained uptick, consistent with low off-season activity.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the declining ILI trend (1074 to 742) followed by a small rise (834) may project a moderate, steady increase in cases over the next 5 weeks. This aligns with a general progression toward normalization, contributing to the forecast of 2612 ILI occurrences in Week13, 2022.
4. Low vaccination rates throughout the season, as repeatedly noted (Week4, 2022 #6; Week5, 2022 #8; Week6, 2022 #8; Week7, 2022 #8; Week8, 2022 #8), reduce community-level protection, creating opportunities for moderate increases in activity.
5. The dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), which has shown some antigenic differences from the vaccine strain (Week5, 2022 #10; Week6, 2022 #10; Week7, 2022 #7; Week8, 2022 #8), may have influenced vaccine effectiveness, limiting its ability to curb ILI levels effectively.
6. Consistent co-circulation of other respiratory viruses and SARS-CoV-2 (Week4, 2022 #8; Week5, 2022 #7; Week6, 2022 #9; Week7, 2022 #9; Week8, 2022 #6) heightens the burden on healthcare systems and contributes to the observed fluctuations in respiratory illness reports.
7. The forecast of 2612 ILI occurrences in Week13, 2022 is supported by the interplay of declining vaccination rates, antigenic changes in Influenza A(H3N2), and ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses. While current trends suggest low off-season activity, these factors collectively explain the moderate projected increase.
