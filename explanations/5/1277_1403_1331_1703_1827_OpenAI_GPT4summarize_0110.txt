1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week45, 2023 to Week49, 2023 are 1277, 1403, 1331, 1703, and 1827. This trend indicates a steady increase in ILI activity, with a sharp rise from Week47 (1703) to Week48 (1827). This upward trajectory aligns with the ongoing elevated influenza activity as reported in the CDC summaries. There were no significant dips or plateaus, suggesting continual growth over this period.
2. Based on historical patterns, Week2, 2024 falls within the typical peak season for influenza in the U.S. (from Week46 to approximately Week6 of the following year). Considering the high ILI activity observed nationwide during the preceding weeks (Week45, 2023 to Week49, 2023) and the continued elevated influenza positivity and severe impacts noted in the CDC reports, Week2, 2024 is forecasted to belong to the peak season.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the steady rise in ILI occurrences over five weeks signals a continuation of elevated influenza activity. The increase from 1277 in Week45, 2023 to 1827 in Week49, 2023 suggests an ongoing upward trend that projects forward into Week2, 2024. Using this trend, the predicted ILI occurrence of 1777 reflects continued but slightly moderated growth in cases relative to Week49, 2023.
4. Influenza positivity rates have consistently increased, reaching 10.2% by Week49, 2023, alongside elevated ILI visits (4.4%) nationwide for the sixth consecutive week and significant hospitalizations (cumulative rate of 8.0 per 100,000), which suggest persistent high transmission levels (Week49, 2023 #2, #4, #6).
5. Vaccination coverage remains critical but has not significantly curbed increases in reported cases yet. CDC highlights that circulating strains are well-matched to current vaccines, but ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV may be compounding the burden of ILI cases (Week49, 2023 #7, #9; Week48, 2023 #7; Week47, 2023 #9).
6. Regional variability, particularly in high activity zones like the southeast, south-central, and west coast regions, continues to drive national estimates upward. The rapid spread is compounded by peaks in Influenza A(H1N1), with Influenza B remaining significant in some regions as a secondary factor (Week49, 2023 #1, #3; Week48, 2023 #10; Week46, 2023 #2).
7. In summary, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 1777 for Week2, 2024 is supported by a combination of factors: the steady upward trend observed in past data, alignment with the peak season, increases in positivity rates and severe disease indicators, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, vaccination effects, and regional differences. These elements collectively indicate sustained heightened activity yet a slightly moderated growth compared to Week49, 2023.
