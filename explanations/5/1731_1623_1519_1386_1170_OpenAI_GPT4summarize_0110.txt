1. The ILI occurrences from Week24 to Week28, 2022 show a consistent decreasing trend, starting with 1731 in Week24, 1623 in Week25, 1519 in Week26, 1386 in Week27, and ending at 1170 in Week28. This indicates a steady decline in activity over the last five weeks, with no significant fluctuations or spikes.
2. Week33, 2022 falls between the typical off-season (which ends around Week31) and the peak onset season (generally starting from Week32 or Week35). Given the ongoing low influenza activity and steady declines observed in Weeks24–28, 2022, Week33, 2022 is most consistent with the off-season, as influenza activity has not yet shown signs of entering the peak onset season.
3. The time-series data demonstrates a stable decline in ILI counts. Considering the gradual reduction in occurrences and no indication of an upward trend, a further reduction is anticipated over the next five weeks. However, as Week33 approaches the typical transition period toward peak onset, the decline slows, resulting in an occurrence value of 1207—lower than Week28 but not drastically so.
4. Influenza activity remained low throughout Weeks24–28, as evidenced by the declining percentage of positive respiratory specimens, from 2.5% in Week24 (Week24, 2022 #1) to 0.7% in both Weeks27 and Week28 (Week27, 2022 #1; Week28, 2022 #1), mirroring the ILI trend. This low activity supports reduced future ILI occurrences.
5. Outpatient visits for ILI have steadily decreased, dropping from 1.9% in Week24 to below the national baseline at 1.6% by Week28 (Week24, 2022 #4; Week28, 2022 #3), indicating reduced respiratory illness transmission. The decreasing outpatient rates correlate with projected lower ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, persisted during Weeks24–28 (Week26, 2022 #10; Week28, 2022 #8), impacting the total ILI but not driving any surge in influenza-specific activities. This factor, combined with the ongoing influenza activity decline, suggests a continued low level of occurrences.
7. In conclusion, the projected ILI count of 1207 for Week33, 2022 is supported by the observed steady decline in ILI trends, the established off-season timing, and low influenza activity levels confirmed by positivity rates and outpatient visits. The influence of co-circulating respiratory pathogens remains moderate, and no significant upward trend is anticipated under these conditions.
