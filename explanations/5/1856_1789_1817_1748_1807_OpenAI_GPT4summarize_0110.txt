1. The reported ILI counts from Week20 to Week24, 2021 are 1856, 1789, 1817, 1748, and 1807. The overall trend indicates a mild, fluctuating decline with values decreasing slightly from Week20 (1856) to Week24 (1807). While there are minor week-to-week variations, this trend showcases a relatively stable occurrence of ILI at low activity levels without any significant spikes.
2. In the U.S., the off-season corresponds to Weeks 7 through 31. Week29, 2021 falls within this off-season period. This is further supported by the consistent reports of minimal influenza activity and nationwide ILI percentages remaining below the baseline during Weeks20 to Week24, 2021 (Weeks20–24, 2021 #1). Therefore, Week29, 2021 is forecasted to also belong to the off-season.
3. The time-series data reflects a stable or slightly fluctuating pattern with no sharp upward trajectory or significant deviations. Projecting this trend forward to Week29, 2021, it is reasonable to expect ILI occurrences to increase slightly but remain relatively low, consistent with patterns observed in prior weeks. This correlates with the predicted occurrence of 3182 cases being within the range expected during the off-season.
4. Influenza activity remained exceptionally low, with less than 0.1% positivity in surveillance specimens and stable outpatient visits below the 2.6% national baseline, indicating minimal transmission during Weeks20–24, 2021 (Weeks20–24, 2021 #1, #4, #10).
5. Healthcare-seeking patterns and syndromic surveillance were influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, complicating traditional ILI monitoring and potentially causing underreporting during this period (Weeks20–24, 2021 #10, #7).
6. Minimal virological activity was reported, with limited Influenza A and B detections, and no significant increases in ILI across different age groups or regions (Weeks20–24, 2021 #1, #9).
7. In summary, the low and stable ILI trend from Week20 to Week24, 2021, the continued off-season classification for Week29, 2021, and the influence of historically low influenza activity, combined with disrupted healthcare seeking dynamics, align with the projection of 3182 ILI occurrences in Week29, 2021.
