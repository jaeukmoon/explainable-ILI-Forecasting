1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1284', '1232', '1264', '1205', '1083']. The highest value, 1284 (Week14, 2023), progressively dropped to the lowest value, 1083 (Week18, 2023), indicating declining ILI activity throughout this observation period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the declining ILI activity in the past weeks (Weeks14-18, 2023) is followed by a reduction in the future occurrence to 1121. This future value is slightly higher than the lowest recorded past occurrence (1083), reflecting a stabilization but no significant resurgence.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable yet below the national baseline of 2.5% throughout the observed period, decreasing from 2.1% (Week14, 2023) to 2.0% (Week18, 2023). This trend aligns with the low ILI activity reported in the future occurrences.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded epidemic thresholds but gradually decreased from 7.6% (Week14, 2023) to 6.9% (Week18, 2023). This decrease reflects an improvement in severe respiratory illnesses and correlates with the decline in ILI trends.
5. The consistently low influenza positivity rates, decreasing from 1.0% (Week14, 2023) to 0.9% (Week18, 2023), combined with stable vaccination coverage and high antiviral susceptibility (>98%), contributed to effective control of influenza spread, aiding reduced ILI occurrences in the subsequent weeks.
6. In summary, the reported 1121 future ILI occurrences (Week23, 2023) can be attributed to the steady decline in past ILI trends, decreasing outpatient visits, reduced severity in PIC-related deaths, and low influenza positivity rates, supported by effective vaccination and antiviral measures. The slight stabilization in future occurrences reflects the ongoing influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses and healthcare behaviors.
