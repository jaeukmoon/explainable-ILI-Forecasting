1. The past time-series ILI occurrences showed a consistent upward trend over the 5 weeks, with values of ['1933', '1867', '1934', '2133', '2350']. After a slight drop from 1933 (Week 21, 2021) to 1867 (Week 22, 2021), the trend reversed into steady growth, culminating in a peak at 2350 (Week 25, 2021). This indicates a progressive increase in ILI occurrences by the end of the observed period.
2. The positive correlation between the past time-series data and the future ILI occurrences of 3478 (Week 30, 2021) is evident, as the rising trajectory observed from Week 23, 2021, to Week 25, 2021, aligns with a further amplification of ILI activity after 5 weeks. The upward momentum in Weeks 24 and 25 is a precursor to the surge in Week 30, 2021.
3. The proportion of outpatient visits for ILI, while minimal, showed consistent values of 1.2% across Weeks 22–25, 2021, compared to 1.1% in Week 21, 2021. This indicates stable but persistent respiratory illness activity, which likely contributed to the observed future increase. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, with percentages of 8.3%, 7.5%, 7.6%, 7.1%, and 6.6% from Week 21 to Week 25, 2021. This persistent elevated PIC mortality likely signals ongoing respiratory illness influences. Disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors and influenza surveillance caused by the COVID-19 pandemic further complicated data interpretation and likely masked underlying ILI activity that later manifested in the sharp increase to 3478 occurrences by Week 30, 2021.
4. Minimal positivity rates for influenza (e.g., <0.1% in Weeks 24–25, 2021) and negligible lab detections indicate that the increase in future occurrences may be driven by non-specific respiratory illnesses or other pathogens, potentially exacerbated by expanded syndromic surveillance.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 3478 (Week 30, 2021) are likely driven by the upward trend in ILI occurrences ending at 2350 (Week 25, 2021), consistent outpatient visit percentages for ILI, persistently high PIC mortality rates, and surveillance challenges from pandemic-driven healthcare changes. The minimal influenza virus positivity suggests that other respiratory factors or secondary disruptions contributed significantly to the increase.
