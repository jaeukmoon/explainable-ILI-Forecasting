1. The past ILI occurrences from Week37 to Week41, 2023, indicate a steadily increasing trend: 15359 (Week37), 15677 (Week38), 16160 (Week39), 17810 (Week40), and 18374 (Week41). This continuous rise suggests a clear upward trajectory heading toward higher ILI activity, marking a consistent increase over five weeks.
2. Week46, 2023, aligns with the peak season in the U.S., as it typically spans from Week46 through Week6 of the following year. Given the increasing ILI trend and rising indicators of influenza activity reported in Week41, 2023, Week46 is consistent with the peak season classification.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the uninterrupted increase in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks signifies a momentum effect, with future values expected to escalate correspondingly. Baseline and short-term growth patterns further support a projection of 30047 occurrences for Week46, 2023, which aligns with this upward trend.
4. Influenza positivity rates gradually increased over five weeks, from 0.8% (Week37, 2023) to 1.3% (Week41, 2023), with the proportions of Influenza A (primarily H1N1) and Influenza B (Victoria lineage) remaining stable. This steady climb indicates heightened transmission potential as the season approaches its peak.
5. Outpatient visits for ILI also rose from 2.0% (Week37, 2023) to 2.3% (Week41, 2023), with children in the 0–4 age group consistently showing the highest visit rates across the weeks. Increasing healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory illnesses reflects broader community spread and intensifying activity.
6. Cumulative hospitalizations for influenza markedly increased each week (820 in Week37, 880 in Week38, 1040 in Week39, 1127 in Week40, and 1228 in Week41), signaling a rising burden of severe disease parallel to growing outpatient ILI cases. This increase correlates with the start of peak season and supports the higher Week46 projection.
7. The forecasted ILI occurrence of 30047 for Week46, 2023, is justified by a consistent upward trend in cases, a transition into the peak season, growing positivity and outpatient ILI visit rates, and steadily increasing hospitalizations. Together, these indicators align with expected heightened ILI activity during this period.
