1. The ILI occurrences from Week8 to Week12, 2024 declined steadily: 16544 (Week8), 16509 (Week9), 15338 (Week10), 15334 (Week11), and 14964 (Week12). This indicates a consistent downward trend across the five weeks, with no reversals or significant spikes. The decline is modest but persistent, aligned with waning influenza activity toward the season's end.
2. Week17, 2024 falls within the off-season based on historical U.S. influenza activity patterns, spanning after the peak season (ending around Week6) through the start of the peak onset season (beginning around Week32). CDC reports from Week8 to Week12 also show decreasing trends in positivity and outpatient visits, consistent with the off-season classification for Week17, 2024.
3. The downward trajectory in ILI occurrences observed in the past five weeks supports the expectation of further declines or stabilization. Decreasing outpatient ILI visits (e.g., 4.4% in Week8 to 3.1% in Week12) and reductions in influenza positivity (e.g., 14.2% in Week8 to 10.5% in Week12) suggest that ILI occurrences are tapering toward baseline levels typical of the off-season. A time-series projection estimates the future ILI occurrence to stabilize around 13258 due to this consistent pattern.
4. Elevated activity in earlier weeks (Week8 and Week9) caused by sustained influenza spread tapered off according to decreasing regional positivity trends (e.g., localized declines reported by Week11 and Week12). This aligns with lower hospitalizations and outpatient visits toward Week12, indicative of the transitioning season. Co-circulating respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 continue to influence ILI counts but have not exhibited notable surges.
5. Vaccine effectiveness remains a positive influence, as the vaccines this season match well with circulating strains. However, while vaccination uptake remains stagnant (no significant increases reported from Week8 to Week12), the antiviral resistance remains minimal, with low susceptibility only isolated to specific cases. These factors contribute to controlling ILI trends in the waning season.
6. Declining influenza B and A positivity (e.g., Influenza A dropped from 59.0% in Week8 to 51.9% in Week11, and Influenza B saw parallel decreases) contribute to the declining trend in ILI activity. The lower prevalence of highly transmissible strains like A(H1N1)pdm09 and stable death rates reflect the reduced burden on vulnerable populations and contribute to the forecasted ILI value stabilizing near baseline levels.
7. The projected Week17, 2024 ILI value of 13258 is justified by the consistent decline in ILI occurrences observed from Week8 to Week12, the off-season classification for this period, decreasing positivity and hospitalization rates, controlled antiviral resistance, and limited spread of co-circulating viruses. These factors collectively explain why ILI occurrences are forecasted to decrease further but stabilize at slightly elevated levels above baseline trends.
