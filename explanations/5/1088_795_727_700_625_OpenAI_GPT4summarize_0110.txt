1. The reported ILI counts from Week17 to Week21, 2024 are 1088, 795, 727, 700, and 625. This data indicates a clear downward trend throughout the five weeks, with consistent week-to-week reductions in ILI occurrences, reflecting declining flu activity nationally. No significant spikes or fluctuations were observed, suggesting a sustained reduction in influenza transmission.
2. Based on historical seasonality patterns in the U.S., Week26, 2024 aligns with the off-season. Influenza activity during this period typically remains minimal following the decline of the peak season. Additionally, all indicators from Week17 to Week21, 2024 (e.g., positivity rates and outpatient visit percentages) confirm that flu activity is low and tapering, further supporting that Week26, 2024 belongs to the off-season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the sustained decline in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks establishes a pattern that strongly correlates with continued reductions in flu activity. Projecting forward five weeks to Week26, 2024, based on this trend, it is reasonable to forecast ongoing declines. Given this trajectory, the model anticipates ILI occurrences stabilizing at a much lower level, reaching 330.
4. Nationwide positivity rates have been consistently decreasing, dropping from 3.9% in Week17, 2024 to 1.7% in Week21, 2024, with no regions reporting moderate or high flu activity. This decline indicates low transmission levels expected to persist in the upcoming weeks.
5. Vaccine effectiveness and antiviral susceptibility remain strong, as genetic characterization suggests that current circulating influenza viruses match the vaccine components, and minimal resistance to antivirals has been observed (Week21, 2024 #10; Week20, 2024 #11; Week18, 2024 #7). This contributes to successfully mitigating further transmission.
6. The co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, observed during Week17 to Week21, 2024, also contributes variably to ILI trends. However, these factors have not triggered any notable increase in ILI occurrences (Week21, 2024 #12; Week20, 2024 #10).
7. Combining the observed time-series trend, off-season classification, and factors like declining positivity rates, highly effective vaccination and antiviral measures, and the absence of any disruptive activity from co-circulating viruses, the forecasted ILI occurrences for Week26, 2024 are confidently projected at 330, reflecting sustained minimal activity.
