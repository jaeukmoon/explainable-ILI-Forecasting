1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a steady upward trend, with values of ['2032', '2021', '2096', '2181', '2531']. Week12, 2022 started at 2032, dipping slightly in Week13, 2022 to 2021, before rebounding and accelerating through Week14–16, 2022, culminating at 2531 in Week16, 2022. This marked and consistent increase signals heightened ILI activity leading into the future period.
2. A positive correlation is discernible between past and future ILI occurrences, as the increasing weekly trajectory observed in Weeks15–16, 2022 reflects an ongoing escalation in sickness levels. Consequently, the future occurrence of 1983, though lower than the Week16, 2022 peak, aligns with the tapering yet sustained activity observed in the previous weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually increased over the 5 weeks, rising from 1.8% in Week12, 2022 to 2.1% by Week16, 2022. Although still below baseline, this consistent rise corroborates the broader increase in respiratory illness activity, aligning with the future occurrence of 1983.
4. Hospitalization rates for influenza grew consistently across the 5-week period, starting at 7.2 per 100,000 in Week12, 2022 and reaching 11.1 per 100,000 by Week16, 2022. This steady increase underscores severe illness trends, contributing to the elevated ILI occurrences seen in the future.
5. Rising co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, throughout the 5-week period (e.g., 5.4% in Week12, 2022 and 5.0% in Week16, 2022) compounded respiratory illness presentations. This dynamic, paired with antigenic changes in A(H3N2) strains, likely fostered sustained ILI activity, influencing the occurrence of 1983 in the future.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1983 (Week21, 2022) can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks14–16, 2022, the consistent rise in ILI outpatient visits, escalating hospitalization rates, and the persistent effect of viral co-circulation and antigenic evolution. These combined factors explain the observed future occurrence.
