1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall upward trend, with values of ['1934', '2133', '2350', '2274', '2482']. There was a steady increase from Week 23, 2021 (1934) to Week 25, 2021 (2350), followed by a slight dip in Week 26, 2021 (2274) and recovery to the highest value in Week 27, 2021 (2482). This pattern reflects a gradual escalation in ILI activity approaching the end of the observed period.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The recent rise in past ILI occurrences, particularly the increase from Week 26, 2021 (2274) to Week 27, 2021 (2482), aligns with the significant jump to 4097 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks. This upward trajectory serves as a precursor to the amplified ILI activity observed in later weeks.

3. Notable factors in the CDC reports contribute to the explanation of the recorded future ILI occurrences:  
   - Outpatient visits for ILI, while remaining below the 2.6% national baseline, exhibited slight increases into Week 27, 2021, rising from 1.2% in Week 23–26, 2021 to 1.3% in Week 27, 2021, particularly in the 5–24 and 25–49 age groups, suggesting broader spread in younger and economically active populations.  
   - PIC deaths exceeded epidemic thresholds across all weeks with values such as 7.6% (Week 23, 2021) and 6.5% (Week 27, 2021), primarily driven by COVID-19 but indicative of heightened respiratory illness activity that could overlap with or mimic ILI dynamics.  
   - Healthcare-seeking behavior shifts due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic were documented in all weeks, complicating traditional surveillance and potentially concentrating ILI activity in fewer, more severe cases, contributing to the observed future surge.  

4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 4097 can be attributed to the upward trend in ILI cases in Week 27, 2021, increases in outpatient ILI visits in key age demographics, and persistently elevated PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds. These patterns, combined with disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance systems during the pandemic, likely created conditions for the significant rise in reported ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
