1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week36, 2023 to Week40, 2023 are 16455, 15359, 15677, 16160, and 17810. A clear upward trend emerges in ILI counts starting from Week38, 2023, showing an increase from 15677 to 17810 by Week40, 2023. This growth pattern suggests a gradual escalation in influenza activity over this period, setting the stage for continued increases in the following weeks.
2. Week45, 2023 falls within the peak onset season. The typical U.S. peak onset season spans from Week35 to Week46 each year, and the upward trajectory observed in the current ILI counts is consistent with influenza transitioning from low-level activity toward its peak.
3. From the time-series perspective, the consistent rise in ILI occurrences over recent weeks (Week39 and Week40, 2023) indicates increasing momentum in cases. Extrapolating this trend forward through Week45, 2023 suggests a continuation of growth, leading to a significantly higher projected ILI count of 28832.
4. Influenza positivity in clinical labs rose from 0.7% in Week36, 2023 to 1.1% in Week40, 2023, with both Influenza A and Influenza B steadily co-circulating (Week36, 2023 #1; Week37, 2023 #1; Week38, 2023 #1; Week39, 2023 #1; Week40, 2023 #1). This reflects an environment highly conducive to increasing ILI activity.
5. Hospitalizations due to laboratory-confirmed influenza climbed from 775 in Week36, 2023 to 1127 in Week40, 2023 (Week36, 2023 #7; Week37, 2023 #4; Week38, 2023 #4; Week39, 2023 #4; Week40, 2023 #3), signaling a broader surge in symptomatic cases and healthcare visits tied to respiratory illnesses.
6. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, continues to amplify ILI activity and healthcare visits across all regions, as seen throughout the CDC reports from Week36 to Week40, 2023 (Week36, 2023 #9; Week37, 2023 #9; Week38, 2023 #8; Week39, 2023 #7; Week40, 2023 #6). Such widespread co-infections likely contribute to the robust projection of higher future ILI counts.
7. The combination of an escalating time-series trend, the seasonal alignment with peak onset, rising positivity and hospitalization rates, and the impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses suggests that ILI occurrences in Week45, 2023 will reach 28832, reflecting a surge in influenza-like illness consistent with historical and current patterns.
