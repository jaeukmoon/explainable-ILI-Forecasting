1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent increasing trend, with the values ['1703', '1827', '2186', '2266', '2402']. Starting at 1703 in Week 48, 2023, the numbers steadily rose each week, peaking at 2402 in Week 52, 2023. This continuous upward trajectory reflects an escalating spread of ILI cases over the observed period.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 2311 (Week 5, 2024) aligns with the upward trend seen in the earlier weeks, though it reflects a slight decline compared to 2402 (Week 52, 2023). The consistent increase leading up to Week 52, 2023, strongly correlates with the elevated baseline activity, indicating ongoing high incidence even as the peak starts to level off.
3. The percentage of outpatient visits for ILI rose sharply from 4.0% in Week 48, 2023, to 6.9% in Week 52, 2023, surpassing the national baseline of 2.9% for eight consecutive weeks. This elevated ILI activity corresponds with the increasing influenza positivity rates, which climbed from 6.8% (Week 48, 2023) to 17.5% (Week 52, 2023).
4. Hospitalization rates similarly rose, from 5.5 per 100,000 in Week 48, 2023, to 22.3 per 100,000 in Week 52, 2023, primarily driven by high-risk groups like adults aged 65+ years. The continued increase in hospitalizations underscores the growing severity of cases, which is consistent with the sustained high ILI occurrence afterward.
5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza, COVID-19, and RSV, significantly drove increased respiratory illness activity, as highlighted in all reports from Week 48–Week 52, 2023. This interplay created compounding effects on healthcare systems, fueling ongoing ILI cases into future weeks.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 2311 (Week 5, 2024) can be explained by the steady upward trend in ILI activity during Weeks 48–52, 2023, as evidenced by rising positivity rates, outpatient visits, and hospitalization rates. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses further sustained disease activity, resulting in the reported elevated ILI level after 5 weeks.
