1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating but slightly declining trend, with values of ['13379', '13307', '12757', '13026', '13095']. The highest occurrences were seen in Week14, 2023 (13379), followed by a slight decline by Week15, 2023 (13307), and a further reduction to 12757 in Week16, 2023. However, Weeks17–18, 2023 displayed minor increases to 13026 and 13095, respectively, suggesting stable yet decreasing activity over the 5 weeks.
2. A positive albeit delayed correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the future decrease to 10638 occurrences in Week23, 2023 correlates with the stabilization and slight rebound in Week17–18, 2023. The downward shift in Weeks14–16, 2023 appears to anticipate the eventual drop in ILI activity seen after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently below the baseline (2.5%), ranging from 2.1% in Week14, 2023 to a gradual decrease of 2.0% in Weeks17 and 18, 2023. This decline in ILI-related outpatient visits aligns closely with the drop in future reported ILI occurrences, highlighting a direct connection to lower respiratory illness activity.
4. Death percentages attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded the epidemic threshold but declined from 7.6% (Week14, 2023) to 6.9% in Week18, 2023. This steady decrease in PIC-related deaths reflects reduced severe respiratory illness cases, corresponding with the lower future ILI activity.
5. Low influenza positivity rates, which fluctuated from 1.0% in Week14, 2023 to 0.9% in Week18, 2023, indicated minimal viral activity despite co-circulation of other respiratory viruses. Combined with stable antiviral susceptibility and effective vaccine matches reported weekly, these factors helped mitigate increased ILI occurrence, contributing to the observed future decline.
6. In summary, the reported 10638 future ILI occurrences (Week23, 2023) can be attributed to the declining trend in Weeks14–16, 2023 before stabilization, reduced outpatient ILI visits, decreasing PIC-associated deaths, and low influenza positivity rates sustained throughout. These factors collectively pointed toward diminished overall respiratory illness activity.
