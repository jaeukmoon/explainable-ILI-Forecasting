1. The ILI occurrences from Week2, 2021 to Week6, 2021 showed a steady decline: 1259, 1042, 883, 812, and 684. This indicates a consistently decreasing trend, with no significant spikes or fluctuations, highlighting a sustained downturn in activity levels.
2. Forecasting target Week11, 2021 belongs to the off-season. The continuous decline in ILI occurrences, coupled with historically low influenza activity in Weeks2 to Week6, 2021, strongly aligns with the off-season pattern, as this timeframe is well past the peak season ending around Week6, 2021.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent decrease over the past five weeks, from 1259 to 684, implies a predictive downward momentum that stabilizes at low levels. Using historical patterns, projecting ahead five weeks to Week11, 2021 suggests minimal activity expected, resulting in the estimation of 607 occurrences.
4. Influenza activity in Weeks2 to Week6, 2021 remained exceptionally low, with positivity rates consistently at or below 0.1% nationwide (Week2, 2021 #1; Week4, 2021 #1; Week6, 2021 #1), and minimal jurisdictional activity (Week2, 2021 #13; Week6, 2021 #10).
5. Influenza positivity rates were dominated by Influenza B (~75-85% in clinical labs, Week3, 2021 #2; Week6, 2021 #2), but no significant outbreaks were detected. Hospitalization rates remained unusually low at 0.5-0.6 per 100,000 (Week2, 2021 #5; Week6, 2021 #5), the lowest in many years for this timeframe.
6. Healthcare-seeking behaviors and outpatient ILI visit data have been significantly impacted by COVID-19, likely leading to altered reporting trends (Week2, 2021 #9; Week6, 2021 #9). Despite uncertainties caused by the pandemic, no indications of dramatically rising activity were reported.
7. The continued decline in ILI occurrences, absence of notable influenza activity, consistent off-season context for Week11, 2021, and COVID-19 pandemic disruptions all justify the estimate of 607 ILI occurrences for Week11, 2021.
