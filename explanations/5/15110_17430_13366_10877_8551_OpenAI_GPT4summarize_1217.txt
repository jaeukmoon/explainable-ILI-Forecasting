1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a clear decreasing trend, with values of ['15110', '17430', '13366', '10877', '8551']. The peak value of 17430 occurred in Week 51, 2023, followed by a decline in the subsequent weeks, with a sharp drop to 8551 in Week 2, 2024. This trend signifies a reduction in ILI activity toward the end of the 5-week period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed. Despite the declining trajectory in the past data (Weeks 1–2, 2024), the future ILI occurrences surged to 11000 by Week 7, 2024. This indicates a potential reversal or resurgence of infections likely triggered by external factors as the 5-week gap progressed.
3. Influenza-related hospitalization and mortality trends during the previous 5 weeks contribute significantly to understanding the future rise. For instance, the cumulative hospitalization rate increased from 15.4 per 100,000 (Week 51, 2023) to 43.3 per 100,000 (Week 3, 2024), showing intense flu burden. Pediatric deaths also rose sharply in the same period, from a total of 20 in Week 51, 2023, to 57 by Week 3, 2024, signaling ongoing virus circulation.
4. The co-circulation of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 with other respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2, as noted in Week 2, 2024, further complicates ILI trends. This results in unpredictable activity spikes following stable or declining trends, as foreseen by potential post-holiday surges identified in Week 1, 2024.
5. Regional and subtype-specific flu activity influenced the resurgence in ILI. High positivity rates for Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in regions like 6, 8, and 3 (Weeks 2–3, 2024), alongside reduced outpatient ILI visits (from 6.9% in Week 52, 2023, to 4.3% in Week 3, 2024), suggest that underreporting or delayed responses contributed to the observed future increase to 11000.
6. In summary, the reported 11000 future ILI occurrences (Week 7, 2024) can be attributed to a resurgence despite the declining trend, driven by cumulative hospitalization burdens, co-circulation of pathogens, regional surges, delayed outpatient reporting, and predicted post-holiday trends amplifying undetected activity.
