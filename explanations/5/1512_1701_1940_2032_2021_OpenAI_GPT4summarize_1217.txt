1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited an overall upward trajectory, with numbers increasing from 1512 (Week9, 2022) to 1701 (Week10, 2022), 1940 (Week11, 2022), and peaking at 2032 (Week12, 2022), before slightly declining to 2021 (Week13, 2022). This demonstrates a general escalation in ILI activity over this period, despite a marginal dip in the last week.
2. A positive relationship is evident between past and future ILI occurrences, as the increasing trend in ILI activity observed in the past weeks aligns with the future surge to 2529 by Week18, 2022. The sustained high levels in Weeks 12 and 13 acted as a precursor to intensified respiratory illness activity in the subsequent weeks.
3. Rising outpatient visits for ILI, which grew from 1.6% (Week9, 2022) to 1.9% (Week13, 2022), suggest increasing healthcare encounters for respiratory illnesses, correlating with the eventual rise to 2529 ILI occurrences.
4. Hospitalization rates for influenza progressively increased, reaching 8.0 per 100,000 population by Week13, 2022, reflecting severe cases that parallel rising ILI trends.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, with SARS-CoV-2 coinfection rates reaching as high as 5.9% (Week9, 2022) and remaining a significant factor through Week13, underscores compounded illness severity and healthcare strain, driving ILI activity increases.
6. Persistent dominance of A(H3N2) influenza, with antigenic differences observed in over 90% of cases across Weeks 11–13, 2022, likely increased transmissibility, contributing to heightened cases.
7. In summary, the reported 2529 future ILI occurrences (Week18, 2022) are attributable to the consistent upward trend in ILI cases, increasing outpatient visits and hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and the impact of dominant A(H3N2) influenza strains.
