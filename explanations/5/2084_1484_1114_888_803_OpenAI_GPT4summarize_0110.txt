1. The ILI occurrences from Week3, 2022 to Week7, 2022 decrease steadily as follows: 2084 → 1484 → 1114 → 888 → 803. This shows a consistent declining trend over the past five weeks without any significant spikes or fluctuations.
2. In the U.S., Week12, 2022 falls outside the typical peak season, which generally ends by approximately Week6 of the year. Given the continued decline in ILI occurrences and minimal influenza activity reported in the CDC summaries (Week5, 2022 #3; Week6, 2022 #3; Week7, 2022 #4), Week12, 2022 aligns most closely with the off-season category.
3. The downward trajectory observed in the past five weeks suggests likely further reductions, albeit at a slower rate as the season moves deeper into the off-season. Based on time-series forecasting, this pattern of diminishing activity supports projecting a decreased count of 973 by Week12, 2022.
4. Key factors from CDC summaries influencing this forecast include:
5. Low vaccination rates compared to previous seasons, which may limit significant suppression of ILI activity but are offset by the decreasing trend (Week3, 2022 #5; Week4, 2022 #6; Week5, 2022 #8; Week7, 2022 #8).
6. (ii) Influenza A(H3N2) remains the dominant strain, but its proportions show no major escalation and remain consistent across weeks, coupled with stable antigenic similarities to vaccine strains (Week3, 2022 #1; Week5, 2022 #10; Week7, 2022 #7).
7. (iii) Overall low positivity rates for influenza specimens and a stable to slightly declining percentage of outpatient respiratory illness visits below baseline, indicative of reduced community transmission (Week3, 2022 #2; Week4, 2022 #3; Week6, 2022 #3).
5. Nationwide observations highlight that influenza-related hospitalizations, deaths, and positivity metrics remain low, reinforcing an off-season classification (Week4, 2022 #5; Week6, 2022 #4).
6. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory viruses continues but does not significantly elevate ILI activity, as seen in the minimal co-infections and sporadic influenza spread (Week3, 2022 #9; Week5, 2022 #7; Week7, 2022 #9).
7. The projected count of 973 for Week12, 2022 reflects the continued off-season decline in ILI activity, guided by past occurrences, current trends in decreasing positivity, low and sporadic flu activity, and the absence of significant destabilizing factors in the data.
