1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a general pattern of fluctuation with an upward trend toward the end. The data began at 1956 (Week13, 2021), rose to 2003 (Week14, 2021), peaked at 2066 (Week15, 2021), then slightly dipped to 1968 (Week16, 2021) but increased again to 2118 (Week17, 2021). This overall rising trajectory, especially from Week16 and Week17, reflects increasing activity near the end of the period, setting a basis for projected future occurrences.
2. A positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The increasing trend during Week16 and Week17, where occurrences rose from 1968 to 2118, aligns with the future occurrences of 1867 recorded after 5 weeks. The slight deceleration in trend likely reflects the interplay of multiple moderate factors rather than a sharp decline in ILI activity.
3. Stable outpatient visits for ILI at 1.1% of visits across Weeks13–17 remain below the national baseline of 2.6%; however, the consistent minimal ILI activity suggests limited growth, which correlates with the modest future occurrence of 1867.
4. Elevated PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) mortality rates observed between 11.4% in Week13, 2021, and 11.7% in Week17, 2021, consistently surpassing the epidemic threshold, underscored respiratory infections' sustained burden. Although primarily driven by COVID-19, this overlap in respiratory mortality is consistent with the stable yet persistent ILI activity contributing to future occurrences.
5. Reported low influenza positivity rates (0.1% across most weeks) and minimal hospitalization rates throughout this period reflect exceptionally low influenza-specific activity. However, persistent minor ILI detections and altered healthcare-seeking behaviors caused by the pandemic likely sustained background occurrences, leading to the eventual future figure of 1867 occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 1867 future ILI occurrences (5 weeks later) are attributable to the fluctuating yet upward trend in past ILI occurrences, consistently stable outpatient visits for ILI, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and sustained minor ILI activity driven by pandemic-related healthcare behaviors. These factors jointly moderated the notable yet contained ILI activity in future projections.
