1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend with values ['2066', '1968', '2118', '2022', '2012']. There was a decrease from 2066 (Week15, 2021) to 1968 (Week16, 2021), followed by an increase to 2118 (Week17, 2021). This was then succeeded by a decline to 2012 in Week19, 2021. The overall changes suggest a relatively stable but slightly fluctuating ILI trend during this period, without any substantial increase or decrease.
2. A weak correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the relatively stable and minor fluctuations observed during the past 5 weeks do not strongly predict the future surge to 2133 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week24, 2021). This indicates that the increase in future ILI occurrences might not be directly driven by the trends in the past occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at 1.1% during Weeks15–17, 2021, and slightly increased to 1.2% by Week18 and Week19, 2021. Although below the national baseline of 2.6%, this small rise may signal a subtle increase in ILI transmission contributing to the higher number of occurrences after 5 weeks.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, declining from 12.4% in Week15, 2021, to 10.1% in Week19, 2021. While driven primarily by COVID-19, such PIC mortality indicates sustained respiratory illness activity that could influence future ILI occurrences.
5. The irregular healthcare-seeking behaviors and altered data interpretation due to COVID-19, as reported across Weeks15–19, 2021, disrupted traditional surveillance systems. These disruptions might have led to delayed or concentrated reporting of ILI cases, contributing to the sharp rise to 2133 future occurrences.
6. Despite minimal influenza activity and low positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% positivity sustained in all 5 weeks), the interplay of COVID-19-associated healthcare dynamics and other non-influenza respiratory illnesses likely contributed to the future increase in ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2133 (Week24, 2021) can be attributed to a slight increase in outpatient ILI visits, sustained PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, COVID-19-driven healthcare disruptions, and contributions from non-specific respiratory illnesses despite continued minimal influenza activity. The increased ILI occurrences are only weakly correlated with the stable trend observed in the past data.
