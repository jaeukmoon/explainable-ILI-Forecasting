1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating yet elevated trend, with values of ['2096', '2181', '2531', '2443', '2529']. The highest peak was observed in Week 16, 2022, at 2531, after a steady increase from 2096 in Week 14, 2022. Though there was a slight dip in Week 17, 2022 (2443), the general trajectory suggests sustained high ILI activity during this period, which reflects a persistent burden of respiratory illnesses.

2. A positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is visible, as the sustained elevated levels in the past data (Weeks 14–18, 2022) transition into a marked reduction in the future ILI occurrences, reaching 1454 in Week 23, 2022. This reduction aligns with a possible tapering of ILI activity following the peak observed in Weeks 15 and 16, 2022, indicating a natural decline in influenza and respiratory illness as seasonal factors change.

3. Hospitalization rates steadily increased over the 5 weeks, from 8.9 per 100,000 in Week 14, 2022, to 13.4 per 100,000 in Week 18, 2022. The consistent rise in new influenza-related hospital admissions and cumulative rates (peaking at 3,243 and 3,071 in Week 15 and Week 18, respectively) likely reflect widespread circulation of Influenza A(H3N2). However, the stabilization or slight decrease toward Week 18 may signal the beginning of a declining trend.

4. Outpatient respiratory visits, while remaining below the national baseline, increased slightly from 2.0% in Week 14, 2022, to 2.3% by Week 18, 2022. This subtle rise in ILI-related visits aligns with the ongoing regional activity and co-circulation of respiratory viruses, creating an environment conducive to high ILI instances, though the eventual stabilization hints at a waning of movement.

5. The dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) (accounting for 99.2–99.9% of all positive influenza specimens) across Weeks 14–18, 2022, combined with its known antigenic mismatches to circulating vaccine strains, contributed to the high ILI occurrences during this period. Late-season trends, however, may have suppressed its impact by Week 23, 2022, resulting in reduced future ILI activity.

6. Mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) hovered above the epidemic threshold, ranging between 6.8% and 7.2%, across the 5 weeks. While primarily driven by COVID-19, the elevated PIC mortality represents a broader burden of respiratory illnesses. As COVID-19 mortality trends fluctuate, overall PIC dynamics could influence future reductions in ILI.

7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1454 in Week 23, 2022, are attributable to the initially elevated but stabilizing trends in past ILI occurrences, gradual declines in new hospitalizations and outpatient respiratory activity, the dominance of late-season A(H3N2) with decreasing vaccine efficacy, and moderating PIC mortality. These factors collectively signify the progression from the seasonal peak toward the conclusion of the influenza season.
