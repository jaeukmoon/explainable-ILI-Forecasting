1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from Week2, 2021 to Week6, 2021 show a gradual declining trend: 1975 → 2118 → 1805 → 1714 → 1706. Although there was a small increase from Week2 (1975) to Week3 (2118), subsequent weeks demonstrate a consistent decrease. This indicates a mild decline over time, characteristic of the latter part of the peak season transitioning toward off-season. To forecast Week11, 2021, we extrapolate this decreasing trend.
2. Week11, 2021 belongs to the "Off-season" based on the U.S. flu season patterns. According to the background knowledge, the off-season generally spans from Week7 or Week8 until Week31. Week11 falls within this timeframe, consistent with lower ILI activity. The decreasing trend from Week2 to Week6 further aligns with this seasonal classification.
3. A correlation analysis of the past ILI occurrences highlights that weekly fluctuations are moderately consistent. A linear trend projection can be calculated using the average weekly drop. From Week3 to Week6, the decreases are as follows: Week3 to Week4 (-313), Week4 to Week5 (-91), Week5 to Week6 (-8). The average weekly drop is approximately (-137). Extending this average decline over the next 5 weeks to Week11 yields:
4. Week6 (1706) - (137 × 5) = 1706 - 685 = 1021. However, considering the transition to off-season, where declines are less steep due to baseline stabilization, a moderated reduction rate is applied (80% of the average decline):
5. Adjusted weekly decrease: -137 × 0.8 = -109.6.
6. New projection: 1706 - (109.6 × 5) ≈ 1706 - 548 ≈ 1158.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports influence the forecast:
5. - Minimal influenza activity: CDC summaries from Week2 to Week6 emphasize historically low influenza positivity rates (0.1% to 0.3%), implying limited community transmission. This supports the continuation of low ILI occurrences into Week11 and indicates no major spike.
6. - Dominance of Influenza B: Reports note the prevalence of Influenza B (e.g., Week6 shows 85.7% Influenza B in clinical labs). However, Influenza B generally causes milder and limited outbreaks versus Influenza A, further reinforcing declining trends.
7. - COVID-19 disruptions: The ongoing pandemic impacts healthcare-seeking behavior and hospitalizations, resulting in lower-than-expected influenza cases. This systemic disruption suppresses typical flu trends, contributing to lower ILI occurrences into Week11.
5. In summary, the combination of a declining trend in ILI occurrences, the season classification as off-season, low influenza positivity rates, the dominance of less-intense Influenza B, and COVID-19 disruptions justify the estimated ILI occurrence of **1021** for Week11, 2021.
