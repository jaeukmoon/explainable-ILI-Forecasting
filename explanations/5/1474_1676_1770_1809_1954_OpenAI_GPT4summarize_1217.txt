1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent upward trend, starting from 1474 (Week16, 2022), followed by increases to 1676 (Week17, 2022), 1770 (Week18, 2022), 1809 (Week19, 2022), and peaking at 1954 (Week20, 2022). This steady rise suggests escalating ILI activity, with Week20, 2022, marking the period of highest occurrences in the time frame provided.
2. A clear correlation exists between the upward trajectory of past ILI occurrences and the future ILI occurrences recorded at 1543 (Week25, 2022). While a decline is reported after 5 weeks, the increase observed in Weeks19–20, 2022, likely reflects peak activity that subsequently tapers, correlating with the reduction in future ILI.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness showed consistent increases, climbing from 2.1% (Week16, 2022) to 2.4% (Week20, 2022). This steady rise in healthcare utilization aligns with the observed trends in past ILI occurrences and contributes as a potential driver for the future ILI count of 1543 (Week25, 2022).
4. Cumulative hospitalization rates saw a steady increase over the 5 weeks, rising from 11.1 per 100,000 (Week16, 2022) to 15.5 per 100,000 (Week20, 2022). Elevated hospitalizations underscore heightened influenza-related burden during this period, which may have influenced the later decrease to 1543 ILI occurrences after response and mitigation measures became effective post-peak.
5. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, rising from 6.8% (Week16, 2022) to 8.0% (Week20, 2022). This persistent PIC mortality indicates a high burden of respiratory illness that corresponds to the initial rise and eventual stabilization seen in the future ILI occurrences.
6. The CDC reports highlighted antigenic differences in circulating A(H3N2) viruses, potentially reducing vaccine effectiveness (Week18, 2022). Coupled with co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2), this may have exacerbated illness trends and contributed to the subsequent fluctuations in ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1543 (Week25, 2022) can be explained by the consistent upward trajectory in past ILI trends (Weeks16–20, 2022), increasing outpatient and hospitalization rates, persistent PIC mortality at epidemic levels, reduced vaccine match effectiveness, and co-circulation of respiratory viruses. These factors collectively reflect a natural peak and subsequent decline toward stabilization in ILI activity.
