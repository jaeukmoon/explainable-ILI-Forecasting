1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week8, 2021 to Week12, 2021) in Region 5 show a generally increasing trend. The reported values ['1013', '975', '949', '1099', '1213'] initially decline from Week8 (1013) to Week10 (949) but then steadily increase from Week10 (949) to Week12 (1213). This pattern suggests a recovery from a temporary dip, and the progression indicates that ILI activity is gaining momentum, likely linked to seasonal or external factors. The calculated weekly percentage change for the most recent 3-week increase (Week10 to Week12) is approximately 7.5% [(1213-949)/949]*100, signaling a moderate growth rate.
2. Season Classification: Week17, 2021 belongs to the Off-season based on the annual influenza cycle. The off-season typically spans after the peak season (ending near Week6) and before the peak onset season (starting near Week32 or later). Given Week17, 2021 falls within this interseasonal range, we expect ILI occurrences to remain below peak levels but could display sporadic increases due to transitioning dynamics and external influences during pandemic conditions.
3. Correlation analysis and forecasting process: Historical ILI trends demonstrate a moderate increasing trajectory between Week10, 2021 and Week12, 2021, with a 7.5% average growth rate per week. Assuming the trend persists, we project future occurrences using compounding growth over 5 weeks from Week12, 2021's value of '1213'. Applying the formula:
4. `Future ILI = Current ILI * (1 + growth rate)^weeks`,
5. we calculate:
6. `Future ILI = 1213 * (1 + 0.075)^5 ≈ 1558`.
7. This projection accounts for continued moderate growth consistent with recent patterns.
4. Influential factors from the CDC reports:
5. 1) CDC data indicates unusually low influenza positivity rates (0.1%) in Week8 through Week12, 2021, suggesting minimal baseline flu spread. However, slight increases in ILI trends in younger age groups (e.g., 0–4 years as noted in Week9 and Week12, 2021) signal localized activity, aligning with the moderate ILI increase in Region 5. This contributes to sustained growth without a sharp spike.
6. 2) The frequent mention of altered healthcare-seeking behavior throughout Weeks8–12, 2021, indicates reduced reporting and underestimation of actual ILI occurrences, likely amplifying observed growth in future surveillance reports. This distortion reflects delayed adjustments in data, supporting gradual increases like those modeled by a 7.5% growth rate.
7. 3) Week11, 2021 includes the identification of a novel influenza variant (Influenza A(H1N1)v), which, while not showing human-to-human transmission, hints at incremental changes in flu activity. Combined with possible increases noted by CDC for the coming months, this provides further rationale for steady future increases in ILI occurrences.
5. Summary: The final prediction of 1558 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week17, 2021) reflects a steady increase from Week12 (1213) based on a compounding growth rate of 7.5%, consistent with the observed upward trend in ILI occurrences from Week10 to Week12, 2021. The rise is supported by slight increases in pediatric ILI trends, lagging healthcare-seeking behaviors, and potential impacts of a novel influenza strain identified in Week11, 2021. Given Week17 is classified as the Off-season with moderate ILI activity, the calculation and supporting factors justify the projection.
