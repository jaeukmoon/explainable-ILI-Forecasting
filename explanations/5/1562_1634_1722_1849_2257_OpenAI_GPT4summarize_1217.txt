1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a steady and marked upward trend, progressing from 1562 (Week 33, 2024) to 1634 (Week 34, 2024), 1722 (Week 35, 2024), 1849 (Week 36, 2024), and eventually peaking at 2257 (Week 37, 2024). This consistent increase highlights accelerating ILI activity week-over-week, with a sharp rise in the latter weeks indicating amplified transmission or reporting dynamics.
2. A direct correlation between the past upward trajectory and the future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks is evident, as the continuous rise in Weeks 33–37, 2024, culminates in a significant surge to 3004 occurrences by Week 42, 2024. This sharp increase aligns well with the accelerating growth observed in the weeks leading to Week 37, demonstrating a predictive relationship between past and future trends.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI rose from 1.5% (Week 33, 2024) to 1.8% (Week 36, 2024) and remained stable through Week 37, 2024, indicating growing respiratory illness activity, particularly among the younger demographics (ages 0–24), which may explain escalating ILI counts. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2) likely contributed to this rise by compounding respiratory illness incidence. Pediatric influenza deaths, totaling 195 by Week 37, 2024, suggest a notable impact on younger populations, correlating with heightened ILI activity.
4. Stable antigenic matching between circulating influenza strains and vaccine components, combined with low antiviral resistance, ensured effective preventive strategies. However, the lack of significant vaccination uptake across reports may have curtailed the mitigation of ILI transmission, thereby exacerbating influenza spread and contributing to the reported increase in future ILI occurrences. Respiratory illness surveillance emphasized zoonotic spillover events and co-circulating novel influenza strains as potential factors elevating ILI risks.
5. In summary, the reported 3004 ILI occurrences in Week 42, 2024, are accounted for by the sharp upward trend in the past 5 weeks (Weeks 33–37, 2024), increasing outpatient visits for ILI, compounded co-circulating respiratory viruses, underwhelming vaccination impact, and heightened pediatric respiratory illness burdens. These factors collectively underscore the amplified ILI activity reflected in the future data.
