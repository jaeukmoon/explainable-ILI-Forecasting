1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1376', '1469', '1659', '1859', '2036']. This increase began at 1376 in Week 26, 2021, and steadily rose to 2036 in Week 30, 2021, highlighting escalating ILI activity throughout this period.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the continuous upward trend observed during the past 5 weeks (Weeks 26–30, 2021) aligns with the substantial increase to 2964 future occurrences after 5 weeks. This progressive rise in ILI activity in the latter weeks acts as a strong precursor for the amplified activity measured in the future.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed consistent incremental growth, increasing from 1.2% (Week 26, 2021) to 1.9% (Week 30, 2021). This growth reflects an expanding burden of respiratory illnesses, aligning with the subsequent rise to 2964 ILI occurrences.

4. PIC (Pneumonia, Influenza, or COVID-19) mortality remained consistently elevated, rising from 6.2% in Week 26 to 9.0% in Week 30, 2021, and continually surpassing epidemic thresholds. While primarily driven by COVID-19, these consistent increases in PIC-related mortality demonstrate a growing impact of respiratory illnesses, which correlates with future ILI surges.

5. The CDC highlighted changes in healthcare-seeking behavior throughout all 5 weeks, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, complicating traditional ILI surveillance. These disruptions likely delayed recognition of escalating ILI activity during the reporting period, leading to a concentrated rise visible in the future data.

6. Despite minimal influenza circulation reported across Weeks 26–30, 2021, increases in ILI likely reflect broader respiratory illness activity, potentially driven by non-specific illnesses or other pathogens. The gradual escalation in outpatient ILI visits aligns with behavioral and environmental factors contributing to the increase in future occurrences.

7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2964 can be attributed to the consistent upward trajectory of past ILI activity (Weeks 26–30, 2021), increasing outpatient ILI visits, persistently high PIC-related mortality, and the compounding effects of pandemic-driven healthcare-seeking and surveillance challenges.
