1. The ILI occurrences from Week5, 2024 to Week9, 2024 show a clear downward trend: Week5 (12,486), Week6 (12,895), Week7 (11,591), Week8 (11,037), and Week9 (10,736). Although Week6 showed a slight increase from Week5, the overall trajectory has been consistently declining. This suggests that influenza activity is subsiding gradually during this period.
2. Target week (Week14, 2024) belongs to the off-season. In the U.S., the off-season typically spans from after Week6 to the onset of the next peak season. The declining activity observed through Week9, 2024, along with reduced positivity rates and stabilizing hospitalization trends (Week9, 2024 #3, #13, #14), aligns with off-season patterns of minimal activity and reduced spread.
3. Based on historical patterns and time-series analysis, the consistent decline in ILI occurrences from Week5 to Week9, 2024 provides a basis for projecting reduced activity over the next five weeks. This aligns with the time-series forecasting model's smoothing of trends five weeks forward, accounting for the gradual tapering observed, leading to the prediction of 8,352 occurrences in Week14, 2024.
4. Elevated influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity decreases regionally, but Influenza B shows moderate increases in some regions (Week6, 2024 #10; Week8, 2024 #9, #11). The mixed patterns suggest ongoing transmission risk, though declining trends in positivity rates (Week5-9, 2024) indicate sustained but decreasing seasonal flu activity.
5. Outpatient ILI visits remain above baseline but show slight declines during this period (Week9, 2024 #3; Week8, 2024 #7), reflecting a gradual tapering of flu activity and fewer cases seeking medical attention. This ties into the prediction of reduced ILI activity by Week14.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, continue to complicate respiratory illness trends (Week8, 2024 #10; Week9, 2024 #10). However, influenza-specific indicators suggest stabilization rather than emerging risk factors that could drive spikes.
7. The projected ILI occurrence of 8,352 for Week14, 2024 is consistent with declining ILI trends, the classification of Week14 within the off-season, and stabilizing flu dynamics. Low co-circulation impacts, reduced outpatient ILI visits, and sustained vaccination recommendations further validate the anticipated tapering of influenza activity.
