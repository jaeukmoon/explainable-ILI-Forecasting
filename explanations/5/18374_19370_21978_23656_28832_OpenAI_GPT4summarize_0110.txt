1. The ILI occurrences from Week41, 2023 (18374) to Week45, 2023 (28832) show a steady and significant rise over these weeks. Beginning at a low value in Week41, 2023, counts increased progressively to 19370 in Week42, 21978 in Week43, 23656 in Week44, and 28832 in Week45. This consistent upward trajectory indicates growing transmission and intensifying influenza activity leading toward peak levels.
2. Week50, 2023 aligns with the peak season as it falls within the typical peak season in the U.S. (Week46 to approximately Week6 of the following year). Additionally, the continuous rise in ILI indicators and escalating flu activity leading up to Week45, 2023 reflects increased transmission, supporting the classification of Week50, 2023 as part of the peak season.
3. The observed rise in ILI occurrences from Week41 to Week45, 2023 establishes a clear upward time-series trend. With consistent week-over-week increases, projecting this trend forward suggests that occurrences will continue to climb for the next several weeks, reaching higher values. Therefore, based on this trajectory, the predicted value of 41554 at Week50, 2023 aligns with expected progression from the recent data.
4. The increasing influenza positivity rates across clinical labs (Week41, 2023: 1.3%; Week42, 2023: 1.7%; Week43, 2023: 1.9%; Week44, 2023: 3.0%; Week45, 2023: 4.0%) confirm a growing flu burden nationwide, directly contributing to rising ILI activity.
5. Outpatient visits for ILI are also steadily increasing and moved above the baseline in Week45, 2023 (2.3% in Week41; 2.5% in Week42; 2.7% in Week43; 2.9% in Week44; and 3.5% in Week45). The increase in outpatient visits is a robust predictor for further growth in ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (Week41, 2023 #9; Week42, 2023 #8; Week43, 2023 #7; Week44, 2023 #6; Week45, 2023 #10), coupled with flu, elevates the total respiratory disease burden, which amplifies observed ILI levels. Furthermore, regions reporting high activity (Week43, 2023 #9; Week44, 2023 #9; Week45, 2023 #3) indicate localized outbreaks contributing to the nationwide upward trend.
7. In conclusion, the marked increase in past ILI occurrences, the designation of Week50, 2023 as the peak season, and corroborative factors such as rising flu positivity rates, outpatient visits above baseline, co-circulating viruses, and regional activity spikes all justify and support the projected future occurrence of 41554 ILI cases for Week50, 2023.
