1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks (Week44, 2021 to Week48, 2021) in Region 1 are as follows: 1228, 1203, 1223, 1170, 1408. The trend shows a minor fluctuation with a slight upward momentum in Week48 (1408). Notably, after a small decrease between Week47 (1170) and Week46 (1223), ILI occurrences surged by approximately 20.3% in Week48, signaling a potential early phase of increased activity that often characterizes the start of Peak seasons. This increase emphasizes a potential rise towards the high transmission phase in the subsequent weeks.
2. Season Classification for Week1, 2022: Based on historical flu season knowledge, Week1, 2022 falls within the Peak season, which typically spans Week46 of the previous year to Week6 of the following year. Reports from Week48, 2021 highlight ILI activity reaching the national baseline (2.5%) coupled with increasing influenza positivity rates and outpatient visits for respiratory illness rising across most regions, strengthening this classification. Peak seasons are associated with widespread ILI transmission and rapidly increasing occurrences.
3. The historical trend of ILI occurrences combined with seasonal classification forecasts the value for Week1, 2022 as significantly increasing. To calculate the projected value, a weighted linear growth model is applied. The average value from the last five weeks is computed as:
4. (1228 + 1203 + 1223 + 1170 + 1408) / 5 = 1246.4 (baseline).
5. Observing a notable jump of (1408 - 1170 = 238) between Week47 and Week48, we account for an approximately 20% exponential growth rate. Applying this growth rate over 5 weeks:
6. Week48 value (1408) × (1 + 0.20 [growth rate])^5 ≈ 3033.
7. This reflects a mid-Peak season scenario characterized by high levels of ILI activity.
4. Correlation analysis between past trends and future occurrences indicates that the ILI uptick seen in Week48, 2021 aligns with similar historical upticks during Peak seasons. Weeks44–47 show stable-to-modest increases, typical of the transition from Peak onset to Peak season under influenza dynamics. Coupled with historical flu trends and anticipated seasonal impacts, the sharp rise in Week48 strongly suggests substantial transmission acceleration in the Peak season, culminating in Week1, 2022 projections of 3033.
5. Factors from the summarized CDC reports influencing ILI forecasting:
6. i. Gradually increasing influenza positivity rates among clinical specimens (from 0.3% in Week44 to 2.6% in Week48) suggest active flu spread, particularly of Influenza A(H3N2). This increase correlates with high transmission weeks during influenza Peak seasons.
7. ii. Region 1, alongside other regions, reported outpatient visits for ILI reaching or surpassing baseline activity (2.5%) by Week48, indicating a wider transmission phase typical of Peak season. With increasing ILI visits across all age groups, the respiratory illness trend likely reflects influenza's increasing impact.
8. iii. Lower vaccination uptake compared to the previous year (per Week48 report) diminishes the population's immunity level, amplifying transmission. With Influenza A(H3N2) dominating outbreaks and affecting younger age groups (5–24 predominantly), such dynamics exacerbate the upward trajectory.
6. Summary: The projected ILI occurrences for Week1, 2022 are 3033, reflecting an upward surge attributable to Peak season dynamics, sharp increases in ILI-related outpatient visits, and declining vaccination uptake amidst elevated influenza positivity rates. The quantitative analysis of historical trends alongside CDC-reported factors underscores this sharp rise, characterizing it as a Peak season phenomenon amidst spreading Influenza A(H3N2).
