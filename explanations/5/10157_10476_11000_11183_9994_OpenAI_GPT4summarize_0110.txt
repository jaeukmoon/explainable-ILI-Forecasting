1. The ILI occurrences from Week6 to Week10, 2024, show an overall fluctuating trend. Weekly counts were 10157, 10476, 11000, 11183, and 9994, respectively. A steady increase was observed from Week6 (10157) to Week9 (11183), followed by a significant decline in Week10 (9994). This reflects a fluctuating pattern with no consistent upward trajectory, suggesting a transition from elevated to declining activity in later weeks.
2. Week15, 2024, is part of the off-season period. Based on historical trends and background knowledge specific to the U.S., ILI activity typically decreases after the peak season (Week6) and remains at a reduced level until the next peak onset season in Week32 or later in the same year.
3. From a time-series perspective, the sharp decline in Week10 (9994) after prior fluctuations indicates that ILI occurrences are cooling off post-peak season. Extending this trend forward by five weeks into the off-season supports a projected reduction in ILI activity, correlating with the expected value of 5686 for Week15, 2024, consistent with diminishing flu activity in this phase.
4. Regional infection variability and co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV and SARS-CoV-2) continued to elevate respiratory illness trends nationally (Week6 #9, Week7 #9, Week10 #11). However, gradual declines in outpatient respiratory visits (Week9 #3, Week10 #4) and influenza-related hospitalizations (Week10 #6) indicate a lessening of severe ILI impacts.
5. The cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rate rose significantly through Week9 (64.8 per 100,000) but began stabilizing and declining by Week10 (67.9 per 100,000). This general stabilization highlights the subsiding intensity of the flu season (Week10 #5).
6. No novel influenza variants or significant antiviral resistance issues were detected, with antiviral susceptibility remaining high across circulating strains. Vaccination coverage continues to offer substantial protection, with vaccines effectively matching dominant strains (Week6 #8, Week9 #8, Week10 #8).
7. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrence of 5686 for Week15, 2024, is supported by the overall decline in activity trends after the peak season, the off-season timing, reduced hospitalization rates, and the protective effects of vaccination. These factors collectively align with the expected decrease and stabilization in influenza-like illness occurrences.
