1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating yet slight upward pattern, with values of ['1831', '2025', '1777', '1831', '1929']. The activity increased from 1831 (Week 19, 2021) to 2025 (Week 20, 2021), followed by a decline to 1777 (Week 21, 2021). Subsequently, a modest rise was observed in Weeks 22 and 23, reaching 1929. This trend reflects sustained low but slightly rising ILI activity toward the end of the 5-week period.  

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the increase toward the latter weeks (Weeks 22–23, 2021) appears to align with the rise to 2386 future occurrences 5 weeks later. The upward shift in the latter weeks suggests a potential build-up of ILI activity leading to the subsequent increase.  

3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below the national baseline of 2.6%, with a slight rise from 1.1% in Week 21, 2021, to 1.3% in Week 20 and stabilizing at 1.2% for Weeks 22–23. While small, these stable or rising percentages imply gradually increasing ILI activity, indirectly contributing to higher future occurrences.  

4. PIC mortality, consistently recorded above the epidemic threshold throughout the observed period, was 10.1% in Week 19 and decreased to 7.6% by Week 23, 2021. Though primarily attributed to COVID-19, this persistent PIC-related impact reflects increased respiratory illnesses in general, potentially linked to elevated future ILI data.  

5. The influence of COVID-19 on healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI surveillance methodologies, as documented in all weeks, disrupted traditional monitoring systems. Alternative healthcare approaches likely concentrated delayed or under-reported cases, amplifying the apparent jump to 2386 ILI occurrences in the future dataset.  

6. While influenza positivity rates and detection levels remained extremely low during the observed weeks, the identification of novel influenza variants (e.g., H1N2v, H3N2v) highlights the potential persistence of other pathogens or non-specific ILI contributors exacerbating respiratory illness trends.  

7. In summary, the rise to 2386 future ILI occurrences (Week 28, 2021) can be attributed to the slight upward trajectory in ILI occurrences during the latter weeks (Weeks 22–23, 2021), the stable percentage of outpatient visits for ILI, persistent PIC mortality above the epidemic threshold, disruptions in ILI surveillance systems, and ongoing respiratory illness trends influenced by pandemic-related healthcare changes and pathogen dynamics.
