1. The reported ILI counts from Week45 to Week49, 2020 are 1873, 2139, 2066, 2064, and 2078. The data shows an initial increase from Week45 (1873) to Week46 (2139), followed by a slight decline in Week47 (2066) and Week48 (2064). Interestingly, in Week49 (2078), a small rise is observed. This pattern reflects a slight upward trend from Week45 to Week46, stabilizing thereafter with minor fluctuations. Overall, it indicates no sharp growth or decline but demonstrates a level of steady activity.
2. Week1, 2021 falls within the peak season window in the U.S., which typically spans from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the following year. The combination of slightly stable trends (Week45 to Week49, 2020 #1) with nationwide reports of low but persistent influenza activity (Week45, 2020 #1; Week48, 2020 #10; Week49, 2020 #10) suggests that Week1, 2021 likely represents ongoing subdued flu activity within the broader peak season. Therefore, it is forecasted to belong to the peak season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the past ILI occurrences exhibit stabilization after a modest rise during Week45 to Week46, 2020, followed by minor fluctuations. Projecting forward to Week1, 2021, a slight increase is anticipated due to consistent low-level activity, aligning with the historical pattern of steady ILI occurrences during the late peak season. This leads to the forecasted ILI count of 2367.
4. Influenza positivity rates remain very low in clinical labs (0.2% in Week45, 2020 #1; Week47, 2020 #1; Week49, 2020 #1), indicating minimal transmission, yet consistent and ongoing detection of influenza viruses supports sustained low activity levels.
5. The influence of COVID-19 on healthcare-seeking behaviors, along with public health measures like masking and distancing, is noted to be impacting influenza spread and skewing ILI surveillance data (Week45, 2020 #9; Week46, 2020 #8; Week49, 2020 #9). These overlapping factors suggest lower-than-average flu transmission yet the sustained occurrence of respiratory illnesses.
6. Public health measures, combined with vaccination recommendations, indicate efforts to minimize severe flu outcomes (Week45, 2020 #8; Week46, 2020 #7; Week49, 2020 #7). Though the uptake trends are unclear, vaccination campaigns could be contributing to stable but moderate post-holiday transmission typically seen during peak weeks.
7. In summary, the forecast of 2367 ILI occurrences in Week1, 2021 is justified by the combined influence of historical trends reflecting stability and minor fluctuations, the alignment of the target week with the late peak season, minimal yet ongoing influenza virus circulation, and external impacts from public health measures and COVID-19. These factors collectively point to continued low but stable ILI activity.
