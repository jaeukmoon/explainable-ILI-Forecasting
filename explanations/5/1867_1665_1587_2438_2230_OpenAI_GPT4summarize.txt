1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited significant fluctuations, with values of ['1867', '1665', '1587', '2438', '2230']. A declining trend was observed from 1867 (Week 37, 2021) to 1587 (Week 39, 2021). However, there was a notable sharp increase to 2438 in Week 40, 2021, followed by a slight decline to 2230 in Week 41, 2021. This overall pattern reflects volatility but a substantial rise in ILI activity during the last two weeks of the observed period.

2. A positive relationship between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the sharp increase in Week 40 (2438) and sustained high value in Week 41 (2230) preceded the reported future surge to 2626 occurrences in Week 46, 2021. This upward shift in the latter part of the past data likely indicates growing respiratory illness activity, serving as a precursor to the higher future tally.

3. Several factors from the summarized CDC reports correlate with the increased future ILI occurrences:  
   - **Healthcare-seeking behavior changes:** Across Weeks 37–41, 2021, changes in care-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted as impacting ILI surveillance and reporting, potentially delaying recognition of cases and leading to a sudden surge in ILI data.  
   - **Increased PIC mortality:** Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, being 21.1% (Week 37), 20.9% (Week 38), 18.7% (Week 39), 18.0% (Week 40), and 17.5% (Week 41). This persistent excess indicates heightened respiratory illness burden, aligning with the rising future ILI occurrences.  
   - **Minimal influenza circulation and other respiratory viruses:** Despite low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% in Weeks 40 and 41) and limited virus spread, the reports attribute increasing outpatient respiratory illnesses to non-influenza pathogens, suggesting a broader driver for elevated ILI trends.  

4. In summary, the reported 2626 future ILI occurrences (Week 46, 2021) can be attributed to the sharp rise in Weeks 40–41, 2021; shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors that disrupted ILI surveillance; sustained high PIC mortality reflecting respiratory illness severity; and elevated contributions from non-specific respiratory pathogens in a period of low influenza circulation. These combined factors explain the observed increase in ILI activity.
