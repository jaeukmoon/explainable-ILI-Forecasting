1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the observed 5 weeks exhibited slight fluctuations with an overall stable pattern, with values ['1243', '1309', '1140', '1250', '1279']. There was an initial increase from 1243 (Week 37, 2021) to 1309 (Week 38, 2021), followed by a dip to 1140 (Week 39, 2021). The subsequent weeks showed a recovery and moderate rise, closing at 1279 (Week 41, 2021), indicating relatively stable and low-level ILI activity.
2. A clear correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the fluctuating but stable pattern seen toward the later weeks of the past data (Weeks 40–41, 2021) relates to the slight decline in future ILI occurrences to 1223 (Week 46, 2021). The modest stabilization in Weeks 40–41 likely contributes to the maintained low-level future occurrences.
3. Weekly outpatient visit percentages for ILI remained below the national baseline throughout Weeks 37–41, 2021, ranging from 2.1% (Week 37, 2021) to 1.8% (Week 41, 2021), with a steady decline across these weeks. This decline in healthcare-seeking behavior for ILI supports the reduced occurrences seen in future weeks.
4. Persistently high pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC)-associated mortality, significantly above epidemic thresholds in all weeks (e.g., 21.1% in Week 37, 18.0% in Week 40, and 17.5% in Week 41), driven mostly by COVID-19, indicates a shift in disease burden towards COVID-19 rather than influenza-specific ILI cases, potentially limiting future ILI increases.
5. Healthcare surveillance and reporting complexities, influenced by changes in healthcare-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, were consistently noted across all summarized reports. Such disruptions skew traditional ILI measurement reliability, reducing apparent ILI case detection despite circulating respiratory illnesses in Week 46, 2021.
6. The persistently low influenza positivity reported by clinical and public health labs (e.g., 0.1% positivity in Weeks 40–41) with no significant influenza activity nationwide highlights limited influenza-driven contributions to ILI, suggesting stable or declining occurrences based on non-specific respiratory illnesses driving low ILI levels in Week 46, 2021.
7. In summary, the reported 1223 future ILI occurrences (Week 46, 2021) are attributable to the stable trend in Weeks 40–41, declining outpatient visit proportions, persistently high PIC mortality dominated by COVID-19, and limited influenza activity. The compounded effects of pandemic-driven healthcare behavior changes further suppressed ILI case detection.
