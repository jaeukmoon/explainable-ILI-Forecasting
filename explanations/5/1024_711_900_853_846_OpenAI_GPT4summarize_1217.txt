1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1024', '711', '900', '853', '846']. The decline from 1024 in Week25, 2022 to 846 in Week29, 2022, with fluctuations such as the drop to 711 in Week26 followed by a rebound to 900 in Week27, indicates overall reducing influenza-like activity despite minor week-to-week variations.
2. The future occurrence of 1299 (Week34, 2022) demonstrates a positive correlation with past time-series data as the preceding decline appears to stabilize near the end (Weeks28-29, 2022). The leveling off in Weeks28-29 reflects a precursor to a subsequent rebound in ILI activity, aligning with the observed future peak. Historical trends suggest seasonal or external influences likely contributed to this resurgence.
3. Outpatient ILI visits remained relatively stable, accounting for 1.8% in Week25, 1.7% in Week26 and Week27, and 1.6% in Weeks28-29. These stable percentages, despite minor variations, indicate sustained ILI activity across multiple age groups, particularly children aged 0-4 years, who consistently exhibited the highest percentages (e.g., 7.4% in Week26, 6.5% in Week28). This subgroup's persistent activity may have contributed to the rise in future occurrences.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, increasing from 8.8% in Week26 to 9.8% in Week29, with COVID-19 as the primary driver. Although influenza-related mortality was minimal, this heightened PIC mortality reflects elevated respiratory illness pressure, indirectly aligning with the observed increase in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
5. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, as noted weekly (e.g., Weeks28-29, 2022), alongside altered healthcare-seeking behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic, disrupted traditional ILI monitoring. These disruptions may have delayed or underreported ILI occurrences during the observed weeks, culminating in the sharp rise to 1299 post 5 weeks as seasonal, behavioral, or surveillance factors resumed their influence.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1299 (Week34, 2022) can be attributed to the stabilization of decreasing trends at Weeks28-29, consistent ILI outpatient visits (notably in the 0-4 years age group), the persistent elevation of PIC-related mortality exceeding thresholds, and co-circulation of respiratory pathogens alongside pandemic-related surveillance disruptions. These factors collectively shaped the observed rebound in respiratory illness activity.
