1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall fluctuating trend, with values of ['17147', '16455', '15359', '15677', '16160']. The data started with a decrease from 17147 (Week35, 2023) to 16455 (Week36, 2023) and further declined to 15359 (Week37, 2023). This was followed by a slight rebound to 15677 (Week38, 2023) and 16160 (Week39, 2023). Although fluctuating, the gradual recovery in the last two weeks suggests a possible resurgence of ILI conditions.
2. A correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, with the slight upward trend in the last two weeks of reported past data (Week38–39, 2023) providing early indications of heightened activity. This aligns with the significant increase to 23656 occurrences reported after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient ILI visits accounted for 1.9%, 2.0%, 2.0%, 2.0%, and 2.1% during Week35–39, 2023, respectively. The incremental rise in outpatient visits for ILI, particularly driven by higher rates among children aged 0-4 years (e.g., 7.2% in Week35 and 7.1% in Week39), reflects a slow but steady increase in healthcare encounters for respiratory illnesses, contributing to the future surge.
4. Hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed influenza also rose progressively from 509 in Week35, 775 in Week36, 820 in Week37, 880 in Week38, to 1040 in Week39, 2023. This consistent increase in hospitalizations indicates a growing burden of severe respiratory illness, a key precursor to the future rise in ILI occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV) was noted in all five weeks, contributing to the ILI trend. Additionally, the proportion of deaths attributed to PIC exceeded epidemic thresholds, standing at 9.6%, 7.0%, 7.6%, 7.2%, and 7.3% in Week35–39, 2023, respectively. These sustained elevated levels highlight the complex interplay of circulating pathogens driving respiratory illness trends.
6. In summary, the reported 23656 future ILI occurrences (Week44, 2023) resulted from the observable recovery in ILI occurrences during Week38–39, 2023, the steady rise in outpatient visits, escalating hospitalizations, sustained PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and contributions from multiple co-circulating respiratory viruses during the period.
