1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the last 5 weeks exhibited a consistent decline, starting at 2001 (Week 13, 2023) and decreasing progressively each week to 1866 (Week 17, 2023). This downward trend suggests a reduction in respiratory illness activity during this period, with the lowest value recorded in Week 17, 2023.
2. Despite the declining trend in past data, the future ILI occurrence of 1246 (Week 22, 2023) represents a significant drop from the most recent past value of 1866 (Week 17, 2023). The lack of alignment between the downward past trend and the sharp decline to the future value points toward external contributing factors unrelated to the past ILI trajectory.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently measured below the national threshold, decreasing from 2.3% (Week 13, 2023) to 2.0% (Week 17, 2023). The sustained low levels and reduction in outpatient ILI visits correlate with the overall reduction in future ILI occurrences.
4. Hospitalization rates for influenza remained stable but low, increasing only slightly from 61.1 per 100,000 (Week 13, 2023) to 61.9 per 100,000 (Week 17, 2023). This stability in hospitalization rates, combined with low outpatient ILI visits and declining influenza positivity rates, supports expectations of reduced ILI cases in the future.
5. Continued low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.9% in Week 13, 2023, and 1.0% in Week 17, 2023) and the declining contribution of respiratory illnesses from influenza suggest that the low future ILI occurrence predominantly reflects non-influenza-related respiratory illnesses or other co-circulating viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 1246 (Week 22, 2023) is primarily attributed to the consistent downward trend in past ILI occurrences, reduced outpatient ILI visits, stable yet low hospitalization rates, minimal influenza activity, and contributions from co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors collectively contribute to the observed significant decline in future occurrences.
