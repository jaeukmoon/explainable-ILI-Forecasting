1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a pronounced and consistent upward trajectory, starting at 12532 (Week 15, 2022) and steadily increasing to 18790 (Week 19, 2022). The most significant weekly jump occurred between Week 18 and Week 19, with an increase of 2994. This sustained escalation indicates intensifying ILI activity over the given period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences. The continued rise in ILI cases over Weeks 15-19, 2022, culminates in significantly high numbers by Week 24, 2022, where future occurrences reached 17486. The high value reflects the cumulative impact of the earlier upward trend.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses showed an incremental rise, from 2.1% in Week 15 to 2.4% in Week 19, 2022, which, though below baseline, indicated a gradual increase in respiratory disease activity contributing directly to the future rise.
4. Weekly recorded influenza-associated hospitalizations remained elevated, with cumulative rates climbing from 9.8 per 100,000 in Week 15 to 14.4 per 100,000 in Week 19, 2022, and weekly admissions increasing slightly, maintaining national pressure on healthcare resources and spreading ILI.
5. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, rising from 7.1% in Week 15 to 7.5% in Week 19, 2022, showing heightened respiratory illness outcomes consistent with increasing ILI occurrences.
6. The dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), accounting for nearly 99% of subtyped influenza cases each week, combined with its antigenic differences from vaccine viruses, contributed to reduced immunity and increased susceptibility within the population, exacerbating future ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the 17486 ILI occurrences observed in Week 24, 2022, resulted from the upward trend in ILI activity in Weeks 15–19, increasing respiratory illness outpatient visits and hospitalizations, persistent PIC mortality above the threshold, and diminished vaccine effectiveness against A(H3N2).
