1. The reported ILI counts from Week28 to Week32, 2021, are 1331, 1372, 1609, 1910, and 1936. The trend demonstrates a substantial and consistent increase across these weeks, with no fluctuations or plateaus. This trajectory reflects rising levels of respiratory illness activity, potentially influenced by both seasonal shifts and external factors.
2. Week37, 2021, fits within the Peak Onset season, as it occurs shortly after Week32, 2021, which aligns with the gradual increase in ILI activity typically observed during this period. Rising outpatient respiratory illness visits (Week32, 2021 #3) and virologic activity trends support this classification.
3. From the time-series perspective, the observed increasing trend suggests that ILI occurrences will likely continue to rise moderately in the coming weeks. Given Week32's high value of 1936 and the steady incremental increases over five weeks, a projection of 1867 for Week37 reflects a stabilization rather than further steep growth, influenced by expected seasonal smoothing during the peak onset period.
4. ILI occurrences increased across all age groups over recent weeks (Week29, 2021 #2; Week32, 2021 #3), particularly among younger age groups, likely contributing to sustained respiratory spread.
5. The presence of novel Influenza A(H1N2)v cases in Week32, 2021 (Week32, 2021 #2) underscores emerging risks but does not yet indicate widespread transmission potential. Any localized impact may still shift broader trends slightly.
6. Minimal influenza activity remains dominant in virologic surveillance (Week30, 2021 #7; Week32, 2021 #7), but the increasing outpatient respiratory illness visits are strongly influenced by the co-circulation of non-influenza respiratory illnesses such as SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens (Week30, 2021 #7; Week32, 2021 #10).
7. The gradual rise in ILI outpatient visits (Week29, 2021 #1; Week31, 2021 #2) aligns with increasing overall respiratory illness activity, marking a transition toward more active ILI circulation. Hence, projecting Week37, 2021 occurrences as 1867 represents a stabilization amidst upward trajectories influenced by seasonal activity, non-influenza illnesses, and age group dynamics.
