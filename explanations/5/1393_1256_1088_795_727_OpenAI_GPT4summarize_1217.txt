1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a steady and significant downward trend, with values decreasing from 1393 (Week15, 2024) to 727 (Week19, 2024). Each week showed a consistent reduction in cases, highlighting a continuous decline in ILI activity over this period. This reflects the diminishing prevalence of influenza-like illness during these weeks.
2. A negative correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences. The declining trend in ILI activity during the 5-week period (Weeks 15–19, 2024) directly aligns with the low future occurrences of 430 (Week24, 2024). This reduction indicates that the persistent downward trend in the previous weeks sets a foundation for the very low ILI activity in the future.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently decreased over 5 weeks, from 2.5% (Week15, 2024) to 2.0% (Week19, 2024), falling below the national baseline for six consecutive weeks. This decline in healthcare visits for respiratory illnesses prominently signifies the reduced burden of ILI, contributing to lower future occurrences.
4. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza dropped substantially, from 5.9% (Week15, 2024) to 2.4% (Week19, 2024). This marked reduction in influenza positivity rates aligns with the declining ILI activity and indicates a low future occurrence of ILI cases.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including RSV and COVID-19, reported in all weeks, likely influenced the decreasing ILI trends by diverging healthcare resources and focus from flu-related encounters. This interplay may have reduced flu reporting and reduced overall ILI prevalence, resulting in lower future occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 430 future ILI occurrences (Week24, 2024) can be attributed to a consistent downward trend in past ILI occurrences, declining outpatient ILI visits and influenza positivity rates, and the diluting impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses, collectively driving very low flu activity after 5 weeks.
