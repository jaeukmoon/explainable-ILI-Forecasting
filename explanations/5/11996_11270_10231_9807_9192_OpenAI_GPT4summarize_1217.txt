1. The past time-series ILI occurrences showed a consistent downward trend over the 5 weeks, with values of ['11996', '11270', '10231', '9807', '9192']. This decrease begins with 11996 in Week22, 2024, dropping steadily to 9192 by Week26, 2024. The consistent decline suggests reduced ILI activity across this period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the persistent decline during Week22 to Week26, 2024, aligns with the lower reported future ILI occurrence of 7139 by Week31, 2024. The consistent decline underscored a notable decrease in ILI activity observed in the subsequent 5-week period.
3. National influenza activity remained low during the 5 weeks, with positivity rates in clinical labs decreasing gradually from 1.8% (Week22, 2024) to 1.0% (Week26, 2024). This low and declining positivity reflects reduced viral spread, contributing to the drop in ILI occurrences. Low hospitalization rates showed stability, varying between 0.1 to 0.2 per 100,000 population from Week22 to Week26, 2024, indicating persistently minimal severe influenza-related illnesses, which aligns with the observed decline in future ILI activity. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness consistently decreased, from 1.9% in Week22, 2024, to 1.4% in Week26, 2024, remaining below baseline throughout. This trend of reduced clinical encounters aligns with the downward trajectory in future occurrences.
4. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, persisted across the 5 weeks. However, the stable or declining trends in these viral activities likely contributed to the reduction in ILI occurrences. Additionally, high vaccine-virus match for circulating influenza strains helped manage activity levels, reducing subsequent occurrences and achieving more controlled outcomes.
5. In summary, the reported 7139 future ILI occurrences (Week31, 2024) can be attributed to the steady decline in ILI occurrences from Week22 to Week26, 2024, minimal influenza lab positivity and hospitalization rates, ongoing low outpatient visit percentages, and controlled co-circulation of respiratory viruses with effective vaccine coverage. These factors collectively drove the sustained downward trend in ILI activity.
