1. The ILI occurrences from Week11 to Week15, 2021 show a consistent increasing trend: 1673, 1893, 1956, 2003, and 2066. This persistent rise without fluctuation or decline indicates gradual growth in ILI activity, albeit at relatively low levels. This suggests an increasing but slow-moving trend forward into subsequent weeks.
2. Based on U.S. influenza seasonality patterns, the target week (Week20, 2021) falls outside the typical peak period (Week46 to Week6) and aligns with the off-season phase, when influenza activity generally remains low to minimal.
3. Correlation analysis of the time-series data highlights a clear upward trajectory in ILI counts, with consistent week-over-week increases. Extrapolating this trend five weeks forward, a slow rise is inferred, predicting future occurrences to increase modestly, culminating at 2114 by Week20, 2021. This projection aligns with the continuous but gradual upward direction of past trends.
4. Confirmed influenza activity remains significantly low nationwide, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza across clinical labs during Week11 to Week15, 2021 (Week11, 2021 #1; Week13, 2021 #1; Week15, 2021 #1). This low positivity discourages the possibility of a sudden spike.
5. There are no major surges in hospitalization rates (only 0.7 to 0.8 per 100,000) (Week11, 2021 #5; Week15, 2021 #4) or influenza-attributable deaths (Week11, 2021 #6; Week15, 2021 #5). Coupled with low outpatient ILI visits remaining stable under 2.6% during this time (Week11, 2021 #4; Week15, 2021 #6), overall community-level transmission appears limited but gently rising.
6. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and overlapping COVID-19 symptoms (Week11, 2021 #9; Week13, 2021 #8; Week15, 2021 #8) have continued to influence reduced ILI reporting. This impact is expected to persist, moderating the rate of increase in reported occurrences.
7. In summary, the persistent upward trend in past ILI occurrences, alignment of Week20, 2021 with the off-season, and the minimal but stable virologic and hospitalization data collectively forecast a modest increase to 2114 ILI occurrences by Week20, 2021, reflecting continued low but slowly rising activity levels during this off-season phase.
