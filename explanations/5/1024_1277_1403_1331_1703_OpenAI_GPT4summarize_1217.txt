1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall upward trend, with values of ['1024', '1277', '1403', '1331', '1703'] from Week44 to Week48, 2023. The trend started with 1024 in Week44, rose significantly to 1277 in Week45, and peaked at 1703 by Week48, despite a slight dip between Week46 (1403) and Week47 (1331). This upward trajectory indicates escalating ILI activity toward the end of the 5-week period.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 2287 aligns positively with the overall increasing trend observed in the past weeks. The pronounced rise from 1277 in Week45 to 1703 in Week48 suggests a momentum in ILI growth, with Week48 activity serving as a precursor to the elevated future levels by Week53, 2023.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily increased across the past weeks, from 2.9% in Week44, 2023, to 4.0% in Week48, 2023. This consistent rise above the baseline underscores higher respiratory illness activity and directly correlates with the increase in ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza positivity rates climbed from 3.0% in Week44 to 6.8% in Week48, with Influenza A being the predominant subtype. Such escalations in viral positivity directly reflect heightened ILI trends and are likely a significant driver of the future rise.
5. The increasing hospitalization rates, from 1.2 per 100,000 in Week44 to 5.5 per 100,000 in Week48, along with the highest impact on adults aged 65+ years, indicate worsening severe cases that correlate with the broader rise in ILI activity. Furthermore, co-circulation of respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 compounded respiratory illness activity.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence of 2287 (Week53, 2023) is attributable to the upward trajectory of past ILI occurrences, rising outpatient visit rates, increasing influenza positivity trends, elevated hospitalization rates, and the compounding effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses. Together, these factors align to explain the continued rise in ILI activity.
