1. The reported ILI counts from Week31 to Week35, 2021 are 1910, 1936, 2164, 2131, and 2388. The trend indicates a steady increase over the five weeks, with a notable rise in Week34 (2131 to 2388). This upward progression suggests growing ILI activity over the observed period, driven by respiratory illnesses other than influenza.
2. Forecasting target week (Week40, 2021) belongs to Peak onset season. Given the timeline, Week40 aligns with the transitional period leading up to the typical U.S. influenza peak season, and the gradual ILI rise coupled with sporadic novel influenza A detections and respiratory virus co-circulation indicates increasing activity during the Peak onset season.
3. Based on the time-series trends, the consistent rise in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks suggests a forward projection for further escalation. From Week31 to Week35, the average weekly increase was 119.5 cases, implying a potential continuation of this growth trajectory. Thus, Week40, 2021's ILI forecast of 2438 aligns reasonably within this growth pattern.
4. Minimal influenza activity was reported nationally (Week31, 2021 #1; Week32, 2021 #1; Week33, 2021 #1), with increases attributed to non-influenza respiratory viruses, representing a major contribution to the ILI rise through Week35.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior shifted due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Week31, 2021 #8; Week32, 2021 #8; Week34, 2021 #8), causing both overreporting and underreporting in ILI surveillance, slightly inflating activity trends.
6. Future flu activity may increase due to rising co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and novel respiratory pathogens (Week32, 2021 #9; Week34, 2021 #4; Week35, 2021 #9). The emergence of two human infections from novel influenza variant A(H1N2)v in Week32 is an early warning signal of novel influenza activity potentially contributing to the increase in Week40.
7. In summary, the ILI forecast of 2438 in Week40, 2021 is justified by the steady rise in ILI counts (1910 to 2388) demonstrated over the past five weeks, the alignment of Week40 with the Peak onset season, and the influence of COVID-19, other respiratory viruses, and novel influenza detections contributing to elevated activity levels.
