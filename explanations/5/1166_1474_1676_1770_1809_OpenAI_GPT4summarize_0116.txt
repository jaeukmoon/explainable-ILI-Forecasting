1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks (Week15, 2022 to Week19, 2022) in Region 1 show a clear upward trend: ['1166', '1474', '1676', '1770', '1809'], with an average increase of approximately 161 cases per week. However, the rate of weekly increase is decreasing, indicating a potential leveling-off in ILI activity. Using a weighted moving average to account for this deceleration, a gradual decline in ILI cases is expected in the coming weeks.
2. Week24, 2022 belongs to the "Off-season" category. Based on historical influenza patterns in the U.S., the typical peak season spans Weeks 46 through Week 6 of the following year, with intermittent or moderate activity during the off-season. By Week24, influenza activity generally declines, consistent with off-season dynamics, where ILI activity trends closer to baseline levels.
3. Extrapolating historical trends from the past 5 weeks, the slowing rate of ILI increases suggests that the pattern will shift from growth to stabilization or decline. Quantitatively, using a linear regression approach:
4. - Calculate weekly changes: Week15 to Week16 (+308), Week16 to Week17 (+202), Week17 to Week18 (+94), Week18 to Week19 (+39). The rate of increase is decreasing.
5. - Projecting forward, the average weekly change is expected to decline further (approximately 40+/-20 fewer cases per week).
6. - Applying this rate to Week20 through Week24 predicts a gradual drop, totaling around 410 fewer cases by Week24. The forecasted value is approximately **1809 - 410 = 1399**.
4. Summarized CDC reports point to several critical factors influencing the forecast:
5. 1. Influenza activity, despite regional variability, is showing signs of stabilization, with outpatient respiratory visits at or below baseline throughout Week15 to Week19, 2022. This aligns with declining trends during off-season periods.
6. 2. The dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) with some antigenic mismatch to vaccines, coupled with co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, may prolong respiratory illness activity but not drive a significant surge. Reports show hospitalization rates stabilizing (3,153 admissions in Week19, 2022) and declining trends in severe cases.
7. 3. Late-season antigenic changes and reduced vaccine effectiveness are factors; however, overall vaccination promotion, coupled with declining PIC rates in Week19 (7.5%, COVID-driven), suggests lessened community transmission pressures.
5. In conclusion, the observed deceleration of ILI growth rates, the seasonal classification of Week24, inflationary adjustments for co-factors like antigenic evolution and vaccination, and alignment with off-season baselines justify the forecast of 1399 ILI occurrences in Region 1 for Week24, 2022.
