1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1399', '1543', '1196', '1122', '898']. There was a peak at 1543 (Week24, 2022), followed by a sharp decline through the subsequent weeks, reaching the lowest value of 898 in Week28, 2022. This trend indicates a lessening of ILI activity over the period.
2. A strong correlation between decreasing past ILI occurrences and the reported future ILI occurrences of 661 (Week33, 2022) is apparent. The sustained decline in Weeks26–28, 2022, aligns with the significant drop to 661 five weeks later, continuing the observed downward trajectory.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI decreased from 1.9% (Week24, 2022) to 1.6% (Week28, 2022), remaining below the national baseline. The reduction in healthcare visits consistently mirrors the drop in ILI occurrences, highlighting a pattern correlating with the future decline to 661 in Week33, 2022.
4. Lab positivity for influenza also decreased steadily, dropping from 2.5% (Week24, 2022) to 0.7% (Week28, 2022), with minimal changes in dominant strains or reported hospitalizations, reflecting overall lower ILI activity. This coincides with the reduced future ILI occurrences of 661.
5. The co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, and altered healthcare-seeking behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic introduced substantial variability and challenges in accurately assessing pure influenza-related trends. This likely contributed to the reduction and stabilization at the lower future level of 661 occurrences in Week33, 2022.
6. Minimal influenza activity across jurisdictions was reported throughout the 5-week period, with an increase to 48 jurisdictions reporting minimal levels in Week28, 2022. This broad geographic reduction in ILI intensity aligns closely with the decline to 661 future occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 661 future ILI occurrences (Week33, 2022) are explained by the consistent decline in past ILI occurrences, decreased outpatient ILI visits, reduced influenza activity (positivity and hospitalizations), and pandemic-related disruptions impacting surveillance. These factors collectively contributed to the observed decrease over time.
