1. The reported ILI counts from Week42 to Week46, 2020 are 1484, 1623, 1558, 1873, and 2139. The overall trend demonstrates a consistent and gradual increase over the five weeks, marking a steady upward trajectory from Week42 to Week46. Notably, Week46 shows a significant rise in cases at 2139, suggesting an escalation in ILI activity as the peak onset season progresses.
2. Based on U.S. influenza activity patterns, Week46, 2020 falls within the typical peak onset season in the United States. This period spans from Week35 to Week46. Consequently, the target forecast week (None) occurs in the immediate transition toward peak season, likely aligning with the start of heightened ILI activity.
3. The time-series data indicates a clear upward trend, with ILI activity growing by approximately 43% from Week42 to Week46 (1484 to 2139). Projecting this trajectory for five weeks ahead using a time-series forecasting approach suggests continued growth, though at a potentially moderated rate, resulting in forecasted ILI occurrences of 1994 by the target week.
4. CDC reports consistently show low influenza positivity in respiratory specimens (Week42 to Week46, 2020 #1). However, ILI visits have gradually increased from 1.2% to 1.5% nationally (Week42, 2020 #4; Week43, 2020 #4; Week44, 2020 #4; Week45, 2020 #4; Week46, 2020 #3), signaling heightened healthcare-seeking for respiratory symptoms. This aligns with the rising ILI trend.
5. Deaths attributable to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remain significantly above the epidemic threshold, increasing from 7.6% to 10.7% between Week42 and Week46 (Week42, 2020 #6; Week43, 2020 #6; Week44, 2020 #6; Week45, 2020 #6; Week46, 2020 #4). COVID-19 co-circulation likely amplifies respiratory illness surveillance figures, indirectly boosting ILI cases.
6. Vaccination promotion remains emphasized as flu activity begins to climb (Week42, 2020 #8; Week43, 2020 #8; Week44, 2020 #8; Week45, 2020 #8; Week46, 2020 #7). However, no significant shifts in vaccination uptake or trends are evident, potentially allowing influenza to propagate further, contributing to future ILI increases.
7. The steady upward ILI trend, the context of peak onset season transitioning to peak season, increasing healthcare visits, limited yet growing virologic detections, and the overlapping burden of COVID-19 justify forecasting 1994 ILI occurrences for the target week. This aligns with historical patterns of activity escalation during this seasonal window.
