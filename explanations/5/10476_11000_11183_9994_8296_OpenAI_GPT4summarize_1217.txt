1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but overall declining trend, with values of ['10476', '11000', '11183', '9994', '8296']. Weeks 7–9, 2024, demonstrated initial increases from 10476 (Week7, 2024) to a peak of 11183 (Week9, 2024), followed by steep declines in Week10 (9994) and Week11 (8296). This pattern highlights a sharp drop in ILI activity during the latter weeks of this period.
2. A negative correlation is evident between the past and future ILI occurrences. The significant decline in ILI activity in Weeks 10–11, 2024, aligns with the further decrease to 4962 after 5 weeks (Week16, 2024). The decreasing trend during the past weeks serves as a precursor to the low level of future ILI occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed consistent declines from 4.5% (Week7, 2024) to 3.4% (Week11, 2024), signaling a reduction in healthcare-seeking behaviors for ILI symptoms. As this trend persisted, it reinforced the decrease in future ILI occurrences (4962, Week16, 2024).
4. Respiratory specimen positivity for influenza dropped from 15.4% (Week10, 2024) to 12.0% (Week11, 2024), indicating waning influenza circulation. This decline contributed significantly to the lower ILI count observed in Week16, 2024.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, particularly RSV and SARS-CoV-2, remained a factor. However, as the CDC highlighted decreasing flu positivity and the seasonal waning of respiratory illnesses by Week11, 2024, the influence of these additional pathogens on ILI occurrences lessened, aligning with the low count after 5 weeks (4962, Week16, 2024).
6. The impact of regional differences, evidenced by decreases in flu activity in most regions in Week11, 2024, suggests broader reductions in ILI cases nationally. These localized improvements compounded to produce the overall decline observed in Week16, 2024.
7. In summary, the reported 4962 future ILI occurrences (Week16, 2024) are driven by the declining trend in ILI activity during Weeks 10–11, 2024, reductions in outpatient ILI visits, decreasing influenza positivity rates, waning influence of co-circulating viruses, and regional declines in ILI activity.
