1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week7 to Week11, 2021 showed a steady increase: 1481, 1519, 1517, 1585, and 1673. This upward trajectory indicates consistent growth week by week, suggesting a rising trend in ILI activity during this period, although the levels remain below historical baselines.
2. Based on U.S. seasonal patterns, Week16, 2021 is consistent with the off-season. Influenza activity remains historically low for the time of year (Week7, 2021 #1; Week8, 2021 #6; Week9, 2021 #11; Week10, 2021 #1; Week11, 2021 #1), and there is no marked evidence suggesting a shift to peak onset or peak season as of Week11, 2021. Therefore, Week16, 2021 is forecasted to belong to the off-season.
3. The time-series data from Week7 to Week11, 2021 exhibits consistent increases in ILI counts, though at low absolute levels. Projecting five weeks forward using this steady growth suggests a continuation of this pattern but with potential stabilization, as no sharp surges are indicated in the data. Thus, an ILI forecast of 1968 for Week16, 2021 aligns with maintaining the observed upward trend.
4. Surveillance data reported nationwide influenza positivity at 0.1% across Weeks7–11, 2021 (Week7, 2021 #1; Week8, 2021 #1; Week9, 2021 #1; Week10, 2021 #1; Week11, 2021 #1), with minimal activity and few positive specimens identified. This low positivity contributes to moderating ILI occurrences, despite the increment over time.
5. COVID-19 remains the dominant factor in deaths attributed to PIC, and influenza-specific activity continues at historic lows (Week7, 2021 #6; Week8, 2021 #7; Week9, 2021 #6; Week10, 2021 #5; Week11, 2021 #6). These conditions limit any dramatic increase in influenza-associated ILI levels.
6. Vaccine promotion remains consistent, but detailed vaccination data trends are limited from Weeks7–11, 2021 (Week7, 2021 #8; Week8, 2021 #9; Week10, 2021 #7; Week11, 2021 #10). Low influenza activity and sustained vaccination efforts are expected to continue mitigating severe influenza impacts, contributing to stable ILI projections.
7. The forecast for Week16, 2021 at 1968 ILI occurrences reflects the observed gradual rise in ILI counts, low influenza positivity, consistent off-season classification, and external suppressive factors such as COVID-19 dominance and vaccination effects. Together, they support a scenario of modest growth within off-season ILI activity for this period.
