1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but overall downward trend, with values of ['13366' (Week 1, 2024), '10877' (Week 2, 2024), '8551' (Week 3, 2024), '9246' (Week 4, 2024), '9072' (Week 5, 2024)]. There was a sharp decline from 13366 in Week 1 to 8551 in Week 3, followed by a slight rebound to 9246 in Week 4 and a small dip to 9072 in Week 5. This pattern reflects a decrease in ILI activity overall, with only a modest increase during Week 4.
2. A weakly positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the moderate rebound in Weeks 4 and 5 (9246 and 9072, respectively) fails to fully reverse the larger decline observed from Week 1–3, 2024, but nonetheless aligns with the modest subsequent increase to 9994 future occurrences reported after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained above the baseline but showed a decreasing trend from 5.7% in Week 1 to 4.3% in Weeks 3 and 4, followed by a slight rise to 4.4% in Week 5, 2024. Although these percentages consistently indicated elevated flu activity, their overall reductions likely contributed to reduced ILI activity until Week 4. However, the small increase in Week 5 could partially account for the slight elevation in future ILI occurrences.
4. Cumulative hospitalization rates due to influenza slightly increased weekly, from 31.7 per 100,000 in Week 1 to 51.5 per 100,000 in Week 5. While linked hospitalizations tracked a rise during Weeks 1–2, subsequent stability and a marginal drop by Week 5 suggest a moderating overall trend, likely influencing the observed future ILI values.
5. The CDC’s warnings of a potential second peak in flu activity following the holiday period, along with ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory illnesses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2, likely complicated ILI patterns and led to an eventual rise in ILI occurrences to 9994 after 5 weeks. Regional variation in activity increases, especially noticeable in regions 5, 6, and 7, may have contributed to variations in transmission patterns and further emphasized the observed future rise.
6. In summary, the reported 9994 future ILI occurrences (after Week 5, 2024) can be attributed to the slight rebound in ILI activity during Weeks 4 and 5 (2024), the consistently high hospitalization rates for influenza, the CDC's forecasted second peak following holidays, and the compounding complexity introduced by the co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses. These factors collectively explain the moderate level of future ILI occurrences observed.
