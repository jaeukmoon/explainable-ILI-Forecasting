1. The past time-series ILI occurrences displayed a consistent upward trend over the 5 weeks, starting from 11626 (Week 31, 2022) and steadily climbing to 15856 (Week 35, 2022). The increase from Week 31 to Week 35 was notable, with a total rise of 4230 occurrences, demonstrating escalating respiratory illness activity during this time period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The steadily increasing trend in ILI occurrences from Week 31–Week 35, 2022, aligns with the reported spike to 18479 future occurrences (Week 40, 2022). This sustained growth in prior weeks serves as a precursor to the significant increase observed after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently rose during the 5 weeks, from 1.5% in Week 31 to 1.9% in Week 35, 2022, with higher rates particularly among children aged 0-4 (6.1% in Week 31 to 7.2% in Week 35). These increases in ILI healthcare visits reflect a broader surge in respiratory illness activity, which likely contributed to the future rise in ILI occurrences.
4. Hospitalizations due to influenza also trended upward, from 506 in Week 31 to 509 in Week 35, 2022. While this increase appears slight, it reflects underlying intensification in flu-related severity, supporting the broader trajectory of heightened illness.
5. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, ranging between 9.2% (Week 34) and 10.0% (Week 31–33, 2022). This indicates sustained high levels of respiratory disease mortality, correlating with increased ILI activity and foreshadowing the future surge.
6. In summary, the reported jump to 18479 future ILI occurrences (Week 40, 2022) can be attributed to the clear upward trend in past ILI occurrences, increasing rates of ILI-related outpatient visits, rising flu-related hospitalizations, and persistently elevated PIC mortality rates. These factors collectively demonstrate the convergence of intensified respiratory illness activity leading to the observed future spike.
