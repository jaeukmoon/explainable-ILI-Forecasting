1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a notable increase, moving from 1213 (Week12, 2021) to 1490 (Week16, 2021), with the highest occurrences observed in Week14 (1496). Week12 to Week13 displayed minimal fluctuation (1213 to 1209), followed by a sharp increase in Week14 (1496) and slight decreases in Week15 (1482) and Week16 (1490). This trend indicates relatively stable yet elevated ILI activity in the latter weeks.
2. A moderate positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the sustained higher values during Weeks14–16, 2021, nearly match the future occurrence of 1383 after 5 weeks. The consistency and extended plateau in past ILI values provide a stable basis for predicting elevated future ILI activity.
3. Outpatient ILI visits, remain steady at 1.1% during Weeks14–16, 2021, below the baseline of 2.6%. This constancy suggests continued respiratory illness monitoring, which aligns with the observed future ILI value of 1383. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) persistently exceeded epidemic thresholds across Weeks12–16, 2021 (e.g., 11.4% in Week12 and 11.8% in Week16). Elevated PIC deaths reflect broader respiratory illness trends contributing to future ILI occurrences. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (Weeks15–16, 2021) impacted traditional monitoring systems, likely leading to underreported or delayed ILI recognition earlier, which subsequently adjusted upward in future data accounting.
4. Despite low influenza detection rates (0.1% positive specimens in Weeks12–16, 2021), sustained ILI activity and PIC mortality suggest a role for non-influenza respiratory viruses or alternative respiratory illnesses contributing to ILI counts.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 1383 (Week21, 2021) is supported by the upward-trending past ILI data (Weeks14–16, 2021), stable outpatient ILI visit percentages, elevated PIC mortality, and pandemic-related data disruption, collectively sustaining future illness monitoring at observed levels.
