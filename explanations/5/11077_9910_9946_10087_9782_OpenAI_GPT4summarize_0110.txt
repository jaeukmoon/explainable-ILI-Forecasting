1. The reported ILI counts from Week23 to Week27, 2024 are 11077, 9910, 9946, 10087, and 9782. The data reveals a slight decline in ILI activity, reflecting a decreasing trend overall across the five weeks. However, the variation is relatively modest without sharp fluctuations or major dips, which suggests a stable but slightly downward movement in ILI activity during this period.
2. Week32, 2024 belongs to the peak onset season, as the typical off-season concludes by Week31. Additionally, historical patterns indicate that Week32 aligns with the period when influenza activity gradually begins to increase in anticipation of the upcoming peak season (Background Knowledge #4).
3. Time-series analysis indicates that while a decreasing trend is observed up to Week27, historical seasonal patterns combined with the transition into the peak onset season suggest a potential rise in ILI occurrences after Week27. The projected ILI count of 11143 likely reflects the early stages of seasonal increases in viral circulation, consistent with past baseline stabilization at the start of the peak onset season.
4. Nationwide influenza activity remains low (e.g., influenza positivity of 0.9%-1.6% in Weeks23-27, 2024), with minimal outpatient respiratory visits and hospitalization rates remaining below baseline levels (Week23, 2024 #1, #6; Week27, 2024 #1, #5). However, the transition to the peak onset season (Week32, 2024) may drive slight increases in ILI due to the seasonal baseline shift.
5. Influenza A (primarily H3N2) dominates circulation, accounting for approximately 80%-92% of recent positive specimens, with co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and RSV) influencing epidemiological trends (Week23, 2024 #3, #9; Week27, 2024 #3, #9). While resistance to antivirals remains low, sporadic mutations and novel virus detections highlight evolving risks (Week25, 2024 #7; Week26, 2024 #8).
6. Vaccine strains for Influenza A and B exhibit high antigenic similarity, and antiviral susceptibility remains robust (Week26, 2024 #7; Week27, 2024 #7). The strong vaccine match might mitigate abrupt spikes in ILI activity but will not prevent the gradual seasonal increase expected as Week32 approaches.
7. In summary, the slight decline in ILI occurrences from Week23 to Week27, the seasonal timing of Week32 aligning with the peak onset season, and ongoing co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses are key drivers of projected increases. Stable vaccination effectiveness and modest antiviral resistance trends further support a manageable rise to 11143 ILI occurrences in Week32, 2024, marking the beginning of heightened seasonal activity.
