1. The reported ILI counts from Week26 to Week30, 2022 are 1196, 1122, 898, 845, and 785. There is a clear decreasing trend, with occurrences declining steadily throughout the period. No significant fluctuations or anomalies are observed, indicating a consistent reduction in ILI activity.
2. Based on the provided background knowledge, Week35, 2022 aligns with the peak onset season. This is consistent with the timeline where ILI activity begins increasing toward its peak intensity later in the year, despite the current reports of low activity.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the consistent decline in ILI occurrences over the previous weeks, coupled with the seasonal characteristics of Week35, 2022, suggests a stabilization around lower ILI levels. However, as Week35 falls within the peak onset season, a potential shift from the declining trend is possible, leading to slightly elevated occurrences compared to the recent weeks.
4. Influenza activity reports indicate that positivity rates remain low and have further declined over recent weeks, with Week30, 2022 showing only 0.5% positivity in clinical specimens. Public health lab reports also reflect minimal influenza presence, dominated by Influenza A H3N2 (Week30, 2022 #1, #2).
5. Influenza-associated hospitalizations have been steadily decreasing, with 722 during Week28, 586 during Week29, and 491 during Week30, 2022, showing subdued overall flu impact (Week28, 2022 #5, Week29, 2022 #4, Week30, 2022 #3).
6. Shifted healthcare-seeking behaviors and ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV remain significant confounding variables, making future trends difficult to predict (Week28, 2022 #8, Week29, 2022 #10, Week30, 2022 #10).
7. The predicted ILI occurrences (566) for Week35, 2022 align with the overall decreasing trend while accounting for the seasonal transition into the peak onset season. This forecast reflects low influenza activity, declining hospitalization and test positivity rates, and potential stabilization of ILI occurrences due to concurrent factors such as viral co-circulation and healthcare changes.
