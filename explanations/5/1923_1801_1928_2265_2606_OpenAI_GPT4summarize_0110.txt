1. The ILI occurrences from Week31 to Week35, 2022 are 1923, 1801, 1928, 2265, and 2606. The trend indicates a steady increase starting from Week32 (1801) through Week35 (2606), with no interruptions or dips, suggesting an upward trajectory in influenza-like illness activity. This consistent growth pattern reflects a transition into a period of heightened flu activity.
2. Week40, 2022 falls within the peak onset season, as the steady rise in ILI counts and an increasing percentage of positive influenza specimens indicate the early stages of significant flu activity. This aligns with historical patterns where the peak onset season begins around Week32 to Week35 and continues until Week46, as observed in the U.S.
3. The correlation analysis of time-series data shows that following the upward trend from Week31 to Week35, the ILI counts are likely to continue increasing. The rise from 1801 in Week32 to 2606 in Week35 is significant, and projecting this five weeks forward based on the historical trajectory leads to the forecast of 8852 ILI occurrences in Week40, 2022. The consistent growth without fluctuation confirms this trajectory.
4. National influenza positivity rates have shown a slight increase each week, reaching 0.6% in Week35 (Week31-35, 2022 #1, #1, #1, #1, #1). Although still low, this gradual rise indicates increasing flu activity, which contributes to the projected spike in ILI occurrences.
5. Pediatric outpatient ILI visit rates have remained the highest among age groups, climbing from 6.1% in Week31 to 7.2% in Week35 (Week31-35, 2022 #5, #6, #4, #4, #5). Since children are often key transmitters, this trend supports a continued rise in overall cases.
6. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, particularly SARS-CoV-2, alongside evolving healthcare-seeking behaviors complicates traditional surveillance and forecasting (Week31-35, 2022 #10, #11, #10, #10, #10). This dynamic could amplify respiratory illnesses, further driving ILI growth.
7. Combining the steady five-week upward trend in ILI counts, the designation of Week40, 2022 as part of the peak onset season, and influential factors such as rising positivity rates, pediatric transmission, and respiratory virus co-circulation justifies the forecasted ILI occurrence of 8852. This projection reflects expected growth in flu activity as the season progresses toward its peak.
