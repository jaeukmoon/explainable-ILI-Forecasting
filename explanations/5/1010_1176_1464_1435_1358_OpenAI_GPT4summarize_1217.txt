1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks presented a fluctuating trajectory, starting at 1010 in Week12, 2021, followed by an increase to 1176 in Week13, 2021, and further peaking at 1464 in Week14, 2021. Subsequently, there was a decline to 1435 in Week15, 2021, and 1358 in Week16, 2021. While there was an initial rise, the overall trend showed a slight leveling off or decline toward the end of the 5-week period, indicating moderate variation in ILI activity.
2. A correlation can be observed between the past time-series ILI occurrences and the future ILI count of 1789. The peak in Week14, 2021, at 1464, coupled with consistently high values above 1300 in subsequent weeks, suggests that the moderate decline in Weeks 15–16 still reflected elevated baseline ILI activity, ultimately supporting a future rise in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI were notably stable but remained higher by Week14, 2021, and Week16, 2021, at 1.1%, compared to the initial Week12 level of 0.9%. While below the national baseline, this marginal increase in reported outpatient ILI activity aligns with the gradual build-up leading to the future count of 1789. Elevated PIC deaths, consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds (e.g., 11.4% in Week12, 11.8% in Week16), driven mainly by COVID-19, may have indirectly increased ILI reporting due to overlapping respiratory illness surveillance. Vaccine effectiveness trends remained unclear, but the persistence of low vaccination updates during Weeks12–16 likely contributed to reduced preparedness for a future rise.
4. Cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza, while exceptionally low at 0.7–0.8 per 100,000 throughout Weeks12–16, reflect an unusual scenario of reduced influenza-specific activity. However, changes in healthcare-seeking behavior due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic likely masked true ILI activity trends, delaying case identification and amplifying future reporting spikes. Overlapping COVID-19 surveillance blurred influenza-specific patterns but may have inflated non-specific ILI records captured in subsequent data.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 1789 is attributable to the relatively high past values peaking at 1464 in Week14, rising outpatient ILI visit percentages over Weeks12–16, consistently elevated PIC mortality surpassing thresholds, limited data on vaccine trends, and pandemic-induced shifts in healthcare dynamics obscuring real-time surveillance and accelerating future reporting increases.
