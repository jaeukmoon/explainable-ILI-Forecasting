1. The reported ILI counts from Week16 to Week20, 2024 are 14138, 13960, 13498, 12644, and 12615. The data shows a clear declining trend, with weekly occurrences steadily decreasing over time. This indicates gradually reduced influenza activity during these weeks, consistent with the expected patterns of decreasing ILI during the later part of the flu season.
2. Forecasting target week (Week25, 2024) belongs to the off-season. In the U.S., the off-season spans from the end of the peak season to the next peak onset season, typically from about Week9 to Week31. As of Week20, 2024, influenza activity remains low, and based on historical seasonality and current indicators, Week25 is categorized within the off-season where ILI activity is minimal.
3. Based on the time-series trend, the declining pattern in ILI occurrences from Week16, 2024 to Week20, 2024 strongly correlates with the off-season characterized by reduced flu activity. This downward trajectory suggests ILI occurrences will continue to decline or stabilize at lower values. Thus, projecting forward to Week25, 2024, a lower ILI count near 9946 aligns with both the historical trend and seasonal reduction in influenza cases.
4. Influenza positivity rates declined significantly over time, from 4.8% in Week16 to just 2% in Week20, indicating a steady drop in circulating influenza virus prevalence (Week16, 2024 #1; Week20, 2024 #1). This aligns with decreased ILI activity and supports lower future ILI projections.
5. Vaccine uptake continues, and although no major shifts in vaccination trends are noted, the ongoing recommendations emphasize high-risk groups (Week16, 2024 #9; Week17, 2024 #6; Week18, 2024 #8). Coupled with antiviral effectiveness and minimal antiviral resistance (Week18, 2024 #7), this contributes to the containment of severe influenza cases, further reducing ILI levels.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, persists but shows no indication of a novel virus driving an outbreak (Week16, 2024 #8; Week20, 2024 #10). This stability among pathogens mitigates the risk of any sudden upsurge in respiratory illness.
7. With steadily declining ILI reports, seasonal off-season conditions, low influenza positivity, effective vaccination efforts, and stable co-circulating respiratory trends, the forecasted future ILI occurrence of 9946 aligns with both current and historically observed patterns during late off-season weeks.
