1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a clear upward trend, with values progressing from 1791 (Week25, 2021) to 3182 (Week29, 2021). There was a stable increase across the weeks: 1791 (Week25, 2021) to 1794 (Week26, 2021), followed by sharper rises to 2193 (Week27, 2021), 2546 (Week28, 2021), and 3182 (Week29, 2021), indicating a notable escalation in ILI activity toward the end of the observation period.
2. A strong positive correlation is observed between the past and future ILI occurrences. The steady rise in ILI cases from Week27 to Week29, 2021, aligns with the reported jump to 3784 future occurrences after 5 weeks. The sustained upward trajectory in Weeks 28 and 29 suggests a continuation of growth, culminating in the elevated future ILI count.
3. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illnesses consistently increased from 1.2% (Week25, 2021) and Week26, 2021, to 1.3% in Week27 and Week28, 2021, and finally to 1.7% in Week29, 2021. This steady rise correlates with higher future ILI activity.
4. Elevated mortality linked to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) ranged from 6.6% (Week25, 2021) to 7.4% (Week29, 2021), consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds. This increased PIC activity reflects a broader respiratory illness impact, aligning with the future rise in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
5. Disruptions in traditional healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic complicated reporting and interpretation, likely deferring recognition of cases. The simultaneous monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza reported during Weeks25-29 likely contributed to an increased concentration of reported cases reflected in the future occurrence data.
6. In summary, the future rise to 3784 occurrences (after Week29, 2021) can be attributed to the consistent escalation in ILI cases, a gradual increase in outpatient ILI visits, persistently high PIC mortality rates above epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-related surveillance challenges, which collectively amplified the impact and reporting of ILI activity.
