1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent and significant upward trend, with values of ['15980', '21189', '22735', '25895', '29922'], starting at 15980 in Week 47, 2023 and steadily increasing to 29922 by Week 51, 2023. This sharp rise highlights escalating flu activity over this period, with no signs of slowing down by the end of the 5 weeks.
2. A clear positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the continuous rise from 25895 (Week 50, 2023) to 29922 (Week 51, 2023) directly aligns with the reported future occurrence of 18657 after 5 weeks. The high activity levels in Week 51, 2023, act as a strong precursor to the maintained elevated activity reflected in the predicted value for Week 5, 2024.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently increased nationwide, rising from 3.9% (Week 47, 2023) to 6.1% (Week 51, 2023), surpassing the national baseline of 2.9% for eight consecutive weeks. This sustained rise in ILI-related healthcare interactions suggests the escalating burden of respiratory illnesses driving the continued high future ILI occurrences. Co-circulation of influenza, COVID-19, and RSV as reported across the 5 weeks compounded respiratory illness trends and contributed significantly to the anticipated elevated ILI activity.
4. Testing positivity for influenza escalated dramatically, from 6.2% (Week 47, 2023) to 16.1% (Week 51, 2023), reflecting rapidly increasing viral transmission. This correlated directly with rising hospitalizations and deaths, with cumulative hospitalization rates climbing from 3.7 per 100,000 (Week 47, 2023) to 15.4 per 100,000 (Week 51, 2023). These factors strongly connect with the sustained high ILI activity predicted after 5 weeks.
5. Continued increases in the cumulative public health estimates (e.g., illnesses rising from 1.8 million to 7.1 million, hospitalizations from 17,000 to 73,000, and deaths from 1,100 to 4,500 from Week 47 to Week 51, 2023) indicate worsening flu dynamics. These escalating estimates mirror the severe ongoing healthcare burden, influencing the future ILI occurrences of 18657 in Week 5, 2024.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 18657 (Week 5, 2024) is explainable by the consistent upward trend in past ILI occurrences (Weeks 47–51, 2023), rising outpatient visits and testing positivity, increasing hospitalization rates, and compounding impacts of co-circulating respiratory viruses and escalating public health estimates.
