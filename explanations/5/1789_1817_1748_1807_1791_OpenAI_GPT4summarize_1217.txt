1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed slight fluctuations with no clear upward or downward trajectory, with values of ['1789', '1817', '1748', '1807', '1791']. Week21, 2021 (1789) showed a slight rise to Week22, 2021 (1817), followed by a drop in Week23, 2021 (1748). The subsequent weeks (Week24 and Week25, 2021) exhibited minor rises and falls, ending at 1791 in Week25, 2021. This pattern suggests stability in ILI activity for this period.
2. A weak correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the relatively stable pattern in Weeks21 through 25, 2021, does not directly anticipate the significant rise to 3354 occurrences reported for Week30, 2021. However, the absence of a downward trend could imply potential for a surge under appropriate triggering conditions.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained minimal and consistent at approximately 1.2% (Weeks22–25, 2021) compared to the national baseline of 2.6%. Although static, the baseline gap indicates room for increased activity as environmental or behavioral factors change, potentially leading to the reported future rise.
4. Persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds (e.g., 8.3% in Week21, 2021, and 6.6% in Week25, 2021) reflects ongoing respiratory disease activity, though primarily driven by COVID-19. This strain on healthcare systems and respiratory surveillance may contribute to the observed spike in future ILI data.
5. COVID-19-related healthcare-seeking behavior changes disrupted traditional surveillance, as highlighted consistently in Weeks21–25, 2021. These disruptions, particularly in alternative care settings, likely caused underreporting in ILI data during the 5-week period, with delayed case recognition manifesting as a sharp future rise in counts.
6. Despite minimal influenza positivity rates (<0.1% across Weeks22–25, 2021) and stable lab detections, the reported future spike in ILI occurrences could reflect increased activity from other respiratory pathogens or behavioral changes such as resumed healthcare visits post-disruption.
7. In summary, the reported 3354 future ILI occurrences (Week30, 2021) can be attributed to disruptions in ILI reporting during the past 5 weeks (Weeks21–25, 2021), persistent PIC mortality levels above epidemic thresholds, static yet below-baseline ILI outpatient visits, and the potential influence of non-influenza respiratory illnesses in reshaping future trends.
