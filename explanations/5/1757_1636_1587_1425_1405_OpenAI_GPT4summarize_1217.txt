1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a steady decline, decreasing from 1757 (Week22, 2024) to 1405 (Week26, 2024) without significant fluctuations. This consistent downward trend suggests a reduction in reported ILI activity across the observed period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the declining trend in past weeks (Week22–Week26, 2024) contrasts with the higher future occurrence of 1509 (Week31, 2024). The future value, despite aligning closer to earlier weeks, reflects a stabilization effect rather than a continuation of decline.
3. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including influenza, COVID-19, and RSV, was highlighted in all summarized reports across Week22–Week26, 2024. This co-circulation likely sustained ILI activity despite the observed low influenza-specific metrics, contributing to the reported future ILI occurrences.
4. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness steadily declined from 1.9% (Week22, 2024) to 1.4% (Week26, 2024), consistently remaining below baseline. However, a large aggregate population reporting minimal but persistent activity could explain the future rise in overall ILI occurrences compared to Week26.
5. Declining test positivity rates for influenza, from 1.8% (Week22, 2024) to 1.0% (Week26, 2024), alongside stable antiviral susceptibility and effective vaccine coverage, limited direct influenza impact. However, localized respiratory illness variability, specifically noted in regional trends, could account for sustained non-influenza ILI cases contributing to the future value.
6. The gradual increase in cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza, reaching 25,196 (Week26, 2024), and the notification of novel influenza cases (e.g., A(H1N2)v cases in Week25 and an A(H5N1) case in Week26, 2024) suggest evolving respiratory pathogen dynamics, indirectly affecting reported ILI occurrences beyond Week26.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1509 (Week31, 2024) can be attributed to a stabilization effect following a prior decline, fueled by the co-circulation of respiratory viruses, persistent low-level outpatient activity, regional variability in respiratory illness trends, and evolving respiratory pathogen impacts beyond influenza-specific metrics.
