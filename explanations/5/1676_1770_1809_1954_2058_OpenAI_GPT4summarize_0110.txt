1. The reported ILI counts from Week17 to Week21, 2022 are 1676, 1770, 1809, 1954, and 2058, showing a consistent increasing trend across all weeks. The rise from Week17 to Week21 indicates a steady upward movement in ILI occurrences, with no signs of stabilization or decline within the observed period.
2. Week26, 2022 falls within the off-season (from Week1, 2022 to Week31, 2022) based on U.S. influenza season classifications. The surrounding low activity in similar timelines further supports the off-season classification.
3. Time-series trends indicate consistent week-over-week increases from Week17 to Week21, 2022. This suggests continued activity into later weeks, though at a potentially lower magnitude as the season progresses further into the off-season. With diminishing seasonal factors and factors observed in CDC reports, it is reasonable to predict a decline in weekly ILI counts, leading to the projected value of 1196 for Week26, 2022.
4. Influenza virus activity remained elevated during Week17 to Week21, with Influenza A(H3N2) dominating, accounting for over 99% of positive cases (Week17 #2; Week18 #1; Week21 #2). However, positivity percentages showed a downward trend, dropping from 8.6% in Week18 to 5.7% in Week21 (Week18 #1; Week21 #1).
5. Although vaccination is encouraged, late-season antigenic differences in dominant H3N2 strains may reduce vaccine effectiveness (Week17 #8; Week18 #8; Week20 #7; Week21 #7). These differences may contribute to a gradual decline in ILI occurrence as the virus's spread lowers late in the off-season.
6. Respiratory co-infections and regional variability also contribute to ILI activity (Week17 #9; Week18 #10; Week21 #11). SARS-CoV-2 co-circulation persisted but did not show significant variability (Week18 #7; Week21 #8), indicating mild late-season influence on ILI trends.
7. In summary, the steady increase in ILI cases through Week21, 2022, followed by diminishing virologic positivity and late off-season timing, explains the forecasted decline in occurrences to 1196 in Week26, 2022. Declining antigenic match effectiveness, reduced overall activity, and ongoing co-circulation of pathogens further support this projection.
