1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall upward trend with fluctuating values ['1587', '2438', '2230', '2476', '2531']. A significant rise from 1587 (Week 39, 2021) to 2438 (Week 40, 2021) was followed by a temporary decrease to 2230 (Week 41, 2021). However, the final two weeks displayed steady increases, ending at 2531 (Week 43, 2021), the highest value in the observed period. This steady escalation toward the later weeks suggests increased respiratory illness activity.

2. A strong positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the upward trajectory in the last two weeks of the past data (Week 42–43, 2021) culminates in a sharp rise to 2971 future occurrences (Week 48, 2021). The growing trend observed near the end of the past data set appears to precede and contribute to the amplified future ILI activity.

3. Among the CDC summarized reports:  
   a. Outpatient visits for ILI showed steady values of 1.9% (Week 39 and 40, 2021) before stabilizing at 1.8% (Week 41–42, 2021), then slightly increasing to 1.9% (Week 43, 2021). The growth signifies sustained respiratory illness rates, correlating with the projected rise in future ILI occurrences.  
   b. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, ranging from 18.7% (Week 39) to 15.6% (Week 43, 2021). This elevated PIC mortality underlines heightened respiratory illness activity over these weeks.  
   c. Influenza positivity rates gradually increased, with 0.1% of clinical specimens testing positive in Week 39–42, rising to 0.2% by Week 43, 2021. This incremental uptick in virologic activity reflects a possible early flu resurgence, which aligns with the intensifying ILI rates.  

4. In summary, the reported 2971 future ILI occurrences (Week 48, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trajectory in ILI occurrences observed during Weeks 42–43, 2021, sustained outpatient ILI visit percentages, persistently high PIC mortality that exceeded epidemic thresholds, and the gradual increase in influenza positivity in clinical specimens. These combined factors—alongside potential disruptions from pandemic-driven healthcare-seeking and surveillance practices—contributed to the sharp rise in future ILI activity.
