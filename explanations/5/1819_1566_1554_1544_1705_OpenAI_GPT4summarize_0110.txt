1. The reported ILI counts from Week40 to Week44, 2020 are 1819, 1566, 1554, 1544, and 1705. The trend initially decreased gradually from 1819 in Week40 to 1544 in Week43, indicating a steady decline in activity. However, Week44 shows an uptick to 1705, suggesting a slight rebound. Overall, these observations point to a relatively stable yet slightly fluctuating trajectory over the past 5 weeks.
2. The target week (None) falls into the off-season phase based on U.S. influenza seasonality. This period typically spans after the peak season through the following peak onset season. Since the current activity remains minimal and is well below baseline levels (Week40-Week44, 2020 #4), the classification of None as the off-season is consistent with the observed low ILI activity.
3. Historically, the time-series indicates that while fluctuations occur (e.g., Week44's rebound), the overall trend remains stable and subdued. Extending this pattern forward five weeks results in projected ILI occurrences near the average of recent weeks, supporting the value of 1822 as no dramatic shift or surge is evident.
4. Flu positivity rates are near negligible (Week40-Week44, 2020 #1; #2), with only 0.1%-0.3% of clinical laboratory specimens testing positive, reflecting minimal virus circulation.
5. Widespread vaccination encouragement (Week40-Week44, 2020 #8) serves as a mitigating factor, although specific data trends are not provided, which likely contributes to low ILI levels.
6. Healthcare-seeking behavior remains altered by the COVID-19 pandemic (Week40-Week44, 2020 #9), affecting traditional ILI surveillance and potentially leading to underreporting or skewed data, which aligns with the predicted continuation of low activity levels.
7. Given the stable yet low-level ILI counts, the off-season timing (None), minimal flu positivity rates, and the impact of behavioral changes due to COVID-19, the forecast aligns with an expected ILI occurrence of 1822 for None.
