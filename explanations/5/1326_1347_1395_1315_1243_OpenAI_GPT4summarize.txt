1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show a fluctuating but overall declining trend, with values of ['1326' (Week 33, 2021), '1347' (Week 34, 2021), '1395' (Week 35, 2021), '1315' (Week 36, 2021), and '1243' (Week 37, 2021)]. Although Week 35 experienced a peak at 1395, ILI occurrences consistently decreased thereafter, reaching the lowest value of 1243 in Week 37. This downward trajectory indicates a general reduction in ILI activity toward the end of the 5-week period.

2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, as the declining trend from Week 35 through Week 37 (2021) contrasts with the drop to 1218 future occurrences after 5 weeks (approximately Week 42, 2021). The sharp reduction in Week 37 serves as an indicator of continued low activity leading to the lower future occurrence level.

3. Despite minimal influenza circulation, the continued influence of non-influenza respiratory viruses on ILI activity (highlighted in all reports) contributed to the reported ILI levels. For example, ILI increases were attributed to non-influenza viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 across Weeks 33–37. This emphasizes that respiratory conditions other than influenza, while declining, sustained some residual ILI activity.

4. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed epidemic thresholds, with percentages such as 17.2% (Week 33), 19.4% (Week 34), 21.0% (Week 36), and 21.1% (Week 37). Primarily driven by COVID-19, these figures reflect persistent respiratory disease burdens, indirectly maintaining ILI surveillance vigilance and potentially influencing the future ILI occurrence values.

5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, as documented throughout all 5 summarized weeks, disrupted the interpretation of ILI data. These changes affected outpatient surveillance systems, leading to difficulty in tracking trends accurately and the underreporting of mild cases, possibly correlating with the lower future ILI count of 1218.

6. In summary, the reported 1218 future ILI occurrences (approximately Week 42, 2021) can be attributed to the observed decreasing trend in ILI activity from Week 35 to Week 37, the continued but reduced influence of non-influenza respiratory viruses, the sustained elevated PIC mortality driven by COVID-19, and disruptions in healthcare-seeking patterns caused by the pandemic.
