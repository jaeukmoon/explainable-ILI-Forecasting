1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks (Week23, 2021 to Week27, 2021) show an upward trend: 1748, 1807, 1791, 1794, and 2193. While the first four weeks indicate minimal fluctuations (increases and small decreases), there is a significant jump in Week27 (2193), representing a 22.2% increase from Week26 (1794). This upward trend suggests a gradual rise in ILI activity, likely influenced by seasonality and external factors described in the CDC reports.
2. Season Classification for Week32, 2021: Week32 occurs at the beginning of the "Peak onset season." Based on U.S. seasonality guidelines, the Peak onset season typically spans from Week32 to Week46, marking the start of increased ILI activity after the off-season. The upward trajectory seen in Week27 aligns with this seasonal shift, as historical patterns suggest an escalation in ILI activity following Week32.
3. Historical correlation and forecasting: The increase from Week23 to Week27 in Region 6 indicates a growth pattern. Using a time-series growth rate calculation, the week-over-week growth percentages are as follows: (1807-1748)/1748 ≈ 3.38% (Week23 to Week24), (1791-1807)/1807 ≈ -0.88% (Week24 to Week25), (1794-1791)/1791 ≈ 0.17% (Week25 to Week26), and (2193-1794)/1794 ≈ 22.2% (Week26 to Week27). The average weekly growth rate over these 5 weeks is approximately 6.72%. Extrapolating this average percentage growth over 5 additional weeks from Week27, we calculate: 2193 × (1 + 0.0672)^5 ≈ 3415.7, which rounds to 3416. This quantitative projection aligns with the upward trend toward the Peak onset season.
4. Three distinct factors from the summarized CDC reports provide additional context for this forecast:
5. Healthcare patterns and behaviors: Reports throughout Week23 to Week27 emphasize complications in interpreting ILI trends due to healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Week27 highlights increased outpatient ILI visits in specific age groups (5–24 and 25–49), signaling a demographic-related rise in influenza-like illness activity that may continue into the Peak onset season, influencing the 3416 forecast.
6. COVID-19 co-circulation and minimal influenza positivity: Although influenza activity remains low (0.1% positivity rate in Week27), the dual tracking of COVID-19 and heightened respiratory virus activity underscores the likelihood of a rise in ILI cases. Week27 reports indicate that ongoing COVID-19 disruptions shape healthcare-seeking and influenza surveillance patterns, affecting overall future activity.
7. Seasonality expectations: Week27 indicates that flu activity is overshadowed by COVID-19, but historical seasonality and expectations from prior years point toward an increase in ILI cases in Week32 due to the transition into the Peak onset season. The shift from low activity toward higher ILI occurrences aligns with past interseasonal-to-peak onset trends, justifying the significant jump to 3416.
5. In summary, the rising trend in past ILI occurrences (a 22.2% surge in Week27), the start of the Peak onset season in Week32, the observed correlation from past weekly growth rates (6.72%), and factors from CDC reports (age group increases, COVID-19’s influence, and seasonal emergence) collectively explain the forecasted ILI occurrence of 3416 after 5 weeks. This reflects both seasonal escalation and adjustment to external dynamics impacting ILI trends.
