1. Explanation:
1. The past 5 weeks of ILI occurrences in Region 9 show a consistent downward trend: Week10, 2023 (11262), Week11, 2023 (10723), Week12, 2023 (10765), Week13, 2023 (10580), and Week14, 2023 (9823). From Week10 to Week11, there was a significant decrease (-539), and while Week12 had a slight uptick (+42), it returned to a clear decline in Week13 (-185) and even more notably by Week14 (-757). This downward trend suggests a steady reduction in ILI cases, indicative of stabilization during a low-activity period.
2. Season classification: The target week (None/5 weeks into the future) is part of the "Off-season," as it falls in late spring (Week19, 2023). In the U.S., influenza activity typically peaks between Week46 and Week6 and then decreases sharply during the Off-season (Week7 through Week31). Historical off-season periods are characterized by minimal ILI activity, with occurrences near baseline levels.
3. The correlation analysis between past trends and future ILI occurrences involves calculating the week-to-week rate of change. From the past 5 weeks:
4. - Week10 to Week11 = (-539/11262) × 100 = -4.8%
5. - Week11 to Week12 = (+42/10723) × 100 = +0.4%
6. - Week12 to Week13 = (-185/10765) × 100 = -1.7%
7. - Week13 to Week14 = (-757/10580) × 100 = -7.1%
8. Thus, the recent rate of decline is accelerating, especially between Week13 and Week14 (-7.1%). Applying a conservative projection based on this trend, we estimate a decrease of approximately 5-6% weekly moving forward. Extrapolating this to 5 weeks (Week15 to None), and applying a compounding reduction factor, the ILI occurrences are forecasted as:
9. 9823 × (1 - 0.055)^5 = 9362 (rounded to the nearest whole number).
4. Summarized CDC reports provide additional context for the decline:
5. - Influenza activity remains low nationwide (e.g., Week14, only 1% positivity rate for respiratory specimens). There is no significant surge in positivity rates or new variants to suggest that ILI activity will increase soon.
6. - Vaccination efforts continue strongly, with antigenically matched vaccines and high antiviral susceptibility (98%-100%), further reducing the likelihood of a resurgence.
7. - Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 may contribute moderately to ILI cases; however, these effects are consistent with baseline levels observed across Week10–Week14.
5. In summary, the consistent decline in ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks, combined with stabilized influenza activity, strong vaccination coverage, and the transition into the Off-season, supports the prediction that ILI occurrences will decrease further to 9362 by None. This prediction aligns with historical trends and CDC-reported activity levels for this time of year.
