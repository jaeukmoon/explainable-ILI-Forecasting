1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall upward trend: ['1063', '969', '1008', '1084', '1189']. After a decrease from 1063 (Week 41, 2021) to 969 (Week 42, 2021), there was a steady rise to 1189 in Week 45, 2021. This trend indicates a progressive increase in ILI activity, aligning with the elevated future occurrences.
2. A positive correlation is evident between the past 5-week trajectory and the reported future ILI occurrences of 1874 (Week 50, 2021). The consistent upward trend in Weeks 43 to 45, 2021, projected an amplified increase, as reflected in the significantly higher 5-week-later ILI figure.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually increased from 1.8% (Week 41, 2021) to 2.1% (Weeks 44 and 45, 2021). This rise, coupled with regional outbreaks such as the Michigan-focused Influenza A(H3N2) spread, underscored a growing ILI burden that fueled the surge to 1874.
4. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC)-attributed deaths, though primarily driven by COVID-19, consistently surpassed the epidemic threshold, declining only slightly from 17.5% in Week 41, 2021, to 14.4% in Week 45, 2021, reflecting persistent and elevated respiratory illness activity that could have driven ILI reporting increases.
5. Increased concurrent respiratory virus circulation, particularly Influenza A(H3N2) dominance and variable age-specific ILI visit upticks in 0–24 age groups, likely amplified overlapping ILI trends. These co-circulating pathogens and the influence of altered healthcare behaviors disrupted routine reporting, intensifying the jump to future occurrences of 1874.
6. In summary, the rise to 1874 ILI future occurrences (Week 50, 2021) is tied to the past data’s upward trend, increasing ILI outpatient visits, elevated PIC deaths exceeding epidemic thresholds, regional influenza outbreaks, and the compounded effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses alongside pandemic-related healthcare behavior shifts.
