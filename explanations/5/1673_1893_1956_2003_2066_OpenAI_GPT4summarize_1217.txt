1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1673', '1893', '1956', '2003', '2066']. Beginning at 1673 (Week11, 2021), occurrences steadily increased each subsequent week, reaching 2066 by Week15, 2021. This consistent growth indicates an underlying rise in ILI activity persisting throughout the observed period.
2. A positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the continual rise from 1673 in Week11, 2021, to 2066 by Week15, 2021, aligns with the subsequent increase to 2114 occurrences in the future (Week20, 2021). The sustained upward trajectory observed during the past period acts as a precursor to the slight rise between Week15 and Week20, 2021.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI displayed a stable yet slight upward movement, progressing from 0.9% (Week11, 2021) to 1.1% (Week15, 2021). While below the 2.6% baseline, this incremental growth reflects increasing respiratory illness activity and provides a plausible pathway to explain the future ILI rise to 2114.
4. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, fluctuating between 11.2% (Week14, 2021) and 12.4% (Week15, 2021), primarily driven by COVID-19. This persistent PIC mortality indicates heightened respiratory illness impacts, correlating with the observed future ILI increase.
5. Data interpretation challenges caused by pandemic-driven healthcare-seeking behavior changes, as stated across all weeks, likely affected traditional ILI reporting. These disruptions may have delayed recognition of cases, contributing to the continued rise in future ILI occurrences.
6. Despite minimal influenza virus activity (e.g., 0.1% positive specimens across all 5 weeks), non-specific respiratory illnesses or overlapping symptoms with other respiratory pathogens, compounded by COVID-19 influences, likely contributed to the sustained incremental increase in ILI activity leading to 2114 occurrences in Week20, 2021.
7. In summary, the reported 2114 future ILI occurrences (Week20, 2021) can be explained by the consistent upward trajectory observed in Weeks11–15, 2021, the slight increase in outpatient ILI visits, high PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, and ongoing pandemic-driven disruptions to traditional reporting and healthcare behaviors.
