1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated an overall upward progression, moving from 1777 (Week 21, 2021) to 2198 (Week 24, 2021) before dipping slightly to 2162 (Week 25, 2021). This trend reflects an increasing ILI activity over the majority of the observed weeks, with only a marginal decline in the final week, suggesting substantial respiratory illness activity during this period.

2. A clear positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences. The upward trajectory in ILI cases from Week 21, 2021, to Week 24, 2021, corresponds with the reported sharp increase to 2989 future occurrences, 5 weeks beyond Week 25, 2021. The slight decline in Week 25, 2021, does not negate the generally increasing trend, which clearly signals the potential for heightened future activity.

3. The percentage of outpatient visits attributed to ILI remained consistent (1.1% in Week 21, 2021, increasing to 1.2% from Week 22 to Week 25, 2021) but still below the national baseline of 2.6%. This gradual increase in healthcare encounters for ILI correlates with the reported rise in future occurrences to 2989 cases.

4. Elevated mortality percentages from pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeding epidemic thresholds were reported consistently throughout the 5 weeks (e.g., 8.3% in Week 21, 2021; 6.6% in Week 25, 2021). These figures underline persistently high respiratory disease activity during this period, contributing to the expected rise in future ILI occurrences.

5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and disrupted surveillance systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted throughout the reports. These challenges may have caused underreporting of ILI data during the observed weeks, leading to a potential accumulation of unaddressed cases, which reflect in the sharp future increase.

6. Despite consistently low influenza-specific positivity rates (e.g., less than 0.1% in Week 24, 2021) and limited virus detections in clinical and public health labs, non-influenza respiratory pathogens or residual pandemic-related behavioral shifts likely fueled ongoing increases in ILI cases.

7. In summary, the steep rise to 2989 future ILI occurrences (5 weeks beyond Week 25, 2021) is attributable to the upward ILI trend during Weeks 21–24, rising ILI-related outpatient visits, persistently high PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, and the compounded impact of healthcare-seeking changes and surveillance challenges during the COVID-19 era.
