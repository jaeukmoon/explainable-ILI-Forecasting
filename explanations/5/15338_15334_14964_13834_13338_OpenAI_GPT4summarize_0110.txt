1. The reported ILI counts from Week10 to Week14, 2024 are 15338, 15334, 14964, 13834, and 13338. There is a consistent week-over-week decline in ILI occurrences during this period. The trend shows a clear decreasing trajectory, suggesting that influenza activity is waning nationally as the season progresses toward the off-season.
2. Week19, 2024 occurs well after the peak season (typically Week46 to Week06) and is closer to the off-season window (Week09 to Week30). Current national declines in influenza positivity, hospitalizations, and outpatient visits (Week12, 2024 #1; Week13, 2024 #1; Week14, 2024 #1-#5), paired with below-baseline thresholds for ILI outpatient visits in Week14, 2024, point to Week19, 2024 being classified within the off-season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the steady decline from Week10 through Week14, 2024, strongly indicates that ILI occurrences are progressively decreasing toward the baseline. Historical seasonal trends suggest that this decline will likely continue into Week19, 2024. Assuming no unexpected deviations (e.g., sudden regional surges or new variants), the forecasted value of 12862 aligns with the expected trajectory based on past fluctuations.
4. The decline in influenza positivity from clinical specimens—15.4% in Week10, 2024 to 7.7% in Week14, 2024—indicates reduced transmission (Week10, 2024 #1; Week14, 2024 #1).
5. Vaccination coverage remains robust, and vaccine strains continue to match circulating influenza strains effectively (Week10, 2024 #10; Week12, 2024 #9; Week14, 2024 #7). This likely contributes to the overall decline in ILI activity by diminishing severe cases and community spread.
6. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (RSV, SARS-CoV-2) without a significant influenza surge further supports the gradual subsiding trend, as these additional respiratory illnesses are being managed concurrently (Week10, 2024 #11; Week12, 2024 #8; Week14, 2024 #8).
7. In summary, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 12862 for Week19, 2024 is justified by the decreasing trend in ILI counts and influenza positivity in Weeks10-14, 2024, the alignment with the off-season classification, the protective effect of effective vaccination, and the stable co-circulation of respiratory viruses. These factors collectively support a continued decline in activity in the coming weeks.
