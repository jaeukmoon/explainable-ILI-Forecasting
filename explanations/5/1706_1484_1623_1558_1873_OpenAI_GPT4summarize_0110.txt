1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week41 to Week45, 2020 are 1706, 1484, 1623, 1558, and 1873. The trend shows a moderate fluctuation with a slight increase in Week45 compared to previous weeks. While the ILI counts decreased from Week41 to Week42 (1706 to 1484) and experienced slight increases and reductions across weeks, the overall pattern reflects a consistent level of activity without any dramatic spikes or steady declines.
2. Based on the timeline, the target week (None) is five weeks after Week45, 2020, aligning approximately with Week50, 2020. Week50 typically falls within the peak season of ILI activity (Week46 to Week6 of the subsequent year). Given that the ILI activity appears to be building slightly and Week50 lies within this timeframe, the target week is classified as the peak season.
3. Time-series forecasting indicates that the recent fluctuations are indicative of mild growth in ILI counts. From Week41 to Week45, ILI occurrences stabilized near the mid-1500s to mid-1800s range, with a notable increase in Week45. Given the seasonal influence (Week50 part of peak season), it's plausible to expect further increases. Therefore, the projected occurrence of 2222 aligns with such seasonal growth trends.
4. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has gradually risen through the weeks (Week41, 2020: 0.3%; Week45, 2020: 0.2-0.3%). This slight positivity increase is consistent with transitioning toward peak influenza season.
5. Outpatient ILI visits have slightly increased (Week41, 2020: 1.2%; Week45, 2020: 1.5%), suggesting a gradual rise in ILI activity, although still below baseline levels. Regional variation further supports localized increases that could impact national trends.
6. The continuing rise of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (Week41, 2020: 7.2%; Week45, 2020: 8.9%) indicates increasing ILI-related severity and activity that aligns with peak-season expectations. Furthermore, shifting healthcare access patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic may influence reporting but suggest increases in transmission activity at this time of year.
7. The projected ILI count of 2222 is justified by the gradual but consistent increase in ILI visits, influenza positivity, and PIC-related deaths observed in recent weeks. Combined with Week50 typically being part of the peak season and the historical pattern of increasing cases during this interval, the projection aligns with seasonal expectations.
