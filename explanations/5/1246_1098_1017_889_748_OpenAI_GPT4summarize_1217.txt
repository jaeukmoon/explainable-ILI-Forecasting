1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a steady decline, with values of ['1246', '1098', '1017', '889', '748']. The weekly decrease in occurrences from 1246 (Week22, 2023) to 748 (Week26, 2023) indicates a consistent reduction in ILI activity during this time frame. This downward trend reflects diminishing respiratory illness activity.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the continuous decline in the past 5-week data (Week22 to Week26, 2023) does not immediately align with the reported future value of 619. However, the diminishing rate of decline over the 5 weeks suggests a potential stabilization or plateau, which could explain the relatively close proximity of the future ILI figure to the Week26 value of 748.
3. Outpatient ILI visits consistently decreased, from 1.9% (Week22, 2023) to 1.4% (Week26, 2023), staying below the national baseline. Reduced healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory illnesses accounts for the lower ILI occurrences and aligns with the declining trend in past and future data.
4. Influenza positivity rates remained consistently low, fluctuating between 1.0% and 1.2% during Weeks22–26, 2023. Minimal new cases of influenza, combined with declining positivity percentages, correlate with the observed reduction in ILI occurrences over time.
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and RSV), as reported throughout Weeks22–26, 2023, may have compounded ILI attribution challenges, diluting the influence of influenza-specific ILI activity. This factor helps explain the stabilization around the future ILI occurrence value of 619.
6. In summary, the reported 619 future ILI occurrences after Week26, 2023, can be attributed to the past steady decline in ILI data, reduced outpatient visits and influenza positivity rates, and the mitigating effect of co-circulating respiratory viruses, leading to a near-stabilization of ILI trends by the end of Week26, 2023.
