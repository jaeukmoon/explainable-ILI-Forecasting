1. The reported ILI counts from Week13 to Week17, 2021 were 1977, 2087, 1956, 1924, and 1816. The trend shows a slight increase in Week14 (2087) followed by a steady decline through Week17 (1816). This indicates a downward trend over the past five weeks without any significant spikes, suggesting decreasing ILI occurrences.
2. Week22, 2021 belongs to the off-season period since the typical U.S. influenza peak season ends by Week06 each year. The exceptionally low positivity rates (Week13, 2021 #1; Week14, 2021 #1; Week15, 2021 #1; Week16, 2021 #1; Week17, 2021 #1) and minimal activity across surveillance metrics during Weeks13-17, 2021 further confirm the continuation of off-season conditions.
3. By observing the downward time-series trend in ILI occurrences and stable yet historically low influenza positivity rates, it is evident that the counts are influenced by diminished influenza spread. Projecting this continuation of the decline forward by five weeks, the predicted ILI occurrence in Week22, 2021 is 1831, closely aligned with the observed deceleration trend.
4. Influenza activity remained unusually low nationwide with extremely low positivity across clinical labs (Week13, 2021 #1; Week14, 2021 #1; Week15, 2021 #1; Week16, 2021 #1; Week17, 2021 #1) and public health labs (Week14, 2021 #3; Week15, 2021 #3; Week16, 2021 #2; Week17, 2021 #3).
5. Vaccination uptake remained stable but showed no significant updates or changes during this period, with annual flu vaccination continuing to be recommended (Week13, 2021 #7; Week14, 2021 #10; Week15, 2021 #10; Week16, 2021 #8; Week17, 2021 #8), providing continued immunity effects in the population.
6. Healthcare-seeking behaviors remained altered due to COVID-19, leading to lower outpatient respiratory visits for ILI (Week13, 2021 #3; Week14, 2021 #5; Week15, 2021 #6; Week16, 2021 #3; Week17, 2021 #7), contributing to minimal ILI activity despite underlying surveillance disruptions.
7. The combination of a declining ILI trend, off-season alignment, exceptionally low influenza positivity rates, stable vaccination coverage, and altered healthcare behaviors due to COVID-19 supports the projected value of 1831 ILI occurrences in Week22, 2021.
