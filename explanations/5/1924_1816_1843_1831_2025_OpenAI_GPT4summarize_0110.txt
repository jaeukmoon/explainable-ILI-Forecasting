1. The reported ILI counts from Week16 to Week20, 2021, are 1924, 1816, 1843, 1831, and 2025. The data indicate a generally stable trend with minor fluctuations, followed by a slight uptick in Week20 (2025). This suggests limited variability and no prominent or sustained growth, consistent with low ILI activity observed during the off-season.
2. Based on influenza seasonality in the U.S., Week25, 2021, falls within the off-season, as it occurs well after the typical peak season (Week46, 2020 – Week6, 2021) and before the peak onset season (usually beginning around Week32 or Week35). The CDC reports further affirm minimal influenza activity across all jurisdictions, aligning with the season classification of off-season for Week25, 2021.
3. From a time-series analysis perspective, the stable trend observed from Week16 to Week20, 2021, with no significant spikes, indicates continuity in low-level ILI occurrences. Given the slight increase in Week20 (2025), projecting forward five weeks to Week25, 2021, suggests a small incremental growth. Thus, the predicted value of 2162 reflects this minimal forward progression from the baseline trend.
4. Historical patterns of near-zero influenza positivity, with 0.1% positivity in Weeks16–20, 2021 (Week16, 2021 #1; Week17, 2021 #1; Week18, 2021 #1; Week19, 2021 #1; Week20, 2021 #1), indicate minimal virus transmission, contributing to low ILI activity.
5. The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare-seeking behavior and ILI data surveillance (Week16, 2021 #9; Week17, 2021 #9; Week18, 2021 #9; Week19, 2021 #10; Week20, 2021 #10) limits the accuracy of ILI data interpretation and helps stabilize low ILI counts.
6. Vaccination trends remain stable, with consistent CDC reminders but no significant updates or disruptions reported during Weeks16–20, 2021 (Week16, 2021 #8; Week17, 2021 #8; Week18, 2021 #8; Week19, 2021 #9; Week20, 2021 #9). This contributes to limited influenza impact alongside low virus circulation.
7. In conclusion, the forecast of 2162 ILI occurrences for Week25, 2021, is justified by the stable trend in past ILI data, the classification of Week25 as off-season, and continued low influenza activity alongside the subdued impact of external factors such as vaccination and healthcare behavior changes during the COVID-19 era. The small, consistent upward movement in ILI trends corroborates the projected value.
