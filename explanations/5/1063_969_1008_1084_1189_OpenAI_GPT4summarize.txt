1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall upward trend, with values of ['1063', '969', '1008', '1084', '1189']. Although there was an initial decline from 1063 (Week 41, 2021) to 969 (Week 42, 2021), a steady and consistent rise followed in subsequent weeks, culminating in the peak of 1189 (Week 45, 2021). This upward trajectory highlights a gradual intensification of ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the upward trend observed in the latter weeks (Weeks 44–45, 2021) aligns with the significant increase to 1874 future occurrences by Week 50, 2021. Notably, the peak in Week 45 serves as a precursor, suggesting sustained or amplified respiratory illness activity leading into the future time period.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily increased over the 5 weeks, from 1.8% (Weeks 41 and 42, 2021) to 1.9% (Week 43, 2021), and subsequently to 2.1% by Week 44 and Week 45, 2021. Though still below the national baseline of 2.5%, this consistent rise indicates growing respiratory illness activity in the population, correlating with the rise to 1874 future occurrences.

4. A rise in lab-confirmed influenza cases and hospitalizations was observed. Public health labs reported increasing detection rates of Influenza A(H3N2), with positivity rates growing from 0.1% (Week 41, 2021) to 0.7% (Week 45, 2021). Confirmed hospitalizations also climbed, from 248 cases (Week 41, 2021) to 332 cases (Week 45, 2021). This trend reflects a mounting burden of illness, contributing to the elevated future ILI levels.

5. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained persistently high, exceeding epidemic thresholds in all 5 weeks: 17.5% (Week 41, 2021) to 14.4% (Week 45, 2021). While predominantly driven by COVID-19, this sustained elevated mortality suggests overlapping respiratory illness trends contributing to the reported future rise.

6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses and changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic further impacted ILI reporting and surveillance. These disruptions, combined with regional outbreaks concentrated among younger populations (e.g., Influenza A(H3N2) in ages 5–24 years), could accelerate ILI growth in subsequent weeks, aligning with the rise to 1874 occurrences.

7. In summary, the reported 1874 future ILI occurrences (Week 50, 2021) are driven by an upward trend in Week 45, increases in ILI-related outpatient visits, rising lab-confirmed influenza and hospitalizations, persistently high PIC mortality, and the compounding effects of co-circulating respiratory pathogens alongside pandemic-driven disruptions in surveillance.
