1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating trend within a narrow range, with values of ['1285', '1243', '1207', '1253', '1190']. While there was a slight decline from 1285 (Week31, 2022) to 1190 (Week35, 2022), the variations were minor, indicating relatively stable but low ILI activity during this period with no significant upward or downward momentum observed.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 2575 displays a significant increase compared to the previous 5 weeks, suggesting a deviation from the stable past trend. This rise could correlate with the gradual leveling of influenza indicators observed during Weeks 34 and 35, 2022, particularly the subtle increase in outpatient visits for ILI from 1.5% in Week33, 2022, to 1.9% in Week35, 2022. This incline in healthcare encounters might signal an early stage of ILI escalation, prefiguring the sharp future rise.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently showed incremental growth across the 5-week span: 1.5% (Week31, 2022), 1.4% (Week32, 2022), 1.5% (Week33, 2022), 1.8% (Week34, 2022), and 1.9% (Week35, 2022). While remaining below baseline, these increases, particularly among children aged 0-4 years (ranging from 6.1% in Week31, 2022, to 7.2% in Week35, 2022), suggest rising respiratory infection activity that likely fueled the surge to 2575 ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza-related hospitalizations also exhibited a steady rise, from 506 (Week31, 2022) to 509 (Week35, 2022). This growth, although modest, reflects increasing severe respiratory illness cases, complementing the observed rise in outpatient ILI visits and contributing to the heightened future ILI numbers.
5. The ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, as outlined repeatedly across the summarized reports, and changing healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic likely amplified overall ILI reporting. These factors, coupled with evolving surveillance challenges, contributed to the disproportionate leap in future ILI occurrences to 2575.
6. In summary, the notable future rise to 2575 ILI occurrences (Week40, 2022) stems from low but gradually increasing outpatient ILI visits, persistent hospitalization rates, the interplay of multiple circulating respiratory viruses, and pandemic-era disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors that accelerated the manifestation of symptomatic cases.
