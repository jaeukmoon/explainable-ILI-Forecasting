1. The reported ILI counts from Week32, 2021 to Week36, 2021 are 1936, 2164, 2131, 2388, and 1976. The ILI occurrences show a fluctuating trend with a peak observed in Week35, 2021 (2388) followed by a significant decline in Week36, 2021 (1976). Overall, the trend reflects irregular fluctuations rather than a consistent upward or downward trajectory.
2. Week41, 2021, aligns with the peak onset season based on U.S. seasonality patterns, as it occurs after the off-season (Week31, 2021) and before the historical peak season start (Week46, 2021). Observations indicate slight increases in ILI activity in some regions during this period, consistent with transitioning toward higher activity levels.
3. Correlation analysis suggests a continued oscillatory pattern over the past weeks, with Week35, 2021 showing a peak that may not sustain further. The abrupt decline in Week36, 2021 (1976) signals potential stabilization. Projecting these patterns forward, a slight recovery or stabilization can be anticipated around 2230 ILI occurrences by Week41, 2021, following the fluctuating and transitioning behavior.
4. Nationwide influenza virus activity remains minimal (Week32, 2021 #7; Week34, 2021 #1; Week36, 2021 #3), and circulating ILI is largely attributed to non-influenza respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (Week33, 2021 #3; Week34, 2021 #4; Week36, 2021 #2).
5. Healthcare-seeking behaviors remain altered due to the lingering COVID-19 pandemic, which impacts the accuracy of ILI reporting and trends analysis in traditional surveillance systems (Week32, 2021 #8; Week33, 2021 #9; Week36, 2021 #9).
6. Vaccination impact is limited as no notable updates on vaccination trends are provided, though the promotion of annual influenza vaccination continues (Week32, 2021 #6; Week34, 2021 #7; Week36, 2021 #8).
7. In summary, the projected ILI occurrences of 2230 for Week41, 2021, align with the observed fluctuating and stabilizing trends of prior weeks, the transition into the peak onset season, minimal influenza virus circulation, significant co-circulation of non-influenza respiratory viruses, and persistent changes in healthcare access. These factors collectively justify the forecast within the observed trajectory.
