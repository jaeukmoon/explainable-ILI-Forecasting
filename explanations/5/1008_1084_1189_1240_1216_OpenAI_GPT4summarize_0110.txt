1. The reported ILI counts from Week43 to Week47, 2021 are 1008, 1084, 1189, 1240, and 1216. The trend shows a consistent increase from Week43 (1008) to Week46 (1240), followed by a slight dip in Week47 (1216). Overall, this exhibits a predominantly upward trajectory with a small fluctuation at the end.
2. In the U.S., the peak season generally spans from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the next year. Based on this timeframe and the observed steady rise in ILI activity in the past weeks (Week43, 2021 #10; Week44, 2021 #1; Week45, 2021 #1; Week46, 2021 #1; Week47, 2021 #14), Week52, 2021 can be classified as the peak season.
3. The time-series trend, which shows a steady increase in ILI levels from Week43 to Week46 followed by a minor decrease in Week47, suggests that influenza activity is intensifying. Extrapolating this trend forward with the typical peak season dynamics, it is consistent to forecast higher ILI occurrences in Week52, 2021, aligning closely with the projection of 2919.
4. Positive influenza specimens are steadily rising, with national positivity rates climbing from 0.2% in Week43 to 1.5% in Week47, and an increasing dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) across age groups, particularly 5–24 years (Week43, 2021 #1, #3; Week44, 2021 #3, #5; Week45, 2021 #3; Week47, 2021 #2, #4).
5. Although vaccination efforts are significant, with 166.9 million doses distributed (Week46, 2021 #7; Week47, 2021 #9), coverage and effectiveness may be limited due to healthcare-seeking behavior changes and the dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), which traditionally exhibits lower vaccine effectiveness (Week43, 2021 #10; Week45, 2021 #10; Week47, 2021 #14).
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, continue to complicate traditional ILI surveillance and influence trends across regions and age groups. However, rising flu activity and Influenza A(H3N2) dominance highlight influenza as the primary contributor for Week52, 2021 (Week43, 2021 #10; Week47, 2021 #10).
7. Considering the upward ILI trend through Week46, 2021, the timing aligned with peak season, the influence of dominant A(H3N2) transmission, and the gradual waning effectiveness of vaccinations, these factors strongly support the forecasted ILI occurrence of 2919 in Week52, 2021.
