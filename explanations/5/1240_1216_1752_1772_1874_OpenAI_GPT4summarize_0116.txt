1. Explanation:
1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week46, 2021 to Week50, 2021 show an overall increasing trend. Starting with 1240 in Week46, 2021, there is a slight dip to 1216 in Week47, 2021, followed by a significant rise to 1752 in Week48, 2021, 1772 in Week49, 2021, and 1874 in Week50, 2021. This steady increase suggests that flu activity is ramping up as the region progresses towards its peak season. The week-over-week growth rates are approximately -1.93%, 44.13%, 1.14%, and 5.75%, respectively. Averaging these growth rates over the increasing trajectory yields approximately 12.77% weekly growth, which projects forward into Week3, 2022.
2. Week3, 2022 belongs to the Peak season as this period historically corresponds to the highest ILI activity during flu seasons in the U.S., generally spanning from Week46 through Week6 of the following year. The data supports this classification, with Week50, 2021 already showing substantial increases in influenza positivity, ILI outpatient visits, and hospitalizations.
3. Based on correlation analysis, the steadily increasing ILI levels in the past five weeks, along with the progression into the peak season, are strong indicators of continued rising activity. To project ILI occurrences at Week3, 2022, the most recent 5-week trend is extended. Using the latest occurrence (1874) and applying the average weekly growth rate (12.77%), future ILI occurrences are forecasted by compounding:
4. ILI_forecast = 1874 × (1 + 0.1277)^3 ≈ 2084.21 ≈ 2084 (rounded to the nearest whole number).
4. Several key factors from the summarized CDC reports strongly influence the forecast:
5. 1) Influenza activity is increasing nationwide, with Week50, 2021 showing 5.6% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, significantly above earlier weeks. This elevated positivity rate aligns with the rising ILI numbers in Region 7 and suggests that the trend will persist through Week3, 2022 as flu activity continues to peak.
6. 2) The dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), which is known for causing severe flu seasons, is a notable factor. Week50, 2021 reports that nearly 100% of public health lab-positive specimens were Influenza A, predominantly subtype H3N2. The high transmissibility of this subtype likely accelerates ILI activity.
7. 3) Vaccination uptake shows early signs of being lower than in previous seasons (per Week48 and Week50, 2021 reports), reducing population immunity and exacerbating flu spread. This suboptimal vaccine coverage is reflected in the rising hospitalization and outpatient ILI visit rates.
5. In summary, the prediction of 2084 ILI occurrences in Week3, 2022 is based on the observed upward trend in ILI data, historical peak season timing, and influencing factors such as increased flu positivity, Influenza A(H3N2) dominance, and lower vaccine uptake. The application of the 12.77% weekly growth rate, derived from past data (Week46 to Week50, 2021), aligns quantitatively with the seasonal and epidemiological context to yield the forecast.
