1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a gradual upward trend, with values of ['1405', '1350', '1421', '1444', '1469']. Despite a slight dip in Week26, 2024 (1350), the subsequent weeks exhibited a consistent rise, peaking at 1469 in Week30, 2024. This trend demonstrates an increasing trajectory in ILI activity by the end of the observed period, suggesting an escalating pattern in respiratory illness occurrences.
2. A positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the upward trend in the latter weeks of the past data (Weeks28–30, 2024) aligns with the jump to 1722 future occurrences by Week35, 2024. The continuous increase from Week27, 2024 onward reflects a buildup in ILI cases that foreshadows the amplified activity observed after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses consistently hovered near 1.4% to 1.5% of total visits during Weeks26–30, 2024, remaining slightly below the national baseline. However, the marginal increase in Week30, 2024 to 1.5% hints at growing respiratory illness activity contributing to the future ILI occurrence rise after 5 weeks (Week35, 2024).
4. The co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, such as COVID-19, RSV, and rare detections of avian influenza (H5N1), was consistently emphasized in Weeks26–30, 2024. This multiplex virus activity likely compounded the burden on ILI metrics and contributed to the reported future ILI figures.
5. Despite low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 1.0% in Week26, 2024, decreasing to 0.7% in Week30, 2024), sporadic antiviral resistance mutations, such as those identified in H1N1 and B strains, were noted. These genetic variations may have impacted the transmissibility of some strains, further driving the observed increase in ILI cases by Week35, 2024.
6. In summary, the rise to 1722 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week35, 2024) can be attributed to the upward trend in past ILI data, gradual increases in outpatient respiratory illness visits, the co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens, and sporadic strain variations contributing to enhanced transmissibility.
