1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week14 to Week18, 2024 are 2003, 2143, 1755, 1808, and 1864. The trend indicates initial growth from Week14 (2003) to Week15 (2143), followed by a significant dip in Week16 (1755), and a slight increase in Week17 (1808) and Week18 (1864). Overall, this trend suggests a fluctuating but moderately declining trajectory, aligning with the broader seasonal decline in influenza activity reported by the CDC.
2. Forecasting target week (Week23, 2024) aligns with the off-season period. In the U.S., the off-season typically spans from the end of the peak season (Week6) to the next peak onset season (Week32 or later). Both the declining ILI trends and CDC's reports on reduced flu activity substantiate that Week23 belongs to the off-season.
3. From the time-series perspective, the fluctuations observed in ILI counts, coupled with a generally declining trajectory, suggest that ILI occurrences might stabilize or decrease slightly in the coming weeks. Extrapolating from this pattern, the model estimates an ILI occurrence of 1685 for Week23, 2024, consistent with low ILI activity during the off-season.
4. Flu activity is reported to be declining nationally, with a reduced percentage of positive influenza specimens each week, ranging from 7.7% in Week14 to 3.1% in Week18, 2024. This declining positivity supports the prediction of lower ILI occurrences in the coming weeks (Week14-Week18, 2024 #1 each week).
5. A cumulative hospitalization rate of 80.3 per 100,000 (as of Week18, 2024) represents a relatively high season-long burden but has continued its downward trend since January. This decline correlates with reduced ILI activity and hospitalization admissions (Week14-Week18, 2024 #4 each week).
6. Widespread co-circulation of non-influenza respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, continues; however, their impact is not driving a significant rise in ILI occurrences at this stage of the season, aligning with stable or declining flu metrics (Week14-Week18, 2024 #8 each week).
7. Lower influenza positivity, stable vaccine effectiveness, declining hospitalization rates, and off-season timing support the predicted value of 1685 for ILI occurrences in Week23, 2024. These factors indicate continued low activity and minimal fluctuations in the near term.
