1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating but relatively stable trend, starting at 1822 (Week 49, 2020) and peaking at 2237 (Week 50, 2020), followed by a decrease to 1783 (Week 51, 2020), then increasing to 1898 (Week 52, 2020) and slightly decreasing to 1867 (Week 53, 2020). This pattern demonstrates intermittent fluctuations with no significant upward or downward trajectory.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 1892 align closely with the past time-series values, particularly the relatively stable averages observed in Week 52 (1898) and Week 53 (1867), indicating continuity in moderate ILI activity as projected. The lack of dramatic fluctuations in past trends likely correlates with the relatively consistent future value reported.
3. Nationwide, outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained stable at 1.6% in all reported weeks, well below the national baseline of 2.6%, suggesting limited fluctuations in healthcare encounters due to ILI. This stability may reflect indirectly on the continuation of similar activity levels leading to the reported future occurrence.
4. Low influenza positivity rates persisted in virologic surveillance during all 5 weeks, progressively dropping to just 0.1% in Week 53, 2020. Although influenza circulation remained minimal, co-circulating respiratory illnesses, changes in healthcare-seeking patterns, and the pandemic's impact on surveillance systems may have influenced ILI activity leading to the reported future value.
5. The overarching influence of COVID-19, which dominated respiratory-related deaths under the PIC classification (ranging from 13.3% in Week 50, 2020, to 14.5% in Week 53, 2020), likely overshadowed distinct influenza-related trends and contributed to disruptions in traditional ILI surveillance. This, combined with pandemic-related behavioral shifts, may have balanced overall reported ILI activity to the relatively consistent future value of 1892.
6. In summary, the reported 1892 future ILI occurrences (Week 5, 2021) can be attributed to the stable pattern observed in the past time-series ILI occurrences, persistent low influenza activity, unchanged outpatient ILI visit proportions, and the overarching effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on ILI reporting and surveillance.
