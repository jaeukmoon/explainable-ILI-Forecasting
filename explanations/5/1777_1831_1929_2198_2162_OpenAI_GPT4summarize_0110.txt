1. The reported ILI counts from Week21, 2021 to Week25, 2021 are 1777, 1831, 1929, 2198, and 2162. The trend shows a gradual increase from Week21 to Week24, peaking at 2198 occurrences, and then slightly declining in Week25. This pattern suggests a moderate upward trajectory with a slight reduction at the end rather than a consistent rise or fall over the period.
2. Week30, 2021 appears to fall within the off-season, based on historical patterns where the off-season generally spans from Week1 to Week31 of the year. Additionally, with current influenza activity being reported as minimal (Week21, 2021 #1; Week22, 2021 #1; Week23, 2021 #1; Week24, 2021 #1; Week25, 2021 #1) and well below the national baseline of 2.6%, it aligns with the expectations of off-season behavior.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the rising trend from Week21 to Week24 followed by a slight reduction in Week25 indicates the possibility of a stabilization or plateau in the upcoming weeks. The historical pattern of increased occurrences peaking and then tapering aligns with projecting a moderate ILI occurrence of 2989 for Week30, 2021. This estimate accommodates marginal adjustments over five weeks.
4. Low influenza virus activity is consistently reported over the past five weeks, with clinical labs showing positivity rates under 0.1% or negligible detections (Week21, 2021 #1, #2; Week22, 2021 #1, #2; Week23, 2021 #1, #2; Week24, 2021 #1, #2; Week25, 2021 #1, #2).
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes and the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic complicate ILI data collection and interpretation across alternative care settings (Week21, 2021 #7; Week22, 2021 #7; Week23, 2021 #8; Week24, 2021 #7; Week25, 2021 #8), potentially leading to slight inaccuracies in observed trends.
6. The CDC has cautioned that influenza activity remains difficult to predict due to concurrent COVID-19 circulation and healthcare access impacts (Week21, 2021 #10; Week22, 2021 #10; Week23, 2021 #10; Week24, 2021 #10; Week25, 2021 #9). However, the extremely low influenza activity already observed supports expectations of continued minimal transmission in the short-term future.
7. In summary, the predicted ILI count of 2989 for Week30, 2021 is justified by the observed moderate rise in counts with recent stabilization, off-season timing, and minimal influenza activity. Challenges introduced by changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and dual surveillance with COVID-19 add complexity but do not indicate a significant deviation from these forecasts for the target week.
