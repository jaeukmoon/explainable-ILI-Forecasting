1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values of ['14144', '14344', '13771', '13570', '13067']. Starting at 14144 in Week 26, 2022, the ILI occurrences peaked briefly at 14344 in Week 27, 2022, before steadily dropping in the subsequent weeks, reaching the lowest value of 13067 in Week 30, 2022. This downward trend reflects a reduction in ILI activity over the observed period.
2. Despite the overall decline in past occurrences, the future ILI occurrences of 15856 signal a sharp reversal. This suggests a delayed resurgence or a potential seasonal variation that counters the decreasing trend in Weeks 26–30, 2022. A lag effect, where ILI surges occur after periods of minimal activity, aligns with the sudden rise in future occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable, hovering between 1.6% and 1.7%, over Weeks 26-30, 2022. However, the disproportionately high ILI activity observed among children aged 0-4 years (e.g., 7.4% in Week 26, 6.4% in Week 30, 2022) indicates an age-specific vulnerability that could contribute to a future spike in ILI.
4. Persistent increases in PIC mortality rates, climbing from 8.8% in Week 26, 2022, to 10.0% in Week 30, 2022, reflect heightened respiratory illness activity that includes conditions beyond influenza. This elevated baseline likely encourages eventual spillover effects into ILI incidence, contributing to the future surge.
5. Multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and RSV) continued to co-circulate during Weeks 26-30, 2022, complicating the understanding of ILI trends. The interplay among these pathogens, alongside evolving healthcare-seeking behaviors post-COVID-19, disrupts traditional surveillance and could obscure growing ILI escalation, culminating in the reported future value of 15856.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 15856 (Week 35, 2022) arises from underlying factors like age-focused outpatient activity, elevated PIC mortality, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and surveillance disruptions. Despite the declining past trend, latent seasonal dynamics and delayed effects align with the observed ILI resurgence.
