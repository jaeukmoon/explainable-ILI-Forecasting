1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week43 to Week47, 2020, are 1544, 1705, 2092, 2178, and 2157, respectively. The trend shows a sharp increase from Week43 (1544) to Week45 (2092), followed by a slight increase until Week46 (2178), and stabilizing through Week47 (2157). Overall, this trend indicates a rapid early rise, slowing to stability without a significant decline.
2. The target week (None) falls within the U.S. Off-season. In the U.S., this period typically corresponds to low-level influenza activity, which aligns with the ongoing low positivity rates of ILI reports and limited influenza spread detailed during Week43–Week47, 2020 (Week43, 2020 #1, Week44, 2020 #1, Week47, 2020 #1).
3. Correlation analysis indicates that the stabilization observed during Week46 (2178) and Week47 (2157) suggests the prediction for future ILI counts will trend slightly down but remain close to the current levels due to the absence of notable surges or declines. Projecting this historical pattern forward, ILI occurrences are forecasted as 1898.
4. Influenza-like illness positivity remains exceptionally low during Week43–Week47, 2020 (e.g., Week43 #1 at 0.2%, Week44 #1 at 0.1%, Week47 #1 at 0.2%), pointing to reduced transmission rates.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior and flu reporting have been significantly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing traditional ILI data's reliability (Week43, 2020 #9, Week46, 2020 #8, Week47, 2020 #6). This factor likely contributes to the flat ILI patterns.
6. Annual flu vaccinations are heavily encouraged (Week43, 2020 #8, Week44, 2020 #8, Week47, 2020 #8), which may reduce the severity and spread of influenza, serving as a stabilizing factor for future ILI counts.
7. Considering the stabilized recent ILI trends, off-season timing, low positivity rates, and influences like COVID-19 healthcare behavior and vaccination campaigns, the predicted ILI occurrences after 5 weeks are expected to decrease slightly, yielding a forecast of 1898.
