1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week52, 2020 to Week3, 2021 are 1175, 1271, 1454, 1284, and 1170. The trend initially rises from Week52, 2020 (1175) to Week1, 2021 (1454), marking a slight peak before declining to Week3, 2021 (1170). This overall pattern suggests a modest fluctuation with no significant sustained increase or extreme spikes in activity.
2. Week8, 2021 occurs after the typical peak season (Week46 of the previous year to Week6 of the current year). Considering the steady decline in ILI activity observed and the overall low influenza circulation, it aligns more with the off-season period. Therefore, Week8, 2021 is forecasted to belong to the off-season.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the modest fluctuations in the past 5 weeks' ILI trends and the recent decline suggest continuing low levels of ILI occurrences. Extending this trajectory to five weeks forward indicates no dramatic changes, leading to the projected value of 1013 for Week8, 2021.
4. Influenza activity remains historically low with minimal positivity rates for respiratory specimens: 0.3% to 0.1% across Weeks52, 2020 (Week52, 2020 #1), Week2, 2021 (#1), and Week3, 2021 (#1).
5. Seasonal influenza-associated hospitalizations are significantly lower than average for this point in the season, with cumulative rates at 0.5 per 100,000 population (Week1, 2021 #7, Week2, 2021 #5). This strongly correlates with suppressed ILI activity and reduced overall prevalence of influenza.
6. Ongoing COVID-19 conditions suppress traditional flu transmission and ILI surveillance (Week52, 2020 #9; Week53, 2020 #9; Week2, 2021 #9). Healthcare-seeking behaviors and reduced influenza spread contribute strongly to keeping ILI counts low, as observed in this season's trends.
7. The projected ILI occurrence of 1013 reflects the declining trend in ILI counts, influenced by suppressed influenza transmission due to overlapping COVID-19 impacts, historically low hospitalization and positivity rates, and alignment with off-season timing. This forecast emphasizes ongoing minimal flu activity in Week8, 2021.
