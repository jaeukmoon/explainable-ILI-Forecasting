1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week6, 2022 to Week10, 2022) show a fluctuating pattern, with values ['1063', '870', '773', '893', '1011']. The overall trend is slightly increasing from Week8 (773) to Week10 (1011) following an initial dip from Week6 (1063) to Week8. This suggests a gradual recovery in ILI activity, particularly in Weeks9 and 10.
2. The target Week15, 2022 falls within the "Peak season" as influenza activity is expected to rise based on historical seasonal patterns. The summarized CDC reports highlight increasing flu activity through Weeks9 and 10, aligning with the typical timeline of peak flu season, which can continue into April (Week15) in certain years.
3. To estimate ILI occurrences for Week15, 2022, a progression from past trends is modeled. Using the time-series values, the percentage change between consecutive weeks is calculated: From Week6 to Week7 (-18.1%), Week7 to Week8 (-11.1%), Week8 to Week9 (+15.5%), and Week9 to Week10 (+13.2%). The average percentage increase over the last two weeks is approximately +14.35%. Applying this average change sequentially to Week10 (1011), we calculate 1011 × (1 + 14.35%) ≈ 1157 for Week11 and 1157 × (1 + 14.35%) ≈ 1166 for Week15. This reflects an underlying upward momentum indicative of the increasing activity observed in the reports.
4. Based on the CDC reports, at least three factors strongly influence the forecast:
5. 1) The dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) with antigenic differences suggests sustained transmission. Antigenic differences likely reduce vaccine effectiveness, contributing to increased ILI activity. Quantitatively, this supports maintaining or increasing the upward trend observed in the data.
6. 2) Vaccination rates are lower than in prior seasons, limiting community immunity and enabling broader virus spread. This exacerbates the activity of ILI occurrences, aligning with the observed rise in ILI in Weeks9 and 10.
7. 3) Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory viruses adds to the complexity of the outbreak. The compounding effects of co-infections contribute to the steady resurgence and likely amplify the trajectory, pushing the expected ILI activity further upward toward 1166 by Week15.
5. The forecast for Week15, 2022, is strongly tied to the upward trend in past ILI occurrences, the classification of Week15 as peak season, and key CDC-reported factors like antigenic mismatches, lower vaccination, and co-circulation of other respiratory illnesses. These elements collectively justify the predicted future occurrences for Week15, 2022, as 1166.
