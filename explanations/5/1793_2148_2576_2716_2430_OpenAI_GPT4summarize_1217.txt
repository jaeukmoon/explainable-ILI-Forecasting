1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks indicated fluctuating but overall decreasing activity, with values of ['1793', '2148', '2576', '2716', '2430']. ILI occurrences peaked at 2716 in Week 45, 2020, following a steady increase from 1793 in Week 43, 2020, before declining to 2430 in Week 47, 2020. Despite the dip in the final week, the preceding weeks showed significant ILI activity, suggesting heightened initial occurrences driving later trends.
2. A declining future trend is evident in the future occurrences (1175), correlating with the observed decrease from the peak in Week 45, 2020, to Week 47, 2020. This decline in the latter half of the time series contributes to the eventual drop in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks but remains consistent with the elevated levels observed earlier.
3. ILI outpatient visits displayed a gradual increase from 1.2% (Week 43, 2020) to 1.6% (Week 47, 2020) while remaining below the national 2.6% baseline. The marginal rise in visits signals stable respiratory illness engagement, contributing to the ongoing moderate ILI activity.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) were consistently above epidemic thresholds, rising from 8.2% (Week 43, 2020) to 11.3% (Week 47, 2020). The elevated PIC mortality highlights a respiratory burden supporting the observed ILI occurrences. However, the primary driver in these statistics was COVID-19 rather than influenza, which aligns with low future ILI projections.
5. Flu activity remained unusually low across the observed period, indicated by minimal positivity rates (0.2% in Week 43–47, 2020) for respiratory specimens. The reduction of influenza virus circulation due to the COVID-19 pandemic explains the decline to 1175 future occurrences, suggesting minimal flu-driven ILI activity.
6. The impact of changing healthcare-seeking behavior amidst the COVID-19 pandemic affected traditional ILI reporting, potentially underestimating or delaying case recognition. Although these disruptions limited an accurate assessment, they likely contributed to the adaptation of gradually decreasing ILI trends as reflected in future projections.
7. In summary, the reported 1175 future ILI occurrences (Week 52, 2020) can be attributed to the observed decline in past ILI occurrences after Week 45, reduced influenza virus circulation, decreasing influenza-related outpatient engagement, and pandemic-driven behavioral changes impacting ILI surveillance and reporting.
