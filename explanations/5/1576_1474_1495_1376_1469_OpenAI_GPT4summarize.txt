1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating pattern with no strong upward or downward trend in reported values: ['1576' (Week 23, 2021), '1474' (Week 24, 2021), '1495' (Week 25, 2021), '1376' (Week 26, 2021), '1469' (Week 27, 2021)]. While Week 26 showed a notable decline, the values over Week 25 to Week 27 exhibited relative stability, reflecting a consistently low level of influenza-like illness activity during this period.

2. A notable positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed despite the stability in earlier weeks (Weeks 23–27, 2021). The future ILI occurrence of 2456 represents a significant rise, likely influenced by underlying factors such as delayed case detection or healthcare-seeking patterns. The stable yet slightly fluctuating ILI occurrences in the past weeks may serve as a precursor to the observed rise after 5 weeks (Week 32, 2021).

3. During Week 27, ILI outpatient visits showed a slight increase to 1.3%, compared to the 1.2% consistency in prior weeks. This marginal growth in outpatient activity corresponds to a trend of slowly rising respiratory illness activity, potentially contributing to the elevated ILI level of 2456 after 5 weeks.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds across Weeks 23–27, 2021, with values ranging from 7.6% (Week 23) to 6.2% (Week 26). Though primarily driven by COVID-19 mortality, this persistent PIC activity suggests an underlying burden of respiratory illnesses, paving the way for heightened ILI activity in the future.
5. Healthcare disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as consistently emphasized in CDC reports, have altered healthcare-seeking behaviors and complicated data interpretation. Such disruptions likely underreported early ILI cases, contributing to the sharp observed rise to 2456 occurrences in Week 32, 2021.
6. Despite minimal influenza positivity rates in public health (e.g., 0.1% in Week 24, 2021), the coexistence of other non-influenza respiratory illnesses and consistent COVID-19 transmission may have amplified reported ILI cases in Week 32, 2021. Virologic data limitations and shifts in healthcare patterns further confound the distinction between influenza-specific and broader respiratory syndromes.

7. In summary, the reported 2456 future ILI occurrences (Week 32, 2021) are likely the result of persistent low-level ILI activity (Weeks 23–27, 2021), slight increases in ILI-related outpatient encounters, PIC mortality consistently exceeding thresholds, and the impact of pandemic-driven disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior and surveillance systems. This context explains the observed jump in ILI cases after 5 weeks.
