1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the observed 5 weeks (Weeks10–14, 2023) displayed a steady decline, with values of ['14829', '14594', '14942', '14370', '13379']. After an initial slight decrease from 14829 (Week10, 2023) to 14594 (Week11, 2023), there was a small uptick in Week12, 2023 (14942), followed by consecutive decreases to reach 13379 by Week14, 2023. This overall declining trend suggests subdued influenza-like activity.
2. A negative correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The sustained decline in ILI occurrences during Weeks10–14, 2023, does not directly align with the substantial drop to 12870 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week19, 2023). However, the persistent downward trajectory in the last 3 weeks (Weeks12–14, 2023) appears as a precursor to the reported drop in Week19, 2023.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below the national baseline of 2.5%, decreasing slightly from 2.4% in Week10, 2023, to 2.1% in Week14, 2023. This steady reduction in healthcare visits for ILI indicates reduced respiratory illness activity, contributing to the future decline in occurrences. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) remained a factor, as these may have influenced traditional ILI trends.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) were above epidemic thresholds but declined from 8.6% in Week10, 2023, to 7.6% in Week14, 2023, mirroring the reduced ILI activity. This decline in PIC mortality correlates with the reported diminished occurrences after Week19, 2023.
5. Stable antiviral susceptibility and the absence of significant mutations or novel influenza strains across the 5-week report reduced immediate concerns of an influenza resurgence. Combined with seasonal stability and continued vaccination efforts, these elements helped suppress ILI occurrences in future weeks.
6. In summary, the drop in future ILI occurrences to 12870 by Week19, 2023, aligns with the overall declining trend in past ILI occurrences (Weeks10–14, 2023), reduced outpatient ILI visits, declining PIC mortality rates, and effective containment strategies (e.g., vaccination and antiviral responses). These factors collectively contributed to the mitigated influenza-like illness burden in the subsequent period.
