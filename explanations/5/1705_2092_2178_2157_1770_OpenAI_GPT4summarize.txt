1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Week 44 to Week 48, 2020) showed significant fluctuation. There was an initial sharp rise from 1705 in Week 44, 2020, to 2092 in Week 45, 2020, followed by a smaller increase to 2178 in Week 46, 2020. However, the values then dropped to 2157 in Week 47, 2020, and further to 1770 in Week 48, 2020. This indicates a peak in Week 46, followed by a steep decline toward the last observed week.

2. A partial correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences can be observed. The return to a slightly lower value (1770 in Week 48, 2020) suggests that while ILI activity declined toward the end of the past time-series, it stabilized enough to predict a modest rebound. This aligns with the reported future occurrence of 1867, which reflects a small upward adjustment after the drop.

3. Historical outpatient ILI visit percentages gradually but steadily increased from 1.3% in Week 44, 2020, to 1.6% in Week 48, 2020, indicative of an incremental rise in healthcare interactions related to influenza-like symptoms over this timeframe. This trend, even though below the national baseline of 2.6%, provides groundwork for recovery in ILI cases leading to the reported future high.

4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, showing concerning increases from 8.1% in Week 44, 2020, to 12.8% in Week 48, 2020. While primarily driven by COVID-19, the heightened PIC mortality suggests a sustained burden of respiratory illnesses, which aligns with the reported elevated future ILI activity.

5. CDC reports noted that COVID-19-driven changes to healthcare-seeking behaviors disrupted traditional ILI surveillance and data interpretation. This factor likely impacted the responsiveness of flu activity reporting, potentially contributing to underrecognized or delayed ILI activity that re-emerges as the increased future occurrence of 1867.

6. Although influenza activity and positivity rates remained low throughout Weeks 44–48, 2020 (e.g., 0.1% to 0.2%), the CDC emphasized that extensive public health measures, such as masking and social distancing, likely suppressed flu spread during this period. However, diminished flu activity during these weeks suggests the potential for respiratory illnesses, including non-specific ILI, to resurge later, as evidenced by the noted rise in occurrences after 5 weeks.

7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1867 (Week 53, 2020) can be explained by the peak in Week 46 followed by stabilization, the consistent upward trends in outpatient ILI visits, elevated PIC deaths indicating respiratory illness persistence, surveillance disruptions due to the pandemic, and suppressed flu activity likely leading to delayed or redistributed respiratory illness patterns.
