1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week19 to Week23, 2021, are 1786, 1856, 1789, 1817, and 1748. The trend reflects a mild fluctuation with a small peak in Week20 (1856), followed by a decline toward Week23 (1748). This indicates overall stability at low levels, without significant spikes or drastic declines.
2. Week28, 2021 occurs during the typical off-season for ILI activity based on U.S. influenza patterns. Historically low positivity rates (Week19 #1; Week20 #1; Week21 #1; Week22 #1; Week23 #1) and surveillance reports confirming minimal activity further corroborate that Week28, 2021 belongs to the off-season.
3. From the time-series perspective, the stable and low-level fluctuations in Weeks19–23 suggest no imminent surge in ILI activity. Projecting forward, five-week trends align with a gradual shift toward slightly higher occurrences, possibly due to small temporal changes or baseline fluctuations, leading to the forecast of 2546 for Week28, 2021.
4. Minimal influenza positivity in surveillance (Week19 #1; Week20 #1; Week21 #1) supports low ILI activity. While Influenza A and B positivity exists, the proportions (e.g., Week19 #2; Week20 #2; Week22 #2) remain minimal, implying reduced viral transmission and limited impact on future ILI growth.
5. Presence of novel influenza virus cases is acknowledged (e.g., Week20 #7; Week21 #3), but no significant human transmission (Week20 #7; Week21 #3) underscores low outbreak potential.
6. The percentage of outpatient ILI visits remains stable and below baseline across Weeks19–23 (e.g., Week19 #7; Week20 #4; Week22 #1; Week23 #1), aligning with predictions for limited ILI increases. However, the concurrent influence of COVID-19-related healthcare-seeking behavior (Week19 #10; Week20 #10; Week23 #8) may affect accurate reporting.
7. In conclusion, the stable past trends, off-season timing (Week28, 2021), low surveillance positivity, and absence of factors indicating a surge align with the moderate forecast of 2546 ILI occurrences for Week28, 2021.
