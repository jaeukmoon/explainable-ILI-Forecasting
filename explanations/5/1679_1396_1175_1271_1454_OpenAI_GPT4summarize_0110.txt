1. The reported ILI counts from Week50, 2020 to Week1, 2021 are 1679, 1396, 1175, 1271, and 1454. This trend indicates a general decline from Week50 (1679) to Week52 (1175) followed by a moderate increase in Week1 (1454). Overall, the pattern suggests an initial decrease with subsequent fluctuations rather than consistent growth or stability.
2. In the U.S., Week6, 2021 falls within the latter part of the peak season, which typically spans from Week46 of the prior year to Week6 of the current year. Although influenza activity has remained unusually low in this timeframe, Week6, 2021 is projected to align with the peak season based on historical seasonality.
3. Time-series analysis suggests that despite the observed fluctuations in ILI counts, the overall declining pattern followed by a mild rebound infers a diminished trajectory of ILI occurrences. Projections for Week6, 2021 account for continued reductions influenced by suppressed flu transmission, settling at 990.
4. Influenza activity has been strikingly low, with respiratory specimen positivity consistently below 0.5% across Weeks50, 2020 to Week1, 2021, reflecting suppressed virus circulation likely related to pandemic-era behaviors and interventions (Week50, 2020 #1; Week52, 2020 #1; Week1, 2021 #1).
5. COVID-19 has significantly influenced healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance systems, complicating reporting accuracy and suppressing influenza transmission (Week50, 2020 #10; Week53, 2020 #9; Week1, 2021 #9). This indirectly reduced the spread of influenza viruses, maintaining ILI counts below typical seasonal levels.
6. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza hospitalization and ICU rates remain notably lower than average during this period (Week50, 2020 #6; Week53, 2020 #7; Week1, 2021 #7). Additionally, low vaccine uptake trends and potential vaccine hesitancy limit further reduction in ILI counts (Week51, 2020 #7; Week53, 2020 #10; Week1, 2021 #8).
7. The forecasted ILI occurrence for Week6, 2021 at 990 is justified by the observed declining yet fluctuating ILI trends, classification within the peak season, suppressed transmission driven by COVID-19 interventions, and lower-than-average hospitalizations. These interacting factors collectively explain the drop relative to previous weeks.
