1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week18 to Week22, 2024 are 12849, 12862, 13038, 12688, and 11996. Influenza activity shows a gradual decrease in this period. Minor fluctuations were observed, with Week18 to Week20 showing slight increases (12849 to 13038), followed by a consistent declining trend starting in Week21 (12688) and extending to Week22 (11996). This downward trajectory indicates diminishing influenza-like illness occurrences.
2. The target week (Week27, 2024) falls within the typical off-season, given that the peak season ends around Week6 and the peak onset season begins around Week32 (Week27 aligns with the off-season period). The declining ILI activity observed in Weeks18 to 22, 2024 further corroborates this classification.
3. The time-series trend reflects a steady decrease in occurrences, aligning with a return to off-season levels after Week22. Historical patterns of ILI occurrences during the off-season and the observed downward trend suggest a lower predicted value for Week27, 2024. Extrapolating from the most recent data, the model forecasts further reductions due to ongoing low activity, approaching 7806 occurrences.
4. Influenza positivity rates have been steadily declining across the past weeks (Week18: 3.1%, Week19: 2.4%, Week20: 2%, Week21: 1.7%, Week22: 1.8%), reflecting significantly reduced transmission and national baseline levels. This low positivity suggests sustained low ILI activity heading into Week27.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 remains a contributing factor to ILI trends (Week18 #10, Week19 #9, Week20 #10, Week21 #12, Week22 #10). However, their influence does not indicate a significant upward trend, as influenza-specific activity continues to remain low.
6. Current vaccine components effectively match circulating influenza strains (Week21 #13, Week22 #13), maintaining high vaccine effectiveness and limiting the spread of influenza. Furthermore, antiviral susceptibility testing demonstrates minimal resistance (Week18 #7, Week21 #11), enabling continued disease mitigation.
7. The projected ILI occurrence of 7806 for Week27, 2024 results from the observed downward trend (Weeks18–22), off-season timing, and mitigating factors such as effective vaccination, low positivity rates, and diminished flu activity. These factors collectively justify the forecast of reduced ILI activity.
