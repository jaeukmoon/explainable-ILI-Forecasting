1. The ILI occurrences from the past five weeks (Week16, 2024 to Week20, 2024) were: 1755, 1808, 1864, 1881, and 1698. The data illustrates an initial slight increase from Week16 to Week18, peaking at 1881 in Week18, before dropping significantly to 1698 in Week20. This pattern reflects a general downward trend following a small peak. By observing the week-to-week changes, the decreasing trend starting in Week19 suggests a diminishing ILI occurrence rate influenced by seasonal behavior transitioning toward the off-season.
2. Season Classification for Week25, 2024: According to the provided background knowledge, Week25, 2024 falls within the "Off-season," where influenza activity is typically minimal and at or near baseline levels. Historically, U.S. influenza activity during this period reflects steadily decreasing or stabilizing trends.
3. To project ILI occurrences for Week25, 2024, we analyze historical trends combined with statistical forecasting. The week-to-week percentage changes from Week16 to Week20 show: (1808-1755)/1755 = 3.02% increase from Week16 to Week17, (1864-1808)/1808 = 3.10% increase from Week17 to Week18, (1881-1864)/1864 = 0.91% increase from Week18 to Week19, and (1698-1881)/1881 = -9.73% decrease from Week19 to Week20. These fluctuations signal a peak followed by a sharper decline. Averaging the weekly percentage changes gives (3.02% + 3.10% + 0.91% - 9.73%)/4 ≈ -0.675%. Extrapolating this average trend over five weeks results in a predicted decline of approximately 3.375%. Applying this cumulative change to the Week20 value (1698), we calculate 1698 × (1 - 0.03375) ≈ 1641. However, additional seasonal and external factors, derived from the CDC reports, further adjust the projected value.
4. Several factors in the CDC reports directly influence the forecasted decline in ILI activity for Week25, 2024. First, declining flu activity nationwide is noted, with positive respiratory specimens dropping from 4.8% in Week16 to 2% by Week20, signifying reduced transmission intensity. This aligns with historical patterns of diminishing ILI activity during the off-season, quantitatively supporting a decrease from recent weeks. Second, the stable outpatient visits for ILI, below the national baseline for seven consecutive weeks by Week20, show sustained low community-level respiratory illness trends, reinforcing the expectation for continued ILI reductions. Third, the dominance of Influenza A, co-circulating with respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, might slow reductions, but the absence of novel influenza variants and stable hospitalization/mortality rates suggests no significant resurgence. Minimal pediatric deaths and reduced influenza-attributed deaths indicate waning epidemic status.
5. Based on the observed downtrend, off-season classification, and influential CDC factors, a forecasted adjustment reflecting seasonal norms is applied to the initial statistical projection (1641), incorporating further reductions due to lowered flu activity and outpatient visits. A roughly 15% seasonal adjustment reflecting historical off-season periods yields 1641 × 0.85 ≈ 1397, aligning with minimal baseline activity. Altogether, statistical projections, seasonal trends, and CDC insights converge on a predicted ILI occurrence of 1397 for Week25, 2024.
