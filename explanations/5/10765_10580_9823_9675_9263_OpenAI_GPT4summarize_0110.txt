1. The ILI occurrences from Week7 to Week11, 2023 were 11935, 11485, 11581, 11262, and 10723, showing a clear downward trend over five weeks. This decline suggests reduced transmission or improved control measures, with no signs of resurgence or significant variability.
2. Forecasting Week21, 2023 aligns with the off-season for ILI activity in the U.S., as it falls well after the typical peak season (Week46 to Week6), and influenza activity has remained consistently low throughout the observed period.
3. From a time-series perspective, the steady decline in ILI counts over the past five weeks indicates a continuation of the trend toward stabilization or further reduction. Extrapolating this pattern with diminishing weekly declines suggests a projected ILI count nearing 9263 for Week21, 2023.
4. Influenza activity remained nationally low, with less than 1.0% positivity in respiratory specimens across Weeks9 to Week11, 2023, indicating minimal viral spread.
5. The seasonal vaccine matches circulating influenza strains, and nearly all tested viruses remain susceptible to recommended antiviral drugs, reducing the likelihood of unexpected spikes in ILI activity (Week7, 2023 #7; Week8, 2023 #9; Week10, 2023 #7).
6. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, persists, impacting overall ILI trends without indicating a significant increase in flu-specific activity (Week7, 2023 #9; Week9, 2023 #10; Week11, 2023 #9).
7. The forecasted ILI occurrence of 9263 for Week21, 2023 reflects the ongoing off-season period influenced by declining ILI trends, effective vaccination and antiviral measures, and consistent low influenza activity, alongside stable co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens.
