1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks display a consistent upward trend, with values ['1859', '2036', '2285', '2456', '2751']. Beginning with 1859 (Week29, 2021), the occurrences steadily climbed week by week, culminating at 2751 in Week33, 2021. This consistent increase over the five-week period reflects a sustained rise in respiratory illness activity.
2. The upward trajectory in past ILI occurrences strongly correlates with the future value of 2736 at Week38, 2021. The peak occurrence of 2751 in Week33, 2021 serves as a precursor for high ILI levels, with a slight stabilization reflected in the future occurrence of 2736, maintaining the elevated levels observed during the latter part of the input series.
3. Outpatient ILI visits increased over four weeks, rising from 1.7% (Week29, 2021) to 2.2% (Week33, 2021), with age-specific spikes among groups 0–4, 5–24, and 25–49 years. These continuous increases align with the overall rise in weekly ILI occurrences, contributing to the elevated future count of 2736. PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) percentages escalated from 7.4% (Week29, 2021) to 17.2% (Week33, 2021), maintaining epidemic threshold levels and highlighting persistent respiratory illness activity likely influencing ILI trends. Regions with high/moderate ILI activity multiplied from one jurisdiction in Week29, 2021 to two jurisdictions and 27 CBSAs (Week33, 2021), indicating expanded localized transmission that reinforces the sustained increase in future occurrences.
4. Variability in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted surveillance systems, creating a potential lag and overrepresentation of ILI activity in subsequent data, as denoted across all summarized reports for Weeks29–33, 2021. This distortion likely fueled the persistence of elevated ILI values observed after 5 weeks.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2736 (Week38, 2021) can be attributed to the steady upward trend in Weeks29–33, 2021, continuous increases in outpatient ILI visit percentages, sustained PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, expanding high/moderate ILI activity, and pandemic-related distortions in healthcare-seeking and reporting systems. These elements collectively sustained high respiratory illness activity levels reflected in the future data.
