1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall downward trend, with values of ['13095', '12870', '12523', '12011', '12674']. There was a consistent decline from 13095 (Week18, 2023) to 12011 (Week21, 2023), followed by a slight rebound to 12674 in Week22, 2023. This pattern indicates a general reduction in ILI activity over the observed period, though a minor uptick is noted in the final week.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the declining trend over the 5 weeks (Weeks18–22, 2023) does not align directly with the significant decrease in future ILI occurrences to 7930 by Week27, 2023. The drop-in values likely represents the continuation of the overall downward trend following Week22, 2023.
3. Multiple CDC report factors correlate with the future ILI decline. First, the outpatient visits for ILI remained stable and below the national baseline (1.9%-2.0%) across Weeks18-22, 2023, reflecting the limited spread of respiratory illnesses. Second, influenza positivity rates remained minimal (0.9%-1.2%) during the 5 weeks, supporting the notion of reduced influenza activity contributing to the ILI decrease. Third, co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, mentioned across the reports, continued at lower levels without significantly increasing ILI occurrences, maintaining minimal seasonal influenza risk.
4. The declining ILI occurrences to 7930 by Week27, 2023, can be attributed to the consistent reduction in past ILI trends, stable outpatient visit rates below national thresholds, minimal positivity rates for influenza, and the absence of notable surges in other respiratory pathogens. Together, these factors suggest a sustained reduction in ILI-related activity during the observed period.
