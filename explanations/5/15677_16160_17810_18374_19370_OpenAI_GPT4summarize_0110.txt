1. The reported ILI counts from Week38 to Week42, 2023 are 15677, 16160, 17810, 18374, and 19370. The trend demonstrates a steady and consistent increase over the five-week period, reflecting progressive growth in ILI occurrences, with no fluctuations or dips. This persistent upward trajectory indicates building transmission.
2. Forecasting target week (Week47, 2023) belongs to the Peak season, as Week47 typically falls within the national peak season that spans Week46 to about Week6 of the subsequent year. Additionally, the reported steady increase in ILI trends and the modest rise in hospitalization and outpatient visit rates in Week42, 2023 suggests the transition into heightened activity associated with the onset of the peak season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the consistent upward trend in occurrences from Week38 to Week42, 2023 suggests a sustained rise in ILI activity. This pattern, when extrapolated over the next five weeks, aligns with historical seasonal dynamics that result in intensified transmission, culminating in the predicted count of 26404 for Week47, 2023.
4. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and influenza contributes to the ILI burden across regions (Week38, 2023 #8; Week42, 2023 #8). This ongoing presence increases the likelihood of higher outpatient visits and ILI reports.
5. Modest increases in outpatient respiratory illness visits, particularly among younger age groups (e.g., 0–4 years), have been consistently observed, signaling heightened vulnerabilities in certain populations (Week39, 2023 #3; Week40, 2023 #8; Week42, 2023 #5).
6. Influenza activity indicators report regional increases and rising positivity rates, climbing from 0.9% in Week38, 2023 to 1.7% in Week42, 2023 (Week38, 2023 #1; Week42, 2023 #1). This trend highlights a progressing influenza season likely to further accelerate heading into the peak period.
7. The consistent week-over-week rise in ILI occurrences, alignment with the historical peak season, co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, increased vulnerability in key age groups, and rising influenza positivity strongly justify a predicted ILI occurrence of 26404 in Week47, 2023.
