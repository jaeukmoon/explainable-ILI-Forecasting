1. The reported ILI counts from Week36 to Week40, 2021, are 1743, 1887, 1889, 1978, and 2037. This data shows a clear upward trend, with a steady and incremental increase over the five weeks. The progression indicates a consistent rise in ILI activity without any significant fluctuations or sharp changes.
2. In the U.S., Week45, 2021, falls into the peak onset season as this period generally spans Week35 to Week46, just before the peak season begins. Additionally, the consistent increase in ILI activity further supports this classification for Week45, 2021.
3. From a time-series perspective, the regular upward trend of ILI occurrences from Week36 through Week40, 2021, suggests a continuation of growth over the next 5 weeks. Projecting forward, the upward trajectory aligns with the predicted occurrence of 2297 cases in Week45, 2021, representing a continuation of the rising pattern seen in past weeks.
4. ILI activity has remained low nationwide with outpatient visit percentages below the 2.6% national baseline (Week36, Week37, Week38, Week39, Week40, 2021 #1). However, incremental increases in ILI cases and respiratory illness visits may be attributed to other respiratory viruses driving transmission (Week36, Week37, Week39, 2021 #2; Week40, 2021 #10). While direct influenza activity remains minimal, this broader context of respiratory illnesses influences the upward trend.
5. The circulation of influenza remains minimal, with clinical labs consistently showing very low positivity rates for influenza specimens (Week36, Week37, Week38, Week39, Week40, 2021 #3; Week40, 2021 #1). However, the gradual rise in ILI occurrences may reflect new viral dynamics, particularly the presence of novel viruses such as the A(H1N2)v identified in Week37, 2021 (Week37, 2021 #2).
6. Vaccination trends show limited reporting, with the CDC continuing to emphasize vaccination recommendations (Week36, Week37, Week38, Week39, Week40, 2021 #8). It is critical to note that vaccination rates by Week40, 2021, could potentially play a role in modulating future ILI activity, particularly as seasonal influenza vaccines gain broader uptake around this time of year.
7. The combination of a consistent upward trend in ILI cases, the overlap with the peak onset season by Week45, 2021, the influence of non-influenza respiratory viruses, and minimal influenza circulation make 2297 a plausible projection for Week45, 2021. The low influenza activity, co-circulating respiratory pathogens, and uncertainties related to healthcare behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic further support this gradual rise without a dramatic spike.
