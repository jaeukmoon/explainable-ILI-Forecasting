1. The past ILI occurrences (Week24 to Week28, 2022) were 17486, 15495, 14144, 14344, and 13771. This data reflects a consistent decline in ILI counts between Week24 (17486) and Week28 (13771), with a minor uptick observed in Week27 (14344). Overall, the trend shows a steady decrease with negligible fluctuations, indicating reduced transmission or reporting levels post-initial decline.
2. Forecasting target week (Week33, 2022) belongs to the off-season. This classification is consistent with low influenza positivity rates, reduced hospitalization numbers, and "minimal" activity reported in most jurisdictions in the prior weeks. Additionally, historical patterns and the defined off-season period confirm Week33 falls within the off-season timeframe.
3. The time-series trend indicates a steady decline in ILI occurrences from Week24 to Week28, with no significant spikes. Applying this trend to a forecasting framework suggests continued reductions with stabilization or a slight plateau in the coming weeks. This supports the expected ILI occurrence of 13526 for Week33, 2022.
4. Multiple CDC-reported factors influence this forecast:
5. - Influenza positivity rates progressively declined from 2.5% in Week24 to 0.7% by Week28, reinforcing reduced transmission and minimal activity (Week24, 2022 #1; Week28, 2022 #1).
6. - Outpatient ILI visits remained low, decreasing from 1.9% in Week24 to 1.6% by Week28, further reflecting less widespread respiratory illness transmission (Week24, 2022 #4; Week28, 2022 #3).
7. - Continued co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, along with altered healthcare-seeking behaviors, adds uncertainty but does not indicate significant upward pressure on ILI (Week28, 2022 #8).
5. Mortality trends and hospitalization data point toward reduced influenza impact: deaths attributed to influenza were minimal compared to levels attributed to other pathogens (e.g., COVID-19), and lab-confirmed flu hospitalizations steadily dropped (Week28, 2022 #4; Week28, 2022 #5).
6. The absence of notable influenza-associated pediatric deaths for multiple weeks, combined with minimal or no reports of atypical flu activity or emergent variants, highlights stability in flu dynamics and provides no indication of a sudden surge (Week27, 2022 #7; Week28, 2022 #6).
7. In summary, the forecasted Week33 occurrence of 13526 reflects the downward trend in ILI occurrences, the off-season timing, reduced influenza positivity rates, minimal outpatient visits, decreased hospitalizations, stable mortality trends, and no emergent variant-driven impacts. Collectively, these factors support a moderate continuation of current ILI levels within the declining trajectory.
