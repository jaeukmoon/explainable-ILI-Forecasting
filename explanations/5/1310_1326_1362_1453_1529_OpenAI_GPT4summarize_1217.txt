1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistently increasing trend, with values of ['1310', '1326', '1362', '1453', '1529']. The increase from 1310 (Week8, 2023) to 1529 (Week12, 2023) indicates a steady growth in ILI cases, potentially signaling persistent respiratory illness activity that could contribute to the reported 1205 future ILI occurrences.
2. Despite the upward trajectory in past ILI occurrences, the future ILI count of 1205 suggests a decline after Week12, 2023. This divergence could result from the stabilization of key metrics (e.g., hospitalizations and outpatient visits) reported in the CDC summaries, reflecting a delayed moderation of ILI activity after the observed peak in Week12, 2023.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable or slightly declined in the past weeks, from 2.6% (Week8, 2023) to 2.3% (Week12, 2023), falling below the national baseline. This consistent decrease during the later weeks might explain the reduced future ILI occurrences, suggesting a tapering in respiratory illness trends.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) decreased from 9.2% (Week8, 2023) to 8.3% (Week12, 2023) but remained above the epidemic threshold. This gradual decline alongside low influenza positivity indicates reduced severe outcomes of respiratory illnesses, potentially tempering future ILI activity.
5. Other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, continued to co-circulate but were reported as stable or minimal in most regions by Week12, 2023. Combined with effective vaccination and antiviral susceptibility, this containment of co-circulating pathogens likely contributed to the decrease in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks, aligning with the reported 1205.
6. In summary, the future decline to 1205 ILI occurrences (Week17, 2023) can be attributed to the peak and subsequent stabilization of ILI trends in Week12, 2023, decreasing outpatient visits for ILI, declining PIC mortality rates, and containment of other respiratory pathogens supported by vaccination and antiviral effectiveness.
