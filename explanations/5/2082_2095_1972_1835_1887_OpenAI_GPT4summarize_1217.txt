1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a declining trend, with values of ['2082', '2095', '1972', '1835', '1887']. After an initial rise from 2082 (Week14, 2024) to 2095 (Week15, 2024), the occurrences progressively dropped to 1835 in Week17, 2024. A slight rebound was observed in Week18, 2024, with occurrences at 1887. Overall, this reflects a predominantly downward trend over the observed period.
2. A negative correlation is evident between the past and future ILI occurrences. The decline in occurrences during Weeks 15–18, 2024, contrasts with the significant drop to 1119 reported 5 weeks later. This sustained reduction suggests that the declining trend in past data likely set the stage for the lower future values.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily decreased over the 5 weeks, from 2.8% (Week14, 2024) to 2.1% (Week18, 2024), falling below the national baseline throughout. This consistent decline in outpatient ILI activity aligns with the reduced future ILI occurrences.
4. Cumulative hospitalization rates showed a slower rate of increase, from 76.0 per 100,000 (Week14, 2024) to 80.3 per 100,000 (Week18, 2024), with hospitalizations predominantly attributed to older adults and young children. This stabilization in hospitalizations, despite continued influenza circulation, reflects decreased ILI severity, contributing to lower future ILI occurrences.
5. The decline in influenza positivity rates from clinical specimens (7.7%, Week14, 2024, to 3.1%, Week18, 2024) and the progressive reduction in influenza-attributed mortality (from 0.4%, Week14, 2024, to 0.2%, Week18, 2024) suggest diminishing flu activity overall. This downward trend directly correlates with the significant drop in future ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses (COVID-19, RSV) and regional variability in influenza subtype distributions impacted illness interpretation. However, the declining flu activity and stabilization of co-circulating viruses reduced the compounded respiratory illness burden, supporting the lower future ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1119 (5 weeks after Week18, 2024) can be attributed to the consistent decline in past time-series occurrences, decreasing outpatient visits and influenza positivity rates, stabilized hospitalization rates, and the waning co-circulation effects of other respiratory viruses.
