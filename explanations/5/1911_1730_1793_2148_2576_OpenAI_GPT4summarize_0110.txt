1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week41 to Week45, 2020 are 1911, 1730, 1793, 2148, and 2576, respectively. The trend shows a slow initial decline from Week41 (1911) to Week42 (1730), followed by a modest increase from Week43 (1793) to Week45 (2576). This indicates a rising trajectory in the last three weeks, with Week45 showing the sharpest increase (+428 occurrences from Week44). The overall pattern reflects a late-season rise in ILI activity.
2. The target week (None) falls within the typical peak season for influenza activity in the U.S., which spans from Week46 of one year to approximately Week6 of the following year. Given the rising trend observed in the last three weeks and the temporal alignment, it is forecasted that the target week (None) belongs to the peak season.
3. From the perspective of time-series forecasting, the sustained rise in ILI occurrences from Week43 to Week45 suggests continued momentum into the following weeks. Assuming no drastic external disruption, a stabilized or slightly reduced growth rate compared to Week45 can be expected over the next five weeks, leading to a projected occurrence of 1679 ILI cases.
4. Multiple key factors support the projection for Week None. First, national influenza positivity rates remain low at or below 0.3% in clinical labs over the past five weeks (Week41, 2020 #1; Week42, 2020 #1; Week43, 2020 #1). Second, the cumulative outpatient ILI visit percentage gradually increased from 1.2% in Week43 to 1.5% in Week45, indicating growing community influenza activity ahead of the peak season (Week43, 2020 #4; Week45, 2020 #4). Third, altered healthcare-seeking behaviors and minimal public health lab detections (Week41, 2020 #9; Week44, 2020 #11) suggest limited traditional surveillance reliability, contributing to uncertainty in forecasting sharp rises.
5. The positivity rate for Influenza A (dominant subtype recently detected) and Influenza B specimens has slightly increased but remains minimal, with no significant drives from novel strains or new variants (Week41, 2020 #2; Week45, 2020 #3). Surveillance data suggests that the transition into regular peak activity is underway, but no explosive growth is expected.
6. Influenza-related PIC deaths exceed the epidemic thresholds (Week42, 2020 #6; Week45, 2020 #6), signaling heightened severity of outcomes despite low overall activity. However, vaccination recommendations are well-emphasized, with no evidence of vaccine mismatches or reduced uptake to exacerbate spread (Week43, 2020 #8; Week45, 2020 #8).
7. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrence of 1679 aligns with an anticipated mild rise into the peak season (target week None), supported by recent trends, marginal positivity gains, and the absence of significant external influenza drivers.
