1. The reported ILI counts from Week52, 2021 through Week4, 2022 show a sharply declining trend: 11,653 (Week52, 2021), 9458 (Week1, 2022), 7190 (Week2, 2022), 5344 (Week3, 2022), and 3944 (Week4, 2022). This significant reduction over five weeks indicates an abating flu activity, consistent with the conclusion of the typical peak season.
2. Week9, 2022 occurs after the peak season (usually ending by Week6 in the U.S.), aligning more with an off-season classification. Influenza positivity, hospitalization rates, and outpatient visits have all stabilized or significantly decreased by Week4, 2022, which supports labeling Week9, 2022 as part of the off-season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the declining pattern in ILI occurrences suggests that future weeks, including Week9, 2022, will continue to experience reduced ILI activity. Extrapolating this pattern, the projected occurrences stabilize at a low level of 3671, reflecting the ongoing downward momentum.
4. ILI-associated hospitalizations and outpatient visits were showing sustained reductions by Week4, 2022 (Week3, 2022 #2; Week4, 2022 #3). Trends such as declining positivity rates (Week2, 2022 #1; Week3, 2022 #1; Week4, 2022 #1), lowering respiratory illness visits (Week4, 2022 #3), and the predominance of sporadic flu activity across regions (Week4, 2022 #11) all indicate reduced flu spread in the subsequent weeks.
5. Lower influenza vaccination uptake this season (Week1, 2022 #6; Week2, 2022 #7; Week4, 2022 #6) continues to influence sustained flu activity, though its effect is mitigated by declining flu positivity. The circulating Influenza A(H3N2) strain demonstrates a partial genetic match to the vaccine, but antigenic differences (Week52, 2021 #7; Week1, 2022 #10; Week2, 2022 #9) have likely limited vaccine effectiveness, maintaining mild background circulation.
6. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses (Week52, 2021 #8; Week2, 2022 #10; Week4, 2022 #11) introduces variability to respiratory trends. However, flu-specific factors, such as lower Influenza B proportions (Week52, 2021 #2; Week4, 2022 #2) and limited spread in long-term care facilities (Week3, 2022 #7), support future stabilization in ILI cases.
7. The projected ILI occurrence of 3671 for Week9, 2022 reflects a combination of downward trends in ILI cases, off-season timing, lower vaccination rates, partial vaccine-virus match, and concurrent circulation of respiratory pathogens. These factors signal a continued reduction in flu activity, aligning with evolving off-season behavior.
