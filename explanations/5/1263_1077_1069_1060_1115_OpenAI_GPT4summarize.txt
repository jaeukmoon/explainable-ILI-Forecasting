1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a declining trend with a slight rebound in the final week. Starting at 1263 (Week 50, 2020), the occurrences decreased to 1077 (Week 51, 2020), 1069 (Week 52, 2020), and 1060 (Week 53, 2020) before a modest rise to 1115 (Week 1, 2021). The overall trajectory suggests predominantly decreasing ILI activity during the observed period, with minor recovery at the end.

2. A negative correlation existed between the past ILI occurrences and future ILI values after 5 weeks. The downward trend during the 5-week observation period (Weeks 50–1, 2020–2021), combined with the slight uptick in Week 1, 2021, contrasts with the significant drop in future ILI occurrences to 522. This reduction indicates that the declining trend persisted and intensified in future weeks.

3. Unusually low positivity rates for influenza (0.3%–0.1% across Weeks 50–1, 2020–2021) and minimal influenza activity nationally, per CDC reports, point to suppressed influenza transmission during this period. These conditions likely contributed to the reduced future ILI occurrences.

4. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at low levels (1.6%–1.7%, well below the 2.6% national baseline) during Weeks 50–1, 2020–2021. The consistent stability in ILI-related healthcare visits reflects suppressed respiratory illness activity, aligning with the significantly lower future ILI counts.

5. COVID-19's continued influence on healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI surveillance systems, as noted in all CDC reports, disrupted traditional reporting accuracy and shifted trends. Such disruptions may have contributed to irregular dynamics, suppressing reported ILI cases and leading to the sharp decline in future occurrences to 522.

6. Persistently low hospitalization rates for influenza-associated illnesses (e.g., 75 cases in Week 50, 2020; 129 in Week 1, 2021) and minimal regional and national ILI activity reflect atypical flu season conditions, likely driving the sharp reduction in future ILI occurrences.

7. In summary, the significant decrease to 522 future ILI occurrences (Week 6, 2021) can be attributed to the prevailing decline in the 5-week trends, minimal influenza activity and positivity rates, stable but low outpatient ILI visits, low hospitalization rates, and pandemic-driven impacts on healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance systems. Together, these factors effectively suppressed ILI activity nationally.
