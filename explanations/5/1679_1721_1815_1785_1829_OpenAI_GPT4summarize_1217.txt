1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating but generally upward trend with values of ['1679', '1721', '1815', '1785', '1829']. Starting from 1679 in Week 39, 2021, there was a consistent increase up to 1815 in Week 41, 2021, followed by a slight dip to 1785 in Week 42, 2021, before rising again to 1829 in Week 43, 2021. This trend suggests a gradual escalation in ILI activity towards the end of the 5-week period.
2. A positive correlation is observed between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the rising trajectory in Weeks 41–43, 2021, corresponds with the significant increase to 2084 future occurrences by Week 48, 2021. The upward momentum in Weeks 41 and 43 serves as a precursor to the higher values observed after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at around 1.9% in Weeks 39, 40, and 43, but dipped slightly to 1.8% during Weeks 41 and 42, 2021, before future increases, indicating a possible delayed upward trajectory. Spiraling respiratory illness activity linked to other respiratory pathogens likely contributed.
4. Elevated PIC deaths (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, ranging from 18.7% in Week 39, 2021, to 15.6% in Week 43, 2021. While primarily driven by COVID-19, these elevated rates highlight ongoing respiratory illness activity contributing to higher ILI rates later.
5. Minimal influenza virus circulation was reported (e.g., 0.1–0.2% positivity in clinical specimens), but the subtle increase in positive cases, particularly for Influenza A (H3N2), from Week 39–43, 2021, may reflect an emerging trend that contributed to subsequent increases by Week 48, 2021. Additionally, changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and reduced surveillance reliability further complicated the interpretation and amplified future ILI activity.
6. Limited data on influenza vaccination coverage and ongoing challenges due to COVID-19-influenced behavioral changes impacted both current ILI trends and subsequent projections. Continual emphasis on vaccination may have prepared populations for higher ILI cases later.
7. In summary, the reported 2084 future ILI occurrences (Week 48, 2021) are attributed to the upward trend in Weeks 41–43, increasing respiratory illness activity tied to outpatient visits and other pathogens, persistently high PIC mortality above thresholds, and the amplified effects of pandemic-altered healthcare behaviors and surveillance challenges.
