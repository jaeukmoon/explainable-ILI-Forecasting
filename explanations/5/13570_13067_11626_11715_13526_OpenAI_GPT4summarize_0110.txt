1. The reported ILI occurrences across Week29 to Week33, 2022 are 13570, 13067, 11626, 11715, and 13526. The trend begins with a slight decline from Week29 (13570) to Week31 (11626), followed by a minor but steady increase to Week33 (13526). Overall, this pattern indicates a mild fluctuation characterized by a decline and subsequent recovery. No significant spikes or sharp dips were observed during this period.
2. The target week (Week38, 2022) falls within the peak onset season. According to historical patterns, the peak onset season in the U.S. spans from approximately Week32 to Week46, with increasing ILI occurrences anticipated during this period. Given that Week38 lies within this timeline, this forecast aligns with expected growth toward peak activity.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the mild fluctuations observed in past ILI occurrences suggest a gradual return to increasing activity. By Week33 (13526), the recovery trend points toward stronger ILI activity due to seasonal factors. Projecting forward five weeks, this combination of seasonal amplification and recent data trends forecasts a notable increase to 16932 occurrences by Week38.
4. Influenza virus activity remains low at present, with positivity rates below 1% nationwide and Influenza A (H3N2) remaining the dominant subtype. However, the trend in slight increases in outpatient visits among younger age groups (e.g., 6.3% for children aged 0-4 years in Week33) indicates potential for rising respiratory illness activity.
5. Novel influenza virus infections (e.g., H3N2v and H1N2v) were detected in all weeks from Week30 to Week33, though no sustained human-to-human transmission was reported. Such incidents might introduce limited variability and influence on ILI trends by Week38, depending on public health measures.
6. The co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, particularly SARS-CoV-2, continues to complicate ILI trends. Co-infections and overlapping symptoms of different circulating viruses (including RSV) may contribute to the observed rise in respiratory visits as flu season approaches.
7. The predicted 16932 ILI occurrences for Week38, 2022 reflect the conclusion of several factors: the observed upward trend in the latter part of the review period (Week32 and Week33), the inclusion of Week38 in the peak onset season when increases are expected, growing outpatient visits among children, and influences of overlapping respiratory viruses. Together, these factors indicate a continued rise in activity consistent with the forecast.
