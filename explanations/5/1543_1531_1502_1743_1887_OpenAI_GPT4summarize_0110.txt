1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week33 to Week37, 2021 are 1543, 1531, 1502, 1743, and 1887. The trend indicates a low and stable pattern initially (Week33 to Week35) followed by a substantial increase in Week36 (1743) and Week37 (1887). This shift toward higher values demonstrates a sudden upward fluctuation, likely influenced by external respiratory factors, though not a consistent rising trajectory.
2. Forecasting for the target week (Week42, 2021), it falls within the Peak onset season as it occurs after Week35, 2021 and precedes the typical peak season starting around Week46, 2021. Historical patterns and time classifications align this period with an early phase of increased ILI activity.
3. Extrapolating from the data trend, the sharp rise in Week36 and Week37 suggests upward momentum, indicating possible further increases over subsequent weeks in the Peak onset season. Based on time-series projections, this momentum stabilizes after Week37, converging toward a forecast of 1800 cases by Week42, 2021.
4. Recent increases in ILI activity (Week36, 2021 #2; Week37, 2021 #5) are primarily driven by non-influenza respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 rather than influenza itself, reflecting shifts in overall respiratory trends.
5. Changing healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic have altered how ILI surveillance data is generated, making trends harder to predict with absolute precision (Week33, 2021 #9; Week34, 2021 #8; Week36, 2021 #9).
6. Minor circulation of influenza viruses is reported nationwide, with ongoing virologic surveillance showing very low positivity rates (Week34, 2021 #1; Week36, 2021 #3; Week37, 2021 #6). The absence of influenza as a major factor keeps ILI trends relatively unpredictable but still influenced by baseline fluctuations.
7. In summary, the projection of 1800 occurrences for Week42, 2021 is justified by the observed Week37 increase, historical Peak onset trends, and the compounding effect of co-circulating respiratory viruses. Despite low influenza positivity and complex surveillance conditions, the ongoing upward trend and Peak onset timing work together to explain the prediction.
