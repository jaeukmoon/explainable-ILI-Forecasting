1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited an overall upward trend, with values ['2025', '1777', '1831', '1929', '2198']. After an initial decrease from 2025 (Week 20, 2021) to 1777 (Week 21, 2021), the numbers steadily increased in the subsequent weeks, reaching 2198 (Week 24, 2021). This consistent rise toward the final weeks indicates an escalation in ILI activity.
2. A positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the rising trajectory of the last three weeks of past data (Weeks 22–24, 2021) foreshadows the higher future occurrence of 2809 (Week 29, 2021). The continuous growth during Weeks 22–24 serves as a leading indicator of the sharp increase reported after 5 weeks.
3. Minimal but consistently reported ILI outpatient visits across Weeks 20–24, 2021, hovering around 1.1%–1.2% (e.g., 1.2% in Week 24), accompanied by a slight increase in ILI visits among children aged 0–4 years in certain weeks (e.g., Week 24), suggest underlying respiratory illness activity that may contribute to the future spike.
4. Persistent PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) mortality percentages consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds, such as 9.5% in Week 20, 8.3% in Week 21, and 7.1% in Week 24, 2021, predominantly driven by COVID-19, highlight a heightened burden of respiratory-related illnesses coinciding with ILI trends.
5. Disruption in ILI data collection due to changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted across all weeks, likely masked or delayed recognition of increasing respiratory illness activity. The compounded surveillance challenges likely culminated in the observed jump to 2809 ILI occurrences in Week 29, 2021.
6. While influenza activity and positivity rates remained low (e.g., <0.1% in Week 24, 2021), challenges stemming from the coexistence of influenza and COVID-19, along with syndromic surveillance shortcomings, suggest the future spike may partially reflect intensified non-specific illness reporting.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2809 (Week 29, 2021) stem from the upward trajectory in past ILI data in Weeks 22–24, persistently high PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, mild yet consistent outpatient ILI activity within the baseline, and disruptions in ILI surveillance due to pandemic-related behavioral and healthcare changes.
