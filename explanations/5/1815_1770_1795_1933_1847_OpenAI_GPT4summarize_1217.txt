1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed fluctuations, with values of ['1815', '1770', '1795', '1933', '1847']. There was an initial decrease from 1815 (Week16, 2023) to 1770 (Week17, 2023), followed by a rise in Weeks 18–19, peaking at 1933 (Week19, 2023), before a slight decline to 1847 (Week20, 2023). This overall variability indicates transient increases in ILI activity but no sustained upward momentum.
2. A slight negative correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences, as the fluctuations captured in the past data correspond with a significant decline in future ILI occurrences, reducing to 1391 (Week25, 2023). The highest past peak of 1933 (Week19, 2023) is inconsistent with the considerable drop seen in future values, suggesting external influences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below the national baseline of 2.5%, holding steady at 1.9%-2.0% throughout Weeks 16–20, 2023. This stability reflects low healthcare-seeking behavior for ILI, likely correlating with reduced future ILI occurrences.
4. Decreasing influenza positivity rates in clinical and public health labs, ranging from 1.0% (Week17, 2023) to 1.1% (Week20, 2023), support the observed lower future occurrences, as minimal flu virus activity contributes to declining ILI rates.
5. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) gradually decreased, from 7.5% (Week16, 2023) to 6.5% (Week20, 2023), hovering near or slightly above the epidemic threshold. This decline in PIC mortality is consistent with reduced respiratory illness severity and aligns with the lower ILI occurrences reported in Week25, 2023.
6. The co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory viruses was consistently documented across Weeks 16–20, 2023. However, stable trends in ILI and low flu activity suggest that the compounded effects of these pathogens did not significantly elevate ILI rates, contributing to lower future values.
7. In summary, the reported reduction to 1391 future ILI occurrences (Week25, 2023) can be attributed to stable and low outpatient ILI visits, declining influenza positivity rates, reduced PIC mortality trends, and limited contributions from other circulating respiratory viruses as evidenced during Weeks 16–20, 2023.
