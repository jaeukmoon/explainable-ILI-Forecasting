1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks presented a generally increasing trend, with numbers rising from 10947 (Week 49, 2023) to a peak of 16604 (Week 52, 2023) before dropping to 14312 (Week 1, 2024). This pattern highlights a significant incline in ILI activity through Weeks 49–52, 2023, followed by a slight decline in Week 1, 2024, suggesting persistent but variable influenza activity.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the peak observed at 16604 in Week 52, 2023, aligns with the subsequent rise to 16110 occurrences reported in Week 6, 2024. The overall escalation in Weeks 49–52, 2023, acted as a precursor to maintaining heightened ILI activity after 5 weeks, further substantiating this alignment.
3. Several other factors from the CDC summary reports provide insight into the future ILI occurrences: (1) Influenza-positive respiratory specimens continued increasing weekly, climbing from 10.2% (Week 49, 2023) to 17.5% (Week 52, 2023), signaling expanding viral circulation. (2) Outpatient visits for ILI also rose considerably from 4.4% (Week 49, 2023) to 6.9% (Week 52, 2023), staying elevated and confirming widespread illness burden. (3) The cumulative influenza hospitalization rate increased sharply, from 8.0 per 100,000 (Week 49, 2023) to 31.7 per 100,000 (Week 1, 2024), with corresponding weekly hospitalizations peaking at over 18526 (Week 1, 2024). These trends indicate sustained disease activity driving future ILI increases.
4. Elevated positivity rates specifically in multiple regions (e.g., regions 8, 4, and 6) through Week 1, 2024, the co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2, and the continued prevalence of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 as the dominant strain (79.6% in Week 1, 2024) underscore the sustained rise in respiratory activity and its contribution to the reported occurrences. These overlapping regional, viral, and co-circulating patterns exacerbate the cumulative impact on ILI cases.
5. The reported future ILI occurrences of 16110 (Week 6, 2024) can be attributed to the climbing trend seen in past weeks (peaking at 16604 in Week 52, 2023), consistent increases in positive specimens and outpatient ILI visits, surging influenza-related hospitalizations, and the continued rapid transmission of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 amidst co-circulating respiratory pathogens. Together, these factors explain the sustained high burden observed in Week 6, 2024.
