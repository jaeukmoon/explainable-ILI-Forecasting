1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating trend, with values of ['1256', '1154', '1212', '1308', '1174']. There was a decrease from 1256 (Week 7, 2023) to 1154 (Week 8, 2023), followed by an increase to 1212 (Week 9, 2023). A peak was observed at 1308 (Week 10, 2023), but it subsequently dropped to 1174 (Week 11, 2023). This pattern reflects periodic fluctuations without a definitive overall direction.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the fluctuating and relatively high ILI activity over the 5 weeks does not directly support the future decline to 807 occurrences by Week 16, 2023. The decrease in Week 11, 2023, to a lower value of 1174, however, marks the start of this downward shift, hinting at reduced ILI activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI maintained stability around 2.4%-2.6% throughout the 5 weeks, peaking slightly in Week 7, 2023, and gradually dropping to 2.4% by Week 11, 2023, already below the national baseline of 2.5%. This decline in healthcare encounters indicates waning respiratory illness activity, contributing to the lower future ILI occurrences. Increasing vaccination rates combined with high antiviral susceptibility (>98%) documented across Weeks 7–11, 2023, likely helped to suppress further disease transmission, supporting reduced future cases. Co-circulating viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, continued to influence respiratory illness trends as seen in all weeks, but reports indicate a stable or declining impact, reducing their likely contribution to ILI. Stability in cumulative flu hospitalization rates (around 60.4 per 100,000 in weeks ending Week 11, 2023) reveals a plateauing health burden, aligning with the anticipated decrease in future ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to PIC displayed a downward trend, decreasing from 9.0% (Week 7, 2023) to 8.7% (Week 11, 2023), though remaining above epidemic thresholds (7.2%-7.3%). This consistent decline corresponds to reduced severity of respiratory illness activity and reflects a progressive containment of lethality linked to flu and related conditions.
5. In summary, the decline to 807 ILI occurrences by Week 16, 2023, aligns with the downward shift in ILI outpatient visits, a plateau in hospitalization rates, declining PIC mortality, and sustained control measures (e.g., effective vaccination and antiviral treatments). These factors collectively led to diminished flu activity and its broader health impacts, marking a shift toward reduced future occurrences.
