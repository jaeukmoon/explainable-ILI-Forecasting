1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the observed 5-week period (Week17-Week21, 2022) showed a consistent upward trend: 1676 (Week17, 2022) to 1770 (Week18, 2022), 1809 (Week19, 2022), 1954 (Week20, 2022), and 2058 (Week21, 2022). This steady increase in ILI activity over consecutive weeks reflects escalating illness spread, which influenced subsequent ILI occurrences.
2. A strong positive correlation between the rising past ILI occurrences and the decrease seen 5 weeks later to 1196 is evident, as the continued escalation in Week21, 2022 suggests late-season peaks that then taper off. The future decline (Week26, 2022) may represent the seasonal conclusion of influenza activity.
3. Outpatient ILI visit percentages remained stable but below baseline, fluctuating from 2.2% (Week17, 2022) to 2.3% (Week18, 2022), 2.4% (Week19-Week20, 2022), and then declining to 2.3% in Week21, 2022. This consistent level of outpatient ILI care aligns with the gradual reduction expected over late spring.
4. Seasonal PIC death percentages were consistently above the epidemic threshold, ranging from 7.2% in Week17 to 7.8% in Week21, 2022. However, influenza’s declining role in mortality (with PIC primarily driven by COVID-19) reflects gradually waning influence on future ILI trends.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viral infections (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in 4.4%-4.7% of influenza-positive cases) and regional variability in flu activity impacted ILI trends. These combined factors contributed to future decline, as influenza tapered off, reducing ILI burden in Week26, 2022.
6. In summary, the decline to 1196 ILI occurrences (Week26, 2022) follows a seasonal trajectory influenced by the upward trend in the 5 prior weeks, stable outpatient ILI percentages, waning PIC contributions from influenza, and reduced flu activity due to regional and co-viral dynamics.
