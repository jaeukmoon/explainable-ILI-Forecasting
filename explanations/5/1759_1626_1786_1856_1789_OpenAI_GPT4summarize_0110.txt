1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week17 to Week21, 2021 are 1759, 1626, 1786, 1856, and 1789. The trend shows minor fluctuations, with a dip in Week18 (1626), a rise peaking in Week20 (1856), and a slight decline in Week21 (1789). Overall, the activity level remains stable, with no significant upward or downward movement but rather minor variability in counts.
2. Forecasting Week26, 2021 to belong to the off-season aligns with the data. During the off-season, minimal flu transmission is typically observed due to low positivity and reduced community spread. Week26, 2021 falls well after the peak season (Week46, 2020–Week06, 2021) and does not indicate any approaching peak onset activity.
3. From the time-series perspective, the stable pattern of ILI counts across Week17–Week21, 2021, with minor fluctuations, suggests low activity maintaining near baseline levels. Projecting this trend forward by five weeks (to Week26, 2021), the model forecasts a gradual stabilization of occurrences near the observed averages, estimating 1794 as the ILI value with no abrupt surges or drops expected in the off-season.
4. Influenza activity remained unusually low (Week17, 2021 #1; Week18, 2021 #1; Week19, 2021 #1; Week20, 2021 #1; Week21, 2021 #1), with only 0.1% of specimens testing positive for influenza over five weeks. Low flu activity supports minimal changes in the forecasting trend.
5. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza remains at historical lows, at 0.8 per 100,000 population (Week17, 2021 #4; Week18, 2021 #5; Week19, 2021 #4; Week20, 2021 #5), reflecting reduced severity of influenza-driven ILI cases during the pandemic.
6. The continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare-seeking behaviors and data collection (Week17, 2021 #9; Week18, 2021 #9; Week19, 2021 #10; Week20, 2021 #10; Week21, 2021 #7) suggests caution in interpreting ILI trends due to skewed baselines but also implies limited direct influenza risks.
7. Given the minor fluctuations in reported data, classification of Week26, 2021 as off-season, minimal flu positivity rates, historically low hospitalization rates, and pandemic-related behavioral impacts, the projected ILI occurrence reasonably stabilizes at 1794.
