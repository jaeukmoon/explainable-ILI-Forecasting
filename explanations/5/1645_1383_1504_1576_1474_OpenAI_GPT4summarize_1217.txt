1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend, with values ['1645', '1383', '1504', '1576', '1474']. There was an initial decline from 1645 (Week20, 2021) to 1383 (Week21, 2021), followed by an increase to 1504 (Week22, 2021) and 1576 (Week23, 2021). However, Week24, 2021, saw a slight decrease to 1474. Overall, ILI occurrences remained relatively stable with no significant upward or downward momentum.
2. A direct correlation can be observed between past and future ILI occurrences. While the past ILI data showed fluctuations without a clear trend, the stability across values (Weeks 21–24, 2021) suggests consistent baseline activity, which potentially set the stage for the modest rise to 1859 future occurrences reported after five weeks.
3. Minimal influenza activity nationwide, as reported across all 5 weeks, corresponded with ILI values remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%. However, the slight increase in outpatient visits for ILI in Week22 and Week24 (e.g., in children aged 0–4 years) indicated subtle shifts in healthcare dynamics that may have contributed to the future rise.
4. Deaths associated with pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded epidemic thresholds every week (e.g., 9.5% in Week20, 2021, and 7.1% in Week24, 2021), highlighting persistent respiratory illness activity despite low influenza detection, which likely influenced future ILI occurrences.
5. Disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to COVID-19, repeatedly emphasized in the CDC reports, complicated ILI data collection and surveillance, potentially underreporting cases during the observed period and concentrating them later, contributing to the increase in ILI occurrences to 1859.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1859 (Week29, 2021) can be explained by the baseline fluctuations observed in Weeks 20–24, 2021, combined with minimal but sustained ILI activity, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and behavioral changes related to COVID-19 that disrupted surveillance and may have delayed or concentrated ILI case recognition.
