1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 8–12, 2024) displayed a consistent downward trend, starting at 11037 (Week 8, 2024) and decreasing incrementally to 9168 by Week 12, 2024. This represents a steady decline in ILI activity, with the most significant drop occurring between Weeks 8 (11037) and 9 (10736). This sustained reduction indicates a diminishing trajectory in ILI cases during this period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the continual decline in the past ILI data aligns with the significantly lower future occurrence of 6135 by Week 17, 2024. The observed reduction in Weeks 8–12 predicts the waning ILI activity reflected in the decreased future occurrences.
3. The outpatient visits for ILI consistently decreased over the 5 weeks, dropping from 4.4% in Week 8, 2024, to 3.1% in Week 12, 2024, remaining above the baseline but signaling a steady decline in respiratory illness activity. This downtrend in outpatient data supports the reduced future ILI numbers. The positivity rate for respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza also declined, reaching 10.5% in Week 12, 2024, further reinforcing the diminishing flu activity. The mortality rate attributed to influenza dropped from 0.7% in Week 8, 2024, to 0.5% in Week 12, 2024, reflecting declining severity of cases and aligning with the lower future ILI occurrence. Co-circulating respiratory viruses like RSV and COVID-19, while complicating surveillance, showed no significant increase that could offset the observed decline in ILI activity, supporting the lower future value.
4. Overall, the future ILI occurrence of 6135 (Week 17, 2024) reflects the trends observed in the past ILI data and CDC reports, which showed a steady decline in occurrences, outpatient visits, influenza positivity rates, and mortality. These decreasing patterns over the 5 weeks signal waning flu activity and contribute directly to the reduced future occurrence.
