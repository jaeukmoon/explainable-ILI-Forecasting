1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks indicate a fluctuating but overall upward trajectory, with values of ['1301', '1524', '1503', '1464', '1635']. Starting from 1301 (Week37, 2023), there is a consistent rise, reaching the highest value of 1635 during Week41, 2023. This trend of increasing values suggests growing ILI activity toward the end of the observed period, acting as a precursor to further increases.
2. A positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The upward progression seen from Week40 to Week41, 2023, signals heightened respiratory illness activity, aligning with the reported future value of 3350 after 5 weeks (Week46, 2023). The rising pattern at the end of this period likely reflects continued escalation resulting in the substantial future occurrence.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily increased, from 2.0% (Week37, 2023) to 2.3% (Week41, 2023). This trend highlights rising respiratory health concerns, driving healthcare-seeking behaviors and potentially contributing to the reported rise in ILI occurrences. Additionally, hospital admissions for influenza-related illnesses rose from 820 (Week37, 2023) to 1228 (Week41, 2023), reflecting increasing severe respiratory illness. Persistent co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, repeatedly noted across regions, has likely compounded respiratory illness burdens. Furthermore, regional increases in influenza positivity and slight escalations in activity in specific areas, as documented in Week41, suggest localized transmission contributing to future escalations.
4. Overall, the increase to 3350 occurrences can be attributed to the consistent upward trend in past ILI occurrences, reflecting heightened respiratory illness activity and healthcare utilization. Contributing factors include increasing ILI outpatient visits, rising hospitalization rates, co-circulating influenza and respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2, and localized increases in influenza activity. Combined, these elements drive the observed future rise in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
