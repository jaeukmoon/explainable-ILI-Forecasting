1. The reported ILI counts from Week18 to Week22, 2023, are 1795, 1933, 1847, 1762, and 1753. The data shows an initial increase from Week18 (1795) to Week19 (1933), followed by a minor decline through Week22 (1753). Overall, this indicates a downward trend after a modest spike in Week19, with progressively decreasing occurrences reflecting stabilization at lower levels.
2. In the U.S., the off-season typically spans Weeks 1–31, characterized by minimal influenza and ILI prevalence. Week27, 2023, being within this period, corresponds to the off-season. This aligns with the ongoing low influenza activity and below-baseline ILI outpatient visit rates across all weeks examined.
3. The time-series trend demonstrates a declining pattern in ILI counts from Week19 onward, with decreases across consecutive weeks. This declining trajectory, combined with the off-season period, suggests sustained reductions in influenza transmission. Based on these historical trends, the projection for Week27, 2023, indicates a continued decline in ILI occurrences, resulting in a forecasted value of 1105.
4. Influenza activity remains marginal nationwide, with only 0.9%–1.2% of specimens testing positive (Week18 #1; Week19 #1; Week22 #1), suggesting minimal disease spread.
5. Flu activity expectations by the CDC indicate continued low influenza transmission during the summer (Week21 #10; Week22 #10), consistent with declining ILI counts over recent weeks.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, continues to influence respiratory illness trends (Week19 #9; Week21 #8; Week22 #9) but has not led to substantial ILI increases, reinforcing the expectation of limited future activity.
7. Given the observed downward trend in ILI, off-season designation for Week27, 2023, stable antiviral effectiveness, and no significant disruptions in co-circulating pathogens, the projected ILI occurrence of 1105 for Week27, 2023, reflects the ongoing stabilization during this period.
