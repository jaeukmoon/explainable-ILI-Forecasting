1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but upward trend, rising from 2025 in Week 20, 2021, to 2198 in Week 24, 2021. This trajectory included a decrease to 1777 in Week 21, followed by steady increases in Weeks 22–24 (1831, 1929, and 2198, respectively). The overall progression indicates growing ILI activity as the period concluded, despite week-to-week fluctuations.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI data is observed, where the incremental increases in ILI occurrences in Weeks 22–24, 2021, culminate in the reported surge to 2809 after 5 weeks. The consistent rise toward the later weeks suggests an amplifying trend in ILI activity, laying the foundation for higher occurrences in the future.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at minimal levels (1.3% in Week 20 and 1.1%–1.2% in subsequent weeks) but saw subtle increases in children aged 0–4 in Weeks 22 and 24. This age-related rise in ILI activity, coupled with persistent disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to COVID-19, indicates potential hidden or unrecognized respiratory illness cases contributing to future ILI growth.

4. Persistent PIC (Pneumonia, Influenza, or COVID-19) mortality rates exceeded epidemic thresholds consistently throughout Weeks 20–24, ranging from 9.5% (Week 20) to 7.1% (Week 24), with COVID-19 predominating. Elevated respiratory illness-related mortality aligns with potential increases in broader ILI activity in subsequent weeks.

5. Minimal influenza virus activity, as indicated by positivity rates under 0.1% and few lab detections, may contribute to the inability to directly attribute ILI rises to influenza alone. Combined with ongoing disruptions in surveillance due to COVID-19 healthcare patterns, broader syndromic influences likely contributed to the observed future ILI spike.

6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 2809 after 5 weeks can be explained by the incrementally rising trend observed in Weeks 22–24, 2021, subtle increases in ILI outpatient visits, elevated PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the impact of disrupted surveillance and healthcare-seeking patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic.
