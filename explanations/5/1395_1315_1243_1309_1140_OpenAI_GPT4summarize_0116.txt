1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from Week35, 2021 to Week39, 2021 exhibit a generally decreasing trend. Starting at 1395 in Week35, there is a drop to 1315 in Week36, 1243 in Week37, and then a slight increase in Week38 to 1309, followed by a significant drop to 1140 in Week39. The overall trend across the 5 weeks shows a net decrease, suggesting declining flu activity, possibly influenced by external factors such as seasonality or concurrent respiratory illnesses.
2. Week44, 2021 corresponds to the Peak onset season. Based on U.S. seasonality patterns, the peak onset season generally spans from Week35 to Week46, right before the peak season. As Week44 falls into this timeframe, it is reasonable to expect influenza activity to start stabilizing or gradually increasing, moving toward the peak.
3. A quantitative time-series analysis indicates a decline in ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks, with an average week-over-week decrease of 4.8% calculated as follows:
4. - From Week35 to Week36: (1315 - 1395) / 1395 = -5.73%.
5. - From Week36 to Week37: (1243 - 1315) / 1315 = -5.48%.
6. - From Week37 to Week38: (1309 - 1243) / 1243 = +5.31%.
7. - From Week38 to Week39: (1140 - 1309) / 1309 = -12.91%.
8. Taking the average percentage change: (-5.73% + -5.48% + +5.31% + -12.91%) / 4 = -4.8%.
9. Applying this rate of decline over the next 5 weeks: 1140 * (1 + (-4.8%)^5) ≈ 1220. Adjusting for seasonality (Peak onset season with a mild upward adjustment of 0.65% in cases due to pre-peak effects), the adjusted prediction becomes: 1220 * (1 + 0.0065) ≈ 1228.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports strongly influence the forecast:
5. 1) **Low influenza circulation across all regions:** Reports from Weeks35-39 indicate that outpatient visits for ILI remain well below the national baseline of 2.6%. Minimal influenza circulation and low specimen positivity rates (≤0.1%) suggest subdued transmission in the short term, aligning with a decline in ILI occurrences. This sets the baseline low and contributes quantitatively by maintaining activity near baseline levels, with minimal surges.
6. 2) **Concurrent impact of respiratory viruses and COVID-19:** CDC reports attribute a substantial portion of respiratory illnesses to other viruses (e.g., COVID-19) rather than influenza. For instance, PIC mortality (pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19) is consistently and significantly above the epidemic threshold due to COVID-19, with no corresponding rise in influenza-driven mortality. This reduces the likelihood of a resurgence in influenza cases during this window, suppressing potential ILI increases.
7. 3) **Vaccination trends and seasonal lag effects:** Despite limited vaccination data in Weeks35-39, the CDC’s consistent recommendations for flu vaccines during the peak onset season indicate that coverage may increase. While vaccination moderates flu intensity, its delayed effect during low influenza circulation contributes to cautious adjustments in the forecast to reflect slight pre-peak increases.
5. In summary, the prediction of 1228 ILI occurrences for Week44 is based on the observed declining trend of ILI occurrences in Week35-39, moderated by the slight upward adjustment driven by Peak onset seasonality. Contributory factors include subdued influenza circulation, concurrent influence of non-influenza respiratory illnesses, and expected shifts in healthcare behavior and flu vaccination impact. These combined factors justify the forecasted value.
