1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1017', '1079', '1171', '1320', '1416']. This trend shows a progressive increase from 1017 in Week42, 2020 to 1416 in Week46, 2020, with no declines observed. The sharp rises in Weeks45 and 46, 2020, suggest escalating levels of influenza-like illness activity.
2. The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (1077) are consistent with a reversal from the past peak in the Week46 upward trend. The steady increments across Weeks42–46, 2020, at first indicated a buildup in activity, but the future pattern suggests stabilization or a downturn after the observed peak of 1416 in Week46. The moderate future level aligns with historical trends of post-peak drops in respiratory illness patterns.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually rose through the 5-week period, from 1.2% in Week42, 2020, to 1.5% in Week46, 2020. This steady increase mirrored rising ILI occurrences, suggesting increased respiratory illness activity. However, since these percentages remained below the national baseline (2.6%), activity likely moderated in the subsequent weeks, contributing to the reported future ILI of 1077.
4. PIC mortality rates exceeded epidemic thresholds throughout the period, increasing from 7.6% in Week42, 2020, to 10.7% in Week46, 2020. These persistently high numbers, dominated by COVID-19, underscore ongoing respiratory illness pressures, which correlate with elevated ILI occurrences during Weeks42–46, 2020. The sharp spike in PIC mortality in Week46 may have marked the peak before activity slowed, reflected in the reported 1077 future occurrences.
5. Healthcare-seeking behaviors impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic created disruptions in traditional ILI surveillance and reporting, as noted in all weekly summaries. Shifts to alternative care settings and reporting adjustments may have caused fluctuations in observed ILI levels, inflating reported surges during Weeks45–46, 2020, before normalizing to 1077 in future data.
6. Despite low influenza positivity rates in clinical and public health labs—consistently below 0.3% over Weeks42–46, 2020—the rise in ILI occurrences may reflect non-specific respiratory illnesses, possibly driven by pandemic-related behaviors or overlapping respiratory infection symptoms. These factors likely contributed to the elevation observed during Weeks42–46, 2020, and subsequent moderation to future occurrences of 1077.
7. In summary, the future ILI value of 1077 aligns with a stabilization or downturn following the peak in Week46, 2020. This reflects the upward trend from Weeks42–46, 2020, increasing outpatient ILI visits, elevated PIC mortality, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the influence of non-influenza respiratory illnesses on observed ILI activity patterns.
