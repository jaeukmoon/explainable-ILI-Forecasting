1. The ILI occurrences data from Week7, 2022 to Week11, 2022 reveals a consistent upward trend. The counts increased from 1933 (Week7) to 2820 (Week11), with notable week-over-week growth. This trend indicates a rising activity of influenza-like illness within this period, suggesting that flu activity was intensifying nationwide.
2. Forecasting the target week (Week16, 2022), it most likely belongs to the off-season. The target week is well beyond the typical peak season (which typically ends around Week6) and later than any peak-onset season in historical records. Although rising flu activity is evident, past indicators suggest that Week16, 2022 represents subdued off-season activity following a late-season residual rise.
3. From a time-series perspective, the data indicates a meaningful growth trend in the five weeks from Week7 to Week11, 2022—a rise of nearly 46% (2820 vs. 1933). Extrapolating this upward momentum while considering the seasonal deceleration of activity suggests future occurrences slowing yet continuing slightly higher. Combining this historical pattern with off-season classification supports a forecast close to 4487 for Week16, 2022.
4. Rising nationwide flu positivity rates reflect increased influenza activity during the analyzed period—4.2% (Week7, 2022), 4.1% (Week8, 2022), 5.8% (Week9, 2022), 6.8% (Week10, 2022), and 7.7% (Week11, 2022). This mirrors the upward trend in ILI occurrences and correlated flu intensity.
5. Continued dominance of influenza A(H3N2), reported as both nationally widespread and antigenically distinct from vaccine strains, suggests reduced vaccine effectiveness, contributing to increased ILI occurrences. Surveillance from Week7 to Week11, 2022 reported 98%-100% dominance of A(H3N2), which retained antigenic differences.
6. Flu vaccination rates remained suboptimal across these weeks, as noted throughout summaries from Week7 to Week11, 2022. Lower vaccine uptake, combined with antigenic mismatches, would limit community immunity and contribute to higher ILI occurrences beyond Week11, 2022.
7. In summary, the prediction of 4487 ILI occurrences for Week16, 2022 is justified by the observed consistent increase in ILI trends, seasonally aligned expectations of off-peak residual rises, and contributory factors such as rising flu positivity, A(H3N2) antigenic drift, and suboptimal vaccination coverage. The value accounts for seasonality moderation while projecting continued late-season activity.
