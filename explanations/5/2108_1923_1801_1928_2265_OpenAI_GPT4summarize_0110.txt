1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week30 to Week34, 2022 are 2108, 1923, 1801, 1928, and 2265. Initially, the trend showed a mild decline from Week30 (2108) to Week32 (1801), implying a gradual drop in ILI activity. However, a slight increase was observed in Week33 (1928) and a more significant rise in Week34 (2265). This trend reflects a transition from decreasing cases to an upward trend, indicative of rising activity potentially signaling an approaching peak onset season.
2. Week39, 2022 falls in the typical peak onset season window (Weeks 32-46, 2022). Supporting this classification, Week34 data confirms that positivity rates, hospitalizations, and outpatient ILI visits have started increasing slightly, suggesting that Week39, 2022 aligns with the peak onset season.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the increase from Week32 (1801) to Week34 (2265) suggests a return to growth in ILI activity. Projecting this trend forward over five weeks shows stronger ILI occurrences typical of peak onset season, with models estimating increased transmission and a forecast of 2958 ILI occurrences in Week39, 2022.
4. Between Week30 and Week34, cumulative virologic surveillance reports emphasize Influenza A predominance, especially subtype H3N2, which is associated with increased intensity of transmission (Week30 #2; Week33 #2). While overall positivity rates are low, the upward trend (from 0.4% to 0.5%) reinforces future growth (Week31 #1; Week34 #1).
5. CDC reports highlight co-circulation of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses influencing ILI activity variability (Week30 #10; Week33 #9; Week34 #10). This overlap complicates forecasting but aligns with slight increases in respiratory illnesses, notably among vulnerable populations like children under age 4 (Week33 #4; Week34 #4).
6. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below baseline nationwide but showed an upward shift from 1.4% in Week32 to 1.8% in Week34 (Week32 #5; Week34 #4). This increase, particularly among children aged 0-4, indicates elevated community transmission and supports the anticipated rise in ILI activity through Week39, 2022.
7. Synthesizing the observed upward trend in ILI occurrences, the classification of Week39, 2022 as part of the peak onset season, and CDC data showing rising transmission of Influenza A (H3N2), coupled with increasing outpatient visits and co-circulating respiratory viruses, the projected ILI occurrence of 2958 in Week39, 2022 is consistent with emerging seasonal patterns.
