1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent upward trend: starting at 1659 (Week 28, 2021) and steadily increasing to 2456 (Week 32, 2021). Each consecutive week displayed a rise—1659 to 1859 (Week 29, 2021), 2036 (Week 30, 2021), 2285 (Week 31, 2021), and culminating at 2456 in Week 32, 2021. This persistent growth indicates escalating respiratory illness activity during this period.
2. A positive correlation is evident between the upward trend in the past ILI occurrences (Weeks 28–32, 2021) and the reported future ILI occurrences of 3091 (after 5 weeks). The continuous rise in values over the previous period reflects a building momentum in ILI activity, culminating in the notable increase after 5 weeks.
3. The percentage of outpatient visits for ILI displayed gradual increases for five consecutive weeks: from 1.3% (Week 28, 2021) to 2.1% (Week 32, 2021). This steady incline aligns with growing ILI activity across various age groups and contributes to the observed future surge.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds: increasing from 7.1% (Week 28, 2021) to 14.6% (Week 32, 2021), with COVID-19 as the primary contributor. Such persistently high PIC mortality reflects broader escalations in respiratory illness activity, reinforcing the trajectory toward higher future ILI rates.
5. Overlapping waves of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, and novel pathogens like Influenza A(H1N2)v, complicated surveillance during the pandemic. These factors, combined with pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors, likely amplified ILI reporting, culminating in the sharp rise to 3091 occurrences after 5 weeks.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 3091 can be attributed to the steady upward trend in past ILI activity (Weeks 28-32, 2021), increasing outpatient visits, persistent PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, and compounding pandemic-related disruptions in illness surveillance and healthcare behaviors.
