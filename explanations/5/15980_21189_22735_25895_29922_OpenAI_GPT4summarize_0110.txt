1. The ILI occurrences from Week47 to Week51, 2023 show a consistently rising trend: 15980 (Week47), 21189 (Week48), 22735 (Week49), 25895 (Week50), and 29922 (Week51). This indicates a strong upward trajectory, reflective of the ongoing elevation in influenza activity across the U.S. throughout this period. No dips or stabilization are observed, signifying sustained growth in ILI cases.
2. Forecasting that Week4, 2024 falls within the peak season is consistent with historical patterns, as the typical peak season spans from approximately Week46 of a given year to around Week6 of the following year in the U.S. The continued rise in respiratory positivity and hospitalization rates seen in previous weeks reinforces this classification.
3. From the time-series perspective, the sharp, consistent increase in cases from Week47 to Week51 indicates a momentum-driven pattern persisting into the peak season. Considering seasonal influence and based on a time-lagged model, the predicted count of 18657 for Week4, 2024 reflects a natural decline from the highest levels in Week51, 2023 (29922), as activity gradually begins to decrease post-holiday season trends, although it remains elevated within the peak season.
4. Influenza positivity rates increased substantially from Week47, 2023 (6.2%) to Week51, 2023 (16.1%), with Influenza A dominance (Week47 #2, Week51 #2). This widespread activity strongly contributes to increased ILI occurrences.
5. Hospitalization rates significantly escalated, with the cumulative rate rising from 3.7 per 100,000 (Week47 #3) to 15.4 per 100,000 (Week51 #5). This indicates more severe cases of influenza, likely correlating with sustained ILI growth for the near term.
6. Pediatric deaths and multiviral co-circulation are concerning. Pediatric deaths rose from 8 (Week47 #4) to 20 (Week51 #6). Furthermore, ongoing co-circulation of Influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 compounds ILI dynamics, sustaining pressure on healthcare systems (Week47 #9, Week51 #9).
7. The forecast of 18657 for Week4, 2024 aligns with the ongoing peak season, indicating gradually tapering influenza activity from the late December high. The combination of a sustained rise in ILI counts, elevated influenza positivity rates, increasing hospitalization rates, and continued co-circulation supports this value, highlighting a transition toward the latter phase of the peak season while remaining above the baseline.
