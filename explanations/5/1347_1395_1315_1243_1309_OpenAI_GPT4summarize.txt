1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but overall downward trend, indicated by values of ['1347', '1395', '1315', '1243', '1309']. While Week 35, 2021 (1395) had the highest value, the subsequent weeks marked a consistent decline, reaching 1243 in Week 37, 2021. Although there was a minor uptick to 1309 in Week 38, 2021, the general trend reflects a reduction in ILI occurrences over most of the observed period.  

2. A negative correlation is observed between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the decreasing trend seen in the later weeks (Weeks 36–38, 2021) contrasts with the significant decline to 1189 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 43, 2021). This pattern suggests that the overall reduction in past data sets the foundation for the lower future value.   

3. Low influenza virus circulation, as documented consistently in the CDC reports (e.g., 0.1% positivity rates in Week 34, 2021, and Week 36, 2021), aligns with the declining trend of ILI occurrences, underscoring the lack of significant influenza activity contributing to future trends.  
   - Reports of steady or decreasing ILI outpatient visits below national baselines (e.g., 2.2% in Week 34, 2021; 1.9% in Week 38, 2021) suggest minimal increases in healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory illnesses like the flu, aligning with the lower future ILI value.  
   - A persistent influence of COVID-19 on PIC deaths (e.g., 21.0% in Week 36, 2021, and 20.9% in Week 38, 2021), significantly above the epidemic threshold, indicates the dominance of non-influenza respiratory illnesses in driving ILI trends. Lower influenza contributions reduce the likelihood of future ILI surges.  

4. In summary, the reported 1189 future ILI occurrences (Week 43, 2021) stem from the downward trend in past ILI occurrences (Weeks 36–38, 2021), low influenza virus activity reflected in laboratory and outpatient data, and the overwhelming influence of non-influenza respiratory illnesses like COVID-19 dominating PIC deaths. These factors collectively suppress influenza activity while limiting future ILI occurrences to lower levels.
