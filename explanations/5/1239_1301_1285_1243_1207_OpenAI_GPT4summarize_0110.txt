1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week29 to Week33, 2022 are 1239, 1301, 1285, 1243, and 1207. These values show a slight rise from Week29 (1239) to Week30 (1301), followed by small fluctuations, with a gradual decline noted by Week33 (1207). Overall, the trend is marked by mild fluctuations within a low baseline range, suggesting no sharp increases or decreases during this period.
2. Week38, 2022 falls into the peak onset season as per U.S. seasonality patterns, where ILI activity typically begins to climb from Week35 onward. Although influenza activity remains low in the preceding weeks, Week38 aligns with the transition phase where increases in ILI-related indicators are expected to begin.
3. From a time-series perspective, the slightly fluctuating yet stable trend in past weeks (Week29 to Week33) suggests that, under typical conditions, occurrences are likely to rise gradually as the system transitions to the peak onset season. Given the low baseline but seasonally predictable upward trajectory, the model forecasts a significant increase by Week38.
4. Influenza activity was reported as low nationwide, with less than 1% of clinical specimens testing positive in Weeks29–33, 2022 (Week29 #1, Week30 #1, Week31 #1, Week32 #1, Week33 #1). The co-circulation of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV continues to complicate interpretation of ILI trends, as highlighted by the CDC (Week29 #10, Week30 #10, Week31 #10, Week32 #11, Week33 #9).
5. Novel influenza virus infections were detected in Weeks30–33, 2022, including Influenza A (H3N2)v and Influenza A (H1N2)v, with swine exposure linked to isolated cases (Week30 #7, Week31 #4, Week32 #4, Week33 #3). While no sustained human-to-human transmission occurred, the emergence of novel variants indicates potential future risks.
6. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline (2.6%) during Weeks29–33, with percentages ranging from 1.4% to 1.6% (Week29 #3, Week30 #4, Week31 #5, Week32 #5, Week33 #4). Children aged 0–4 years consistently reported the highest ILI outpatient visit rates, which could signal an early upward trend in ILI activity among this age group.
7. In summary, while past ILI occurrences stayed low with minimal fluctuations, Week38, 2022 marks the peak onset season when gradual increases are seasonally expected. Low vaccination emphasis, overlapping viral co-circulation, and the emergence of novel variants are key factors influencing the projection of 2171 ILI occurrences in Week38, reflecting anticipated seasonal growth.
