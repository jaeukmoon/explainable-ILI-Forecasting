1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend with values of ['1425', '1405', '1350', '1421', '1444']. The lowest value of 1350 (Week27, 2024) was followed by an increase to 1444 (Week29, 2024), and while fluctuations were present, the overall pattern suggests a slight upward momentum toward the last week.
2. A modest positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences can be noted, as the increase from 1350 (Week27, 2024) to 1444 (Week29, 2024) aligns with the rise to 1634 future occurrences by Week34, 2024. This pattern reflects a continuation of the gradual upward trend in ILI activity observed toward the end of the 5-week data series.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable and below baseline over the 5-week period, ranging from 1.5% in Week25, 2024, to 1.4% in Week29, 2024. While low, the persistently slight levels of respiratory illness activity allowed for transmission, which could contribute to future ILI occurrences.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as RSV and COVID-19 alongside influenza was consistently reported across all 5 weeks, highlighting the combined effect of multiple pathogens in fueling broader respiratory illness activity, thereby contributing to the future increase.
5. The continued detection of novel Influenza A(H5) and A(H1N1)v cases in Weeks26 and 28, 2024, alongside minimal antiviral resistance, reflects evolving influenza activity in the population. While case numbers are limited, these developments may signal heightened surveillance sensitivity and tracking efforts, which could contribute to the noted rise in future ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 1634 future ILI occurrences (Week34, 2024) can be attributed to the upward momentum in Weeks28–29, 2024, steady outpatient ILI visits below baseline, the dynamic co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, and increased sensitivity to tracking emerging influenza strains. The interplay of these factors collectively explains the observed rise in future activity.
