1. The reported ILI counts from Week30 to Week34, 2021 are 17202, 18422, 19975, 21495, and 20189. The trend demonstrates a consistent week-over-week increase from Week30 to Week33, peaking at 21495. However, there is a slight decline in Week34 to 20189, suggesting slight fluctuation following a sustained rise. Overall, the trajectory highlights an increasing trend over most weeks with a minor drop at the end.
2. Forecasting that Week39, 2021 belongs to the peak onset season aligns with patterns and season classification. Historically, Week39 falls within the peak onset season, as significant rises in ILI occurrences are expected during this period (indicative of early ILI activity buildup, not yet peaking). The observed data shows increasing ILI trends in the previous weeks, matching the expected progression during the peak onset season.
3. The correlation analysis of the observed increasing ILI trend from Week30 to Week34, 2021, with a slight dip in Week34, suggests that ILI occurrences are beginning to stabilize after intensive growth. However, given that Week39 falls within the peak onset season and historical trends indicate strengthened activity in this window, projected values likely reflect moderate regression towards normalized respiratory activity coupled with seasonality-driving factors.
4. Three distinct factors from summarized CDC reports strongly influencing the forecast:
5. - Rising outpatient respiratory illness visits below the baseline but increasing steadily across all age groups in Week30 (1.9%), Week31 (2.0%), Week32 (2.1%), Week33 (2.2%), and Week34 (2.2%) highlight ongoing respiratory transmission, contributing to sustained ILI occurrences.
6. - Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 rather than influenza itself drives these increases, creating overlapping impacts on ILI outpatient visits across regions, as observed in Week30 (#7), Week31 (#3), and Week34 (#4).
7. - Low vaccination trends and changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the pandemic (Week30 #8, Week32 #8, and Week34 #8) render ILI monitoring less accurate and increase susceptibility to respiratory illnesses, which may elevate ILI numbers.
5. The ILI counts over five weeks reveal an increasing trend transitioning into fluctuation. Week39, 2021 likely reflects peak onset seasonal trends, consistent with early ILI buildup. Rising outpatient respiratory illnesses, compounded by co-circulating SARS-CoV-2, and low flu vaccination uptake further justify an expected stabilization of ILI occurrences around 11116 for this period.
