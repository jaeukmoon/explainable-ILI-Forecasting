1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent downward trend, with values of ['20189', '17987', '16276', '12979', '11487']. Starting from a high of 20189 in Week 34, 2021, the ILI occurrences declined steadily each week, reaching 11487 by Week 38, 2021. This clear decline signals a substantial reduction in reported ILI activity during this period.
2. A direct correlation between the declining trend in the past ILI occurrences and the future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (11880 in Week 43, 2021) suggests that although ILI numbers decreased substantially during Weeks 34–38, the relatively small reduction in the last observed week (11487 in Week 38, 2021) served as a stabilizing point, aligning with the slight increase to 11880 in the future weeks.
3. Minimal influenza virus activity was detected during the past 5 weeks, as reported by clinical and public health labs, with positivity rates consistently at or below 0.1%, indicating negligible direct influenza contributions to ILI data. Low but stable percentages of ILI outpatient visits were reported, such as 2.2% (Week 34, 2021) and 1.9% (Week 38, 2021), further supporting the lack of influenza influence on ILI trends.
4. Elevated deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), primarily driven by COVID-19, with percentages exceeding the epidemic threshold (e.g., 21.0% in Week 36, 2021 and 20.9% in Week 38, 2021), highlighted the persistent respiratory disease burden, which could contribute indirectly to reported ILI occurrences.
5. Shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, as emphasized in CDC reports, likely disrupted traditional ILI surveillance and reporting, influencing the stabilization in future ILI occurrences.
4. The summarized CDC reports noted an environment dominated by non-influenza respiratory illnesses, low flu virus circulation, and pandemic-related behavioral and healthcare system disruptions. These factors collectively led to a decrease in the observed ILI activity across Weeks 34–38, 2021, while setting stabilized conditions that likely moderated the decline and resulted in 11880 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
5. In summary, the reported 11880 future ILI occurrences (Week 43, 2021) are explained by the steady decline in past ILI occurrences stabilizing by Week 38, 2021, the minimal role of influenza activity, the dominance of COVID-19 in PIC deaths, and pandemic-triggered changes in healthcare-seeking and reporting, which minimally impacted the future ILI stabilization at 11880 after 5 weeks.
