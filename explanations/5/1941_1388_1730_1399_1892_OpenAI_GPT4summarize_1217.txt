1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating trend with the values ['1941', '1388', '1730', '1399', '1892']. There was a sharp decline from 1941 (Week1, 2021) to 1388 (Week2, 2021), followed by a brief increase to 1730 (Week3, 2021), then another decrease to 1399 (Week4, 2021), and finally a rise to 1892 (Week5, 2021). This oscillating pattern reflects unstable ILI activity within the observed period.
2. A modest negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences can be noted, where the overall uneven trend, with no consistent upward movement in the final weeks (Week4–Week5, 2021), did not directly predict the marked decrease to 936 occurrences after 5 weeks. Instead, the future value suggests a significant drop in ILI activity contrary to the occasional spikes seen in prior weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently decreased from 1.7% (Week1, 2021) to 1.1% (Week4–Week5, 2021), remaining below the national baseline of 2.6% throughout this period. This consistent, low-level activity likely explains the subdued future ILI occurrences.
4. The consistently low influenza positivity rates for respiratory specimens during the 5 weeks (e.g., 0.4% in Week1, 2021, and 0.1% in Week4 and Week5, 2021) highlight suppressed influenza transmission, which aligns with lower future ILI occurrences.
5. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare behaviors, as noted across all reports, reduced traditional ILI healthcare-seeking and disrupted typical ILI surveillance. These adjustments negatively impacted the ILI trends, contributing to fewer future occurrences.
6. Elevated PIC mortality remained present throughout the period (e.g., 17.2% in Week1, 2021, to 25.0% in Week5, 2021) but was primarily driven by COVID-19 rather than influenza, demonstrating diminished influenza-related severe outcomes or cases, further correlating with the drop to 936 future occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 936 future ILI occurrences (after 5 weeks, 2021) can be attributed to the fluctuating and uneven past ILI trend, consistently low outpatient ILI visits, minimal influenza positivity rates, and disrupted healthcare behaviors and surveillance due to the COVID-19 pandemic, offsetting any notable influenza activity increase.
