1. The reported ILI counts from Week39 to Week43, 2023 are 2037, 2328, 2168, 2348, and 2464. This data shows a generally increasing trend, with fluctuations. The ILI counts rose consistently from Week39 (2037) to Week40 (2328), dropped slightly in Week41 (2168), and rebounded in Week42 (2348) and Week43 (2464). This overall upward trajectory, despite minor variations, signals increasing influenza activity.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans from Week46 to Week6. With Week48, 2023 falling within this expected timeframe, the target prediction aligns with the peak season. CDC observations from Week43, 2023 (#10) also indicate that flu activity is anticipated to rise, consistent with entering the peak season phase.
3. The time-series analysis demonstrates consistent increases in ILI counts over the last five weeks, alongside national indicators of rising influenza positivity and hospitalizations (Week43, 2023 #1, #4). Historical patterns and the current trajectory suggest a significant increase in ILI occurrences in the following five weeks, forecasting the rise to 4597 by Week48, 2023.
4. Positivity rates of influenza are gradually increasing week over week, from 1.0% in Week39, 2023 (#1) to 1.9% in Week43, 2023 (#1). Higher positivity reflects growing transmission and likely translates to more ILI cases in the upcoming target period.
5. Regional increases in hospitalizations (Week43, 2023 #4) and outpatient visits (Week43, 2023 #3) indicate escalating ILI activity in certain high-transmission areas. Such signals often precede broader, nationwide ILI peaks.
6. Respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, are co-circulating alongside influenza (Week43, 2023 #7). The combined burden of these viral contributors can amplify respiratory illness trends, pushing ILI counts higher.
7. Combining the observed upward trend in ILI counts, the seasonal progression to peak season, rising positivity rates, increasing hospitalization trends, and the additive influence of co-circulating viruses justifies the prediction of 4597 ILI occurrences for Week48, 2023.
