1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited an overall downward trend, with values ['1621' (Week 51, 2020), '1402' (Week 52, 2020), '1451' (Week 53, 2020), '1475' (Week 1, 2021), '1259' (Week 2, 2021)]. After an initial decrease from Week 51 to Week 52, a minor uptick occurred in Weeks 53 and 1, followed by another substantial decline in Week 2, 2021. This trend suggests a general weakening of ILI activity during these periods.

2. A weak positive correlation is observed between the past and future ILI occurrences. Despite the overall decline in the past time-series, brief increases (e.g., Weeks 53 and 1) may have created localized spikes, possibly contributing to the reported future occurrence of 559 ILI cases. However, the general downward trend aligns with the relatively low future value compared to historical higher-week averages.

3. Several factors contribute to the lower future ILI occurrences. First, minimal influenza activity was established, with respiratory specimens consistently testing positive at rates far below historical norms, e.g., 0.3% (Week 51, 2020) and 0.1% (Week 2, 2021). Second, outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently below the national baseline, showing a decline from 1.6%–1.7% (Weeks 51–1) to 1.4% (Week 2, 2021). Third, impacts of COVID-19 altered traditional healthcare-seeking behaviors, suppressing influenza transmission and creating reporting disruptions throughout this period. Finally, the predominance of non-specific ILI activity and suppressed influenza seasonality reduced the potential for significant increases in future ILI occurrences.

4. In summary, the reported 559 future ILI occurrences (Week 7, 2021) are a result of the declining trend observed in the past time-series data, low influenza virus positivity rates, stable-to-declining outpatient ILI visits, and the broader impact of COVID-19 on reducing overall influenza transmission and altering healthcare-seeking behaviors. Together, these factors reflect an atypically low ILI burden for the period.
