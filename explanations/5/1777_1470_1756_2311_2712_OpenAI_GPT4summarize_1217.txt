1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating and generally upward trend, with values of ['1777', '1470', '1756', '2311', '2712']. After an initial dip from 1777 (Week 2, 2024) to 1470 (Week 3, 2024), there was a consistent increase, reaching a peak of 2712 in Week 6, 2024. This steady escalation toward the end of the period indicates a worsening epidemiological situation, likely driving the rise in future ILI occurrences.
2. A strong correlation is evident between the increasing trend in the latter weeks of past ILI occurrences (Weeks 5–6, 2024) and the future occurrences recorded at 2431 (Week 11, 2024). Although future ILI values are lower than Week 6 (2712), the elevated baseline indicates a persistence of high influenza-like illness rates.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained above the baseline, with slight fluctuations from 4.7% (Week 2, 2024) to 4.5% (Week 6, 2024). Even at lower levels, above-baseline activity signifies elevated disease transmission, sustaining continued ILI occurrence into the future.
4. The cumulative hospitalization rate increased steadily from 37.3 per 100,000 in Week 2, 2024, to 54.9 per 100,000 in Week 6, 2024, reflecting heightened disease severity, particularly among at-risk populations, further supporting the increase in future ILI occurrences.
5. Elevated levels of respiratory co-circulating viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, reported consistently across Weeks 2–6, 2024, likely contributed to sustained elevated ILI activity, compounding the observed rise in Week 11, 2024.
6. In summary, the future 2431 ILI occurrences (Week 11, 2024) were driven by the consistent upward trend in past ILI data, high outpatient visit percentages above baseline, persistently increasing hospitalization rates, and the continued impact of respiratory virus co-circulation.
