1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week42 to Week46, 2023 are 12389, 13096, 14457, 16408, and 18067. The trend shows a clear and steady increase in ILI cases, with notable weekly growth. This progression suggests increasing flu activity heading towards the peak season. There are no significant fluctuations or dips, indicating continued upward momentum in disease activity.
2. Forecasting Week51, 2023 aligns with the peak season. In the U.S., the typical peak season spans from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the following year. The observed escalations in ILI occurrences and CDC reports from Week42 to Week46, 2023 are consistent with the typical patterns of increasing flu prevalence in this timeframe, further solidifying that Week51, 2023 falls within the high-activity peak season.
3. From the time-series forecasting perspective, the consistent and steep upward trend observed in the past five weeks (Week42 to Week46, 2023) strongly projects further growth in ILI activity. Applying the acceleration in weekly cases (e.g., increments of 707, 1361, 1951, and 1659) to subsequent weeks suggests that values will continue rising. Such growth aligns with the predicted ILI occurrences of 29922 by Week51, as the trend indicates no current plateau or decline.
4. Influenza positivity rates are noticeably increasing across weeks: 1.7% in Week42, 1.9% in Week43, 3.0% in Week44, 4.0% in Week45, and 4.9% in Week46. These trends confirm escalating flu activity in conjunction with regional transmission growth (Week42-Week46 key points #1; Week44 #1; Week45 #1).
5. The increasing hospitalization rates provide another strong indicator of heightened ILI activity. The cumulative hospitalization rate rose from 0.5 per 100,000 in Week42, 0.8 in Week43, 1.2 in Week44, 1.7 in Week45, to 2.6 in Week46. This is the second-highest cumulative rate for Week46 since 2010 (all weeks), underscoring intensifying disease severity (Week42 #3; Week43 #4; Week44 #3; Week45 #4; Week46 #4).
6. Coinfections with other respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 also contribute to increased ILI occurrences. All weeks from Week42 to Week46 highlight significant co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens, amplifying ILI case counts in the short term (Week42 #8; Week43 #7; Week44 #10; Week45 #10; Week46 #9).
7. The predicted Week51 ILI value of 29922 is justified by the sharp upward trajectory in recent weeks (Week42 to Week46), seasonality matching the typical peak season, increases in influenza positivity, hospitalization trends, and the compounding influence of other respiratory pathogens. This convergence strongly supports the projected rise in ILI to a high value in the peak season.
