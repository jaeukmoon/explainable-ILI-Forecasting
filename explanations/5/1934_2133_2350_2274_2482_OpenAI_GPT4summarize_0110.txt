1. The reported ILI counts from Week23 to Week27, 2021 are 1934, 2133, 2350, 2274, and 2482. Analysis of the trend reveals a general increase in occurrences from Week23 (1934) to Week25 (2350), followed by a minor decrease in Week26 (2274) and another rise in Week27 (2482). The overall pattern suggests a steady upward trend over this period, with minor fluctuations.
2. Based on U.S. seasonality patterns, Week32, 2021 falls within the Peak onset season, as it aligns with the timing (Week32 to Week46) when influenza activity typically starts to rise from baseline levels, transitioning toward higher prevalence.
3. The time-series trend indicates an upward trajectory in occurrences, with ILI showing incremental increases over the 5 weeks (Week23-Week27, 2021). This trend suggests a continued rise leading into the Peak onset season. Projecting forward, the trajectory and timing would account for a higher future value like 4097 in Week32, 2021 based on the increasing momentum.
4. During Week27, 2021, Influenza B predominates (70.6%) over Influenza A (29.4%), and the confirmed presence of the Victoria lineage for Influenza B implies a specific strain contributing to ongoing transmission (Week27, 2021 #2). Though influenza positivity remains low (0.1%), this strain may drive gradual increases into the coming weeks.
5. Outpatient respiratory illness visits reflect a slight rise by Week27, 2021, where ILI visits increased slightly in the 5–24 and 25–49 age groups compared to prior weeks (Week27, 2021 #3). This demographic shift suggests growing spread within higher-contact, more mobile populations, likely contributing to the forecasted increase in occurrences.
6. The CDC foresees challenges in ILI activity predictions due to healthcare access shifts and overlapping SARS-CoV-2 activity (Week27, 2021 #9). While influenza activity is reported as minimal, ongoing healthcare-seeking changes during the COVID-19 pandemic could obscure relevant signal trends (Week26, 2021 #6), potentially underestimating the increase prior to Week32.
7. The projected ILI value of 4097 for Week32, 2021 reflects the interplay of factors including a steady upward trend in reported ILI occurrences, the timing of Peak onset season, increasing spread within certain age groups, and the dynamic relation of influenza patterns with COVID-19-related disruptions. These factors collectively drive the expected rise.
