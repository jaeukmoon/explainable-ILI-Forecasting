1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited fluctuations but an overall decline in the final weeks, with values of ['1064', '975', '1124', '1063', '969']. There was an initial decrease from 1064 (Week 38, 2021) to 975 (Week 39, 2021), followed by a surge to 1124 (Week 40, 2021). However, this was succeeded by a steady drop to 969 (Week 42, 2021). This pattern highlights inconsistencies in ILI activity, with no strong sustained increase over the observed period.

2. A moderate positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences can be inferred. Although the past time-series settled at a lower point (969 in Week 42, 2021), the earlier peak of 1124 (Week 40, 2021) suggests potential residual respiratory illness activity, which may have driven the increase to 1216 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 47, 2021). The fluctuation in past values may act as a precursor to more variable respiratory trends.

3. Despite low national influenza activity, multiple high-correlating factors are noted. First, pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC)-related deaths consistently surpassed epidemic thresholds, declining from 20.9% (Week 38, 2021) to 16.5% (Week 42, 2021) but remaining significantly elevated, largely driven by COVID-19. The persistent PIC mortality reflects ongoing respiratory illness activity that may influence the observed future rise. Second, healthcare-seeking behaviors continued to shift due to the COVID-19 pandemic, disrupting surveillance systems and potentially clustering future ILI recognition. Third, non-influenza respiratory pathogens showed sustained contributions to respiratory illness patterns, amplifying ILI occurrences. Finally, despite vaccination reminders, no concrete vaccination uptake trends were reported—low vaccination coverage may sustain susceptibility to illness.

4. In summary, the reported 1216 future ILI occurrences (Week 47, 2021) can be attributed to inconsistent trends in past ILI data, persistent PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, the compounding effects of healthcare-seeking and surveillance disruptions, and ongoing activity from non-influenza pathogens. These dynamics collectively contributed to increased respiratory illness activity after 5 weeks.
