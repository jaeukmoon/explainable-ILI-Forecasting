1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1897', '1895', '2172', '2707', '3350']. Starting at 1897 (Week 42, 2023), the ILI occurrences remained stable initially before beginning a steady increase, peaking at 3350 in Week 46, 2023. This upward trend reflects a growing burden of influenza-like illnesses over the observed period.
2. A clear positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the steady increase toward the end of the past time series (Weeks 45–46, 2023) corresponds to the subsequent rise to 5807 ILI occurrences in Week 51, 2023. The ongoing escalation observed in the later weeks set the stage for continued growth in influenza-like illness cases.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI rose significantly from 2.5% (Week 42, 2023) to 3.7% (Week 46, 2023), exceeding the national baseline of 2.9% by Week 45. This increase in patient visits reflects heightened respiratory illness activity, contributing to rising future ILI occurrences. Cumulative hospitalization rates increased markedly from 0.5 per 100,000 (Week 42) to 2.6 per 100,000 (Week 46), with the elderly (65+ years) experiencing the highest rates. Both the rise in hospitalizations and the predominance of Influenza A(H1N1) (79.3% in Week 46) further illustrate the trend of increasing severe influenza-associated illness. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, such as RSV and COVID-19, alongside influenza intensified the overall burden on the population and likely amplified future ILI cases.
4. Vaccination data showed a consistent CDC recommendation for all individuals aged 6 months and older, but the persistent lack of updates on vaccination rates (Weeks 42–46, 2023) suggests potentially suboptimal coverage. This gap may have facilitated the further spread of respiratory illnesses. Additionally, viral positivity rates increased from 1.7% (Week 42) to 4.9% (Week 46), confirming an intensifying influenza season with broader regional impacts.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 5807 (Week 51, 2023) can be explained by the consistent upward trend in past ILI occurrences, increasing outpatient ILI visits and hospitalizations, sustained activity of influenza A(H1N1), and the contribution of co-circulating respiratory viruses, compounded by limited data on vaccination uptake and rising viral positivity rates. These factors collectively reflect an escalating respiratory illness burden leading into Week 51, 2023.
