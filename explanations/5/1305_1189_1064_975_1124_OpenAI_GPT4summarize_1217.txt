1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks ('1305', '1189', '1064', '975', '1124') illustrate a fluctuating downward trend initially, marked by a sharp drop from 1305 (Week 36, 2021) to 975 (Week 39, 2021). However, the final week (Week 40, 2021) shows a slight rebound to 1124, potentially signaling a stabilization or slight seasonal increase in respiratory illnesses.
2. A moderate correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences, as the eventual rebound in Week 40, 2021, aligns with the return to a comparable level of 1189 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 45, 2021). The resurgence toward the end of the series likely contributed to maintaining future ILI counts at an elevated level.
3. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) throughout the observed period remained substantially above the epidemic thresholds, ranging from 20.9% (Week 38, 2021) to 18.0% (Week 40, 2021), predominantly driven by COVID-19. This persistent PIC burden reflects heightened respiratory illness activity, influencing future ILI occurrences.
4. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, repeatedly highlighted across the reports, posed challenges for accurately capturing ILI trends, potentially leading to shifts or lags in data capture, which affected future reporting.
5. Minimal influenza virus circulation was consistently reported during the period, with clinical specimen positivity rates as low as 0.1% (Weeks 36 and 40, 2021). The rise in ILI occurrences is thus attributed to other respiratory viruses or broader non-specific respiratory illnesses, which also contribute to the future level of ILI activity.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1189 (Week 45, 2021) are aligned with the stabilization of past ILI trends (Week 40, 2021), the sustained high PIC mortality rates, pandemic-driven healthcare-seeking disruptions, and the dominance of non-influenza respiratory illnesses during the observation period.
