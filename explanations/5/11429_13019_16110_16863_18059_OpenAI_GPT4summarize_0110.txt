1. The ILI counts from Week4, 2024 (11429) to Week8, 2024 (18059) display an upward trend. This includes steady increases from Week4 to Week6 (11429 → 13019 → 16110), followed by a moderate rise through Week7 (16863) and Week8 (18059). The overall pattern suggests a consistent and gradual increase in ILI occurrence during this period.
2. Based on U.S. seasonal norms, Week13, 2024 falls within the off-season, as the typical peak season concludes around Week6, and Week13 aligns with the off-season timeline (Week9 to Week30). Although elevated flu activity persists, the classification remains consistent with off-season trends.
3. Historical data indicates that after stable increases during Weeks4–8, subsequent weeks often experience a plateau or slight reduction in growth rates. This time-series data, combined with elevated but stabilizing respiratory illness trends, projects a moderate reduction in ILI counts for Week13, 2024. Therefore, the forecast drops to 11544 occurrences, reflecting slowing growth from the earlier upward trajectory.
4. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (Week4, 2024 #8; Week5, 2024 #10; Week6, 2024 #9; Week7, 2024 #9; Week8, 2024 #10) continues to contribute to ILI trends but has shown no dramatic increase or novelty to drive notably higher rates.
5. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 remains the predominant strain (Week4, 2024 #2; Week5, 2024 #3; Week6, 2024 #3; Week7, 2024 #3; Week8, 2024 #3), and while influenza B activity has increased moderately (Week5, 2024 #9; Week6, 2024 #10; Week8, 2024 #11), this rise remains gradual without significant surges.
6. Vaccination rates continue to play a stabilizing role in mitigating high transmission levels, as vaccination is widely recommended (Week4, 2024 #7; Week5, 2024 #7; Week6, 2024 #7; Week7, 2024 #7; Week8, 2024 #8), and antivirals show high efficacy (Week4, 2024 #10; Week5, 2024 #7; Week6, 2024 #8).
7. In summary, the projected ILI occurrence of 11544 for Week13, 2024 aligns with stabilizing trends in respiratory illness visits, moderate influenza positivity rates, a well-controlled vaccination campaign, and co-circulating viruses without sharp escalations. The forecast reflects an expected leveling following earlier increases based on historical correlations and observed trends.
