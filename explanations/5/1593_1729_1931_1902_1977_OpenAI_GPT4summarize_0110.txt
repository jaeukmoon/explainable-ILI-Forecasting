1. The ILI occurrences from Week10 to Week14, 2022 were 1593, 1729, 1931, 1902, and 1977. This shows a clear upward trend from Week10 (1593) to Week12 (1931), suggesting increasing activity. A minor stabilization or plateau followed from Week13 (1902) to Week14 (1977). Overall, the trend indicates a moderate increase in ILI activity, with no sudden spikes or substantial declines.
2. Forecasting target week (Week19, 2022) belongs to the off-season. Although Week19, 2022 serves as a second peak window, current ILI values are below baseline, and past reports indicate that flu activity intensity aligns more closely with off-season behavior rather than a true widespread peak.
3. Time-series analysis shows that, leading into Week14, ILI levels consistently rose and stabilized slightly toward Week14. This trend would likely project forward into a mild rise or stabilization due to regional variations and ongoing respiratory activity. Based on historical patterns evolving seasonally and regionally, Week19's projection of 3134 occurs amidst a slow-building phase favoring moderate continuation of rising activity.
4. Influenza positivity rates rose steadily in clinical labs, reaching 8.4% in Week14, 2022, and showing a predominance of A(H3N2) (Week10, 2022 #2; Week14, 2022 #2). This particular subtype demonstrated limited antigenic compatibility with the vaccine and is likely contributing to increased spread and ILI visits.
5. The presence of co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, continues to complicate ILI metrics, with mixed contribution to outpatient visits. However, consistent reports of coinfection and co-circulation trends (Week12, 2022 #9; Week14, 2022 #13) indicate that these factors are fostering an environment for lingering respiratory illness activity.
6. Regional intensity variation is notable, with highest influenza activity in central and south-central regions and rising trends in others (Week12, 2022 #1; Week14, 2022 #1). Regional disparities contribute to sustained ILI visits, which may continue for localized populations into Week19, 2022.
7. In summary, the ILI occurrence of 3134 forecasted for Week19, 2022 reflects the interaction of a modest upward historical trend, regional variability sustaining activity, widespread A(H3N2) dominance with partial vaccine mismatch, and continued co-circulation of respiratory viruses. These factors justify the prediction of moderate ongoing increases remaining in the off-season classification.
