1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences for Region 4 from Week29, 2022 to Week33, 2022 show fluctuation but with an overall upward movement. Specifically, ILI occurrences were 13570 (Week29), 13067 (Week30), 11626 (Week31), 11715 (Week32), and 13526 (Week33). A sharp decline from Week29 to Week31 (13570 to 11626) was followed by stabilization (11715) and then a notable increase to 13526 in Week33. This suggests a shifting trend likely indicative of entering a more active ILI phase driven by seasonal dynamics, with Week33 marking a return to elevated activity levels.
2. Week38, 2022 belongs to the "Peak onset season." Based on Background Knowledge, the Peak onset season typically starts around Week32-Week35 and lasts until Week46. Since Week38 falls within this period and is characterized by increasing ILI activity from baseline toward peak levels, the prediction for this week is based on anticipated growth during this initial ascent phase of the seasonal cycle.
3. A time-series forecasting approach provides the quantitative foundation. Calculating the 5-week moving average from the provided data:
4. (13570 + 13067 + 11626 + 11715 + 13526) / 5 = 12700.8 (average). From Week33's base value of 13526, the Peak onset season’s expected growth rate is incorporated. Using historical patterns and CDC reports, an estimated 5% week-over-week increase is applied to project ILI occurrences during the Peak onset season. Over five weeks, the compounding growth is calculated as follows:
5. 13526 × (1.05)^5 ≈ 16932. Thus, with sustained escalation during the Peak onset season, the prediction for Week38 is 16932.
4. CDC reports highlight three primary influencing factors contributing to this rise:
5. First, increased co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., COVID-19 and RSV) alongside influenza is expected to amplify overall ILI activity. This multi-virus overlap is a pivotal driver, raising ILI outpatient visits and possibly cases. Second, the dominance of Influenza A (H3N2)—which historically drives higher transmission rates compared to Influenza B—is critical. Over 90% of positive influenza cases in public health labs were Influenza A (Week29-Week33), indicating a strain prone to spike activity levels during Peak onset season. Third, changes in healthcare-seeking behavior post-pandemic, as seen in increased outpatient visits for ILI among children (6.1%-6.4% for ages 0-4 during Weeks29-33), directly impact ILI surveillance data and numbers. Together, these factors contribute to the sustained growth seen in projections.
5. In summary, ILI occurrences are predicted to increase to 16932 due to the upward trajectory seen in recent weeks, the classification of Week38, 2022 in the Peak onset season, and the compounding effect of factors such as respiratory virus co-circulation, dominant H3N2 activity, and shifts in healthcare-seeking trends. These quantitative and qualitative elements strongly support the forecasted value of 16932.
