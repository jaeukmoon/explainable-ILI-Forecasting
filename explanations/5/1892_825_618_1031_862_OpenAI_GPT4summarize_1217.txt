1. The past time-series ILI occurrences demonstrated an overall downward trend over the 5 weeks, with values of ['1892', '825', '618', '1031', '862']. The sharp decline from 1892 (Week5, 2021) to 618 (Week7, 2021) was followed by a modest rebound to 1031 (Week8, 2021) and a slight decrease to 862 (Week9, 2021). While the decline dominated the early period, the latter weeks showed a stabilization with minor fluctuations, suggesting a potential shift in ILI patterns.
2. A correlation exists between the past and future data, as the increase in ILI occurrences in Week8, 2021 (1031) hinted at the possibility of activity resuming. This upward adjustment, together with leveling trends by Week9, 2021 (862), correlates with the observed future rise to 1464 after 5 weeks, indicating a turnaround in activity following a prolonged decline.
3. Factors from the summarized reports indicating correlations include: ILI outpatient visit percentages consistently below baseline but stable at 1.1%, 1.0%, 0.9%, and 0.8% (Weeks5-9, 2021), with increasing trends reported specifically among children aged 0–4 years (Week7, 2021 onward); persistent COVID-19 impact on healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance data interpretation (Weeks5-9, 2021), signaling underreporting or delayed case acknowledgment; and the unpredictable nature of ILI and influenza activity emphasized across all weeks, compounded by pandemic perturbations (Weeks5-9, 2021).
4. Elevated deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) exceeding epidemic thresholds—ranging from 25.0% (Week5, 2021) to 14.6% (Week9, 2021)—predominantly driven by COVID-19, reflect concurrent respiratory illness activity that indirectly impacts ILI trends, indicating broader respiratory disease pressures feeding into future occurrences.
5. In summary, the projected increase to 1464 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks can be attributed to the initial declining trend stabilizing in Weeks8-9, 2021; pediatric ILI increases; disruptions in monitoring due to the pandemic; and concurrent respiratory pressures seen in elevated PIC mortality. These combined factors suggest a delayed but notable uptick in ILI occurrences.
