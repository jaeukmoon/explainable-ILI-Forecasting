1. The past time-series ILI occurrences for the 5 weeks demonstrate fluctuations, with values of ['1189', '1064', '975', '1124', '1063']. There was an initial decline from 1189 in Week 37, 2021, to 975 in Week 39, 2021, followed by an increase to 1124 in Week 40, 2021, and a slight drop to 1063 in Week 41, 2021. This pattern suggests an oscillating trend, with no clear sustained increase or decrease over the observed period.
2. A weak but notable correlation exists between past and future occurrences, as the increasing fluctuation observed in Week 39 and Week 40, 2021, provides a foundation for the rise to 1240 occurrences by Week 46, 2021. The variability in past weeks could foreshadow the eventual rise in ILI cases.
3. Weekly outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 2.1% (Week 37, 2021) to 1.8% (Week 41, 2021), consistently below the 2.5%-2.6% national baseline. However, the slight weakening trend in ILI percentages and non-influenza pathogen contributions indicate underlying respiratory activity, contributing to the rise by Week 46, 2021.
4. PIC-related mortality rates remained significantly high (21.1% in Week 37, 2021, to 17.5% in Week 41, 2021), consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds, primarily due to COVID-19. This heightened respiratory-related mortality suggests broader seasonal respiratory activity that could inform the future rise to 1240 occurrences.
5. Continued shifts in healthcare-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional ILI surveillance systems, as indicated across reports. These disruptions could delay disease recognition and amplify reported ILI occurrences in the subsequent weeks.
6. Influenza virus positivity rates remained notably minimal (e.g., 0.1% in Weeks 40 and 41, 2021), but other respiratory viral activity and novel influenza subtypes may have contributed to cumulative ILI occurrences in the future.
7. In summary, the future rise to 1240 ILI occurrences by Week 46, 2021, can be attributed to fluctuating past trends, slight contributions from non-influenza respiratory illnesses, sustained high PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the impacts of pandemic-related challenges in healthcare-seeking and ILI surveillance systems.
