1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an inconsistent yet slightly increasing pattern towards the end, with values of ['13570', '13067', '11626', '11715', '13526']. There was a decline from 13570 (Week29, 2022) to 11626 (Week31, 2022), followed by a minor increase in Week32, 2022, and a notable rise to 13526 in Week33, 2022, signaling a potential rebound in respiratory illness activity.
2. A clear correlation exists between the past week's upward trend in ILI occurrences (particularly Weeks 32-33, 2022) and the future rise in ILI cases to 16932, as continued increases in the latter weeks act as a precursor to the surge recorded after 5 weeks (Week38, 2022).
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistent at approximately 1.5-1.6% across all 5 weeks, with children aged 0-4 years consistently exhibiting notably higher rates (e.g., 6.4% in Week29, 2022, and 6.3% in Week33, 2022). This consistently elevated rate among younger age groups likely contributed significantly to the observed future increase.
4. Persistent PIC mortality rates exceeding epidemic thresholds were recorded throughout the 5 weeks, ranging from 9.8% (Week29, 2022) to 10.0% (Week33, 2022). While primarily driven by COVID-19, this elevated PIC mortality reflects sustained respiratory illness prevalence, highlighting its influence on the upcoming rise in ILI cases.
5. The influence of viral co-circulation (e.g., Influenza A, influenza B, SARS-CoV-2), combined with changes in healthcare-seeking behavior, complicates direct ILI surveillance interpretation but contributes to the overall increase in respiratory illness burden by Week38, 2022.
6. In summary, the future occurrence of 16932 ILI cases (Week38, 2022) stems from the rebound and upward trend in past ILI data from Weeks 32-33, rising rates of outpatient visits driven by pediatric cases, persistently elevated PIC mortality rates, and the compounding effects of viral co-circulation and healthcare behavior changes.
