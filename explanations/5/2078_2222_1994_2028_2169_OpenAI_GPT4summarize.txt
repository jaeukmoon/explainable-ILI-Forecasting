1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating trend, with values of ['2078', '2222', '1994', '2028', '2169']. There was an initial rise from 2078 (Week 49, 2020) to 2222 (Week 50, 2020), a subsequent dip to 1994 (Week 51, 2020), followed by a slight recovery peaking at 2169 (Week 53, 2020). This oscillating pattern suggests an overall stable yet slightly declining trajectory by Week 53, 2020.  

2. A moderate decline in ILI occurrences is evident when comparing the past data to the future value of 1714 after 5 weeks (Week 58, 2021). The slight decrease in past ILI activity from Week 51 to Week 53 (1994 to 2169) aligns with the continuation of reduced ILI activity reflected in the eventual drop to 1714 future occurrences.  

3. Low influenza activity persisted during Weeks 49–53, 2020, with only 0.1–0.3% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza. This consistently low circulation of influenza strains likely contributed to minimal ILI occurrences in the future.  
   - Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at 1.6% throughout Weeks 49–53, 2020, well below the 2.6% national baseline. The lack of any significant increase in outpatient visits thus correlates with the reduced future ILI numbers.  
   - Despite continued high levels of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), ranging from 13.3% to 14.5% during Weeks 49–53, 2020, the majority were linked to COVID-19 rather than influenza. This suggests that influenza played a minimal role in driving ILI occurrences during this period.  
   - The consistent challenges posed by pandemic-related changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during Weeks 49–53, 2020, may have further suppressed traditional surveillance data and contributed to underreporting, aligning with lower future ILI occurrences.  

4. In summary, the observed decline to 1714 future occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 58, 2021) can be attributed to the fluctuating but stable-to-declining trajectory of past ILI activity, persistently low influenza positivity rates, stable but low ILI-related outpatient visits, and the significant influence of COVID-19 on PIC deaths and healthcare-seeking behaviors, which suppressed influenza activity and complicated traditional surveillance systems. Monitoring and continued surveillance remain critical to understanding long-term trends.
