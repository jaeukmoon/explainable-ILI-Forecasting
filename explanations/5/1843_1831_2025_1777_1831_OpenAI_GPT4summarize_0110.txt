1. The reported ILI counts from Week18, 2021 to Week22, 2021 are 1843, 1831, 2025, 1777, and 1831. The trend shows a slight increase in Week20, 2021 (2025) followed by a dip in Week21, 2021 (1777) and a return to Week22, 2021 (1831), reflecting mild fluctuations with no significant rise or sustained growth. Overall, the ILI trend appears relatively stable at low levels, with minor variations.
2. Week27, 2021 belongs to the off-season as it falls outside the typical peak (Week46–Week6) and peak onset (Week32–Week46) periods, consistent with low influenza activity reported in Weeks18–22, 2021.
3. From the time-series perspective, the relatively flat and fluctuating ILI counts in Weeks18–22, 2021 indicate limited influenza transmission and low activity levels. Projecting this pattern forward, the stable trend combined with minor fluctuations leads to an anticipated ILI occurrence of 2197 in Week27, 2021.
4. Influenza activity remained minimal nationwide during Weeks18–22, 2021, with outpatient visits for ILI consistently below the national baseline of 2.6% (Week18, 2021 #4; Week19, 2021 #7; Week20, 2021 #4; Week21, 2021 #1; Week22, 2021 #1).
5. Vaccination trends remained stable, with the CDC continuing to recommend annual flu vaccination, but there were no significant changes or updates noted during this period that would impact ILI trends (Week18, 2021 #8; Week19, 2021 #9; Week20, 2021 #9; Week21, 2021 #8; Week22, 2021 #6).
6. Healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI data interpretation were influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, causing potential underreporting or data skewness (Week18, 2021 #9; Week19, 2021 #10; Week20, 2021 #10; Week21, 2021 #7; Week22, 2021 #7).
7. Given the overall stability in ILI occurrences, minimal influenza activity nationwide, vaccination trends holding steady, and the impact of healthcare patterns during COVID-19, the forecast value of 2197 ILI cases in Week27, 2021 reflects projected mild fluctuations within an off-season context.
