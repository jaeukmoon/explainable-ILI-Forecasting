1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week28 to Week32, 2024, are 10762, 10864, 10818, 10927, and 11143. The trend shows a steady rise in ILI cases, with a slight fluctuation observed between Week29 (10864) and Week30 (10818), followed by a consistent increase through Week32 (11143). This general upward trend suggests a gradual buildup in ILI activity over recent weeks.
2. Forecasting Week37, 2024, aligns with the Peak onset season, as the historical data and increasing trajectory in recent weeks (Week28-Week32, 2024) indicate the transition from the off-season (up to Week31, 2024) into the pre-peak phase, consistent with the national timeline for the Peak onset season (typically starting from Week32 or 35 in the U.S.).
3. From a time-series perspective, the observed upward trend in reported ILI cases across Week28 to Week32, 2024, demonstrates a consistent growth pattern. Extrapolating this trend and accounting for potential amplification during the Peak onset season, the model predicts a further rise in ILI occurrences by Week37, 2024, forecasting a value of 13311.
4. National influenza positivity remains low, ranging from 0.8% in Week28, 2024, to 0.4% in Week32, 2024, but the steady rise in outpatient ILI visits from 1.4% (Week28, 2024) to 1.5% (Week32, 2024) reflects a broadening impact of respiratory viruses co-circulating amidst stable influenza activity.
5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and influenza, has been highlighted consistently (Week28, 2024 #10; Week29, 2024 #7; Week30, 2024 #6; Week31, 2024 #8; Week32, 2024 #8), contributing to an escalating trend in reported ILI cases and warranting near-future vigilance.
6. Vaccination coverage remains stable but with challenges due to reportedly low vaccine effectiveness in Week32, 2024 (#9), which can impair the immunogenic protection of at-risk populations as ILI activity advances into the Peak onset season.
7. In summary, the increasing ILI activity trend (Week28-Week32, 2024), transition into the forecasted Peak onset season (Week37, 2024), the co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, and low vaccine effectiveness collectively justify the model’s projection of 13311 ILI occurrences for Week37, 2024.
