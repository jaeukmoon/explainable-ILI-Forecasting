1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks (Week20, 2024 to Week24, 2024) in Region 8 show a clear decreasing trend, with values steadily declining from 1635 in Week20 to 924 in Week24. This corresponds to a week-over-week percentage decrease of approximately 8.75% (from 1635 to 1492), 8.37% (from 1492 to 1367), 18.13% (from 1367 to 1119), and 17.39% (from 1119 to 924). The trend suggests a consistent decline in ILI activity with sharper drops occurring in later weeks, indicating reduced baseline influenza prevalence typically associated with the middle of the off-season.
2. Week29, 2024, falls within the "Off-season" as per the U.S. flu season structure. The off-season is marked by minimal ILI activity and spans from after the peak season (e.g., Week6-9) to the next peak onset season (beginning typically around Week31-35). Since Week29 is still in the off-season (as per Background Knowledge), the ILI occurrences are expected to remain low, reflecting a minimal baseline level of influenza transmission.
3. A correlation analysis between past trends and future ILI occurrences involves projecting historical patterns forward. By analyzing the percentage decreases across the past five weeks, we calculate an average weekly decline rate of approximately 13.16%. Applying this average decline sequentially to the Week24 occurrence (924) to project forward, we estimate successive weekly values as follows:
4. Week25: 924 × (1 - 0.1316) ≈ 802
5. Week26: 802 × (1 - 0.1316) ≈ 696
6. Week27: 696 × (1 - 0.1316) ≈ 605
7. Week28: 605 × (1 - 0.1316) ≈ 526
8. Week29: 526 × (1 - 0.1316) ≈ 457. However, the projection model needs adjustment based on relevant CDC factors discussed next.
4. Several external CDC-reported factors are integrated into the forecast for Week29, 2024:
1. Vaccination rates remain stable and the genetic match between circulating strains and vaccine components is likely suppressing flu transmission. This reinforces the rate of decline in ILI activity but does not trigger abrupt resurgence (+0% adjustment to stabilization).
