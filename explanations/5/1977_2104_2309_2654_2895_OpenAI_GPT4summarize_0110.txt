1. The reported ILI counts from Week14 to Week18, 2022 are 1977, 2104, 2309, 2654, and 2895. This shows a consistent upwards trend with a pronounced increase each week. The steady rise suggests increasing influenza activity, with no signs of stabilization or decline within this period.
2. Week23, 2022 occurs after the peak season for influenza but aligns with the special late-season peak mentioned in historical patterns for Week19. As influenza activity is still reported to be increasing in later weeks and historically prolonged in such outliers (Week18, 2022 #1, #10), Week23, 2022 likely correlates with an extension of the off-season rather than traditional peak timelines. However, the specific rise suggests alignment with a peak onset season for late-season activity.
3. From a time-series view, the continuous increase over five weeks strongly suggests growth in ILI occurrences. Linear extrapolation of the trend anticipates this rising trajectory persisting into Week23, 2022, justifying the projected value of 3158. The growth shows a multiplier effect above earlier fluctuations in Week14-Week16, signaling escalated transmission by Week23, 2022.
4. Influenza activity remained regionally heightened in central and south-central areas with an increasing positivity percentage (Week14, 2022 #1, #2; Week15, 2022 #1, #2; Week16, 2022 #1; Week18, 2022 #1).
5. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory viruses impacts trends. Although influenza remains predominant, concurrent co-circulation could amplify overall respiratory illness visits (Week14, 2022 #12; Week15, 2022 #11; Week17, 2022 #9).
6. Influenza hospital admission rates have grown significantly (Week14, 2022 #10; Week17, 2022 #4; Week18, 2022 #3), reinforcing a possible higher prevalence in coming weeks. This indicator of severe cases suggests continued ILI growth correlating with increased transmission.
7. Rising late-season activity, sustained hospitalizations, and regional contributions point to an expected continued upward trajectory for ILI counts through Week23, 2022. Combined with minor antigenic mismatches in A(H3N2) and growing positivity rates, these factors substantiate a plausible projection for 3158 ILI occurrences.
