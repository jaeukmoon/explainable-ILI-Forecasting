1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited fluctuations with no consistent trend: 1816 (Week 17, 2021), 1843 (Week 18, 2021), 1831 (Week 19, 2021), 2025 (Week 20, 2021), and 1777 (Week 21, 2021). Notably, Week 20 recorded a significant peak at 2025, followed by a steep decline in Week 21 to 1777. These fluctuations suggest an unstable pattern in ILI activity without a clear directional trend.

2. The reported future ILI occurrences of 2237 (Week 26, 2021) demonstrate a notable increase compared to Week 21, 2021, breaking the previous downward trajectory. However, the spike observed in Week 20 (2025) might indicate a prelude to the rise seen after 5 weeks. This correlation suggests that intermittent peaks in the past data may have signaled increased ILI activity in subsequent weeks.

3. The outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently below the national baseline of 2.6% during Weeks 17–21, 2021, with values fluctuating between 1.1% and 1.3%. A slight uptick from 1.1% (Week 17, 2021) to 1.3% (Week 20, 2021) suggests increased respiratory illness activity. Even if minimal, this growth in outpatient ILI-related visits aligns with the upward trajectory observed in future occurrences.

4. PIC mortality data consistently remained above the epidemic threshold across Weeks 17–21, 2021, underscoring elevated respiratory disease activity. For instance, PIC deaths accounted for 11.7% (Week 17, 2021), 10.1% (Week 19, 2021), and 9.5% (Week 20, 2021), with most cases driven by COVID-19. This persistent PIC mortality indicates underlying respiratory illness dynamics that may have contributed to the observed future increase in ILI occurrences.

5. Significant disruptions in ILI data collection and surveillance caused by the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic were reported across Week 17–21, 2021. These disruptions may have masked actual influenza activity, potentially delaying case reporting and amplifying the future ILI surge observed in Week 26, 2021.

6. In conclusion, the future ILI occurrences of 2237 (Week 26, 2021) were influenced by the fluctuating trend in past ILI activity, with intermittent peaks such as Week 20 (2025) possibly serving as precursors. The slight increase in outpatient ILI visits, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and disruptions to traditional ILI surveillance likely compounded the subsequent rise in occurrences. These factors collectively explain the observed increase in ILI activity after 5 weeks.
