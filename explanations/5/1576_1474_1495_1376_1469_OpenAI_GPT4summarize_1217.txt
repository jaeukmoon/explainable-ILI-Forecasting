1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show a fluctuating trend with an overall decline, with values of ['1576', '1474', '1495', '1376', '1469']. After starting at 1576 in Week23, 2021, a decrease is observed in Week24, 2021 (1474), followed by a slight rebound to 1495 in Week25, 2021. However, the decline resumes in Week26, 2021 (1376), before a minor recovery to 1469 in Week27, 2021. This oscillating pattern reflects inconsistent ILI activity during these weeks, remaining below 1600 throughout the observed period.
2. A weak positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences can be observed as the sporadic fluctuations in Weeks23–27, 2021, precede a significant increase to 2456 future occurrences by Week32, 2021. Despite the oscillations in the earlier weeks, the rise from Week27, 2021, suggests a potential precursor to the scaled-up ILI activity evident after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently below the 2.6% national baseline throughout the 5 weeks, fluctuating slightly from 1.2% in Weeks23–26, 2021, to 1.3% in Week27, 2021. The subtle increase in Week27, 2021, particularly among age groups 5–24 and 25–49, may contribute to the spike in ILI occurrences over the following period.
4. Pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC)-attributed deaths consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, ranging from 6.6% in Week25, 2021, to 6.2% in Week26, 2021, despite most PIC deaths being linked to COVID-19 rather than influenza. This persistent respiratory illness burden indicates an ongoing context of heightened illness activity that might have indirectly driven the rise to 2456 ILI occurrences.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavioral changes throughout Weeks23–27, 2021, reported disruptions in surveillance and alternative care settings were consistently cited as complicating ILI data accuracy and interpretation. These factors, combined with concurrent monitoring of COVID-19 trends, likely contributed to underreported or shifted ILI activity, amplifying the apparent rise to 2456 occurrences after 5 weeks.
6. Minimal influenza positivity rates across Weeks23–27, 2021 (e.g., <0.1% positivity in Week24, 2021), coupled with negligible lab-confirmed influenza circulation, suggest that non-specific respiratory illnesses or the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could have contributed significantly to inflated future ILI numbers.
7. In summary, the significant rise to 2456 future ILI occurrences (Week32, 2021) can be attributed to inconsistent ILI activity during Weeks23–27, 2021, compounded by slightly increasing outpatient visits; elevated PIC-related deaths surpassing epidemic thresholds; pandemic-driven disruptions in healthcare-seeking patterns and respiratory illness reporting; and contributions from non-specific ILI cases or interactions with COVID-19 trends.
