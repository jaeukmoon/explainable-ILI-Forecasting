1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week50, 2020 to Week1, 2021 are 1263, 1077, 1069, 1060, and 1115. The time-series data shows a decreasing trend from Week50, 2020 (1263) to Week53, 2020 (1060), followed by a slight increase in Week1, 2021 (1115). This overall declining trend is consistent with the absence of notable influenza activity and may signal a gradual reduction in ILI cases, with minor fluctuations linked to unrelated factors such as COVID-19 impacts on healthcare-seeking behaviors or suppressed influenza spread.
2. Week6, 2021 coincides with the end of the traditional peak season for ILI. Historically, peak season spans from about Week46 to Week6. However, considering the unusually low ILI activity (Week50, 2020 #1; Week51, 2020 #1; Week52, 2020 #1; Week53, 2020 #1; Week1, 2021 #1) and stable to declining trends, Week6, 2021 aligns with an extremely atypical and subdued peak season rather than typical intensified activity. Outcome aligns with late-peak or minimal-peak season characteristics.
3. Based on past ILI trends from Week50, 2020 to Week1, 2021, there is an overall decline with slight fluctuations. Given this downward trend and the impact of external factors suppressing influenza activity, projecting forward to Week6, 2021 suggests a continuation of reduced occurrences, consistent with lower seasonal levels of ILI activity. This aligns with the forecasted value of 522, reflecting the atypically minimal occurrence forecast based on historical patterns and suppressed transmission.
4. Atypical influenza activity due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to suppress flu circulation and distort healthcare-seeking behaviors, resulting in reduced positivity rates (Week50, 2020 #1; Week51, 2020 #9; Week53, 2020 #7; Week1, 2021 #9). Previous weeks showed extremely low influenza positivity rates, with outpatient ILI visits below the seasonal baseline (Week50, 2020 #4; Week51, 2020 #3; Week52, 2020 #4; Week53, 2020 #4; Week1, 2021 #4). Finally, CDC projections indicated minimal likelihood of flu surges in the immediate term due to suppressed influenza strain circulation and concurrent pandemic measures reducing flu transmission (Week50, 2020 #11; Week51, 2020 #10; Week52, 2020 #11; Week53, 2020 #11; Week1, 2021 #10).
5. Despite ongoing high coverage of flu vaccinations, trends and uptake figures were unavailable or not detailed (Week50, 2020 #9; Week51, 2020 #7; Week52, 2020 #8; Week1, 2021 #8). The protective effect of vaccination likely helped limit influenza-related ILI occurrences, further contributing to the subdued influenza season.
6. A majority of respiratory illnesses remained dominated by COVID-19 rather than influenza, as suggested by weekly PIC data where deaths attributed to COVID-19 far exceeded those for influenza and pneumonia combined (Week50, 2020 #7; Week51, 2020 #4; Week52, 2020 #6; Week53, 2020 #6; Week1, 2021 #6). This further suppressed influenza transmission and lowered ILI activity.
7. In conclusion, the time-series reduction in past ILI occurrences, low influenza positivity rates, historical suppression due to COVID-19 overlap, and minimal peak-season influenza activity contribute to an ILI occurrence forecast of 522 for Week6, 2021. The combined effects of disrupted healthcare-seeking behaviors, widespread vaccination, and low virologic flu prevalence support this subdued activity projection.
