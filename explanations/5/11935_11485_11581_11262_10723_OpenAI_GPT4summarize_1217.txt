1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall downward trend, with values of ['11935', '11485', '11581', '11262', '10723']. Following an initial decrease from 11935 (Week 7, 2023) to 11485 (Week 8, 2023), a slight increase occurred in Week 9, 2023 (11581), before resuming a decline to 10723 in Week 11, 2023, the lowest value in the observed period. This downward trajectory reflects a consistent reduction in ILI activity.
2. A strong negative correlation is noted between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the declining trend in the preceding weeks aligns with the low value of 9263 reported after 5 weeks (Week 16, 2023). The steady decline over the 5-week span presages the reduced level of future influenza-like illness activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable or decreased, with a shift from 2.6% (Week 7, 2023) to 2.4% (Week 11, 2023), falling below the national baseline of 2.5% in later weeks. This decline in outpatient ILI visits indicates reduced healthcare-seeking for respiratory illnesses, aligning with the future drop to 9263.
4. Cumulative hospitalization rates showed a decreasing trend, with the weekly hospitalization count dropping from 1778 in Week 7, 2023, to 1387 in Week 10, 2023, and further stabilization. These reduced hospitalization rates for respiratory illnesses suggest a diminishing overall burden, directly correlating with the future lower ILI occurrences.
5. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) showed a gradual downward trend, from 9.0% (Week 7, 2023) to 8.7% (Week 11, 2023), though remaining above the epidemic threshold. This consistent but modest decline in PIC mortality reflects abating respiratory illness severity, supporting the reduced ILI occurrences observed in Week 16, 2023.
6. The co-circulation of respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, mentioned across all reports, added variability to ILI trends. However, the declining influence of influenza-dominant strains and stable vaccination effectiveness reduced the likelihood of significant outbreaks, further contributing to the future lower activity.
7. In summary, the reported 9263 future ILI occurrences (Week 16, 2023) are largely attributable to the downward trend in past ILI occurrences, reduced outpatient visits and hospitalization rates, declining PIC mortality, and limited respiratory pathogen activity. These factors collectively reflect a stabilizing public health scenario with diminished influenza-like illness activity over time.
