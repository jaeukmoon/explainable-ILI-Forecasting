1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks indicate a fluctuating but overall rising trajectory, with values ['1209', '1464', '1472', '1695', '1661']. There was a notable increase from 1209 (Week 46, 2020) to 1695 (Week 48, 2020), followed by a slight decline to 1661 (Week 50, 2020). This pattern signals consistent elevation in ILI activity, reaching near-peak levels by the last observed week.
2. A positive correlation between previous trends and future occurrences is evident, as the marked increase toward Weeks 47–48, 2020 (up to 1695), precedes a return to lower ILI activity observed at 1259 in Week 51, 2020. The decline from Week 50 levels mirrors stabilization in future occurrences, suggesting lagged containment or reduced spread of ILI-indicative illnesses.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently stable at 1.6% from Week 47 to Week 50, all below the national baseline of 2.6%. This plateau in healthcare-seeking behavior aligns with future stabilization at lower occurrence levels. Additionally, reports of only minimal to low ILI activity across jurisdictions reinforce this trend.
4. The low influenza virus positivity rates, ranging between 0.1% and 0.3% across Weeks 46–50, 2020, indicate constrained flu circulation during this period. Reduced flu-related morbidity dampens overall ILI numbers, helping explain the lower future value of 1259 occurrences.
5. Persistent impact of COVID-19 on healthcare-seeking behaviors and reporting systems (highlighted weekly) likely suppressed traditional ILI detection, despite concurrent high PIC mortality (10.7%–14.3%) attributed mainly to COVID-19. These pandemic-associated disruptions likely caused an overestimation of ILI occurrences in earlier weeks, contributing to apparent declines reflected in Week 51.
6. Aggregate influences—rising but capped ILI outpatient visit rates, suppressed flu transmission due to public health measures, and pandemic-driven reporting skews—culminated in the reported Week 51, 2020, ILI occurrences of 1259.
