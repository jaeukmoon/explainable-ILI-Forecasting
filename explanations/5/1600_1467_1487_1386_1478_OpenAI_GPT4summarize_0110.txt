1. The ILI counts from Week24, 2023 to Week28, 2023 show fluctuations: 1600, 1467, 1487, 1386, and 1478. While there is an initial decrease from Week24 to Week25, it stabilizes with minor variations from Week25 to Week28. This trend indicates a relatively low but slightly variable ILI activity, without strong increases or sudden decreases.
2. Week33, 2023 falls in the off-season, as it is well before the anticipated peak onset beginning around Week35-Week46. Historical off-season patterns and consistently low ILI activity up to Week28 confirm that Week33 aligns with the off-season classification.
3. The time-series pattern of minor fluctuations observed from Week24 to Week28 suggests limited growth in future counts. Extrapolating this trend forward, with slight seasonal variability expected, supports the forecast of 2106 ILI occurrences in Week33, 2023, which represents a mild increase but remains consistent with off-season trends.
4. Minimal influenza activity was consistently reported, with low positivity rates (1.1% in Week24, 1.0% in Week25, 1.2% in Week26, 0.8% in Week27, and 0.9% in Week28 for clinical labs). The stable distribution between Influenza A and B, with no major detection of novel or concerning subtypes, suggests limited viral resurgence.
5. Vaccination trends were not emphasized in the reports, and the ongoing recommendation for annual vaccination continues without significant changes. As vaccination uptake often influences off-season ILI rates, no major surge or mitigation from vaccination is anticipated.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, remain a factor in ILI data interpretation. However, no significant shifts in these viruses' activity during Weeks24 to Week28 suggest that respiratory trends impacting ILI remain stable.
7. The predicted value of 2106 reflects the slight upward tendency within historical fluctuations, consistent with the low activity in the off-season and minor co-influences from other respiratory illnesses. The alignment of past trends, off-season classification, stable factors like low positivity rates, and minimal external perturbations justify the forecasted figure.
