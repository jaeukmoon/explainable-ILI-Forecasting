1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 29–33, 2021) showed a steady and pronounced upward trend, with values of ['14311', '17202', '18422', '19975', '21495']. The data reflects consistent weekly increases, starting from 14311 in Week 29, 2021, reaching 21495 in Week 33, 2021, representing a 50.1% growth over the 5-week period. This sustained escalation suggests heightened respiratory illness activity during this phase.
2. A clear correlation between the past ILI occurrences and future ILI count can be established. The substantial rise in ILI counts in Weeks 32–33, 2021 (19975 to 21495), indicates a high likelihood of subsequent declines in ILI activity after a prolonged peak. This aligns with the decrease to 11487 observed 5 weeks later, implying a transition beyond the peak period.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased consistently from 1.7% (Week 29, 2021) to 2.2% (Week 33, 2021), highlighting a rise in respiratory illnesses across age groups during the observed period. This sustained increase suggests a possible subsequent decline once peak levels are reached.
4. Mortality due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) rose sharply during the observed weeks, from 7.4% (Week 29, 2021) to 17.2% (Week 33, 2021), far exceeding epidemic thresholds. This reflects significant respiratory illness activity, further supporting the ILI fluctuations seen over time.
5. Healthcare-seeking behaviors remained disrupted by the pandemic, complicating surveillance and contributing to delayed case recognition. As alternative care patterns normalized, this likely caused a gradual tapering in ILI counts, contributing to the lower future occurrence of 11487.
6. Despite minimal influenza circulation reported over the 5 weeks, alternative respiratory viruses likely drove the observed trends. SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens were noted as significant contributors to increasing ILI, affirming that these heightened activities likely diminished over time.
7. In summary, the decline to 11487 future ILI occurrences can be attributed to the stabilization following a sharp upward trend during Weeks 29–33, 2021, sustained increases in outpatient ILI visits, substantial PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the normalizing impacts of pandemic-related healthcare-seeking patterns. These factors collectively reflect a post-peak transition in ILI activity.
