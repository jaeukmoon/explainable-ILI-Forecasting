1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, increasing sequentially from 1816 (Week8, 2022) to 3166 (Week12, 2022). This pattern represents a steady rise in activity, with notable week-over-week growth, particularly from Week10 to Week12, 2022, where the largest jump (2820 to 3166) reflects accelerating flu activity.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the rising ILI occurrences in the past 5 weeks (Weeks 8–12, 2022) and the significant increase to 4778 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week17, 2022). The escalation observed in Weeks 11–12, 2022, where occurrences reached substantial levels, laid the groundwork for the amplified ILI burden in Week17, 2022.
3. Weekly outpatient visits for ILI rose incrementally, aligned with rising positivity rates in clinical specimens (7.7% by Week11, 2022). The sub-baseline outpatient visit rates (below 2.0% nationally) likely reflect growing detection in affected regions, contributing to future increases in reported occurrences in Week17, 2022. Influenza-associated hospitalization rates consistently climbed, from 5.2 per 100,000 (Week8, 2022) to 7.2 per 100,000 (Week12, 2022), indicating a broader impact on healthcare systems, correlating with the rise to 4778 occurrences. Co-circulation and coinfection with respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, identified in 5.4% of specimens by Week12, challenged healthcare capacities and drove aggregated ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) dominance (99% positivity across Weeks 8–12, 2022), coupled with antigenic differences, created a mismatch with the vaccine strain, reducing vaccine effectiveness and amplifying the spread of influenza. This mismatch, combined with low vaccination uptake as noted in Week8, 2022, heightened susceptibility in the population and strengthened the link to the future surge. The mortality percentage for pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC deaths) remained high, consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds, reinforcing the systemic impact of respiratory illnesses.
5. The reported 4778 occurrences in Week17, 2022, are attributed to the sustained upward trajectory of ILI activity from Weeks 8–12, 2022, marked increases in positivity rates and hospitalization rates, challenges of co-circulation with multiple respiratory viruses, reduced vaccine effectiveness against Influenza A(H3N2), and high mortality associated with respiratory illnesses, all providing strong epidemiological precursors to the reported future increase.
