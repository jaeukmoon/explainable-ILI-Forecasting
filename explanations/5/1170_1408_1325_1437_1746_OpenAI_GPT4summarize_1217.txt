1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an upward trend, with values ['1170', '1408', '1325', '1437', '1746']. Despite fluctuations, the overall pattern shows a consistent increase in ILI activity, peaking at 1746 in Week 51, 2021. This upward progression indicates heightened respiratory illness activity toward the end of the observed period, setting the stage for elevated future occurrences.
2. A strong correlation exists between the past time-series trend and the future occurrences of 1567 (Week 5, 2022). The peak at 1746 in Week 51, 2021, followed by a potential leveling or moderate decline observed in adjacent ILI trends (based on similar seasonal patterns), aligns with the future ILI value five weeks ahead, reflecting residual high seasonal activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased steadily, exceeding the national baseline, rising from 2.4% (Week 47, 2021) to 3.8% (Week 51, 2021). Persistent upward trends in ILI-related healthcare visits signal ongoing transmission and intensified activity, supporting future elevated occurrences.
4. Similarly, rising hospitalization rates, with new admissions jumping from 495 (Week 47, 2021) to 1,825 (Week 51, 2021), further reflect the escalating severity of ILI cases, which likely contributed to sustained transmission and the reported 1567 future value.
5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza A(H3N2) and other pathogens, as detailed across Weeks 47–51, 2021, likely amplified ILI occurrences. Regional variations and antigenic differences in circulating viruses added further complexity to flu dynamics, contributing to the observed future increase.
6. In summary, the reported 1567 future ILI occurrences (Week 5, 2022) result from the cumulative effect of the rising past trend, increased outpatient visits and hospitalization rates, and the compounding impact of co-circulating pathogens and regional activity variability during Weeks 47–51, 2021.
