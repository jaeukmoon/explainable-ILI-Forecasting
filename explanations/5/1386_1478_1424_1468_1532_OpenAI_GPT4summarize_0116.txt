1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks (Week27, 2023 to Week31, 2023) are ['1386', '1478', '1424', '1468', '1532'], showing a steady upward trend. From Week27 to Week31, there is a cumulative increase of 146, indicating a weekly average increase of approximately 36.5 cases. Using the past 5-week trend and projecting forward with an approximate weekly increase of 36.5 cases over the next 5 weeks, the projected base ILI occurrence by Week36, 2023 is estimated to be around 1714.
2. Week36, 2023 falls within the "Peak onset season," which typically spans from Week32 to Week46. During this period, ILI occurrences generally rise as influenza activity begins to increase from baseline levels toward peak intensity. Historical epidemiological trends suggest that during this season, ILI occurrences can escalate significantly due to heightened viral transmission.
3. The time-series trend alone does not account for the observed steep increase in ILI forecasts to 3514. Key factors influencing this surge include (a) peak onset season dynamics, (b) dominance of Influenza A ((H1N1)pdm09) variants, and (c) co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV and SARS-CoV-2). These factors amplify transmission rates, adding an exponential growth component. Specifically, Week31 highlighted ongoing circulation of RSV and SARS-CoV-2, contributing to compounded ILI occurrences. By incorporating these factors and adjusting for seasonal amplification, the increase from the five-week trend base estimate of 1714 to the final predicted forecast of 3514 reflects an approximate doubling of expected cases (consistent with initial peak onset patterns).
4. Additional CDC insights affecting the forecast include (a) the steady detection of Influenza A ((H1N1)pdm09), which made up 88.9% of Influenza A subtypes in Week31, 2023, suggesting its dominance in driving higher transmission rates during the peak onset. (b) The co-detection of multiple respiratory pathogens, as emphasized in Week30 and Week31 (e.g., RSV and SARS-CoV-2), increases outpatient visits due to respiratory illnesses. (c) Variability in ILI by age groups, especially the higher percentages observed among children under 5 years (4%-4.2% across Week27 to Week31), suggests the potential for sharp regional surges.
5. Based on these factors, the predicted ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week36, 2023) is 3514. This forecast reflects the synergistic impact of rising trends, rapid viral transmission in the peak onset season, and contributing co-circulating pathogens, driving the observed sharp increase from baseline statistical projections to the final value of 3514.
