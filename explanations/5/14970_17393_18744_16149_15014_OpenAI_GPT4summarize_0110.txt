1. The reported ILI counts from Week50, 2023 to Week2, 2024 are 14970, 17393, 18744, 16149, and 15014. The trend shows an initial steep rise from Week50, 2023 (14970) to Week51, 2023 (17393) and Week52, 2023 (18744), followed by a significant drop in Week1, 2024 (16149) and Week2, 2024 (15014). This trend illustrates a peak in Week52, 2023 (18744), after which a gradual decline is observed. Overall, this suggests a deceleration in ILI activity after reaching the seasonal peak.
2. Forecasting for Week7, 2024 aligns with the off-season period. Week7, 2024 occurs beyond the typical peak season window in the U.S., which usually spans Week46, 2023 through Week6, 2024. Additionally, recent ILI declines (Week1, 2024 #3; Week2, 2024 #3, #11) and CDC’s expectations of post-holiday activity stabilization (Week2, 2024 #7) confirm this classification.
3. Based on the historical time-series data, a sharp rise in ILI occurrences leads to a peak, followed by subsequent stabilization or decline. The decline from Week1, 2024 (16149) to Week2, 2024 (15014) reflects a tapering trend projected to continue through Week7, 2024. Given this deceleration, the forecast predicts a moderate reduction in occurrences, i.e., reaching 11591 in Week7.
4. Current flu vaccines remain antigenically matched with predominant Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains (Week52, 2023 #13; Week1, 2024 #8), while antiviral susceptibility remains high (Week50, 2023 #10; Week52, 2023 #14; Week2, 2024 #9). This containment factor likely contributes to reducing ILI occurrences.
5. Despite co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 (Week50, 2023 #8; Week2, 2024 #10), the predominance of influenza-focused immunity strategies, alongside a vaccination campaign now covering larger populations (Week51, 2023 #8; Week2, 2024 #8), suggests a declining trend in ILI post-holidays.
6. Outpatient visit rates for ILI are showing declines, from 6.9% in Week52, 2023 (Week52, 2023 #3) to 5.7% in Week1, 2024 (Week1, 2024 #6) and 4.7% in Week2, 2024 (Week2, 2024 #3), indicating lowered transmission and reduced new infections.
7. In summary, the projected ILI count of 11591 for Week7, 2024 reflects a continued deceleration due to weaker transmission trends following the peak season (Week50, 2023 #1; Week2, 2024 #11), effective vaccinations, and high antiviral susceptibility (Week1, 2024 #8; Week2, 2024 #9). This aligns with off-season ILI activity expectations.
