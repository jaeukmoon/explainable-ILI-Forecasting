1. Explanation:
1. The past ILI occurrences from Week15, 2024 to Week19, 2024 show a consistent decreasing trend: ['1393', '1256', '1088', '795', '727']. From Week15 to Week19, there was a constant reduction in ILI cases, with each week showing a percentage decrease. The percentage drops are: Week15 to Week16 (9.85%), Week16 to Week17 (13.38%), Week17 to Week18 (26.97%), and Week18 to Week19 (8.55%). Despite some variability in the rate of decline, the trend overall is strongly downward. The projection assumes a continuation of this downward trajectory.
2. Week24, 2024, belongs to the "Off-season." Based on Background Knowledge, Week24 falls between the peak period of flu season (typically ending around Week6) and the next potential peak onset phase (typically starting Week32 or later). Off-season periods are characterized by minimal ILI activity near baseline, as reflected by declining or stable ILI occurrences.
3. Correlation analysis between the time-series trend and Week24 projection shows that, given the compound weekly percentage drop, the averages suggest a shift toward a base level near or under 500 cases. Extrapolating the declines observed in Weeks15-19 using a stable reduction pattern averaging approximately 14.69% weekly, the projected ILI cases for Week24 are calculated as follows:
4. - Week20: \( 727 \times (1 - 0.1469) = 620.9 \)
5. - Week21: \( 620.9 \times (1 - 0.1469) = 529.8 \)
6. - Week22: \( 529.8 \times (1 - 0.1469) = 452.1 \)
7. - Week23: \( 452.1 \times (1 - 0.1469) = 385.6 \)
8. - Week24: \( 385.6 \times (1 - 0.1469) = 329 \)
9. However, CDC trends from recent years suggest that off-season activity stabilizes near 400+ cases due to co-circulating respiratory illnesses and nonzero baseline ILI activity.
4. Three CDC factors strongly influencing this forecast are: (a) **Seasonal decline in influenza-positive rates:** From Week15 to Week19, influenza positivity rates decreased from 5.9% to 2.4%, supporting a consistent decline in ILI activity across all regions. The rate reduction aligns with the broader seasonal trend and directly impacts ILI occurrences by reducing new case generation. (b) **Cumulative hospitalization trends:** Although hospitalization rates remained high (80.6 per 100,000 at Week19), incremental weekly increases have slowed (Week19 added only 0.3 per 100,000), reflecting reduced community transmission. This deceleration hints at fewer severe cases ahead, aligning with declining ILI cases overall. (c) **Co-circulating respiratory viruses:** While contributions from COVID-19 and RSV slightly elevate respiratory illness visits, these do not result in a substantial increase in influenza-specific ILI cases during the off-season. The minimal activity reported through CDC surveillance corroborates a low but sustained baseline ILI level.
5. In summary, the consistent downward trend in ILI cases, combined with Week24's classification as an off-season period, the ongoing reduction in influenza positivity, stabilized hospitalization rates, and minimal co-circulation effects of additional respiratory viruses, justifies the forecast of **430 cases** for Week24, 2024. This value reflects the expected baseline level during the off-season with residual contributions from localized flu dynamics.
