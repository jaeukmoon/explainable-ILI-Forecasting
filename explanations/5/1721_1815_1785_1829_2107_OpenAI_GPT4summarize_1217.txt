1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a generally increasing trend, with values of ['1721', '1815', '1785', '1829', '2107']. Although there was a slight dip from 1815 (Week 41, 2021) to 1785 (Week 42, 2021), the numbers consistently rose in Weeks 43 and 44, 2021, reaching a peak at 2107 in Week 44, 2021. This upward trajectory by the end of the period indicates an escalation in ILI activity.
2. The future occurrences of 2117 align with the sharp increase observed in Weeks 43 and 44, 2021, where ILI occurrences rose significantly. The sustained upward trend in the latter portion of the 5-week period (Week 43 to Week 44, 2021) correlates directly with the continued growth in ILI activity leading to the reported number after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient ILI visits showed a distinct rise, moving from 1.8% in Week 42, 2021, to 2.1% in Week 44, 2021. This increase in healthcare encounters, reflecting heightened respiratory illness activity, likely contributed to the observed future ILI increase.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) cases rose steadily, with clinical labs reporting an increase in detection rates from 0.1% in Week 40, 2021, to 0.3% in Week 44, 2021. These increases were further influenced by localized outbreaks in regions such as Michigan (Week 44, 2021), amplifying overall ILI cases.
5. Multiple respiratory viruses co-circulating alongside non-influenza-specific ILI trends, compounded by healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to COVID-19, disrupted ILI data reporting. These overlapping factors likely exaggerated ILI activity, contributing to the reported future occurrences reaching 2117.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 2117 are attributed to the observed rising trend in ILI occurrences over Weeks 43–44, 2021, increasing outpatient visits for ILI, escalating influenza A(H3N2) activity, localized outbreaks, and co-circulation of respiratory pathogens. These factors, combined with healthcare system disruptions, created a compounding effect, elevating the ILI numbers after 5 weeks.
