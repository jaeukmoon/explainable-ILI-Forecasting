1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1933', '1816', '2040', '2378', '2820']. After a slight decrease from 1933 (Week7, 2022) to 1816 (Week8, 2022), the data exhibited a steady rise, reaching a peak of 2820 in Week11, 2022. This increasing trend aligns with the growing flu activity reported during the same period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the steady rise seen in Weeks9–11, 2022, culminating in 2820, serves as a precursor to the elevated future occurrence of 4487 in Week16, 2022. The consistent increase in past weeks corresponds to the larger spike observed after 5 weeks, signaling sustained and compounding influenza activity.
3. As indicated in the CDC reports, the cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza steadily increased over the 5 weeks, rising from 4.9 per 100,000 in Week7, 2022, to 6.5 per 100,000 in Week11, 2022. This continuous rise reflects more severe cases contributing to the future surge.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza was evident, with influenza-positive cases co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 accounting for 6% in Week7, 2022, and slightly decreasing to 3.5% in Week11, 2022. This overlap likely amplified the healthcare stress and reported ILI occurrences.
5. Antigenic differences in the dominant A(H3N2) virus relative to vaccine strains were noted throughout the reports (Week7–Week11, 2022), compromising vaccine effectiveness and likely contributing to the observed increase in ILI cases. Additionally, lower vaccination rates compared to prior seasons further exacerbated the rise.
6. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illnesses, although below national baseline levels, showed a gradual increase, inching from 1.5% in Week7, 2022, to 1.8% in Week11, 2022. This increase reflects a broader trend of rising respiratory illnesses, supporting the jump to 4487 occurrences after 5 weeks.
7. In summary, the reported 4487 future ILI occurrences (Week16, 2022) resulted from the consistent upward trend in Weeks9–11, 2022, increasing hospitalization rates, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, antigenic mismatches in A(H3N2) strains, lower vaccination rates, and gradually rising outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses. These factors collectively drove the observed future surge.
