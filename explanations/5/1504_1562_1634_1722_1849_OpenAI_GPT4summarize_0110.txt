1. The reported ILI counts from Week32 to Week36, 2024 are 1504, 1562, 1634, 1722, and 1849. This trend indicates a steady and continuous increase over the five weeks, with no dips or plateau phases observed. The week-over-week rise suggests the progression of ILI activity toward the peak onset season.
2. Based on historical season classification in the U.S., Week41, 2024 aligns with the peak onset season (early increasing phase), as it typically spans from Week32 or Week35 to Week46. The ongoing rising trend in ILI occurrences supports this season classification.
3. From a time-series analysis, the upward movement of ILI counts over five weeks projects forward as sustained growth. If this trend continues with similar weekly increments (~70-120 increase per week), ILI occurrences would likely reach approximately 2645 by Week41, 2024. The projection aligns with the data-driven trajectory.
4. The number of clinical respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza remains low (0.4% from Week32 to Week36, 2024). However, slight increases in ILI outpatient visits (from 1.5% in Week32, 2024 to 1.8% by Week36, 2024) suggest growing spread, particularly in younger age groups.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses (influenza, COVID-19, and RSV) may contribute to the gradual rise in ILI cases, even with stable hospitalization and death rates (e.g., Week32, 2024 #8 and Week36, 2024 #10), especially given potential interaction effects during seasonal transitions.
6. Vaccination rates remain stagnant across the five weeks, and the low uptake (Week32, 2024 #9; Week33, 2024 #10; Week36, 2024 #9) could reduce herd immunity and facilitate further ILI transmissions. Additionally, ongoing novel influenza cases and zoonotic exposures (Week33, 2024 #7 and Week34, 2024 #5) indicate risks for localized or broader transmission events.
7. In summary, the forecast of 2645 occurrences for Week41, 2024 is justified by the consistent growth trend in ILI counts, its alignment with the peak onset season, stable co-circulation of respiratory viruses, low vaccination trends, and persistent novel influenza risks. This combination reflects potential escalation in ILI activity driven by these cumulative factors.
