1. The reported ILI counts from Week21 to Week25, 2023 are 1448, 1246, 1098, 1017, and 889. The trend shows a consistent weekly decline, with ILI occurrences decreasing from 1448 in Week21 to 889 in Week25. This reflects a significant downward trajectory without fluctuations, indicative of ongoing low influenza activity.
2. Given the historical seasonality of ILI in the U.S., with the off-season spanning Week1 to Week31 (inclusive), Week30, 2023 falls squarely within the off-season. This timing aligns with reports of low influenza activity consistently below national baselines during Week21 to Week25, 2023.
3. The consistent five-week downward trend suggests a continuation of declining or stable ILI occurrences, reflective of seasonal off-peak influenza activity. In time series forecasting, such historical patterns from Week21–25, 2023, likely project forward to minimal ILI counts in Week30, barring sudden external changes. Hence, extrapolation predicts occurrences settle at moderate levels of 666 by Week30, 2023.
4. Influenza positivity rates during Week21 to Week25, 2023, remained low, declining further (Week21: 1.2%, Week25: 1.0%). Co-circulation of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (Week21 #8, Week22 #9, Week23 #10, Week24 #9, Week25 #10) influences respiratory illness trends but does not spur notable ILI surges. Nationwide "minimal" ILI activity characterization (Week21 #10, Week22 #8, Week23 #8, Week24 #8, Week25 #7) points toward a subdued outlook.
5. Vaccination data shows a lack of new trends or campaigns during Week21 to Week25, 2023. With no updates in vaccination coverage (Week21 #9, Week22 #10, Week23 #9, Week24 #10, Week25 #9), immunity against influenza is neither significantly bolstered nor compromised in the population. This stability aligns with flat projections for low future ILI activity.
6. Hospitalizations and deaths have consistently declined throughout Week21 to Week25, 2023. Weekly hospitalization numbers decreased from 927 (Week21) to 768 (Week25), consonant with reduced influenza severity (Week21 #5, Week22 #5, Week23 #5, Week24 #3, Week25 #4). Deaths attributed to PIC also stayed around thresholds but showed no sign of epidemic spikes, further indicating low disease pressure (Week21 #6, Week22 #6, Week23 #6, Week24 #4, Week25 #5).
7. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrence of 666 for Week30, 2023, is justified by the ongoing off-season timing, consistent declines in activity and virologic surveillance metrics, the lack of vaccination-driven spikes, and low hospitalization and death rates. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses remains stable without significantly amplifying ILI counts, reinforcing this subdued projection.
