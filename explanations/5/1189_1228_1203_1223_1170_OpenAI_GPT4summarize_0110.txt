1. The reported ILI counts from Week43 to Week47, 2021 are 1189, 1228, 1203, 1223, and 1170. Over these weeks, the trend appears relatively stable, with small fluctuations in counts but no significant upward or downward spikes. This generally level pattern demonstrates that ILI activity is increasing gradually but not yet at its peak intensity.
2. Week52, 2021 falls within the typical U.S. peak season for ILI activity, which runs from approximately Week46 of one year through Week6 of the next. CDC reports indicate rising influenza detections and outpatient trends (Week46, 2021 #1, #4; Week47, 2021 #1, #5), reinforcing that influenza activity is transitioning toward its peak. Forecasting that Week52, 2021 belongs to the peak season aligns with observed activity increases.
3. From the time-series perspective, the past ILI occurrences reflect a stable pattern with gradual increases and slight declines in some weeks. With no significant spikes or surges up to Week47, 2021 and given the steady growth in laboratory-confirmed influenza detections and outpatient visits, time-series forecasting anticipates a notable rise in ILI occurrences over the next five weeks, projecting a peak of 2250 by Week52, 2021.
4. Influenza activity has been increasing, particularly due to the predominance of the Influenza A(H3N2) subtype. Reports indicate that cases are rising among younger age groups (5–24 years), a historically high-risk demographic known to drive transmission (Week43, 2021 #3; Week46, 2021 #10; Week47, 2021 #14).
5. Despite vaccination efforts distributing 166.9 million flu doses (Week46, 2021 #7; Week47, 2021 #9), the impact seems limited as vaccination rates have not shown significant increases over these five weeks. This could contribute to broader community spread and an elevated ILI burden.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 are complicating monitoring and reporting systems (Week44, 2021 #10; Week47, 2021 #14). Additionally, shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic may have delayed recognition of rising cases (Week44, 2021 #13; Week46, 2021 #9), leading to a potential underestimation of ILI occurrences.
7. Given the stable yet gradually rising ILI trends, the alignment of Week52, 2021 with the annual peak season, the predominance of Influenza A(H3N2), and moderate limits in vaccination coverage and healthcare dynamics, the projection of 2250 ILI occurrences accurately reflects anticipated peak-season activity during Week52, 2021.
