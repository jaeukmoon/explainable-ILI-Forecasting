1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a rising trend, starting from 1512 (Week 9, 2022) and peaking at 2032 in Week 12, 2022, before slightly declining to 2021 in Week 13, 2022. This overall upward trajectory suggests a steady increase in influenza-like activity during this period, with only minor fluctuations, indicative of sustained transmission.

2. A strong positive correlation between past and future occurrences is evident, as the upward trajectory observed in Weeks 9–12, 2022, set the stage for sustained escalations. The modest dip in Week 13 did not negate the overall increasing trend, which likely carried forward, leading to the reported surge to 2529 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 18, 2022).

3. Several factors from CDC reports align with the observed increase in future ILI occurrences:  
   - **Hospitalizations due to influenza increased weekly for seven consecutive weeks**, reaching a cumulative rate of 8.0 per 100,000 by Week 13, 2022 (with 95.1% attributed to Influenza A), indicating heightened severity and increased disease burden during the subsequent period.  
   - **Influenza virus positivity rates in clinical labs increased consistently**, from 5.8% (Week 9, 2022) to 8.3% (Week 13, 2022), with A(H3N2) dominating at nearly 100% of subtyped cases, highlighting increased virus circulation and activity.  
   - **Co-circulation with other respiratory viruses**, particularly SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, was consistently reported and compounded respiratory illness trends (e.g., coinfection rates of 5.9% and 3.2% in Weeks 9 and 13, respectively), contributing to rising ILI occurrences.

4. In summary, the reported 2529 future ILI occurrences (Week 18, 2022) can be attributed to the steadily increasing past ILI trends, high positivity rates of circulating Influenza A(H3N2) with antigenic differences, rising cumulative hospitalization rates, and the compounding effect of respiratory virus co-circulation during Weeks 9–13, 2022. These factors collectively indicate an intensification of influenza and respiratory illness activity leading to a significant future surge.
