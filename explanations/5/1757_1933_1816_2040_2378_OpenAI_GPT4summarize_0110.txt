1. The ILI occurrences from Week6, 2022 to Week10, 2022 display a consistent upward trend: 1757, 1933, 1816, 2040, and 2378. Despite a minor dip in Week8 (1816), the overall trend reflects an increasing trajectory over the 5-week period. This rise suggests heightened transmission and growing respiratory illness activity as the season progresses.
2. Week15, 2022 falls outside the typical U.S. influenza peak season (Week46 to Week6). Considering the increasing activity reported over the previous weeks and CDC's projections of rising flu trends, it corresponds to the peak onset season. This is consistent with historical patterns where off-season peaks (e.g., Week19, 2022 or Week50, 2022) might also emerge.
3. The historical data indicates an increasing time-series trend, which projects forward into higher values. By Week10, 2022, ILI occurrences had reached 2378, and using time-series forecasting, the upward trajectory projects a continuing rise, explaining the predicted value of 4771 for Week15. The doubling of ILI from late peak-onset activity aligns with prior surges in transmission intensity during transitional influenza phases.
4. Influenza activity increased steadily nationwide across Weeks6 to Week10, 2022 (Week6 #1, Week7 #1, Week9 #1, Week10 #1). Central and south-central regions experienced notable rises, highlighting emerging ILI hotspots (Week9 #11, Week10 #14), and CDC predicted ongoing activity rises.
5. Hospitalizations have increased for six consecutive weeks, reaching a cumulative rate of 5.9 per 100,000 (Week10 #6). This trend indicates widespread flu transmission and severity, supporting the rise in ILI occurrences for Week15, 2022.
6. Influenza A(H3N2) dominance (98%-99.7%) and antigenic differences from vaccine strains (Week7 #7, Week9 #5, Week10 #9) suggest suboptimal vaccine protection, contributing to rising flu activity in Week15, 2022. Lower vaccination uptake compared to past seasons (Week6 #8, Week8 #8) further amplifies susceptibility.
7. The projection of 4771 ILI occurrences for Week15, 2022 aligns with the observed upward trends in past ILI occurrences, hospitalizations, and co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (Week6 #9, Week10 #12), compounded by regional ILI increases, vaccine mismatch, and low vaccination coverage. Together, these factors justify the continuing rise into the peak onset season.
