1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating pattern with slight stabilization toward the latter weeks, as evident from values of ['1873', '2139', '2066', '2064', '2078']. The initial rise from 1873 (Week 45, 2020) to 2139 (Week 46, 2020) was followed by a decline to 2064 (Week 47, 2020) and a marginal increase to 2078 by Week 49, 2020. This suggests a near-steady ILI activity with minor variations.  

2. A moderate positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences. The stabilization observed in the past weeks (Weeks 47–49, 2020) may have set the groundwork for the higher value of 2367 occurrences after 5 weeks. The slight upward push toward Week 49 indicates latent potential for escalated activity.  

3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained constant at 1.6% from Week 47 to Week 49, 2020, below the national baseline, but consistent activity reflects steady healthcare encounters tied to respiratory illnesses, contributing to sustained occurrences.  
   Elevated PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) deaths increased markedly from 8.9% (Week 45, 2020) to 14.3% (Week 49, 2020), significantly surpassing epidemic thresholds across all weeks. Although primarily driven by COVID-19, persistent respiratory-related fatalities indicate a steady burden of respiratory illnesses, likely influencing future ILI reporting.  
   The CDC's anticipation of potential future increases in influenza activity, paired with coexisting COVID-19 impacts and fluctuations in healthcare access, heightens the likelihood of increased ILI reporting, reflected in the jump to 2367 occurrences.  

4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2367 can be explained by a combination of the stabilization of past weekly data, steady outpatient ILI visits, elevated PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and CDC forecasts of rising respiratory activity. These factors, compounded by pandemic-related reporting and behavioral disruptions, collectively contribute to the observed future increase.
