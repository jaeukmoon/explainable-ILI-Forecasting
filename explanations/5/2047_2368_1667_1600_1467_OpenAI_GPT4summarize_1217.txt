1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['2047', '2368', '1667', '1600', '1467']. After an initial increase from 2047 (Week 21, 2023) to 2368 (Week 22, 2023), there was a sharp decline in cases, dropping to 1667 (Week 23, 2023), followed by 1600 (Week 24, 2023) and further to 1467 (Week 25, 2023). This overall decrease reflects reduced ILI activity leading into future weeks.
2. A clear negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the falling trend in past occurrences (Week 23-25, 2023) aligns with the subdued value of 1468 reported after 5 weeks (Week 30, 2023). The final past week's low ILI occurrence (1467) closely matches the future value, indicating stabilization of ILI activity at a lower level.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI also consistently declined over the 5-week period, from 1.9% (Week 21, 2023) to 1.4% (Week 25, 2023), staying below the national baseline. The highest rates consistently occurred among children aged 0-4, but the decreasing national rates suggest waning influenza-like activity, closely mirroring reduced ILI occurrences in subsequent weeks.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC) steadily declined over the observed weeks, from 7.0% (Week 21, 2023) to 6.2% (Week 25, 2023), with proportions falling near or below epidemic thresholds. This decline in PIC-associated mortality corresponds to a reduction in respiratory illness severity that is reflected in the future stable ILI value.
5. The 5-week reports consistently highlighted low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 1.2% in Week 21, 2023, and 1.0% in Week 25, 2023) and minimal regional ILI activity nationwide, with co-circulating respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 contributing to residual ILI trends. The limited influenza circulation and predominance of other pathogens resulted in continued low respiratory illness burdens, aligning with stabilized future occurrences. In summary, the reported 1468 future ILI occurrences (Week 30, 2023) can be attributed to the overall downward trend in past occurrences, declining outpatient ILI visits, reduced PIC mortality nearing baseline thresholds, and minimal influenza activity amid co-circulating respiratory pathogens. These factors collectively led to a stabilization of ILI activity at a low level by Week 30, 2023.
