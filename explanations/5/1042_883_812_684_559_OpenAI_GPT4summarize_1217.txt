1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1042', '883', '812', '684', '559']. This decline from 1042 in Week3, 2021, to 559 in Week7, 2021, indicates a significant reduction in ILI activity during this period, aligning with reports of historically low influenza and minimal flu activity.
2. Despite the declining weekly trend in past ILI occurrences, the future occurrence of 664 in Week12, 2021, represents a slight increase from the Week7 value of 559. The slight recovery might be linked to the plateauing of outpatient ILI visits (1.1%, Weeks5–7), signaling stabilization before a modest rebound.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below the national baseline of 2.6%, with levels of 1.3% (Week3, 2021) gradually declining to 1.0% (Week7, 2021). This persistent low activity reflects minimal flu transmission but suggests a stabilized impact, possibly contributing to the slight increase in Week12, 2021.
4. The high percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), particularly elevated from 14.8% (Week3, 2021) to a peak of 28.4% (Week4, 2021) before declining to 19.3% (Week7, 2021), indicate ongoing respiratory illness burdens despite reductions in influenza activity. Such sustained impact aligns with the modest future ILI rise.
5. Minimal influenza positivity in lab results (as low as 0.1% in Weeks4–7, 2021) and ongoing disruptions in ILI surveillance due to altered healthcare-seeking behaviors related to COVID-19 impacted data reliability. These disruptions could obscure small-scale increases like the rise to 664 (Week12, 2021), driven by unreported respiratory illnesses or delayed recognition.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 664 in Week12, 2021, can be attributed to the stabilization of outpatient ILI visits, consistent respiratory illness burdens (evidenced by sustained PIC mortality and COVID-19 influence), plateauing lab-confirmed positivity rates, and potential underreporting or delays in surveillance mechanisms.
