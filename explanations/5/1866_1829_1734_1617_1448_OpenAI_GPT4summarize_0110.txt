1. The reported ILI counts from Week17 to Week21, 2023 are 1866, 1829, 1734, 1617, and 1448. The trend over these five weeks reflects a consistent decline in ILI occurrences, with a steady reduction each week. This clearly indicates a decreasing trajectory with no significant spikes, suggesting reduced influenza-related activity during this period.
2. Forecasting target Week26, 2023 belongs to the off-season. Given that Week26 occurs outside the typical peak or peak onset season, coupled with continued low ILI positivity and widespread minimal influenza activity (Week17, 2023 #1; Week18, 2023 #1; Week19, 2023 #1; Week20, 2023 #1; Week21, 2023 #1), the off-season classification is consistent.
3. From the time-series perspective, the steady decline in ILI occurrences from Week17 to Week21, 2023 supports the hypothesis of continued decreasing activity towards the target Week26. Extrapolating this trend using linear forecasting, the expected ILI reductions suggest a further decline, resulting in a projection of 748 occurrences by Week26, 2023.
4. Influenza activity has remained low nationwide with minimal positivity rates between 0.9% and 1.2% (Week17, 2023 #1; Week18, 2023 #1; Week19, 2023 #1; Week20, 2023 #1; Week21, 2023 #1), which contributes to the ongoing decrease in ILI occurrences.
5. Vaccination coverage remains consistent, with no significant updates in uptake trends reported during the past five weeks. Nearly all circulating influenza viruses remain antigenically similar to the current vaccine strains and susceptible to antivirals (Week17, 2023 #9; Week18, 2023 #9; Week19, 2023 #7; Week20, 2023 #7; Week21, 2023 #7), limiting the potential for widespread influenza escalation.
6. The ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and influenza remains observable (Week17, 2023 #10; Week18, 2023 #11; Week19, 2023 #9; Week20, 2023 #10; Week21, 2023 #8), but these interactions continue to yield low-level trends without substantial new risks of influenza surges.
7. In conclusion, the projected ILI occurrence of 748 for Week26, 2023 is justified by the continued decline in past ILI counts, classification of the period as off-season, low influenza activity, strong vaccine matching, and the absence of major surges from co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors collectively support the expected reduction in ILI cases.
