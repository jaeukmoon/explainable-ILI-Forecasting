1. The reported ILI counts from Week39 to Week43, 2021 were 1140, 1250, 1279, 1218, and 1189. The trend showed an initial increase between Week39 (1140) and Week41 (1279) followed by a slight decline through Week43 (1189). This represents a fluctuating pattern with no strong upward or downward trend, suggesting stable ILI activity at a moderate level.
2. Forecasting Week48, 2021 indicates it belongs to the peak onset season, as it falls within the typical initial phase of heightened influenza activity (Week35–Week46), where increases in respiratory illness are gradual but suggest a transition toward higher activity as influenza spreads (Week43, 2021 #10).
3. From a time-series perspective, the fluctuation between Week39 and Week43, 2021 points to a stabilization of trends rather than abrupt surges. Projecting five weeks forward, considering seasonal adjustments and expected peak onset growth, the data suggests moderate ILI occurrence reaching 1408 for Week48, 2021.
4. Limited circulation of influenza viruses is observed, with only 0.1%-0.2% of clinical specimens testing positive across Weeks39–Week43, 2021 (Week39, 2021 #5; Week42, 2021 #1; Week43, 2021 #1). However, a slight increase in positivity near Week43 (Week43, 2021 #10) signals potential future growth.
5. Vaccination coverage remains limited, as CDC emphasizes vaccination by late October but reports no definitive uptake trends (Week39, 2021 #8; Week41, 2021 #8; Week43, 2021 #8). Suboptimal vaccination efforts could leave populations more vulnerable to influenza spread.
6. Respiratory illness activity is influenced heavily by non-influenza pathogens and COVID-19, complicating ILI trends and likely muting influenza-specific activity (Week40, 2021 #10; Week42, 2021 #10; Week43, 2021 #10). Still, healthcare-seeking behavior and steady increases in positive specimens suggest influenza-specific trends will grow further in upcoming weeks.
7. In summary, ILI activity of Week48, 2021 reaching 1408 is justified by stable to slightly rising historical trends, classification in the peak onset season, gradual increases in influenza positivity, incomplete vaccination protection, and expected growth of influenza activity based on CDC projections. All factors collectively align with the forecasted ILI increase.
