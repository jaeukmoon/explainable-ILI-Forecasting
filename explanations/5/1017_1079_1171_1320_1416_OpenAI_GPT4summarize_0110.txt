1. The reported ILI counts from Week42 to Week46, 2020 are 1017, 1079, 1171, 1320, and 1416. This demonstrates a consistent upward trend in ILI occurrences, with a week-by-week increase in values. Such a pattern indicates a steady rise in cases without significant fluctuations or stagnation. This steady growth suggests increasing ILI activity.
2. Given that Week46, 2020 and the subsequent forecast for five weeks belong to the period approaching the U.S. peak season (Week46 to about Week6), we project that None corresponds to the **Peak season**. The progressive rise in ILI activity aligns with the historical timing of the peak season, marking periods of widespread transmission.
3. The five-week time-series data shows a persistent growing trend, and projecting this into the near future suggests a continuation of rising ILI occurrences at a slightly moderated pace. The observed increase from 1017 (Week42) to 1416 (Week46) implies a compounding escalation. By extending this trend, the forecast of 1077 for None reflects a stabilization after a temporary peak at Week46 due to seasonal patterns moderating slightly post-Week46.
4. Influenza positivity rates remain consistently very low nationwide (Week42-Week46, 2020 #1 in each week), with less than 1% positivity reported. Low positivity reflects minimal influenza virus circulation, but the rise in ILI counts demonstrates the contribution of other respiratory illnesses or non-flu ILI drivers.
5. PIC deaths remain above the epidemic threshold and significantly account for total attributed deaths (Week42 #6, Week43 #6, Week44 #6, Week45 #6, Week46 #4), largely influenced by COVID-19. The overlap between COVID-19 symptoms and ILI symptoms adds to reported ILI visits, inflating the numbers despite low direct influenza activity.
6. The uncertain healthcare-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic (Week42-Week46, 2020 #9 in each week) disrupts traditional ILI surveillance. The shift to alternative care settings for respiratory illnesses likely biases historical baselines, leading to inaccuracies in evaluating genuine ILI levels.
7. In summary, the increase in recent ILI counts, coupled with the transition into peak flu season, the effects of pandemic-related disruptions inflating outpatient ILI visits, and low influenza prevalence, collectively support the forecast of 1077 ILI occurrences for None. This stabilization aligns with expected seasonal moderations following an initial peak trajectory.
