1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall upward trend, with values of ['1610', '1911', '1730', '1793', '2148']. An initial surge from 1610 (Week 40, 2020) to 1911 (Week 41, 2020) was followed by a dip to 1730 (Week 42, 2020), then a steady increase to 2148 by Week 44, 2020, the highest point in this period. This upward trajectory indicates growing ILI activity in the observed weeks.
2. A direct correlation is observed as the increasing pattern in past ILI occurrences, particularly the sharp rise in Weeks 43 and 44, 2020, connects with the future ILI occurrence of 1734 after 5 weeks. The comparatively high value in Week 44 suggests sustained ILI activity leading to the future outcome.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI demonstrated a gradual rise from 1.1% (Week 40, 2020) to 1.3% (Week 44, 2020), reflecting increasing respiratory illness-related healthcare visits, which support the surge in future ILI occurrences. Persistent PIC mortality rates, exceeding epidemic thresholds (7.0% in Week 40, 2020, to 8.1% in Week 44, 2020), indicate ongoing respiratory illness burden, aligning with the observed future increase. Healthcare-seeking changes documented during this period highlight reporting disruptions, possibly contributing to concentrated activity reflected in the 1734 future occurrences.
4. Despite low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.21% in Week 40, 2020, and 0.1% in Week 44, 2020), elevated deaths attributed to respiratory illnesses and altered care-seeking behavior suggest that the reported rise stems from non-influenza respiratory illnesses or overlapping pandemic factors.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1734 (Week 49, 2020) can be explained by the upward trend in past data, increasing outpatient ILI rates, elevated PIC mortality exceeding thresholds, and pandemic-driven disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior and surveillance systems.
