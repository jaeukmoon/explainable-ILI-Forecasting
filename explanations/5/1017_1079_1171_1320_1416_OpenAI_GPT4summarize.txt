1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1017', '1079', '1171', '1320', '1416']. Starting at 1017 in Week 42, 2020, the occurrences steadily increased, peaking at 1416 in Week 46, 2020. This regular ascent suggests escalating ILI activity through the observed weeks.

2. A positive correlation between past time-series and future occurrences is evident. The continuous rise in Weeks 44–46, 2020 (reaching 1320 and 1416, respectively), aligns with the reported future occurrence of 1077 at Week 51, 2020. This aligns with the established late-season flu activity pattern.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased steadily, rising from 1.2% in Week 42, 2020, to 1.5% in Week 46, 2020, though still below the national baseline of 2.6%. This gradual increase corresponds with the heightened ILI occurrences and reflects growing respiratory illness outreach to healthcare providers.

4. Elevated percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed epidemic thresholds, climbing from 7.6% in Week 42, 2020, to 10.7% in Week 46, 2020. This trend indicates an overlap of respiratory illnesses, consistent with the rise in ILI activity over time.

5. Healthcare system disruptions from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted in all CDC reports. Altered healthcare-seeking behaviors, reduced surveillance capacity, and overlaps with COVID-19 symptoms hindered accurate tracking of specific illnesses. These factors likely resulted in under-detected cases early on, contributing to a subsequent spike in ILI occurrences.

6. Despite low influenza virus positivity rates (fluctuating between 0.1% and 0.3%) and minimal lab-detected cases in Weeks 42–46, 2020, the steady increase in ILI activity suggests contributions from numerous other respiratory illnesses or undiagnosed influenza cases. Pandemic-related behavioral changes likely accentuated non-specific reporting trends, feeding into higher future occurrences.

7. In summary, the reported 1077 ILI occurrences in Week 51, 2020, are explained by a consistent upward trajectory across Weeks 42–46, 2020, increasing outpatient ILI visits, elevated PIC-related mortality, and the amplifying effects of COVID-19-driven healthcare disruptions and reporting adjustments.
