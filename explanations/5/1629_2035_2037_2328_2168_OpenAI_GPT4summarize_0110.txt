1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week37 to Week41, 2023 are 1629, 2035, 2037, 2328, and 2168. The data shows a notable rise from Week37 (1629) to Week40 (2328), followed by a slight decline in Week41 (2168). Overall, this trend indicates a rise toward higher activity levels, with mild fluctuation during the latest week, suggesting the approach of increased flu activity but not yet peaking.
2. Forecasting Week46, 2023 aligns with the peak season. Based on historical seasonality patterns in the U.S., Week46 typically marks the transition into peak influenza activity. Coupled with recent growth in outpatient respiratory visits (Week41, 2023 #4) and increased positivity rates in clinical specimens (Week41, 2023 #1), it is consistent with the start of the peak season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the growing trend in ILI occurrences up to Week40, 2023, followed by a small dip in Week41, 2023, suggests gradual escalation in activity. Extending this pattern forward based on historical data (with Week46 frequently marking the onset of heightened activity), an increase in ILI occurrences is expected, projecting future occurrences at 3453 due to a compounding rate of outpatient visits and flu positivity.
4. Nationwide influenza positivity rates showed a steady increase over the weeks (Week37, 2023 #1: 0.8%; Week38, 2023 #1: 0.9%; Week39, 2023 #1: 1.0%; Week40, 2023 #1: 1.1%; Week41, 2023 #1: 1.3%), signaling higher transmissibility levels.
5. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness demonstrated persistent growth, nearing the national baseline, with Week41, 2023 reporting 2.3% of visits attributed to ILI (Week41, 2023 #4).
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and influenza, contribute to rising outpatient respiratory burdens (Week38, 2023 #8; Week39, 2023 #7; Week41, 2023 #9). These compounding factors are anticipated to sustain or amplify ILI levels over the coming weeks.
7. In summary, the forecast for 3453 ILI occurrences in Week46, 2023 is justified by rising positivity rates in respiratory samples, increased outpatient ILI visits, and higher regional activity levels. Coupled with historical peak season onset, the combination of co-circulating viruses and escalating trends in recent surveillance data substantiates this prediction.
