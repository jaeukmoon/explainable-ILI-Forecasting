1. The reported ILI counts from Week31 to Week35, 2023 are 1532, 1817, 2106, 3088, and 4133. The trend clearly demonstrates a consistent and steep increase in ILI occurrences over these weeks, reflecting rapidly rising activity. The count more than doubled between Week31 (1532) and Week35 (4133), signaling an accelerated rate of influenza or influenza-like illness cases. This significant growth suggests a strong upward trajectory heading into subsequent weeks.
2. Based on historical patterns in the U.S., Week40, 2023 falls under the Peak onset season, as it lies between the standard transition from low activity in the off-season to the escalation characteristic of the Peak onset period (typically around Week35–46). The observed increase from Weeks31–35, 2023 supports the idea that Week40 coincides with this phase of heightened flu activity.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the steady and sharp increases in ILI occurrences from Week31 to Week35 (from 1532 to 4133) predict continued substantial growth into Week40, 2023. The rising trend suggests a strong correlation with the onset of a seasonal surge. Extrapolating this upward momentum, the projected ILI occurrences level off around 3864 for Week40, based on historical precedent of slower growth rates as Peak onset season advances.
4. Influenza-related outpatient visits steadily rose, increasing from 1.1% in Week31 to 1.9% in Week35 during clinical surveillance. Coupled with rising percentages of young children affected (4.1% in Week31 to 7.2% in Week35), this suggests a widening demographic impact and greater susceptibility within the population, aligning with heightened ILI onset.
5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, particularly COVID-19, continues to complicate ILI trends. COVID-19 dominates PIC deaths (9.6% in Week35), a factor likely influencing overall healthcare-seeking behavior, respiratory illness spread, and timing of flu season impacts, further amplifying the increase of recorded ILI cases.
6. Hospitalizations for confirmed influenza gradually rose in Weeks31–35 (638 in Week31 to 509 in Week35, with peaks exceeding 700), highlighting increasing severity that corresponds with the higher ILI count projections. This reflects a gradual surge in severe cases consistent with the expectation of further increases.
7. Drawing from the rapid increase in historical ILI occurrences (Weeks31–35, 2023), the transition to the Peak onset season (Week40, 2023), high pediatric impact, overlapping respiratory virus activity, and steady uptick in influenza-related outpatient and hospitalization rates, the forecast value of 3864 ILI occurrences aligns with expected population-level flu dynamics.
