1. Explanation:
1. The time-series data from Week19, 2023 to Week23, 2023 shows a clear and steady decreasing trend in ILI occurrences: 1933 → 1847 → 1762 → 1753 → 1592. This consistent decline over the past five weeks indicates a stabilizing pattern, moving toward off-season levels. The average week-over-week decrease is calculated as follows:
2. Week19 to Week20: 1933 - 1847 = 86
3. Week20 to Week21: 1847 - 1762 = 85
4. Week21 to Week22: 1762 - 1753 = 9
5. Week22 to Week23: 1753 - 1592 = 161
6. Total decrease over 4 weeks: 86 + 85 + 9 + 161 = 341.
7. Average weekly decrease: 341 / 4 = 85.25.
8. Assuming this average decrease persists, projecting five weeks forward from Week23, 2023 yields:
9. Week24: 1592 - 85.25 ≈ 1507
10. Week25: 1507 - 85.25 ≈ 1422
11. Week26: 1422 - 85.25 ≈ 1337
12. Week27: 1337 - 85.25 ≈ 1252
13. Week28: 1252 - 85.25 ≈ 1167.
14. Since the overall decreasing trend may further accelerate during the off-season due to minimal transmission, an additional adjustment (~8% further drop) is made, resulting in the final value: 1167 × 0.92 ≈ 1075.
2. Week28, 2023 belongs to the "Off-season" based on U.S. influenza season classifications. The off-season typically spans from Week1 to Week31, characterized by minimal influenza activity with declines in ILI occurrences. The summarized CDC reports and historical seasonality confirm that influenza activity remains low nationally during late June to mid-July, affirming Week28 is part of the off-season. This directly supports the expectation of reduced ILI occurrences in this period.
3. The correlation analysis between past trends and future ILI occurrences highlights the importance of the decreasing time-series trends and the identified seasonal pattern. The observed five-week trend points to declining ILI occurrences, especially moving deeper into the off-season. Historical data patterns, such as reductions during the late season, add statistical weight to expectations of continued decline. Week28 projections align with typical off-season behavior, modeled through the combination of average decline rates and seasonal baseline adjustments.
4. Three CDC-reported factors strongly influence the forecast:
5. 1) **Minimal influenza positivity rates**: Reports from Week19, 2023 to Week23, 2023 consistently show national influenza positivity below 1.2%. This low transmission rate correlates with a reduced ILI occurrence. A projected reduction by ~10% aligns with these observed conditions.
6. 2) **Off-season dynamics and co-circulation**: CDC reports emphasize low flu activity despite co-circulating viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, RSV). These reports note minimal upward pressure on ILI due to dominance of respiratory viral contributions unrelated to influenza. This multi-respiratory dynamic reduces the likelihood of sharp ILI spikes, further supporting forecast reductions to off-season baselines.
7. 3) **Seasonal expectations and vaccine effectiveness**: The CDC projects flu activity during summer (off-season) will remain very low, and widespread vaccination minimized flu spread earlier in the season. These factors further substantiate reductions, particularly as Week28 aligns with declining ILI trends during the off-season.
5. The predicted ILI value of 1075 for Week28, 2023 reflects a continuation of the observed decreasing trend over the past five weeks, compounded by seasonal reductions typical of the off-season. The time-series analysis, trend forecasts, CDC-reported low viral activity, and co-circulation of respiratory viruses support this estimate. Adjustments for accelerating declines in activity (~8%, reflecting off-season effects) further refine the projection to align with historical data and situational analysis.
