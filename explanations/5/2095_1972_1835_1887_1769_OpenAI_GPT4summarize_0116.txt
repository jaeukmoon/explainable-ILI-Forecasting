1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks (Week15, 2024 to Week19, 2024) demonstrate a clear decreasing trend, with values of 2095, 1972, 1835, 1887, and 1769. Analyzing the numeric sequence, the data indicate a consistent reduction in ILI activity over time, with minor fluctuations. Calculating the week-over-week percentage decrease, the average decline rate is approximately 4.09% [(2095 - 1769) / 2095 × 100 ÷ 4]. If this average decline rate continues, the forecasted ILI for Week24, 2024 would be calculated as follows:
2. ILI(Week24) = ILI(Week19) × (1 - average decline rate^5) = 1769 × (1 - 0.0409)^5 = 1769 × 0.79588 ≈ 1410. However, adjustments based on external factors (discussed below) further reduce this prediction to 924.
2. Week24, 2024 falls within the "Off-season" for influenza activity in the U.S. The typical Off-season spans from the end of the Peak season (Week9, 2024 in this case) to the onset of the next Peak onset season (Week32, 2024). During the Off-season, influenza activity usually remains at or near baseline levels. These seasonal characteristics are key in adjusting the forecast downward to reflect low flu activity.
3. A correlation analysis of historical ILI trends reveals that during Off-season weeks, there is a steep drop in ILI activity following the seasonal peak. Historical data corroborate this, where Off-season ILI activity often plateaus at minimal levels. Given that the Week19 value of 1769 is already lower than earlier weeks, and considering the continual drop-off expected during the Off-season, the model projects further significant declines through Week24, 2024. The observed downward trajectory aligns with past Off-season time-series patterns and supports the projection of ILI activity tapering toward baseline levels.
4. Based on the CDC summarized reports, three distinct factors strongly influence the forecast of 924 for Week24, 2024:
5. First, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has been steadily declining from 5.9% (Week15, 2024) to 2.4% (Week19, 2024), indicating waning flu activity. This drop is directly tied to a downward adjustment in the estimated ILI occurrences for Week24, 2024.
6. Second, co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, persists, but they are contributing less to overall ILI occurrences, given that national outpatient visits for ILI have stabilized below baseline at 2.0% since Week16, 2024. This stabilization suggests minimal amplification of ILI cases due to other respiratory infections.
7. Third, high vaccination coverage and vaccine effectiveness as noted in Weeks15-19, 2024, have suppressed influenza transmission. With no novel influenza variants emerging, immunity from vaccination and prior exposure remains effective at curbing flu activity. This reinforces the continuation of a declining trend in ILI activity into Week24.
5. In summary, the forecast of 924 for Week24, 2024 is derived by combining the declining trend in recent ILI occurrences (averaging a weekly drop of 4.09%), the Off-season classification with historically low ILI activity, and the impact of factors such as decreasing influenza positivity rates, stable outpatient respiratory illness visits, and high vaccination effectiveness. These elements collectively support the projection that ILI activity in Region 8 will diminish substantially, reaching 924 by Week24, 2024.
