1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the preceding 5 weeks demonstrate a fluctuating yet overall upward trend, with values of ['1639', '1540', '1679', '1721', '1815']. After an initial drop from 1639 (Week 37, 2021) to 1540 (Week 38, 2021), the data reveal a gradual increase, peaking at 1815 in Week 41, 2021. This consistent rise toward the end of the observation window indicates increasing ILI activity.

2. A direct correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The upward trend observed in Weeks 39–41, 2021, aligns with the increase to 2190 after 5 weeks (Week 46, 2021). The steady growth, particularly in the last two weeks of the dataset (Weeks 40 and 41), acts as a precursor to the elevated ILI activity observed in the future time period.

3. Several factors outlined in the summarized CDC reports strongly correlate with the future occurrences:  
   - **PIC-related deaths:** A consistently high proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) was observed, exceeding epidemic thresholds for all 5 weeks (e.g., 21.1% in Week 37, declining to 17.5% in Week 41). The persistent respiratory disease burden highlights the ongoing transmission risks.  
   - **Healthcare-seeking behavior shifts:** Since healthcare-seeking patterns have been significantly altered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the reported changes (highlighted in all 5 weeks) likely impacted the surveillance and reporting of ILI occurrences, leading to potential surges in reported cases.  
   - **Concurrent non-influenza respiratory viruses:** The reports from Weeks 37–41 mention limited influenza activity, with other respiratory viruses contributing to ILI. This overlap likely spurred broader respiratory illness-related outpatient visits, influencing the rise in ILI activity.

4. In summary, the reported 2190 future ILI occurrences (Week 46, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trajectory of past ILI data in Weeks 39–41, 2021, the sustained high burden of PIC-related mortality, disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior due to the pandemic, and the impact of non-influenza respiratory virus activity. These interconnected factors underscore the observed increase in ILI trends over time.
