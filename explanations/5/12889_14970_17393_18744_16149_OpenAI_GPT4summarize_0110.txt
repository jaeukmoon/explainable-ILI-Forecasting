1. The reported ILI counts from Week49, 2023 to Week1, 2024 are 12889, 14970, 17393, 18744, and 16149. The trend shows a consistent increase from Week49, 2023 (12889) to Week52, 2023 (18744), followed by a decline to 16149 in Week1, 2024. The overall pattern indicates an increasing trend with a peak in Week52, 2023 and then a slight decrease, possibly due to temporarily reduced transmission post-holiday or reporting variations.
2. Considering Week6, 2024 is within the typical peak season (Week46 of the prior year to Week6 of the following year), and current influenza activity remains significantly elevated and widespread, it is forecasted that Week6, 2024 belongs to the peak season.
3. A correlation analysis between past trends and the forecasted value shows that ILI occurrences have increased over the previous weeks, with a peak followed by a slight decline. Given historical peaks during this period and regional activity levels (from CDC reports), the projected value (12895 in Week6, 2024) aligns with slightly declining ILI activity as the season transitions toward its latter phase.
4. Three distinct factors from the summarized CDC reports strongly influencing this projection are: (i) elevated influenza activity with positivity rates steadily increasing, reaching 17.5% in Week52, 2023 and slightly declining to moderate levels by Week1, 2024 (Week52, 2023 #1; Week1, 2024 #1); (ii) co-circulation of respiratory pathogens (influenza, RSV, COVID-19), which complicates recovery and sustains ILI activity (Week49, 2023 #9; Week50, 2023 #8; Week52, 2023 #10; Week1, 2024 #9); (iii) CDC's warning for potential post-holiday increases in ILI activity due to ongoing elevated trends and widespread regional activity (Week1, 2024 #10).
5. Vaccination efforts remain ongoing, with continued availability and late-season benefits expected (Week49, 2023 #8; Week50, 2023 #9; Week52, 2023 #9; Week1, 2024 #8). This helps to manage severe cases but does not fully prevent transmission at this peak stage due to time lag between vaccination and immunity development.
6. Hospitalization rates and influenza-related deaths have increased sharply over the last five weeks, reaching a cumulative rate of 31.7 per 100,000 with significant impact on vulnerable populations, notably adults aged 65+ (Week1, 2024 #3, #5). Rising influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 dominance (Week50, 2023 #2; Week52, 2023 #2; Week1, 2024 #2) correlates with increased severity and ILI visits in the peak season.
7. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrence of 12895 in Week6, 2024 is based on the observed increasing trend in ILI cases during the peak season (with a slight decline in Week1, 2024), ongoing widespread influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity, and the influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors, combined with CDC warnings of potential secondary flu surges, align with the slightly reduced yet elevated forecasted value for Week6, 2024.
