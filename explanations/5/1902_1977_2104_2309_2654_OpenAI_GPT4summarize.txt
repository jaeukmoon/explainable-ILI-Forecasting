1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, starting at 1902 in Week 13, 2022, and steadily rising to 2654 in Week 17, 2022. Each week recorded higher values than the previous one, indicating a sustained increase in ILI activity, with the most significant jump occurring between Week 16 and Week 17 (from 2309 to 2654). This continuous rise suggests escalating respiratory illness burden over the period.

2. There is a strong positive correlation between the upward trajectory of past ILI occurrences in Weeks 13–17, 2022, and the future ILI occurrences reported as 3629 after 5 weeks (Week 22, 2022). The consistent increases in weeks leading up to Week 17 align with and point toward the significant growth in future ILI activity. The progression supports the idea that heightened ILI activity persisted in the weeks beyond the observed time frame.

3. The summarized reports highlight multiple contributing factors:

   - Outpatient visits for respiratory illness increased incrementally during the observation period, rising from 1.9% of healthcare visits in Week 13 to 2.2% in Week 17. This steady growth in outpatient visits aligns closely with the reported increase in ILI cases.
   - Cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza rose throughout the 5-week period, increasing from 8.0 per 100,000 in Week 13 to 12.2 per 100,000 in Week 17, reflecting a worsening trend in severe influenza-related illness.
   - The dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) (accounting for 95.1% to 99.2% of subtyped cases during Weeks 13–17) and its genetic similarities but antigenic differences to the vaccine strain likely contributed to widespread influenza activity, exacerbating ILI occurrences.
   - Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, further aggravated respiratory illness trends, with regions reporting varying impacts on the attribution of influenza to ILI activity.

4. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 3629 (Week 22, 2022) can be attributed to the pronounced upward trend in ILI activity over Weeks 13–17, increasing outpatient visits and hospitalizations, the predominance of Influenza A(H3N2), and the compounded effects of co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors combined to sustain and amplify respiratory illness activity in subsequent weeks.
