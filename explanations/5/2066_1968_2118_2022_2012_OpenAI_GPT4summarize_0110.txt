1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week15 to Week19, 2021 are 2066, 1968, 2118, 2022, and 2012. These values indicate a mild fluctuation without a clear upward or downward trend, with minor variances across weeks. Specifically, ILI counts decreased slightly in Week16 (1968) compared to Week15 (2066), increased again in Week17 (2118), and slightly dropped over Week18 and Week19 (2022 and 2012, respectively). This overall stability suggests no significant deviation in ILI activity during this period.
2. In the U.S., Week24, 2021 falls into the off-season for influenza, consistent with the period after the typical peak season (ending around Week6) and before the peak onset season (starting around Week32 or Week35). Historical context and current low flu activity (Week15, 2021 #1; Week16, 2021 #1; Week19, 2021 #1) confirm this classification.
3. From the time-series perspective, the mild fluctuations in past ILI data suggest a relatively stable ILI trend at marginally low levels. Projecting these conditions forward five weeks to Week24, 2021, and accounting for the off-season classification, the model anticipates no sudden increases or decreases in occurrences, leading to a forecast of 2133.
4. Influenza activity has remained exceptionally low, as only 0.1% of respiratory specimens tested positive for flu in clinical laboratories throughout Week15 to Week19, 2021, indicating historically minimal flu circulation (Week15, 2021 #1; Week18, 2021 #1; Week19, 2021 #1).
5. Since vaccination rates have shown no significant updates or emerging trends during this period (Week15, 2021 #10; Week16, 2021 #8; Week18, 2021 #8), the protective baseline established from prior immunizations provides a consistent yet modest effect, keeping flu transmission low.
6. The persistent dominance of COVID-19 continues to affect healthcare-seeking behaviors and outpatient visits for ILI, with data showing a stable 1.1–1.2% of outpatient visits being related to ILI across Week15 to Week19, 2021 (Week15, 2021 #6; Week17, 2021 #7; Week19, 2021 #7). This factor heavily curtails influenza cases during the ongoing pandemic.
7. Given the observed stable yet low ILI trends, off-season timing for Week24, 2021, and the interplay of minimal flu positivity, static vaccination impact, and COVID-19 dominance, the forecasted ILI count of 2133 is well-aligned with these conditions, projecting modest fluctuations within the same historical range.
