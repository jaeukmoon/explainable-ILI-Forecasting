1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating pattern, with values of ['1301', '1285', '1243', '1207', '1253']. While there was an initial decline from 1301 (Week30, 2022) to 1207 (Week33, 2022), the latest week, Week34, 2022, showed an increase to 1253. This indicates a slight rebound in respiratory illness activity toward the end of the 5-week period.
2. There is a correlation between past and future ILI occurrences, as the observed uptick in the final week of the past data (Week34, 2022) aligns with the reported surge to 2301 future cases after 5 weeks. The rise from 1207 to 1253 in prior weeks serves as an early precursor to the subsequent amplification of ILI activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a gradual increase, from 1.6% (Week30, 2022) to 1.8% (Week34, 2022), with the highest rates observed consistently among children aged 0-4 years, such as 7.0% in Week34. This growth in ILI-related healthcare encounters signals escalating respiratory illness activity, contributing to the future ILI peak.
4. Hospitalizations due to influenza steadily declined, with weekly admissions reducing from 491 in Week30, 2022, to 486 in Week34, 2022. However, respiratory co-circulation involving other viruses, notably COVID-19, persisted, with PIC mortality ranging between 9.2% and 10.0%. This ongoing co-circulation likely facilitated broader respiratory illness trends, influencing the rise to 2301 future occurrences.
5. The low influenza positivity rates across clinical and public health labs, e.g., 0.4%-0.5% positivity during Weeks30–34, 2022, indicate that other factors, such as healthcare-seeking behavior shifts or co-circulating illnesses, were significant contributors. Uncertainty in surveillance caused by pandemic-exacerbated changes likely amplified the reported future surge in ILI levels.
6. In summary, the reported 2301 ILI occurrences after Week39, 2022, stem from the slight upward trend in recent ILI occurrences in Week34, 2022, increasing outpatient ILI visit percentages, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and the compounding effects of co-circulating illnesses and pandemic-driven disruptions in healthcare behaviors and surveillance.
