1. The reported ILI counts from Week30 to Week34, 2021 are 1025, 1201, 1413, 1326, and 1347. This trend indicates a significant increase from Week30 (1025) to Week32 (1413), followed by a slight decline in Week33 (1326) and stabilization through Week34 (1347). Overall, the trend demonstrates a rising pattern up to Week32 and a minor leveling off in later weeks.
2. Forecasting Week39, 2021 categorizes this period into the peak onset season. Based on historical baseline knowledge, Week39 falls within the predicted peak onset season window, where ILI activity typically begins to grow steadily before transitioning into the standard peak season starting later in the year.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the upward trajectory noted until Week32 and subsequent stabilization suggests modest continued growth within the next five weeks. Given the increase over prior weeks and seasonal expectations, the value of 1140 ILI occurrences for Week39, 2021 aligns with this pattern of steady rise transitioning into the peak onset season.
4. CDC reports from Week30–Week34, 2021 highlight key factors influencing this forecast: (1) The increase in outpatient ILI visits attributed to respiratory viruses other than influenza, including COVID-19 (Week30 #7; Week31 #1, #3; Week32 #9); this widespread transmission likely sustains an upward trend in respiratory illness that affects ILI reports. (2) Limited virologic activity for influenza virus detection, but the emergence of novel influenza cases (e.g., swine-related A(H1N2)v) signals circulating risks that can drive ILI increments (Week32 #2; Week33 #3). (3) Rising ILI percentages consistently across multiple age groups, notably 5–24 years and children (Week32 #3; Week34 #2), amplifying outpatient visits, an indicator for steady activity levels.
5. The fluctuations in healthcare-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic pose interpretation challenges, but overlapping respiratory virus symptoms likely influence rising ILI trends (Week31 #8; Week34 #9).
6. Additionally, high PIC mortality rates exceeding the epidemic threshold (Week30 #4; Week32 #4; Week34 #6), largely driven by COVID-19 but overlapping with respiratory morbidity, maintain elevated ILI levels.
7. The ILI forecast of 1140 for Week39, 2021 strongly correlates with the mildly stabilizing time-series trend, seasonally predictable escalation during the peak onset period, viral co-circulation influencing ILI increments (COVID-19 and non-flu viruses), and broader respiratory illness data pointing toward steady growth yet not a rapid spike. This value reflects the expected gradual rise before entering peak intensity weeks later in the year.
