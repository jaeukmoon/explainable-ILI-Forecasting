1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show a consistent and significant decline, with values of ['1017', '889', '748', '722', '698']. Starting from 1017 in Week24, 2023, the figures drop steadily each week, eventually reaching 698 in Week28, 2023. This clear downward trend represents decreasing ILI activity over the 5-week period.
2. Despite the declining trend in past occurrences, the future ILI occurrences increase to 800 (Week33, 2023). This reversal suggests external factors or a latent buildup of cases influenced the subsequent rise, as the immediate past trends alone do not predict an uptick. Other factors in the summarized CDC reports, including co-circulating respiratory viruses and pediatric illness patterns, likely played a critical role in this correlation.
3. Pediatric ILI rates among children aged 0-4 remained disproportionately high (e.g., 5.2% in Week24 and 4.0% in Week28), signaling sustained ILI burden in vulnerable age groups that could contribute to higher future counts.
4. Although respiratory virus circulation, including influenza, decreased overall (e.g., testing positivity fell from 1.1% in Week24 to 0.9% in Week28), co-circulation with other viruses like SARS-CoV-2 persisted. This trend complicates the interpretation of ILI data and may lead to a non-linear relationship between past and future occurrences.
5. Hospitalizations due to influenza varied minimally (e.g., 779 in Week24 and 689 in Week28), but the steady existence of severe cases reflects ongoing disease activity. Moreover, deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained consistently near or above epidemic thresholds, reflecting a broader illness burden potentially contributing to the future increase in ILI cases.
6. In summary, the reported 800 future ILI occurrences (Week33, 2023) are influenced by persistent elevated pediatric ILI activity, the continued burden of respiratory viruses (including non-influenza viruses like SARS-CoV-2), and cumulative hospitalization and PIC mortality impacts. While past time-series data suggest a declining trend, concurrent external dynamics likely drove the eventual increase.
