1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a clear downward trend, with values of ['1101', '1255', '1305', '1189', '1064']. The initial weeks saw an increase, peaking at 1305 in Week 36, 2021, before a consistent decline to 1064 by Week 38, 2021. This pattern of declining ILI activity in the latter weeks reflects reduced respiratory illness cases over time.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed. The declining trend during the last weeks of the past data (Weeks 37–38, 2021) aligns with the reported drop to 1008 future occurrences by Week 43, 2021, emphasizing a continuation of diminishing ILI trends.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI exhibited a steady decrease, dropping from 2.3% (Week 36, 2021) to 1.9% (Week 38, 2021), remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%. This consistent decline in ILI-related healthcare encounters highlights reduced respiratory illness activity, contributing to the lower future occurrences.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained high but slightly declined, from 21.1% (Week 37, 2021) to 20.9% (Week 38, 2021), driven predominantly by COVID-19. Though still elevated, the gradual decline aligns with the general downward trajectory in ILI activity.
5. Data interpretation challenges caused by pandemic-related healthcare-seeking behavior shifts, as noted in all summarized reports, contributed to underestimates in ILI data. This likely resulted in artificially suppressed values for Weeks 37–38, 2021, which naturally extended into the 1008 future occurrences in Week 43, 2021.
6. Despite overall low influenza virus positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% in Week 36, 2021, and minimal flu detection in Week 38, 2021), high activity of non-influenza respiratory viruses influenced ILI reports, highlighting the broader context of declining respiratory illness without significant flu contributions.
7. In summary, the reported 1008 future ILI occurrences (Week 43, 2021) are rooted in the consistent decline in ILI percentages, diminishing PIC mortality rates, low influenza detection, and altered healthcare-seeking behaviors during the pandemic, all reflected in the downward trends observed in Weeks 37–38, 2021.
