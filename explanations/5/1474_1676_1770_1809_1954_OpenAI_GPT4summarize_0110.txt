1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week16, 2022 to Week20, 2022 exhibit a consistent upward trend. Starting at 1474 in Week16, the occurrences rise weekly, reaching 1954 in Week20. This pattern demonstrates a steady increase in ILI activity over time, with no observed dips or stability in the data, indicating that ILI transmission is accelerating.
2. Based on U.S. seasonality trends, Week25, 2022 aligns with the off-season as it occurs well after the usual peak season (Week46 to Week6) and prior to the peak onset (Week32 to Week46). The relatively low ILI positivity rates reported in Weeks16 through Week20, 2022, along with outpatient respiratory illness visits below the national baseline, further corroborate this off-season classification.
3. From a time-series perspective, the steady ILI growth observed over five weeks reflects a strong positive trajectory. Projections for Week25, 2022, which rely on historical data and assume no abrupt deviations, suggest a tapering or stabilization of this increase. The projected count of 1543 reflects a slight decline from Week20’s 1954 value, indicating that the trend may begin to stabilize or plateau as the off-season progresses.
4. Regional influenza activity continues to rise, particularly driven by Influenza A(H3N2), which accounted for nearly all positive flu cases during Weeks16 to Week20, 2022. This dominance of a single strain likely sustains increased ILI occurrences.
5. Vaccination efforts, while recommended, show a reduced match against Influenza A(H3N2) due to late-season antigenic differences, which may impact immunity and fail to curtail rising ILI occurrences effectively during this period (Week16, 2022 #10; Week17, 2022 #8; Week18, 2022 #8).
6. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, as well as regional variability in respiratory illness contributions, adds complexity to predictions but likely sustains ongoing ILI activity (Week16, 2022 #7; Week18, 2022 #10; Week20, 2022 #8).
7. In summary, the projected value of 1543 for Week25, 2022 reflects the interplay of increasing ILI trends observed in previous weeks, the off-season classification limiting rapid acceleration, the dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), reduced vaccine match impacting immunity, and co-circulation of other respiratory viruses maintaining moderate ILI activity. These factors collectively justify the forecasted stabilization and slight decline following Week20’s higher occurrences.
