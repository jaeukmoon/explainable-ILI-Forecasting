1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks (Week33, 2021 to Week37, 2021) show an increasing trend. Starting at 1543 in Week33, the ILI occurrences slightly decreased to 1531 in Week34 and further to 1502 in Week35, before sharply rising to 1743 in Week36 and 1887 in Week37. This suggests a transition from relatively stable levels to a rising pattern, indicating the onset of a seasonal increase in ILI activity. The sharp increase between Weeks35 and 36 (+16.1%) and Weeks36 and 37 (+8.3%) is significant. The average weekly growth rate over the last two weeks is approximately (16.1% + 8.3%) / 2 = 12.2%.
2. Season Classification: Week42, 2021 belongs to the “Peak Onset Season.” According to U.S. flu season classifications, the peak onset season spans Weeks32–46 (from Background Knowledge). Given that Week42 falls within this range and influenza activity during Weeks33–37 shows increasing trends (not yet reaching peak), Week42 is within the timeframe of escalating activity during the onset period leading to the peak.
3. To forecast Week42, 2021, we use the historical ILI occurrences and the observed growth rates:
4. a. The average weekly increase between Week36 and Week37 is 8.3%, and between Week35 and Week36 is 16.1%. As the trend stabilizes, we expect the weekly growth rate to moderate closer to the lower end (e.g., 8–9%), characteristic of gradual seasonal rise during peak onset.
5. b. Using the most recent Week37 value (1887) and applying an average weekly increase of 9% over 5 weeks:
6. Week38: 1887 × 1.09 ≈ 2058
7. Week39: 2058 × 1.09 ≈ 2243
8. Week40: 2243 × 1.09 ≈ 2444
9. Week41: 2444 × 1.09 ≈ 2664
10. Week42: 2664 × 1.09 ≈ 2903. However, since this growth is being driven by factors unrelated to influenza (e.g., SARS-CoV-2), and in combination with CDC's indications of low influenza circulation, we apply a reducing factor of 50%, resulting in a final value of 2903 × 0.5 ≈ 1800. This reduction accounts for the influence of non-influenza respiratory viruses and inaccuracies in healthcare reporting trends (from the CDC reports).
4. Factors from the CDC reports influencing the prediction:
5. a. Minimal influenza transmission and low positivity rates (0.1% by Week36 and Week37), which indicate that the observed ILI surges are due to non-influenza viruses like SARS-CoV-2. These external drivers add to respiratory illness but do not correspond to true influenza spikes (Week33–37, 2021). This aligns with reducing the forecasted raw growth.
6. b. Substantial impact of COVID-19. COVID-19 remains the primary driver behind PIC deaths, which surged to 21.1% by Week37, well above the epidemic threshold. COVID-related surges amplify outpatient respiratory illness visits reported in ILINet (Week33–37, 2021), elevating ILI rates from indirect effects.
7. c. Disruptions due to healthcare-seeking behaviors and pandemic-related reporting inaccuracies. Observed changes in surveillance data (e.g., underreporting of true influenza cases, overreporting from pandemic-related visits) necessitate a more conservative estimate of true ILI-driven growth (CDC narratives across Week33–37, 2021).
5. In summary, the prediction of 1800 ILI occurrences for Week42, 2021 is based on an increasing trend in the past data (+12.2% average growth rate). The seasonal classification places Week42 in the peak onset season, where typical ILI increases occur. However, CDC reports highlight the dominance of non-influenza respiratory viruses, particularly COVID-19, and disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors that skew ILI data upward, requiring a reduction in raw growth estimates. Hence, the predicted ILI occurrences stabilize at 1800.
