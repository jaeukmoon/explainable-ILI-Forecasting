1. The past ILI occurrences from Week23 to Week27, 2022 are 1921, 1731, 1623, 1519, and 1386. The trend indicates a consistent decline over this period, with weekly decreases in cases. This downward pattern shows no significant spikes or variability, suggesting low and predictable activity.
2. Target Week32, 2022 falls under the off-season as the typical U.S. influenza off-season spans from Week1 to Week31/Week32, and the data from Week23 through Week27, 2022 consistently reflect low ILI prevalence and minimal influenza positivity. Thus, Week32 aligns with the off-season period.
3. The time series trend demonstrates steady reductions in ILI occurrences. Projecting this pattern from Week27 forward, a continued decline in cases is expected. However, as the declines are moderating, the future ILI count for Week32 balances slightly above such long-term decay trends at 1243, consistent with the time-series forecasting model's output.
4. Nationwide influenza activity has remained consistently low and decreasing (Week23, 2022 #1; Week24, 2022 #1; Week25, 2022 #1; Week26, 2022 #1; Week27, 2022 #1), with influenza positivity rates dropping from 3.4% in Week23 to 0.7% by Week27.
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, particularly COVID-19 and RSV, continues to impact ILI activity (Week23, 2022 #7, #10; Week24, 2022 #10; Week25, 2022 #10; Week26, 2022 #10; Week27, 2022 #10), maintaining some residual respiratory cases without driving significant increases.
6. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness remain below baseline across all weeks (Week23, 2022 #3; Week24, 2022 #4; Week25, 2022 #4; Week26, 2022 #3; Week27, 2022 #4). Modest activity persists primarily among children aged 0-4 years, but these numbers are insufficient to produce a surge in ILI occurrences.
7. The consistent decline in ILI cases, coupled with general off-season timing, low community transmission rates, co-circulation impacts, and minimal outpatient visits, supports the forecasted ILI count of 1243 for Week32, 2022.
