1. The reported ILI counts from Week29 to Week33, 2023 are 1761, 1721, 1888, 1992, and 2122. The ILI occurrences show a consistent rising trend over these weeks, beginning with 1761 in Week29 and increasing steadily to 2122 in Week33. This gradual and consistent growth in ILI activity reflects the onset of higher influenza activity.
2. Week38, 2023 occurs in the U.S. typical Peak onset season, which spans approximately from Week35 to Week46 each year. Given the observed rising trend in ILI counts (Week29 to Week33, 2023) and the timeframe, Week38, 2023 aligns with the gradual build-up of activity expected during the Peak onset season.
3. The time-series trend shows a steady rise in ILI cases from Week29 to Week33, 2023. This consistent increase, coupled with the seasonal timing, suggests a continued upward trajectory in ILI activity leading to Week38, 2023. Extrapolating this trend forward using a time-series forecasting model aligns with the prediction of a higher ILI occurrence at 4104 in Week38, 2023, reflecting intensified influenza activity.
4. Regional and national influenza positivity remains low but shows slight fluctuations across weeks, with percentages at 1.0% in Week29, 2023 (#1), 1.0% in Week30, 2023 (#1), 1.0% in Week31, 2023 (#1), 0.8% in Week32, 2023 (#1), and 0.5% in Week33, 2023 (#1). This low positivity suggests minimal immediate impact from influenza alone but is potentially influenced by co-circulating respiratory pathogens such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 (Week33, 2023 #10).
5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and novel influenza variants such as H1N2v, remains ongoing (Week29, 2023 #8; Week30, 2023 #8; Week33, 2023 #3), likely contributing to the overall burden of ILI occurrences. This sustained viral activity compounds the ILI count observed in past weeks and supports forecasts of continued increases.
6. Outpatient visits for ILI show a gradual increase, from 1.1% in Week29, 1.2% in Week30, 1.1% in Week31, 1.3% in Week32, to 1.5% in Week33 (Week29, 2023 #4; Week30, 2023 #3; Week31, 2023 #3; Week32, 2023 #5; Week33, 2023 #4). This trend reflects growing respiratory illness activity, particularly in younger populations, such as children aged 0-4 years, where rates have spiked as high as 6.3% by Week33, 2023 (#4). Such demographic-specific increases often signal broader rises in ILI cases.
7. In summary, the steady rising trend in ILI occurrences from Week29 to Week33, 2023, the seasonal timing aligning with the Peak onset season, the co-circulation of additional respiratory pathogens, and the increasing outpatient respiratory visits all justify the projection of 4104 ILI occurrences in Week38, 2023 as a continuation of this upward trajectory.
