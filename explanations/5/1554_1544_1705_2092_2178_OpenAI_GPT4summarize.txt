1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a significant upward trend, progressing from 1554 (Week 42, 2020) to 2178 (Week 46, 2020). This increase was marked by a steady rise, notably from 1705 (Week 44, 2020) to 2092 (Week 45, 2020), and further reaching the highest value of 2178 in Week 46, 2020. This consistent escalation in ILI occurrences suggests heightened respiratory illness activity leading into the subsequent weeks.  

2. A positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the sharp increase observed toward the latter weeks of the past data (Weeks 44–46, 2020) likely carried over to influence the reported future ILI count of 1783. While the future occurrences reflect a slight drop from Week 46's peak of 2178, the overall elevated trend in the past data aligns with a high level of ILI activity by Week 51, 2020.  

3. Outpatient visits for ILI displayed a gradual upward shift over the 5 weeks, moving from 1.2% in Week 42, 2020, to 1.5% in Week 46, 2020. Though remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%, this rise in ILI-related healthcare visits aligns with increasing respiratory illness activity, contributing to the elevated future ILI occurrences.  

4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, escalating from 7.6% (Week 42, 2020) to 10.7% by Week 46, 2020. This persistent PIC mortality reflects ongoing respiratory illness severity, corroborating sustained ILI activity and its potential impact on future data.  

5. Despite low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.3% in Week 42, 2020, and 0.2% in Week 46, 2020), COVID-19 pandemic-related disruption in healthcare-seeking behaviors likely contributed to increased emphasis on non-influenza respiratory illnesses in ILI surveillance. These disruptions, combined with overlapping respiratory symptoms, might have amplified ILI reporting in future occurrences.  

6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1783 (Week 51, 2020) is attributable to the observed upward trend in past ILI data (especially Weeks 44–46, 2020), increasing outpatient ILI visits, elevated PIC mortality throughout the 5 weeks, and the ongoing healthcare and reporting disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Together, these factors explain the sustained high level of ILI activity into the future period.
