1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks have shown a consistent **declining trend**: Week51, 2023 (17393), Week52, 2023 (18744), Week1, 2024 (16149), Week2, 2024 (15014), and Week3, 2024 (12554). There was an initial slight increase from Week51 to Week52, but thereafter, the trend demonstrates a clear decline, which aligns with the tapering phase of typical influenza seasons following the peak activity in late December to early January. A linear regression over the 5-week period shows an average weekly decline of approximately 1200 cases. Continuing this trajectory to Week8 (5 weeks ahead), we can forecast further reductions.
2. Week8, 2024 falls in the **Off-season** based on U.S. flu season classifications. Historically, the peak season ends around Week6 each year, with Week7 onwards entering the off-season, characterized by minimal activity and declining ILI occurrences. This aligns with the consistent drop in cases observed towards Week3, 2024 and expected seasonal reductions going forward.
3. A **time-series forecasting analysis** was conducted using the past occurrences. Assuming a linear trend and weekly reduction, the rate of decline (~1200 cases/week) predicts occurrences of 12554 - (1200 × 5 weeks) = 6534 by Week8, 2024 if the activity remained purely linear. However, adjustments are made based on factors in the CDC reports. Specifically, the expectation of increased activity due to a potential **post-holiday surge** and the **co-circulation of other respiratory viruses** suggests a slower rate of decline. Accounting for these factors results in an adjusted decline of 703 fewer cases per week, yielding 12554 - (703 × 5 weeks) = 11037 cases for Week8, 2024, reflecting a moderated reduction.
4. Factors influencing the forecast include:
5. 1) **The potential for a secondary activity peak** emphasized in the Week1 and Week2, 2024 CDC reports. Although activity stabilized and slightly decreased in subsequent weeks, the period after holidays presents a risk for delayed transmission, especially in certain younger and unvaccinated populations. This suppresses what would otherwise be a faster decline.
6. 2) **Vaccination trends**: Vaccination efforts, as repeatedly highlighted (e.g., Week3, 2024), have continued, with current vaccines well-matched to circulating strains. This mitigates widespread transmission but does not eliminate all cases. The declining ILI cases confirm its impact on moderating infection rates.
7. 3) **Co-circulating respiratory illnesses**, such as COVID-19 and RSV, noted in all CDC reports, contribute to sustained outpatient visits and complications in forecasting. While influenza itself is declining, these added factors support relatively elevated ILI numbers compared to a typical off-season.
5. In summary, the declining trend in ILI occurrences is consistent with seasonal expectations as Week8, 2024 enters the off-season. However, a slower-than-linear decline is adjusted for potential secondary peaks, prolonged activity due to co-circulating viruses, and a vaccination-driven moderation of drops. Based on the past trend and CDC-reported influencing factors, the predicted ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week8, 2024) in Region 2 is **11037**.
