1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show a fluctuating pattern characterized by an increase followed by a decline. The values began at 1705 (Week 44, 2020), rose to 2092 (Week 45, 2020) and slightly to 2178 (Week 46, 2020), then decreased to 2157 (Week 47, 2020) and further to 1770 (Week 48, 2020). Although there was an initial rise, the decline in the latter weeks highlights a tapering off of ILI activity by the end of the observed period.
2. A moderate correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is observed. The elevated values during Weeks 45 and 46, 2020, appear to have contributed to the reported future occurrence of 1867 (Week 53, 2020). However, the subsequent decline by Week 48 suggests that the rise in the future data may not be as significant as the earlier peak values in Weeks 45–46.
3. Outpatient ILI visits showed a progressive uptick from 1.3% (Week 44, 2020) to 1.6% (Weeks 47–48, 2020), aligning with the steady presence of respiratory illnesses. This consistent ILI activity below the national baseline indicates ongoing circulation of respiratory pathogens, which influenced the future ILI occurrence of 1867.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, rising from 8.1% (Week 44, 2020) to 12.8% (Week 48, 2020). This persistent elevation in PIC deaths reflects heightened respiratory illness activity during the observed period, correlating with the future ILI increase.
5. The unusually low influenza virus positivity (ranging between 0.1% to 0.2% across all weeks) and minimal reported pediatric influenza-associated deaths emphasize that non-influenza pathogens or COVID-19 may have been primary contributors to the future ILI occurrences. Concurrent changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors also impacted data fidelity, potentially amplifying reported ILI cases.
6. In summary, the reported 1867 future ILI occurrences (Week 53, 2020) can be attributed to the elevated ILI activity observed around Weeks 45–46, the steady percentage of outpatient visits for ILI, persistently high PIC mortality rates consistently above epidemic thresholds, and the influence of pandemic-driven healthcare-seeking and reporting challenges.
