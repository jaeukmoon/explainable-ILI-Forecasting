1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1762', '1753', '1592', '1546', '1391']. The ILI occurrences steadily declined week by week, from 1762 in Week21, 2023, to 1391 in Week25, 2023. This indicates a continuous decrease in ILI activity leading up to the observed period.
2. The negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the declining trajectory observed over the 5 past weeks (Week21 to Week25, 2023) aligns with the continued reduction to 1142 future occurrences after 5 weeks. The consistent decline suggests a maintained trend in reduced ILI activity over time.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI progressively declined from 1.9% in Week21, 2023, to 1.4% in Week25, 2023, with the steepest decrease apparent in Week24 and Week25 (1.5% to 1.4%). This reduction in outpatient ILI interactions reflects diminishing illness prevalence, contributing to the drop in future occurrences to 1142. SARS-CoV-2 and RSV co-circulation persisted throughout the period, with CDC reports emphasizing that these viruses likely contributed to overall ILI trends. Declining hospitalization numbers for influenza, from 927 in Week21, 2023, to 768 in Week25, 2023, highlight a significant reduction in severe influenza cases, aligning with the anticipated future decrease in ILI occurrences. Virologic testing revealed a systematic decrease in influenza positivity rates, from 1.2% in Week21, 2023, to 1.0% in Week25, 2023, reinforcing the seasonal decline in ILI-related infections, which coincides with the future reduction.
4. In summary, the future occurrence of 1142 ILI cases stems from the observed continuous decline in past ILI occurrences, reduced outpatient visits for ILI, fewer hospitalizations, decreasing influenza positivity rates, and the impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses. This downward trend aligns with the reported low influenza activity and minimal ILI engagement projected for the season.
