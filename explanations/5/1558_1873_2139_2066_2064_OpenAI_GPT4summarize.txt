1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an initial increase from 1558 (Week 44, 2020) to 2139 (Week 46, 2020), followed by a slight decline to 2064 by Week 48, 2020. These values indicate a peak in Week 46, 2020, and a stabilization at elevated levels in Weeks 47–48, 2020, reflecting a generally upward trend with a minor reduction toward the end of the observed period.  
2. A positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences. The rise in Weeks 44–46, 2020, coupled with sustained higher values in Weeks 47–48, 2020, aligns with the significant future occurrence of 2169 after 5 weeks (Week 49, 2020), suggesting that the elevated levels in the past were precursors to the continued intensity of ILI activity in the future.  
3. Increasing outpatient visits for ILI, as observed in CDC reports, grew gradually from 1.3% in Week 44, 2020, to 1.6% by Weeks 47–48, 2020. This consistent growth, despite remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%, implies a steady rise in respiratory illness activity, foreshadowing the increase in future occurrences.  
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) progressively rose, exceeding epidemic thresholds each week, climbing from 8.1% in Week 44, 2020, to 12.8% in Week 48, 2020. This persistent rise highlights respiratory illness trends that correlate with the amplified future ILI occurrences.  
5. COVID-19 and associated healthcare-seeking behavior changes notably disrupted traditional ILI surveillance. The pandemic’s overlapping symptoms and mitigation measures, such as masking, likely masked true influenza activity while amplifying nonspecific respiratory illness reporting, contributing to the future surge of 2169 occurrences.  
6. Despite unusually low influenza virus positivity rates throughout the 5 weeks (e.g., 0.1% in Weeks 44 and 48, 2020), the sustained ILI activity suggests contributions from non-specific respiratory pathogens, compounded by the pandemic’s broad impact on healthcare reporting and surveillance systems.  
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2169 (Week 49, 2020) are explained by the upward trend in Weeks 44–46, 2020, sustained elevated levels in Weeks 47–48, 2020, rising ILI-related outpatient visits, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and the compounding effects of healthcare disruptions and behavioral changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
