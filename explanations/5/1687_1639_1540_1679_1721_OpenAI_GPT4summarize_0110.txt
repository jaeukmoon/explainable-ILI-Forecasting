1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week36 to Week40, 2021 are 1687, 1639, 1540, 1679, and 1721. The trend shows slight fluctuations, with a dip from Week36 (1687) to Week38 (1540) and a gradual recovery to Week40 (1721). Overall, the ILI activity has remained low with minor variance, reflecting stability rather than any sharp increase or significant reduction.
2. Week45, 2021 falls within the Peak onset season, as it is before the typical peak season starting around Week46 in the U.S. The observed increase toward the later weeks of the provided data further supports this classification.
3. A correlation analysis of the time-series data suggests an upward trend following the dip in Week38. While ILI occurrences remained stable and slightly increased by Week40, a continuation of this slow rise over the next five weeks aligns with seasonal expectations. Therefore, projecting from these trends, the anticipated occurrence reaches 2109 for Week45, 2021.
4. Limited influenza circulation is observed nationwide, with minimal influenza testing positivity at clinical and public health laboratories (Week36-Week40, 2021 #4, #5, #1). This low prevalence reflects a still low-level flu activity consistent with the pre-peak period.
5. Healthcare-seeking behaviors influenced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic create challenges in traditional ILI surveillance systems and data interpretation (Week36-Week40, 2021 #9). This limits immediate spikes being fully attributable to influenza, with other respiratory pathogens influencing ILI activity.
6. Circulating respiratory illnesses remain attributed to non-influenza viruses rather than influenza strains, as evidenced by regional increases and outpatient visits due to other pathogens, even as influenza remains below national baselines (Week36-Week40, 2021 #2, #10).
7. Combining the stable trend in ILI occurrences, ongoing low influenza positivity, the influence of non-flu respiratory illnesses, and the classification of Week45 within the Peak onset season, the forecast of 2109 ILI occurrences aligns with gradual seasonal increases expected as ILI activity moves toward peak season levels.
