1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks depicted a consistent decline, with values decreasing sequentially from '1983' (Week 21, 2022) to '1024' (Week 25, 2022). This downward trajectory indicates a steady reduction in ILI activity, potentially signaling the seasonal decline in respiratory illness activity during this period. 

2. Despite the downward trend in past occurrences, the subsequent lower future ILI occurrence of 835 (Week 30, 2022) continues along this declining path. The consistent reduction observed over the earlier weeks (Weeks 21–25, 2022) directly correlates with the reported lower future figure, reflecting a continuation of the diminishing ILI trend.

3. Coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 remained a recurrent factor, noted in 4.4% (Week 21, 2022), 4.3% (Week 22, 2022), and 4.2% (Week 23, 2022) of influenza-positive specimens. These coinfections may have exacerbated ILI cases earlier, but a gradual reduction over weeks suggests their decreasing contribution to respiratory illness activity, corresponding with the overall ILI reduction.  
4. Healthcare-seeking behavior showed significant disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as highlighted in Weeks 24 and 25, 2022. This factor likely suppressed ILI reporting as individuals sought less outpatient care for respiratory illnesses, contributing to the observed diminishing ILI occurrences both in the past and in the future (Week 30, 2022).  
5. Influenza positivity rates declined consistently across the weeks, from 5.7% (Week 21, 2022) to 1.8% (Week 25, 2022). The sustained drop in positive detection highlights the decreasing prevalence of influenza, a major contributor to ILI occurrences, which aligns with the reduced future figure of 835 in Week 30, 2022.  

6. In summary, the reported 835 future ILI occurrences (Week 30, 2022) can be attributed to the steady downward trend observed across Weeks 21–25, 2022, reflecting declining influenza positivity rates, diminishing SARS-CoV-2 coinfections, and reduced healthcare-seeking behavior. These combined factors collectively explain the continuation of reduced ILI occurrences in Week 30, 2022.
