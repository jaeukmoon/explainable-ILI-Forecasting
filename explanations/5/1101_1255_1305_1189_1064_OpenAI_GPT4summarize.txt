1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating yet generally downward trend, with values of ['1101', '1255', '1305', '1189', '1064']. There was an increase from Week 34, 2021 (1101), peaking at 1305 in Week 36, 2021, followed by a consistent decline to 1064 by Week 38, 2021. This decline suggests diminishing ILI activity as the observed period progressed.

2. A moderate correlation is observed between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the decreasing trajectory in Weeks 37 and 38, 2021, aligns with the future ILI occurrences decreasing after 5 weeks to 1008 (Week 43, 2021). The reduction in ILI activity in the latter weeks of the past data serves as a precursor to the lower level of ILI activity observed in Week 43, 2021.

3. A continued nationwide low influenza circulation, reflected by testing positivity rates of 0.1% across Weeks 34–38, 2021, supports declining ILI activity. Contributions from respiratory illnesses due to non-influenza viruses remained a dominant factor, suppressing influenza-specific ILI trends.

4. Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline (2.6%) throughout the observed 5 weeks, ranging from 2.2% (Week 34) to 1.9% (Week 38). This continuous decline in outpatient ILI visits aligns with the reduced future ILI occurrence of 1008.

5. Weekly PIC mortality rates well above the epidemic threshold (e.g., 21.1% in Week 37, 2021) indicate ongoing respiratory illness activity dominated by COVID-19, diluting influenza-specific trends. The lack of significant influenza spread aligns with the reduced ILI occurrence projected after 5 weeks.

6. Pandemic-driven shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors and data interpretation challenges, as consistently noted in the summarized reports, introduced variability in the ILI data. This unpredictable disruption likely contributed to misaligned reporting, resulting in the moderate reduction observed in future ILI activity.

7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences (1008 by Week 43, 2021) can be attributed to a declining trend in past occurrences (Weeks 37–38), persistently low influenza circulation, declining outpatient ILI visits, the dominance of non-influenza respiratory viruses, and pandemic-induced surveillance challenges. These factors collectively created an environment of reduced ILI activity.
