1. Explanation:
1. Past ILI occurrences from Week20, 2022 to Week24, 2022 show a consistently **decreasing trend**: [1954, 2058, 1858, 1595, 1399]. After a slight rise in Week21 (2058 from 1954), the numbers decline steadily by 10.7% (from 2058 to 1858), 14.2% (from 1858 to 1595), and 12.3% (from 1595 to 1399). This pattern suggests that the region is transitioning from moderate activity to a lower activity phase, characteristic of the **off-season** for ILI occurrences.
2. Forecasting target week (Week29, 2022) falls within the **off-season**, based on typical U.S. flu season cycles and the ongoing trend. The CDC reports confirm steadily declining influenza activity during the past weeks, shown by reduced positivity rates (e.g., 5.9% in Week22 down to 2.5% in Week24), fewer outpatient ILI visits (e.g., 2.3% in Week22 decreasing to 1.9% in Week24), and waning hospitalization rates. These indicators align with the minimal transmission levels typical of the off-season.
3. Extrapolation of historical trends combined with off-season adjustments suggests that Week29 will see **further declines in ILI occurrences**, but at a slowing pace. Using a time-series model, we initially compute the percentage changes over the past weeks:
4. - Week21 to Week22: (1858 - 2058) / 2058 = -9.7%
5. - Week22 to Week23: (1595 - 1858) / 1858 = -14.2%
6. - Week23 to Week24: (1399 - 1595) / 1595 = -12.3%.
7. Averaging recent decreases gives a mean weekly decline of approximately 12.1%. Projecting this rate logarithmically over 5 weeks reduces ILI counts, while off-season adjustments further suppress this decline. A seasonality factor of +5% is added to account for slower declines in late off-season weeks.
8. Forecasted ILI for Week29 = 1399 × (1 - 0.121)^5 × (1 + 0.05) = 845 (rounded).
4. Three key CDC factors influencing this forecast:
5. 1) **Late-season influenza activity decline**: Positivity rates for influenza plummeted (e.g., from 5.9% in Week22 to 2.5% in Week24). With fewer people seeking outpatient care, virus circulation is dropping significantly, consistent with transitioning into the off-season.
6. 2) **Vaccination trends and partial vaccine match**: While vaccination uptake was encouraged, antigenic differences in H3N2 viruses may have marginally reduced vaccine efficacy. The flu season waning, however, minimizes potential secondary surges.
7. 3) **Co-circulation of respiratory viruses with declining impact**: SARS-CoV-2 and RSV were noted as contributing factors, but both showed diminishing influence by Week24, per co-infection and positivity reports (<4.3%).
5. The predicted ILI value of 845 for Week29, 2022 reflects an overall trend of declining influenza activity during the off-season, based on extrapolated time-series patterns from Week20-24, regional reporting on flu dynamics, and diminishing public health impacts of related respiratory illnesses. This value aligns with projected minimal activity phases typical for this period.
