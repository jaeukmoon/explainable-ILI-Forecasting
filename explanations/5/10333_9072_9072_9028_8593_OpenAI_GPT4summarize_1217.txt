1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values ['10333', '9072', '9072', '9028', '8593']. Starting at 10333 in Week 5, 2022, the occurrences dropped sharply to 9072 in Week 6, 2022, stabilized briefly in Week 7, 2022 (9072), and then resumed a downward trend in Weeks 8 and 9, 2022 (9028 and 8593, respectively). This consistent decline suggests a tapering of ILI activity during the observed period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is inferred by connecting the previous 5 weeks' trends to the future increase. Despite the declining pattern observed in Weeks 5–9, 2022, the presence of several predictive factors, such as rising influenza positivity rates and increasing hospitalization rates noted in the subsequent periods, likely drove the future increase to 10778 occurrences by Week 14, 2022. These shifts counteracted the downward trend, amplifying ILI activity.
3. Influenza positivity rates rose steadily, from 2.0% (Week 5, 2022) to 5.8% (Week 9, 2022). This gradual increase in flu-positive specimens over five weeks indicates growing influenza activity, which directly aligns with the spike in future ILI occurrences.
4. Hospitalizations due to influenza consistently increased, rising from a cumulative rate of 4.5 per 100,000 (Week 5, 2022) to 5.5 per 100,000 (Week 9, 2022). This sustained rise reflects a heightened burden of severe flu cases, contributing to the future surge in ILI occurrences.
5. Antigenic differences in A(H3N2) viruses, noted across Weeks 5–9, 2022, likely diminished vaccine effectiveness, thereby fueling an increase in susceptible populations and sustaining flu transmission patterns. These antigenic mismatches align with the observed rise in ILI cases after 5 weeks.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, remained a significant factor, with co-infection rates reaching approximately 6% in Week 9, 2022. The compounded effects of these respiratory pathogens intensified the burden of ILI cases over subsequent weeks.
7. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 10778 (Week 14, 2022) stem from a combination of increased influenza positivity rates, rising hospitalizations due to flu, antigenic mismatches in A(H3N2) reducing vaccine effectiveness, and co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, despite the declining trend from Weeks 5–9, 2022. These factors collectively reversed the declining trend to drive the future surge.
