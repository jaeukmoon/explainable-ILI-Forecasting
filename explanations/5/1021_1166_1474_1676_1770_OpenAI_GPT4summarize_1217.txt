1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1021', '1166', '1474', '1676', '1770']. The data reflect a steady increase week by week, starting from 1021 in Week14, 2022, and culminating at the highest value of 1770 by Week18, 2022. This trajectory demonstrates a clear and gradual rise in ILI activity during the observed period, suggesting a sustained escalation of respiratory illness during these weeks.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences. The persistent increase in the past weeks, particularly the notable rise from Week16, 2022 (1474) to Week18, 2022 (1770), provides a substantial basis for the subsequent future occurrence value of 1595 after five weeks. The sustained uptick during the past period predicts a continuation of significant ILI activity, though the slight drop to 1595 likely reflects seasonal or regional stabilization toward Week23, 2022.
3. Influenza-associated hospital admissions steadily rose each week, with cumulative hospitalization rates climbing from 8.9 per 100,000 in Week14, 2022, to 13.4 per 100,000 in Week18, 2022. Weekly hospital admissions showed no decline except in Week17, 2022, signaling amplified severe influenza activity. Outpatient respiratory illness visits for ILI grew from 2.0% in Week14, 2022, to 2.3% in Week18, 2022, consistently inching closer to the baseline nationally. The high prevalence of Influenza A(H3N2) (≥98.8% dominance across reports) is another critical factor driving increased transmissions and subsequent ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained above epidemic thresholds throughout the observed weeks, with percentages rising from 7.1% in Week14, 2022, to 7.2% in Week18, 2022. Furthermore, the aging population, particularly older adults, continued to experience disproportionate hospitalization rates, reinforcing the broader trend of heightened respiratory illness intensity.
5. In summary, the reported 1595 future ILI occurrences (Week23, 2022) are attributable to the consistent upward trend in ILI values during Weeks14–18, 2022, coupled with increasing hospitalization rates, outpatient respiratory illness visits nearing baseline thresholds, and high PIC mortality and Influenza A(H3N2) dominance. These factors collectively underline sustained high respiratory illness activity, driving the surge to 1595 occurrences.
