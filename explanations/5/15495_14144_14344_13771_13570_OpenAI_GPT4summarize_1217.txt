1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values of ['15495', '14144', '14344', '13771', '13570']. This downward trend is evident as it starts from 15495 (Week25, 2022) and decreases steadily to 13570 (Week29, 2022), reflecting overall reduction in recorded ILI activity over this period. The decline correlates with the low reported influenza activity in the corresponding weeks across multiple indicators.
2. A slightly positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is notable. Despite a declining trajectory during the past 5 weeks, the slight increase to 15614 after 5 weeks (Week34, 2022) suggests the resurgence of ILI activity. This can be attributed to residual influenza circulation and factors such as co-circulation with other respiratory viruses reported during earlier weeks.
3. Hospitalization counts began decreasing within the period, from 1307 reported in Week25, 2022, to 586 in Week29, 2022. However, residual influenza-related hospitalizations and PIC-related trends might still fuel delayed increases in ILI cases.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, climbing from 8.8% in Week26, 2022, to 9.8% in Week29, 2022. These persistent elevated PIC-related death trends point to continuing respiratory illness activity, which may contribute to a future rise in ILI occurrences.
5. Variations in healthcare-seeking behavior and co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., COVID-19 and RSV) complicates ILI data interpretation, potentially contributing to latent spikes in reported ILI occurrences, such as the increase to 15614 in Week34, 2022.
6. Geographical variations in influenza activity, including jurisdictions with moderate to high activity levels, may contribute to the observed increase in future ILI occurrences. Such localized deviations can act as drivers for overall ILI fluctuations.
7. In summary, the reported 15614 future ILI occurrences (Week34, 2022) can be attributed to the residual effect of declining trends during Weeks25–29, 2022; consistent PIC-related mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds; and the influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses and healthcare-seeking behavior disruptions impacting surveillance and reporting.
