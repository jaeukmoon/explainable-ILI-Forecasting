1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibit a consistent and significant upward trend, with values increasing from 1532 (Week 31, 2023) to 4133 (Week 35, 2023). The increase is gradual at first, rising from 1532 to 2106 (Weeks 31 to 33, 2023), followed by a steeper acceleration from 3088 to 4133 (Weeks 34 to 35, 2023). This steady growth in ILI occurrences illustrates a heightened trajectory of respiratory illness activity over the 5-week period.
2. A strong positive correlation is evident between the upward trend in past ILI occurrences and the future record of 3864 occurrences observed in Week 40, 2023. Specifically, the peak in Week 35, 2023, of 4133 occurrences acts as a precursor to the sustained, high levels observed 5 weeks later, indicating continuity or carryover of heightened respiratory illness activity.
3. Increased outpatient visits for ILI from 1.1% in Week 31, 2023, to 1.9% in Week 35, 2023, highlight a parallel rise in healthcare-seeking behaviors associated with respiratory illnesses, especially in children aged 0–4 years, whose age-specific ILI rates grew from 4.1% to 7.2% over the same period. This ongoing increase likely contributed to the future surge.
4. Elevated PIC (pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19) mortality rates, consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds (e.g., 5.9% in Week 31, 2023, to 9.6% in Week 35, 2023), serve as an indicator of sustained respiratory illness activity, indirectly fueling the future rise in ILI occurrences.
5. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses and shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors, as noted throughout Weeks 31 to 35, 2023, have disrupted traditional surveillance systems. These factors may have delayed accurate case reporting, causing underestimates during this period and contributing to concentrated or amplified reporting of ILI cases in future weeks, as seen with the jump to 3864 in Week 40, 2023.
6. Overall, the future 3864 ILI occurrences in Week 40, 2023, can be attributed to the pronounced upward trend in Weeks 31–35, 2023, increasing outpatient ILI visits in younger children, persistently elevated PIC mortality rates, and the compounding effects of respiratory virus co-circulation and healthcare shifts disrupting traditional reporting.
