1. The reported ILI counts from Week27 to Week31, 2024 are 1350, 1421, 1444, 1469, and 1509. The data shows a consistent upward trend in ILI occurrences, with weekly increases of 71, 23, 25, and 40 cases. This pattern reflects gradual growth over five consecutive weeks without any abrupt spikes or significant dips, suggesting a steady rise rather than fluctuation.
2. Week36, 2024 falls within the peak onset season. Historically, the peak onset season in the U.S. spans from approximately Week32 to Week46. Given that Week31, 2024 shows increasing ILI activity, with outpatient visits and positivity rates trending upward alongside co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, Week36, 2024 aligns with the initial phase of rising ILI activity leading into the peak season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the five-week upward trajectory (Week27–Week31, 2024) indicates a growing trend in ILI occurrences, pointing towards an ongoing increase. Extrapolating this trend forward, considering continued steady or moderate growth, leads to the projected value of 1849 ILI occurrences in Week36, 2024, consistent with this upward momentum.
4. While influenza positivity rates nationally remain low (Week27–Week31, 2024: 0.9%, 0.8%, 0.7%, 0.7%, 0.6%), the decreasing positivity does not negate the rising absolute ILI cases, as overall outpatient visits and respiratory disease activity are influenced by other factors, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2 (Week31, 2024 #8).
5. Vaccine effectiveness is strong, with circulating strains (Influenza A and B) well-matched to vaccine reference strains, and antiviral resistance remains minimal except for specific subtypes (Week27–Week31, 2024 #7–#8, #7, #8, #7, #9). However, vaccination trends are not emphasized, potentially leaving gaps in immunity affecting ILI trends.
6. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and novel influenza strains (e.g., H5, H3N2v), continues to impact respiratory illness rates, though influenza-specific positivity remains stable or low (Week27–Week31, 2024 #10, #11, #10, #10, #10). This interplay emphasizes regional variations in ILI occurrences despite low national positivity rates.
7. Considering the sustained upward ILI trend, the classification of Week36, 2024 in the peak onset season, and influencing factors such as ongoing co-circulation of respiratory viruses, limited breakthrough resistance, and moderate growth in cases, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 1849 aligns with these projections.
