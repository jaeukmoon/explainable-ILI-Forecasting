1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks revealed minor fluctuations but remained relatively stable with values ['1817', '1748', '1807', '1791', '1794']. There was a slight decrease from 1817 (Week22, 2021) to 1748 (Week23, 2021), followed by small increases in Week24 (1807) and Week26 (1794). This minimal variability indicates consistently low ILI activity without significant upward or downward trends during the observed weeks.
2. The significant rise to 3336 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week31, 2021) indicates a positive but delayed correlation with the earlier stable pattern. The slight increase seen in Weeks24 and 26 could act as the early sign of the eventual upsurge in ILI occurrences, potentially driven by unrecognized or downstream factors.
3. Nationwide outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently low at 1.2% across Weeks22–26, 2021, below the national baseline of 2.6%. This sustained baseline-level activity created a potentially suppressed environment where respiratory illnesses could later escalate.
4. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds during all 5 weeks, ranging from 7.5% in Week22 to 6.2% in Week26. Although primarily attributed to COVID-19, these elevated mortality rates reflect an overall high respiratory illness burden, creating conditions conducive to the eventual increase in ILI cases.
5. Healthcare disruptions and changes in healthcare-seeking behavior due to COVID-19, repeatedly mentioned in CDC reports (Weeks22–26), may have masked early increases in ILI cases and resulted in delayed reporting or recognition. These disruptions potentially contributed to the sudden rise in ILI cases by Week31, 2021.
6. Despite minimal influenza lab detection during Weeks22–26 (e.g., <0.1% positivity rate in Week24, 2021), the sharp increase to 3336 future occurrences suggests contributions from non-specific respiratory illnesses or other respiratory pathogens rather than influenza itself. The compounding interaction of seasonal trends, healthcare behavior, and pandemic effects likely amplified ILI reporting.
7. In summary, the rise to 3336 future ILI occurrences (Week31, 2021) can be attributed to the stable baseline activity of Weeks22–26, 2021, the persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, healthcare-seeking changes affecting surveillance, and the likelihood of non-influenza respiratory illnesses contributing to ILI data. These factors combined under pandemic-influenced dynamics to drive the eventual sharp increase in cases.
