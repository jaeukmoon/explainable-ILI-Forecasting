1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed fluctuating trends with values of ['1589', '1706', '1484', '1623', '1558']. Specifically, there was an increase from 1589 (Week 40, 2020) to 1706 (Week 41, 2020), then a decline to 1484 (Week 42, 2020), followed by an increase to 1623 (Week 43, 2020), and another slight reduction to 1558 (Week 44, 2020). While the trend is inconsistent, the overall activity remained moderate, indicating a period of fluctuation rather than a persistent rise or fall.
2. The correlation between past and future ILI occurrences suggests that despite the fluctuations, the moderate activity levels in the observed weeks acted as a precursor to the significant increase to 2078 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 49, 2020). The future rise could reflect an accumulation or delayed reporting of cases influenced by the trends observed during earlier weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI exhibited a subtle upward shift, starting at 1.1% (Week 40, 2020) and increasing to 1.3% by Week 44, 2020, though still below the baseline of 2.6%. This slight growth corresponds to heightened respiratory illness-related healthcare interactions, which could have driven the future increase in ILI activity.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained high throughout the period, increasing from 7.0% (Week 40, 2020) to 8.1% (Week 44, 2020), consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds. The elevated PIC percentages reflect ongoing respiratory illness prevalence, which aligns with the future elevation in ILI occurrences.
5. Altered healthcare-seeking behaviors amidst the COVID-19 pandemic were a recurring theme in CDC reports, impacting traditional ILI surveillance and likely underestimating trends during Weeks 40–44, 2020. This disruption could explain why ILI activity appears to surge sharply to 2078 in Week 49, 2020, as delayed or hidden cases potentially surfaced post-adjustment.
6. Despite the low percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza (e.g., 0.21% in Week 40, 2020, and 0.1% in Week 44, 2020), ongoing monitoring highlighted additional respiratory illness activity, possibly driven by non-specific ILI or other pathogens. This could have augmented ILI totals in future data.
7. In summary, the reported 2078 future ILI occurrences (Week 49, 2020) can be attributed to fluctuating ILI trends in Weeks 40–44, 2020, slight increases in ILI-related outpatient visits, continuous PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, and pandemic-driven challenges in data surveillance impacting the reporting and aggregation of ILI cases.
