1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a generally declining trend, with values of ['1881', '1698', '1711', '1731', '1685']. Week19, 2024, recorded the highest ILI occurrence at 1881, followed by a notable drop to 1698 in Week20, 2024. While Weeks21-22, 2024, showed minor fluctuations (1711 and 1731, respectively), there was a decline to 1685 by Week23, 2024. This consistent decrease indicates diminishing ILI activity during this period.
2. The decrease in past ILI occurrences appears inversely correlated with the future surge to 1025 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week28, 2024). While past weeks indicated a declining trend, the resurgence to 1025 likely reflects the multifactorial lag effects of co-circulating respiratory illnesses or other novel contributors not evident in prior data trends (Week19-23, 2024).
3. The outpatient ILI visit percentages remained below the national baseline throughout (ranging between 2.0%-1.7% from Week19 to Week23, 2024), reflecting stable but suppressed healthcare-seeking behavior for ILI. The rise to 1025 could suggest a subsequent relaxation of baseline healthcare engagement. Pediatric influenza mortality, while relatively constant, reached 175 deaths by Week23, 2024, with continued Influenza A dominance, which may influence delayed spikes in ILI reports. Co-circulating viruses like RSV and COVID-19 persisted across all reports (Week19-23, 2024), contributing variably to respiratory illness trends and potential under-recognition of specific ILI components earlier. Vaccination coverage remained aligned with circulating strains (e.g., genetic match noted Week21, 2024), minimizing immediate-seasonal flu burden but potentially leaving gaps in unvaccinated groups influencing future trends.
4. Future ILI activity fluctuating due to suppressed past surges (Weeks19-23, 2024), alongside stable yet potent co-factors like RSV, regional sensitivities, or alternate viral upticks, likely frames the upward disparity reflected by Week28 spikes.
