1. The reported ILI counts from Week18 to Week22, 2023 are 13095, 12870, 12523, 12011, and 12674. The trend shows a general decline from Week18 (13095) to Week21 (12011), followed by a small uptick in Week22 (12674). Over the five-week period, the overall pattern can be characterized as a declining trajectory with slight fluctuations, suggesting a reduction in ILI burden with no significant spikes.
2. Forecasting target week (Week27, 2023) belongs to the off-season. Based on the background knowledge that off-season in the U.S. typically spans from after the peak season until the next peak onset season, Week27 falls within this period. Moreover, summarized CDC reports from Week18 to Week22, 2023 consistently report minimal influenza positivity levels and low flu activity, supporting this classification.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the declining ILI occurrences through Week22, 2023, combined with ongoing low influenza activity, indicate a probable continuation of this downward trend into subsequent weeks. Accounting for expected fluctuations observed in the historical data and further reductions typical during the off-season, the model predicts future ILI occurrences at 7930 by Week27, 2023.
4. Nationwide influenza activity remains minimal, with positivity rates consistently near 1.0% (Week18, 2023 #1; Week19, 2023 #1; Week20, 2023 #1; Week21, 2023 #1; Week22, 2023 #1), indicating no notable surge in influenza transmission.
5. Vaccination effectiveness remains high, with a well-matched vaccine against circulating strains reported across all weeks (Week18, 2023 #9; Week19, 2023 #7; Week20, 2023 #9; Week21, 2023 #9; Week22, 2023 #10). This contributes to reducing spread and keeping ILI levels low during this time.
6. The co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, remains stable without major increases (Week18, 2023 #9; Week19, 2023 #9; Week20, 2023 #10; Week21, 2023 #8; Week22, 2023 #9). The stable presence of these viruses, alongside low influenza activity, affects respiratory illness patterns but does not trigger significant ILI spikes.
7. Given the declining ILI occurrences from Week18 through Week22, 2023, the off-season classification (Week27, 2023), the protective factors of high vaccination effectiveness, minimal influenza positivity, and steady co-circulation trends, the projected future ILI occurrence for Week27, 2023 aligns accurately with the predicted value of 7930.
