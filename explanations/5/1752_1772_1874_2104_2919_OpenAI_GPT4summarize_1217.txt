1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a significant upward trend, with values of ['1752', '1772', '1874', '2104', '2919']. Beginning with 1752 in Week48, 2021, there was a gradual increase in the first four weeks, followed by a sharp escalation to 2919 in Week52, 2021. This steep rise highlights the intensifying activity of respiratory illnesses, culminating in a significant peak at the end of the observed period.
2. A positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the upward trajectory toward Week52, 2021 strongly aligns with the decline in future occurrences (1114) after 5 weeks (Week5, 2022). The substantial peak in Week52 is reflective of heightened ILI activity, followed by the expected regression toward baseline as transmission slowed.
3. Positive influenza test rates steadily increased over the weeks, reaching 6.2% in clinical labs by Week51, 2021, before slightly declining to 3.8% in Week52, 2021. This indicates a peak in influenza activity that likely drove the heightened ILI occurrences. Outpatient visits for ILI increased throughout the period, from 2.5% in Week48 to 4.8% in Week52, 2021, signaling an intensifying trend that aligned with the observed ILI peak. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, mentioned across reports, compounded respiratory illness trends, contributing to the surge before the decline. Hospitalization rates rose significantly to 2.6 per 100,000 by Week52, 2021, reflecting severe cases likely impacting ILI reporting trends.
4. Influenza-associated pediatric deaths were minimal (two for the season), suggesting limited fatality-driven disruptions in ILI trends, while mortality attributed to PIC remained high throughout (19.9% by Week52, 2021), indicating respiratory illness impacts dominated by co-circulating pathogens like COVID-19. Declining vaccine uptake, noted consistently across the reports, could have exacerbated illness spread and contributed to the ILI peak. However, as antiviral measures and natural regression took effect, occurrences eventually dropped to 1114.
5. In summary, the reported 1114 future ILI occurrences (Week5, 2022) are primarily attributable to the sharp rise in past ILI trends peaking at 2919 in Week52, 2021, driven by increasing flu positivity, ILI outpatient visits, and PIC mortality rates. Co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, vaccination shortfalls, and natural seasonal regression likely facilitated the subsequent decline to 1114 as transmission slowed over 5 weeks.
