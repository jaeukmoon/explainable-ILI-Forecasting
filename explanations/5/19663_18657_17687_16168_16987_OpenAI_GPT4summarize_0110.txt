1. The reported ILI occurrences for Week3 to Week7, 2024 are 19663, 18657, 17687, 16168, and 16987. The trend exhibits a consistent decline from Week3 to Week6, followed by a slight rebound in Week7. This overall pattern suggests a weakening influenza spread but occasional fluctuations, indicating the end of peak activity.
2. In the U.S., the peak season generally spans from Week46 of the preceding year to approximately Week6 of the current year. Week12, 2024 occurs after the usual peak season and aligns with the transition from peak to off-season. Given the declining ILI trends and no significant spikes reported in Week7, 2024, Week12, 2024 is forecasted to belong to the off-season.
3. Historically, declining ILI occurrences in the weeks after peak typically project a stabilization or decrease in activity during the subsequent weeks. The time-series pattern from Week3 to Week7, 2024 indicates that the ILI occurrences are unlikely to rise sharply beyond occasional minor increases. Therefore, the projection for Week12, 2024 reflects a stabilized decrease with 14964 occurrences based on this historical tendency.
4. Outpatient respiratory illness visits consistently remained above baseline but only slightly fluctuated (4.3%-4.5%) in the past five weeks. This suggests steady, persistent illness activity rather than a resurgence (Week3, 2024 #5; Week4, 2024 #3; Week5, 2024 #2; Week6, 2024 #4; Week7, 2024 #4).
5. Influenza A dominance, particularly A(H1N1)pdm09 (over 60% of subtyped cases), indicates that the outbreak is driven by known strains well-matched to the vaccine (Week3, 2024 #2; Week4, 2024 #2; Week5, 2024 #3; Week6, 2024 #3; Week7, 2024 #3). This reduces the likelihood of unexpected spikes due to novel variants or mismatched viruses.
6. Vaccination coverage continues to be emphasized and has likely contributed to slowing the spread of influenza in recent weeks (Week3, 2024 #9; Week4, 2024 #7; Week5, 2024 #7; Week6, 2024 #7; Week7, 2024 #7). Although updates on rates are unspecified, the consistent recommendation indicates sustained mitigation efforts and reduced illness severity.
7. In summary, the gradual decline from Week3 to Week6, 2024, the off-season classification of Week12, 2024, current virological stability, widespread vaccination efforts, and the predictable stabilization of historical patterns justify the projection of 14964 ILI occurrences after five weeks. This forecasting reflects the natural tapering of activity as influenza moves further into the off-season.
