1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a general upward trajectory despite minor fluctuations. The values increased from 1802 (Week 43, 2021) to 2296 (Week 44, 2021) and further to 2297 (Week 45, 2021). A significant rise to 2658 (Week 46, 2021) was observed, followed by a slight decline to 2589 (Week 47, 2021). This overall growth, especially between Weeks 43–46, suggests increasing ILI activity in the observed timeframe.
2. A positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the increasing trend in Weeks 43–46, 2021, aligns with the sharp rise to 6147 future occurrences (Week 52, 2021). The upward trajectory seen in the past weeks highlights a precursor to the significant surge reported 5 weeks later.
3. Outpatient ILI visits showed consistent growth from 1.9% (Week 43, 2021) to 2.4% (Week 47, 2021), approaching the 2.5% national baseline. This steady increase mirrors the rise in ILI occurrences during subsequent weeks.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) activity gradually intensified, with positivity rates rising from 0.2% (Week 43, 2021) to 1.5% (Week 47, 2021). Most cases were observed among individuals aged 5–24 years, contributing significantly to the rise in future ILI counts.
5. Hospitalizations due to laboratory-confirmed influenza significantly increased from 282 nationwide (Week 43, 2021) to 495 (Week 47, 2021), reflecting heightened flu-related severity. Such patterns are strongly correlated with the observed future surge in ILI counts.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, alongside Influenza A(H3N2) dominance, and healthcare changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, complicated data collection and delayed case detection, potentially amplifying observed ILI counts in Week 52, 2021.
7. In summary, the reported 6147 future ILI occurrences (Week 52, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks 43–46, increasing outpatient ILI visits, rising Influenza A(H3N2) activity, surging hospitalizations, and the impacts of co-circulating respiratory illnesses and pandemic-related healthcare behaviors.
