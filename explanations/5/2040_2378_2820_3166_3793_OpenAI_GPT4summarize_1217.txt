1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent and substantial upward trend, with values of ['2040', '2378', '2820', '3166', '3793']. ILI occurrences increased each consecutive week from 2040 in Week 9, 2022, to a peak of 3793 in Week 13, 2022. This steady growth reflects an intensifying spread of influenza-like activity over the observed period.
2. A significant correlation exists between the persistent upward trajectory in past ILI data and the future ILI occurrences of 5433 after 5 weeks (Week 18, 2022). The sharp increase in Weeks 12 and 13, 2022, signals heightened transmission dynamics, providing a clear foundation for the observed spike in ILI occurrences.
3. The increasing percentages of positive influenza specimens, rising from 5.8% in Week 9 to 8.3% in Week 13, 2022, strongly align with the upward trajectory in future ILI occurrences. Sustained dominance of A(H3N2), which accounted for nearly 100% of influenza cases, coupled with its antigenic differences, contributed to increased illness and decreased vaccine effectiveness, further fueling the rise.
4. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza grew considerably, from 5.5 per 100,000 population in Week 9 to 8.0 in Week 13, 2022, reflecting amplified severe ILI cases. This mirrors the elevated future ILI activity and suggests that more intense viral transmission led to higher illness rates.
5. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, particularly SARS-CoV-2, remained a critical factor during the 5-week period. With 5.9% of influenza-positive specimens co-infected in Week 9 and similar trends through Week 13, increased respiratory illness burden compounded the ILI increases, culminating in the surge to 5433 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 18, 2022).
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 5433 (Week 18, 2022) are attributable to the consistent rise in past ILI occurrences (Weeks 9–13, 2022), the increasing influenza positivity rates and predominance of A(H3N2), rising hospitalization rates, and the co-circulation of respiratory viruses, all of which collectively fueled escalating respiratory illness activity.
