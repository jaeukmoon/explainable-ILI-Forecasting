1. The reported ILI counts from Week47 to Week51, 2021 are 1855, 2084, 2117, 2313, and 2550. The trend clearly shows a steady increase each week, indicating that influenza-like illness activity is intensifying as the season develops, with no significant drops or stabilization.
2. Week4, 2022 falls within the U.S. typical peak season window (Week46 to approximately Week6 of the following year). Considering the increasing ILI activity during the last recorded weeks of 2021, Week4, 2022 is strongly indicative of occurring during the peak season.
3. The upward progression in ILI counts observed during Week47 to Week51, 2021 suggests a continuation of this increasing trend into subsequent weeks, albeit with some moderation as peak season progresses. This indicates that after Week51, 2021, ILI occurrences are likely to stabilize or start slightly reducing by Week4, 2022, which aligns with the prediction of 1539 occurrences reflecting a tapering off from prior escalation.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including Influenza A(H3N2) and SARS-CoV-2, which persisted across all regions (Week51, 2021 #4, #9), likely contributed to increased outpatient respiratory visits and ILI occurrences.
5. Flu vaccination uptake is noted to be lower this season compared to prior years, potentially reducing collective immunity levels and contributing to sustained ILI growth, especially among vulnerable populations (Week50, 2021 #7; Week51, 2021 #8).
6. Outpatient respiratory illness visits exceeded the national baseline (from 2.4% in Week47, 2021 to 3.8% in Week51, 2021), and this consistent rise signals widespread flu activity, especially due to Influenza A(H3N2), which accounted for the vast majority of cases (Week51, 2021 #4, #9).
7. In summary, the prediction of 1539 future ILI occurrences in Week4, 2022 reflects a stabilization or slight decline from Week51, 2021, during the peak season. This trend is supported by rising influenza positivity rates, persistent co-circulating viruses, lower vaccination uptake, and widespread outpatient illness activity, which together drive sustained but tapering ILI occurrences.
