1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1259', '1042', '883', '812', '684']. Weekly data indicates a steady decline from 1259 (Week2, 2021) to 684 (Week6, 2021). This sustained decline reflects markedly reduced activity for influenza-like illnesses during the observed period.
2. A notable negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences (607, after Week11, 2021) is evident. The consistent reduction observed in past weeks aligns with a continuation of subdued ILI activity, slightly leveling at 607 occurrences, after 5 weeks without significant surges.
3. The outpatient visits for ILI, consistently below the national baseline, decreased from 1.4% (Week2, 2021) to 1.1% (Weeks5–6, 2021). This persistent low ILI visit rate supports the reduced ILI activity observed in future weeks.
4. PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19)-attributed mortality rates, despite remaining well above epidemic thresholds, exhibited gradual reductions from 14.7% (Week2, 2021) to 22.3% (Week6, 2021), influenced primarily by COVID-19 rather than influenza. This decrease aligns with reduced influenza-specific illness activity and helps explain lower future ILI occurrences.
5. Minimal influenza positivity rates, consistently at or below 0.3% in clinical and public health lab testing over the 5 weeks, demonstrate an unprecedented lack of viral activity, leading to subdued ILI levels. Additionally, low hospitalization rates (0.5-0.6 per 100,000) further confirm reduced severity and transmission.
6. The ongoing disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI surveillance led to reduced reporting and altered patterns in traditional influenza-related trends. These pandemic-driven dynamics contributed to sustained low ILI activity during the predicted future period.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 607 (Week11, 2021) can be attributed to the consistent downward trend in past time-series ILI occurrences, persistently low outpatient visit rates for ILI, minimal influenza positivity, reduced PIC mortality, low hospitalization rates, and pandemic-driven disruptions in healthcare and surveillance.
