1. The reported ILI counts from Week28 to Week32, 2023 are 1075, 1092, 1142, 1089, and 1216. The overall trend exhibits a moderate increase over the five weeks, with a subtle dip in Week31 (1089) before rising again in Week32 (1216). While these fluctuations are mild, the general upward trend suggests a potential shift into a more active phase of ILI occurrences.
2. Considering that Week37, 2023 falls within the typical Peak Onset season (which spans from approximately Week32 to Week46 in most years) and aligns with the observed gradual increase in ILI counts, it is forecasted that Week37, 2023 belongs to the Peak Onset season.
3. The past ILI trend indicates a progressive rise, particularly from Week28 to Week32, 2023. Drawing from time-series projection models, this trend supports an expectation of continued growth over the subsequent five weeks, bringing occurrences to the estimate of 1629 for Week37, 2023. Peaks typically follow such early signs of escalation, consistent with historical season progression.
4. Co-circulating respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 have continued to contribute to ILI cases, especially among vulnerable populations including children (Week28, 2023 #4, Week30, 2023 #8, Week31, 2023 #8).
5. Despite low influenza positivity rates nationwide, slight increases in outpatient respiratory visits were recorded, with particular activity in the 0-4 age group, suggesting early indicators of rising flu transmission (Week28, 2023 #4, Week32, 2023 #5).
6. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) have exceeded the epidemic threshold for several weeks, remaining a concerning factor that reflects broader disease burden amidst increasing respiratory infections (Week28, 2023 #7, Week31, 2023 #5, Week32, 2023 #6).
7. The forecasted value of 1629 ILI cases accounts for the observed upward trend in recent occurrences, the transition into the Peak Onset season, and co-factors such as respiratory co-infections and rising outpatient respiratory illness visits. The slight increase aligns with historical patterns of gradual intensification preceding the peak season.
