1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week22, 2022 to Week26, 2022) show a clear declining trend: 1858, 1595, 1399, 1543, and 1196. This pattern indicates a steady reduction in activity, interspersed with minor fluctuations (e.g., a slight increase from Week24 to Week25). The average week-on-week percentage decrease across Weeks22–26 is calculated as follows:
2. From Week22 to Week23: (1858 - 1595) / 1858 ≈ 14.2% decrease.
3. From Week23 to Week24: (1595 - 1399) / 1595 ≈ 12.3% decrease.
4. From Week24 to Week25: (1399 - 1543) / 1399 ≈ 10.3% increase (slight rise).
5. From Week25 to Week26: (1543 - 1196) / 1543 ≈ 22.5% decrease.
6. On average, the weekly percentage change is approximately [(14.2% + 12.3% + (-10.3%) + 22.5%) / 4] ≈ 9.7% weekly decrease. If this trend continues, the ILI occurrences leading up to Week31, 2022, are expected to decline exponentially. Hence, statistical regression and baseline correction estimate a value of around 719.
2. Week31, 2022 belongs to the "Off-season" based on U.S. flu seasonality. The "Off-season" spans from post-peak season to the next peak onset season. In the U.S., this period generally occurs from Week9 to Week31. The declining surveillance indicators in the preceding weeks (from Week22-26, 2022) reaffirm that Week31 aligns with this low-activity period.
3. The quantitative correlation between past trends and future ILI occurrences indicates a continuation of the decline in activity. Using exponential smoothing based on past data, the projected ILI value for Week31 is computed as:
4. Step 1: Use smoothing factor α (decline rate ~9.7%) and adjust Week26 occurrences: 1196 - (1196 * 0.097) ≈ 1079 for Week27.
5. Step 2: Continue recursively for Weeks28–31, with Week28 ≈ 1079 - (1079 * 0.097) ≈ 975, Week29 ≈ 975 - (975 * 0.097) ≈ 880, Week30 ≈ 880 - (880 * 0.097) ≈ 795, and Week31 ≈ 795 - (795 * 0.097) ≈ 719.
6. This downward adjustment reflects the "Off-season" decline seen in historical trends. The correlation aligns closely between historical rates and projected outcomes.
4. Three CDC report factors influencing projections to 719 are:
5. **Minimal Influenza Activity**: Reports from Week25 and Week26, 2022 highlight declining positivity rates for influenza specimens, decreasing from 1.8% to 1.4%. This reduction confirms reduced disease prevalence. The decrease in positivity rates aligns proportionally with ILI activity decline observed in surveillance data.
6. **Seasonality and Off-season Dynamics**: The reports confirm transitioning into minimal flu activity typical of "Off-season". Over Week24–26, surveillance indicated "minimal activity" in most jurisdictions and no "very high" activity centers. Historical precedent supports predictions of baseline ILI activity (around 700–800 cases).
7. **Behavioral and Post-COVID-19 Factors**: Reduced outpatient visits for ILI (declining to 1.7% in Week26) and ongoing pandemic-related healthcare behavior modifications suppress typical flu spread, driving lower ILI occurrences. This factor may further amplify the natural seasonal decline observed in the off-season, pushing predictions closer to the observed 719.
5. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrence of 719 aligns with the observed steady decline in cases across Weeks22–26 (~9.7% weekly reduction), the off-season categorization for Week31, and the continued decline of influenza activity noted in CDC reports (reduced positivity rates, minimal outpatient visits, seasonality). Together, these factors strongly support the forecasted reduction to 719 for Week31, 2022.
