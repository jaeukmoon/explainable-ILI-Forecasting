1. The reported ILI counts from Week42 to Week46, 2021 are 1785, 1829, 2107, 2109, and 2190. This shows a consistent upward trend, with a marked increase starting from Week44 (2107) to Week46 (2190). The week-on-week growth indicates a gradual escalation in ILI occurrences as the season progresses toward its peak activity.
2. Week51, 2021 falls within the peak season, consistent with U.S. epidemiological patterns where the highest intensity of ILI activity typically occurs between Week46 and Week6 of the following year. The upward trend and increasing laboratory-confirmed cases support this classification.
3. Time-series analysis suggests continued growth in ILI occurrences over the next five weeks. The transition from relatively low ILI occurrences (below baseline) in Week42, 2021 to sustained increases through Week46, 2021 aligns with a seasonal progression toward peak activity. Extrapolating the established trend predicts a further rise, yielding an estimated 2550 for Week51, 2021.
4. CDC reports show a rising proportion of Influenza A(H3N2), which dominates current influenza detections (Week43, 2021 #3; Week46, 2021 #3). The age group most affected (5–24 years) is known for higher interaction rates, facilitating faster virus transmission and ILI increases (Week44, 2021 #5; Week46, 2021 #10).
5. As of Week46, 2021, ILI visits increased to 2.2%, nearing the national baseline of 2.5% (Week46, 2021 #4). This uptick in outpatient respiratory illness reflects rising community transmission levels, which can contribute to higher ILI occurrences in subsequent weeks.
6. The ongoing co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, complicates trends and may amplify ILI cases (Week44, 2021 #10; Week45, 2021 #10; Week46, 2021 #10). Additionally, the H1 variant reported in Week46, 2021, although with no sustained transmission, signals potential novel virus dynamics influencing ILI projections (Week46, 2021 #8).
7. In summary, the rise in ILI activity, dominant spread of Influenza A(H3N2), increasing outpatient visits, and co-circulation of respiratory viruses collectively drive the forecast of 2550 ILI occurrences for Week51, 2021, consistent with the peak season.
