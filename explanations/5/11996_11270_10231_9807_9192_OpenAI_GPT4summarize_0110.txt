1. The reported ILI counts from Week22 to Week26, 2024 are 11996, 11270, 10231, 9807, and 9192. The trend shows a consistent decline over the five weeks, with a gradual decrease in ILI occurrences. This suggests a steady waning of influenza activity, indicative of off-season dynamics where overall ILI reports remain low and tapering. No significant spikes or deviations were noted.
2. Week31, 2024 falls within the off-season, as it occurs after the peak season (around Week06, 2024) and remains within the typical low influenza activity period between Week09, 2024 and Week31, 2024, as supported by CDC observations of low ILI activity across the previous weeks.
3. From a time-series perspective, the continuous weekly decreases from Week22 to Week26, 2024 indicate a gradual tapering trend in ILI occurrences. Projecting this pattern forward five weeks suggests that ILI levels will continue to decline but eventually stabilize around lower levels. This trajectory matches the predicted value of 7139 ILI occurrences for Week31, 2024.
4. National influenza activity remains low, with respiratory specimen positivity rates steadily declining from 1.8% in Week22, 2024 to 1.0% in Week26, 2024, along with consistently low hospitalization and outpatient respiratory illness visit rates (Week22, 2024 #1, #4, #5; Week23, 2024 #1, #6; Week26, 2024 #1, #4, #6).
5. Vaccination trends are stable, with CDC recommending annual vaccination, and genetic characterization showing circulating viruses closely match vaccine strains, ensuring effective immunoprotection (Week22, 2024 #13; Week23, 2024 #8; Week25, 2024 #9).
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including influenza, COVID-19, and RSV, influences ILI activity, but no novel influenza viruses show sustained human-to-human transmission, and influenza resistance to antivirals remains minimal (Week22, 2024 #10; Week25, 2024 #7; Week26, 2024 #9).
7. Given the declining ILI trend, the classification of Week31, 2024 as off-season, the effectiveness of vaccines, and the absence of notable adverse factors such as novel variants or widespread antiviral resistance, the predicted 7139 occurrences for Week31, 2024 align with seasonal norms and the expected stabilization of influenza activity at low levels.
