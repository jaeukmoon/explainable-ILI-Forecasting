1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks fluctuated with values of ['2067', '1800', '1802', '2296', '2297']. A noticeable decline occurred from Week 41, 2021 (2067) to Week 42, 2021 (1800), followed by a slight increase between Week 42, 2021 (1800) and Week 43, 2021 (1802). The final two weeks, from Week 43 to Week 45, 2021, exhibited a pronounced upward trend, from 2296 to 2297, signaling an overall increase in ILI activity towards the end of the 5-week period.
2. A direct relationship between the past and future data is observed, as the upward trajectory in the later weeks (Weeks 44 and 45, 2021) anticipates the reported jump to 3957 future ILI occurrences at Week 50, 2021. The notable increase in Weeks 44 and 45 hints at the onset of amplified activity, which correlates with the reported future spike.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily increased, from 1.8% in Week 41, 2021, to 2.1% by Week 44, 2021, maintaining this level in Week 45, 2021. This upward trend in healthcare visits due to respiratory illnesses reflects heightened ILI activity, contributing to the sharp rise in future occurrences.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) predominantly affected the 5–24 age group, with outbreak clusters like the one in Michigan documented in Week 44, 2021. These localized surges potentially fueled broader increases in ILI activity and future ILI data.
5. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, as noted throughout the 5 weeks, interacted with ongoing healthcare disruptions due to COVID-19. These complexities introduced variability in traditional ILI trends, influencing an eventual spike to 3957 occurrences in Week 50, 2021.
6. Despite low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.2% in Week 41, 2021, and 0.7% in Week 45, 2021), the gradual rise in ILI occurrences aligns with broader respiratory disease dynamics, suggesting contributions from non-influenza pathogens or behavioral reporting shifts impacting ILI data.
7. In summary, the future count of 3957 ILI occurrences (Week 50, 2021) stems from the increasing trend evident in Weeks 44–45, 2021, correlated outpatient ILI visit growth, outbreak influences in specific age groups, respiratory virus co-circulation, and the compounded effects of pandemic-induced healthcare and reporting disruptions.
