1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 observed weeks reveal a steady and consistent upward trend, starting at 1887 (Week 37, 2021) and increasing consecutively to 1889 (Week 38, 2021), 1978 (Week 39, 2021), 2037 (Week 40, 2021), and 2067 (Week 41, 2021). This progression indicates heightened respiratory illness activity over time, suggesting increased vulnerability to future ILI surges.

2. A clear positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences. The consistent upward trajectory in the past ILI data (Weeks 37–41, 2021), peaking at 2067 in Week 41, aligns proportionally with the sharp rise to 2658 in occurrences 5 weeks later (Week 46, 2021). The continued upward trend in the observations directly hints at sustained or amplified ILI patterns into the future.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable but consistently below the national baseline (e.g., 2.1% in Week 37, 1.9% in Weeks 38–40, and 1.8% in Week 41, 2021). However, increases in non-influenza respiratory illnesses, as noted across several CDC reports, likely influenced the future surge in ILI cases.  
   - Persistent PIC mortality percentages significantly exceeded epidemic thresholds every week (e.g., 21.1% in Week 37, 20.9% in Week 38, 18.7% in Week 39, 18.0% in Week 40, and 17.5% in Week 41, 2021), suggesting widespread respiratory illness-related deaths, which correlate with increased ILI activity.  
   - The ongoing impact of healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as highlighted across all reports, disrupted traditional surveillance and likely delayed recognition of respiratory illnesses, contributing to the future spike in ILI cases.  
   - Despite limited lab-confirmed influenza circulation (e.g., 0.1% positivity from clinical labs in Weeks 40–41, 2021), increases in respiratory illnesses attributed to non-influenza pathogens (e.g., RSV or rhinoviruses) were noted in CDC reports, indicating their significant influence on the elevated future ILI occurrences.

4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2658 (Week 46, 2021) are driven by the observed steady upward trend in past ILI counts (Weeks 37–41, 2021), consistently high PIC mortality percentages, disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the predominance of non-influenza respiratory pathogens contributing to heightened ILI activity.
