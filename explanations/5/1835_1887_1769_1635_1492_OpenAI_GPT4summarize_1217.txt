1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a clear declining trend, with values ['1835', '1887', '1769', '1635', '1492']. There was an initial slight rise from 1835 (Week 17, 2024) to 1887 (Week 18, 2024), followed by a consistent decline in subsequent weeks, reaching 1492 in Week 21, 2024, the lowest in the observed period. This trend reflects a steady reduction in ILI activity throughout the 5-week period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent, where the continuous decrease observed during Weeks 19–21, 2024, aligns with a significantly reduced future ILI occurrence of 835 by Week 26, 2024. The sustained downward trend across Weeks 19–21 acts as a precursor to the markedly low future ILI activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently declined from 2.2% in Week 17, 2024, to 1.9% in Week 21, 2024, remaining below the national baseline throughout this period. This reduction in healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory illnesses corresponds to the significant drop in future ILI occurrences.
4. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza steadily decreased, from 3.9% in Week 17, 2024, to 1.7% in Week 21, 2024. This declining positivity rate mirrors the continuous decline in ILI occurrences and indicates diminished influenza activity contributing to the reduced future ILI count.
5. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, was documented across all weeks but showed declining impacts on respiratory illness trends. This multifactorial respiratory illness environment, combined with declining influenza activity, explains the observed low future ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the low future ILI occurrences of 835 (Week 26, 2024) can be attributed to the consistent declining trend in Weeks 18–21, 2024, reduced outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses, declining positivity in respiratory specimens, and diminishing impacts of co-circulating respiratory viruses. These combined trends forecast the significantly diminished ILI activity reported in the future data.
