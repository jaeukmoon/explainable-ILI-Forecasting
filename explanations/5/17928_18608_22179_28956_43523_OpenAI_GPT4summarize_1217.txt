1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show a dramatic upward trend, increasing from 17928 (Week48, 2021) to 43523 (Week52, 2021). This consistent and sharp rise reflects escalating respiratory illness activity, which peaked in Week52, 2021, demonstrating a pronounced increase in ILI occurrences over the observed period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences. The significant rise during Weeks50-52, 2021, where values reached 43523 in Week52, preceded the sharp decline to 10333 after 5 weeks (Week5, 2022). The steep climbs in the past weeks likely led to a peak, followed by a natural decline post-peak, correlating with the reduced future occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness steadily grew every week, reaching 4.8% in Week52, 2021, above baseline levels. This sustained upward trend suggests a higher volume of ILI cases, fueling the initial peak and contributing to subsequent correction in future weeks.
4. Hospitalization rates, which rose substantially from 1.4 per 100,000 in Week50 to 2.6 per 100,000 by Week52, 2021, mirror the steep rise in ILI cases. The increased healthcare strain and hospitalization surges indicate intensified transmission, likely followed by a natural decline reflected in the future ILI occurrences.
5. Low flu vaccination uptake observed across all 5 weeks suggests a reduced mitigation effect, leading to widespread influenza transmission and rising ILI occurrences, peaking in Week52, 2021, and subsequently declining to 10333 after 5 weeks in alignment with the waning flu wave.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, complicated case recognition and exacerbated respiratory illness trends during Weeks48-52, 2021. The interplay of these viruses likely intensified rates initially, leading to eventual stabilization by Week5, 2022.
7. In summary, the decrease to 10333 ILI occurrences (Week5, 2022) stems from the sharp escalation in Weeks48-52, 2021, which peaked at 43523 (Week52, 2021). This was driven by increased outpatient visits, higher hospitalization rates, low vaccination rates, and co-circulating respiratory viruses. The natural post-peak decline reflects this shift in future occurrences.
