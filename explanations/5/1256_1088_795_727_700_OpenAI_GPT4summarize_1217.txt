1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show a consistent decline, with values of ['1256', '1088', '795', '727', '700']. Starting at 1256 in Week 16, 2024, the numbers decreased steadily to 1088 in Week 17, 2024, then dropped further to 795 in Week 18, 2024, 727 in Week 19, 2024, and reached 700 in Week 20, 2024. This pattern indicates a sustained reduction in ILI activity over the observed period.
2. The significant drop in ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks correlates with the future decline to 372 occurrences by Week 25, 2024. The observed downward trend during the previous weeks aligns with the continuation of reduced ILI activity observed after 5 weeks, reflecting a prolonged period of decreasing illness prevalence.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable at 2.3% in Week 16, 2.2% in Week 17, and gradually decreased to 2.1%, 2.0%, and 2.0% in Weeks 18–20, 2024. This consistent reduction corresponds closely with the decline in ILI occurrences and supports the future low value of 372 occurrences.
4. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza decreased from 4.8% in Week 16 to 2% in Week 20, 2024, suggesting declining viral activity as a major factor in reducing future ILI occurrences. Similarly, deaths attributed to influenza dropped from 0.3% in Week 16 to 0.1% in Week 20, reflecting diminished severity and prevalence.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, remained a contributing factor but appeared to have reduced impact toward the latter weeks as flu activity reached consistently low levels. This declining influence likely contributed to the lower future ILI occurrences of 372.
6. In summary, the reported 372 future ILI occurrences (Week 25, 2024) can be attributed to the sustained decline in ILI occurrences over the prior weeks, supported by consistent decreases in outpatient visits, reduced influenza positivity rates, and stabilization of overall respiratory virus activity, culminating in significantly lower illness prevalence.
