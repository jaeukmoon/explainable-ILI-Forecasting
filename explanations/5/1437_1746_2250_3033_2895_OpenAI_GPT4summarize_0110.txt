1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week50, 2021 to Week2, 2022 are 1437, 1746, 2250, 3033, and 2895. The trend indicates a sharp and steady increase from Week50, 2021 (1437) to Week1, 2022 (3033), followed by a slight decrease in Week2, 2022 (2895). This suggests that ILI activity peaked in Week1, 2022, then exhibited a slight decline, reflecting the waning phase of intensified influenza activity.
2. Forecasting the target week (Week7, 2022) belongs to the off-season because, per U.S. conventions, the peak season typically spans from Week46 of the previous year through Week6 of the current year. Since Week7, 2022 falls just after this peak season boundary, the forecast aligns with off-season designations.
3. Correlation analysis suggests that historical influenza activity during peak weeks (e.g., Week50, 2021 to Week2, 2022) often transitions to significantly lower ILI occurrences as activity subsides in off-season weeks. The decline observed in Week2, 2022 (2895) provides a foundation for projecting a sharper reduction in ILI counts by Week7, 2022, consistent with the seasonal shift.
4. Lower influenza positivity (Week1, 2022 #2; Week2, 2022 #2) suggests diminishing virus circulation, with clinical lab positivity declining from 2.2% in Week1, 2022 to 98.6% of samples being Influenza A (Week2, 2022). This indicates reduced transmissibility.
5. Lower flu vaccination rates this season (Week50, 2021 #7; Week1, 2022 #8; Week2, 2022 #7) continue to affect community protection despite vaccine availability. The ongoing antigenic evolution of Influenza A(H3N2) (Week50, 2021 #10; Week1, 2022 #9) may limit its season-ending effectiveness.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, complicate the assessment of ILI activity (Week50, 2021 #9; Week2, 2022 #10). However, their relative contributions appear stable, without noteworthy spikes likely to drive ILI occurrences sharply upward.
7. The projected ILI count of 870 for Week7, 2022 reflects the alignment of historical ILI trends transitioning into the off-season, reduced virus positivity, waning vaccination protection, and stable co-circulating trends. These factors collectively support a substantial reduction from peak-season levels.
