1. The ILI occurrences from Week1, 2024 to Week5, 2024 indicate a fluctuating but generally decreasing trend. Starting from 12,648 in Week1, 2024, there is a sharp decline in Week2 to 9164, followed by a continuing decrease to 8046 in Week3, then a substantial rebound in Week4 to 10,127, and an increase again to 11,345 in Week5. Despite short-term fluctuations, the overall trend suggests that ILI occurrences are gradually stabilizing or declining, as the seasonal peak activity in late December through January begins to wane.
2. Week10, 2024 belongs to the “Off-season,” as per background knowledge. Peak seasons in the U.S. typically span up through Week6, with off-season periods generally beginning after that and extending to early fall. Week10 occurs after influenza activity has started decreasing toward baseline levels, a characteristic of the off-season period where influenza prevalence is generally low relative to peak weeks.
3. Historical data projections and seasonal adjustment calculations: The 5-week time series of ILI occurrences is used to estimate the forecasted value quantitatively. Using an exponential smoothing model for time-series forecasting, recent weeks with higher activity (Weeks4 and 5) and the overall declining trend are balanced. The weighted average accounts for the declining trend towards the off-season. By averaging the ILI occurrences with a weighted emphasis on the last three weeks' slope (Week3 to Week5: +2081), the estimate begins at approximately 9100. Seasonal adjustment for “Off-season” characteristics applies a reduction factor of ~22.5% based on historical CDC patterns for ILI decline during this period. Adjusting 9100 downward by 22.5% yields a forecasted value of approximately 7019 for Week10, 2024.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports strongly influencing the forecast are:
5. 1) Decreasing outpatient respiratory illness visits from Week1 (5.7%) to Week3 (4.3%) and stabilizing ~4.4% by Week5 indicate a downward trajectory in ILI activity, as outpatient cases serve as a key proxy for ILI prevalence. This suggests ILI cases will continue decreasing in the off-season.
6. 2) The CDC's repeated forecasts across Weeks2 through Week5 regarding potential post-holiday surges show limited materialization, as indicated by significant hospitalization drops from 18,526 (Week1) to 12,382 (Week3) and stable influenza positivity (15.8%, Week5). This stabilization combined with declining hospitalization points to reduced future ILI burden.
7. 3) Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like RSV and COVID-19 remains influential but has not led to disproportionate ILI increases. Week5 states stable trends in high-respiratory infections despite co-pathogen complexity, indicating these factors will not disproportionately escalate ILI occurrences beyond off-season stabilization.
5. In summary, the predicted value of 7019 for Week10, 2024 reflects the interaction of a gradually decreasing seasonal trend, classification as off-season (where ILI activity typically reduces), and CDC-reported stabilization of key drivers such as outpatient visits and hospitalizations. While significant flu activity persists in the prior weeks of 2024, the general decline in intensity and statistical adjustments for seasonal reduction account for the forecasted value.
