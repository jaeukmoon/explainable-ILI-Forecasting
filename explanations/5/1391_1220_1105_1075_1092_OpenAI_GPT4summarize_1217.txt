1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but overall declining trend, with values of ['1391', '1220', '1105', '1075', '1092']. There was a sharp initial decrease from 1391 (Week25, 2023) to 1220 (Week26, 2023), followed by consecutive smaller declines to 1105 (Week27, 2023) and 1075 (Week28, 2023). However, Week29, 2023 showed a slight rebound to 1092. This pattern reflects a tapering trend with minor variability toward the end of the observed period.
2. A moderately positive correlation exists between the declining trend in past ILI occurrences and the future value of 1227, with the slight rebound in Week29, 2023 potentially marking the start of a reversal toward higher ILI activity. The observed stabilization in the last week of the period aligns with an uptick in the reported future ILI numbers.
3. Hospitalizations for influenza showed a consistent decrease over the weeks, from 768 (Week25, 2023) to 573 (Week29, 2023). However, this trend aligns with the anticipated rise in respiratory illnesses due to co-circulating viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 (highlighted in Weeks27–29, 2023), which may explain the future increase in ILI activity.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained consistently near or above epidemic thresholds, fluctuating marginally from 6.2% (Week25, 2023) to 5.6% (Week29, 2023). This persistent PIC mortality reflects a sustained burden of respiratory illnesses, aligning with the rise to 1227 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
5. Minimal but consistent levels of influenza activity, with Influenza A ((H1N1)pdm09) dominating, combined with co-circulation of other respiratory viruses (Weeks25–29, 2023), underscore non-specific respiratory illness activity. This factor, coupled with the CDC's emphasis on respiratory infections in younger age groups, explains the upward shift in future ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence of 1227 (Week34, 2023) can be attributed to the observed stabilization of past ILI data, persistent PIC mortality near or above epidemic thresholds, co-circulation of pathogens other than influenza, and the gradual resurgence of respiratory illness activity suggested by Week29, 2023 trends.
