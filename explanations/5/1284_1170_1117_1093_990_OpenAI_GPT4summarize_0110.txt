1. The past ILI occurrences from Week2, 2021 (1284) to Week6, 2021 (990) show a consistent downward trend without significant fluctuations. This steady decline indicates low transmission levels and reduced influenza activity over the observed five weeks.
2. Week11, 2021 falls within the off-season because the typical peak season in the U.S. generally spans from Week46 to Week6, and the observed ILI occurrences and positivity rates remain unusually low during the weeks leading up to Week11, 2021.
3. From the time-series perspective, the steady decrease in ILI occurrences observed between Week2, 2021 and Week6, 2021 suggests that the ILI incidence is likely to stabilize at a lower level in the following weeks. Based on this trend, the projected occurrence for Week11, 2021 is approximately 1099 as activity levels stabilize.
4. Positivity rates for influenza remained exceptionally low across all clinical and public health labs, with just 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, and no sharp increase expected in the coming weeks (Week2–Week6, 2021).
5. Vaccination efforts continued with CDC recommendations; however, no significant increases in vaccination uptake were reported during this period, suggesting no major shifts in immunity levels were achieved (Week2–Week6, 2021).
6. Overall influenza spread was minimal with 0.5–0.6 cumulative hospitalization rates per 100,000 population, the lowest since 2005, pointing to limited severe influenza cases or transmission during these weeks (Week2–Week6, 2021).
7. Considering the observed consistent decline in ILI occurrences, the classification of Week11, 2021 as off-season, the influence of low community influenza positivity rates, stable vaccination levels, and historically low hospitalization rates, the prediction of 1099 ILI occurrences is justified as reflecting a stabilized state in line with observed minimal influenza activity.
