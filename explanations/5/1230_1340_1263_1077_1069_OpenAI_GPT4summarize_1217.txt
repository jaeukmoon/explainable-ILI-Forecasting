1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but overall downward trend, with values of ['1230', '1340', '1263', '1077', '1069']. There was an initial increase from 1230 (Week48, 2020) to 1340 (Week49, 2020), which was followed by a decline to 1263 (Week50, 2020), 1077 (Week51, 2020), and 1069 (Week52, 2020). This consistent decrease in the latter weeks suggests reduced ILI activity by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A negative correlation between past ILI occurrences and the future value of 757 is evident. The steady decline in ILI activity observed during Weeks50–52, 2020, aligns with the eventual drop to 757 after 5 weeks, indicating a continuation of the downward trend in ILI occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable across Weeks48–52, 2020, at 1.6%, below the national baseline of 2.6%. This stagnation suggests low and stable respiratory illness activity, correlating with the decline to 757 future ILI occurrences.
4. Low influenza virus positivity rates, observed at 0.1% (Week48), 0.2% (Week49), and 0.3% (Weeks50–52), indicate minimal influenza circulation during this period. This low prevalence of the influenza virus likely contributed to the continued decrease in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavioral changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, mentioned as impacting surveillance across Weeks48–52, 2020, likely suppressed traditional flu-related ILI reporting. These disruptions further explain the observed drop to 757 ILI occurrences in the future weeks.
6. Despite stable PIC mortality percentages above the epidemic threshold (e.g., 12.8% in Week48, 14.3% in Week49, and 13.6% in Weeks51–52), the primary driver was COVID-19 rather than influenza. This reflects low flu-related ILI activity during the observation period, which aligns with the lower future ILI value.
7. In summary, the reduction to 757 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks can be attributed to the downward trend in past ILI occurrences, stable and low ILI outpatient visit percentages, minimal influenza circulation, persistent pandemic-driven surveillance disruptions, and non-influenza-related PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds.
