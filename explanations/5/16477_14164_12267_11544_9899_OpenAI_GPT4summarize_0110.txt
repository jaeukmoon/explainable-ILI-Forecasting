1. The ILI occurrences from Week10, 2024 (16477) to Week14, 2024 (9899) show a consistent decline over the 5-week period. The sharpest drop occurred between Week11 (14164) and Week12 (12267). This decreasing trend signifies a waning phase of influenza activity, without any significant fluctuations or rebounds.
2. Based on influenza seasonality in the U.S., the target Week19, 2024 falls within the off-season, as it is long after the typical peak season (Week46 to Week6) and aligns with the observed declining ILI activity indicative of reduced transmission and spread (Week10-14, 2024 reports).
3. The consistent decline in ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks suggests a progressively diminishing level of disease transmission. By applying a time-series projection, the continuation of this downward trend points to the expectation of lower ILI occurrences around 4658 by Week19, 2024, reaching the lower seasonal baseline.
4. The decreasing positivity rates for respiratory specimens for influenza from Week10, 2024 (15.4%) to Week14, 2024 (7.7%) (Week10-Week14, 2024 #1) highlight a reduction in active viral transmission. Regions also report stable or declining activity (Week11, 2024 #1; Week12, 2024 #10; Week14, 2024 #10).
5. Influenza vaccination remains effective against circulating strains, with high vaccine uptake and genetic matches offering community protection (Week10, 2024 #10; Week12, 2024 #9; Week14, 2024 #7). This reduces the susceptibility to infection and supports lower transmission as the season wanes.
6. Co-circulation of RSV, COVID-19, and influenza (Week10, 2024 #11; Week13, 2024 #11; Week14, 2024 #8) introduces a potential complication in respiratory illness trends, but no significant resurgence of ILI has been recorded. Additionally, antiviral resistance remains low (Week10, 2024 #8; Week13, 2024 #10).
7. In summary, the declining ILI occurrences, alignment with off-season patterns, effective vaccination coverage, and low antiviral resistance collectively support a reduction to baseline levels. Accordingly, the ILI forecast for Week19, 2024 is reasonably projected at 4658 cases.
