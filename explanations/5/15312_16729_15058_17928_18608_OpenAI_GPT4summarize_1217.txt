1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall upward trend, with values of ['15312', '16729', '15058', '17928', '18608']. While Week45 (2021) experienced initial growth from 15312 to 16729 in Week46 (2021), there was a slight dip to 15058 in Week47 (2021). However, significant increases followed, with notably higher values of 17928 in Week48 (2021) and 18608 in Week49 (2021), indicating a progressive escalation in ILI activity across the timeframe.
2. A positive correlation is apparent between past and future ILI occurrences, as the marked rise in ILI counts in the latter weeks of the past data (Weeks48–49, 2021) foreshadowed the future surge of 26625 ILI cases. The accelerating upward trend in Weeks48 and 49 aligns closely with the substantial increase reported 5 weeks later.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently showed growth, from 2.1% in Week45 (2021) to 2.2% in Week46, further increasing to 2.4% in Week47 and reaching the national baseline of 2.5% in Week48, finally surpassing it at 2.7% in Week49. This continuous rise reflects increasing respiratory illness rates and aligns with the future spike in ILI cases.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained persistently high across the period, climbing from 14.4% in Week45 to 17.4% in Week49. These figures consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds and signal heightened severe respiratory illness activity, contributing to the future surge in ILI cases.
5. Influenza A(H3N2), predominantly affecting younger age groups (ages 5–24) and gradually spreading to older adults by Week48–49 (2021), saw increasing dominance. This age-group shift, coupled with co-circulating respiratory viruses, indicated broader and escalating flu activity, further substantiating the rise to 26625 future cases.
6. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the pandemic compounded the complexity of ILI data interpretation during these weeks. Such factors likely contributed to delayed detection and intensified the apparent ILI increase reflected in the future data.
7. In summary, the rise to 26625 ILI cases (Week5, 2022) reflects the sharp upward trajectory in Weeks48–49 (2021), increased ILI-related outpatient visits, sustained high PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, the expanding impact of Influenza A(H3N2), and the pandemic-driven challenges of healthcare-seeking behavior and respiratory illness surveillance during the observed period.
