1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a steady decline, with values of ['14942', '14370', '13379', '13307', '12757']. This decreasing trend indicates a consistently weakening ILI activity over the observed weeks, reaching the lowest level (12757) by Week16, 2023, compared to the starting value (14942) in Week12, 2023.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the steady decline in the observed data (Weeks12–16, 2023) aligns with the subsequent drop to 12011 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week21, 2023). The past data's consistent downward trend supports a continuation of reduced ILI activity into future weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained below the baseline of 2.5% throughout the 5-week period, declining from 2.3% (Week12, 2023) to 1.9% (Week16, 2023). This diminishing outpatient ILI activity directly aligns with the lower future occurrence of ILI cases (12011). Elevated deaths attributed to PIC persistently surpassed the epidemic threshold (e.g., 8.3% in Week12, 7.5% in Week16, 2023), reflecting sustained respiratory-related severity, potentially limiting susceptibility to increased ILI activity. Influenza positivity rates remained exceptionally low during the 5-week period, ranging from 0.9% (Week12, 2023) to 0.8% (Week16, 2023), signifying limited influenza transmission, further reducing future ILI incidents. Stable antiviral susceptibility and vaccination coverage throughout the 5-week period ensured adequate mitigation of influenza activity, evidenced by matching vaccine strains to circulating viruses (Week16, 2023), maintaining low future occurrences. Ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, notably SARS-CoV-2, may have indirectly influenced overall healthcare-seeking behavior and reduced specificity in recorded ILI cases, contributing to the lower future ILI occurrences.
4. The reported future ILI occurrence of 12011 (Week21, 2023) is explained by the downward trend in past ILI data, below-baseline levels of outpatient visits for ILI, persistently elevated PIC mortality, and minimal influenza positivity. Effective vaccination coverage and antiviral susceptibility also played a role in mitigating future ILI spread alongside reduced respiratory illness activity. The synergistic effects of these factors solidify the observed decline in ILI occurrences into the future.
