1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values of ['1212', '1308', '1174', '1129', '1097'], indicating a downward trend in ILI activity. The highest value occurred during Week9, 2023 (1308), followed by a steady decrease to 1097 in Week13, 2023. This continuous decline suggests a gradual reduction in reported ILI cases over the observed period.
2. The future ILI occurrences (850 by Week18, 2023) show a correlation with the declining trend in past ILI activity. The consistent week-on-week decrease in reported cases from Week9 to Week13 aligns with the lower final value (1097) in Week13, which precedes the continued decline to 850 occurrences after 5 weeks. This illustrates the persistence of the downward trend.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently decreased, moving from 2.4% in Week9, 2023, to 2.3% by Week12–13. These values remained below the national baseline of 2.5%, reflecting stable or slightly diminished respiratory illness activity that likely contributed to the continued decline.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained elevated but showed a subtle decrease over time, declining from 8.9% in Week9 to 7.9% in Week13. Although still above epidemic thresholds, this gradual reduction in PIC-related mortality reflects a slight easing of respiratory illness severity, supporting the overall downward trend.
5. The continued co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) and stable antiviral susceptibilities, combined with effective vaccination coverage for circulating influenza strains, acted as mitigating factors. These trends, as reported across all weeks, likely minimized the potential for surges and contributed to the ongoing reduction in ILI activity leading to the reported future occurrences of 850.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 850 (Week18, 2023) are explained by the continuous decline in past ILI reports, stable outpatient ILI visit percentages below baseline, gradual reductions in PIC mortality, and the mitigating effects of vaccination and antiviral susceptibilities, all contributing to the sustained downward trend.
