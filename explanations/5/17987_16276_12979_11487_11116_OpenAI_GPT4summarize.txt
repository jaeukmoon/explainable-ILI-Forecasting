1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent decline, moving from 17,987 (Week 35, 2021) to 16,276 (Week 36, 2021), then to 12,979 (Week 37, 2021), 11,487 (Week 38, 2021), and eventually 11,116 (Week 39, 2021). This downward trend in ILI occurrences reflects decreasing respiratory illness activity during this period, potentially influenced by low influenza circulation nationwide.

2. Despite the observed declining trend, the subsequent jump to 13,895 future occurrences (Week 44, 2021) might indicate a delayed rebound phase. While the initial decrease suggested diminished ILI activity, earlier Weeks 35–36 exhibited higher baseline activity. This past sub-baseline report (below 2.6%) and a potential shift in population behaviors could account for the unexpected rise.
