1. The past time-series ILI occurrences in the 5 weeks demonstrate a fluctuating trend with some stabilization in the latter weeks: ['2003', '2143', '1755', '1808', '1864']. There was an increase in values from 2003 (Week13, 2024) to 2143 (Week14, 2024), followed by a sharp decrease to 1755 (Week15, 2024). Subsequently, there was a slight upward shift to 1808 (Week16, 2024) and 1864 (Week17, 2024), indicating a marginal increase in ILI activity toward the end of the observed timeframe.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 1685 (Week23, 2024) align with the declining yet stabilizing trend observed during the latter weeks of the past data. After peaking at 2143 (Week14, 2024), there was a drop but with signs of stabilization around the range of 1800, making the reported future value consistent with a continued slight decline influenced by the prior trend.
3. Declining test positivity for influenza aligns with reduced ILI activity. Clinical positivity for influenza steadily dropped from 7.7% (Week14, 2024) to 3.1% (Week18, 2024), with reduced outpatient visits for ILI, which fell below baseline (from 2.8% in Week14 to 2.1% in Week18, 2024). This national decline in flu indicators supports the reduction in future ILI cases.
4. Cumulative hospitalization rates, while historically high at 80.3 per 100,000 (Week18, 2024), are tapering, reflecting reduced severe flu activity. Influenza-related deaths also stabilized at 0.2% by Week18, 2024, alongside lower pediatric deaths compared to prior weeks, indicating declining disease severity and transmission contributing to fewer future ILI cases.
5. The co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, such as COVID-19 and RSV, alongside Influenza A and B, further complicated the attribution of respiratory illness trends. However, this heightened multifactorial respiratory illness noise diminished over time, contributing to a more stabilized and reduced future ILI trend.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 1685 (Week23, 2024) are consistent with the overall declining ILI trend, driven by factors such as reduced influenza test positivity and ILI outpatient visits, stabilization in hospitalization rates, and reduced respiratory illness transmission, as indicated by co-circulation and regional data.
