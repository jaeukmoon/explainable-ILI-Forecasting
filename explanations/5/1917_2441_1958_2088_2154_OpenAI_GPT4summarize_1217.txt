1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but overall upward trend, with values of ['1917', '2441', '1958', '2088', '2154']. There was a significant increase from 1917 (Week 40, 2020) to 2441 (Week 41, 2020), followed by a sharp decline to 1958 (Week 42, 2020). However, the subsequent weeks observed a consistent rise to 2088 (Week 43, 2020) and further to 2154 (Week 44, 2020). This overall trend suggests a gradual resurgence of ILI activity toward the end of the observed period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the upward movement in Weeks 43 and 44, 2020, mirrors the future ILI occurrence increase to 3284 (Week 49, 2020). This rise in later weeks acts as a precursor to the amplified activity reflected in future data.
3. ILI outpatient visits showed a slight but steady increase, rising from 1.1% (Week 40, 2020) to 1.3% (Week 44, 2020). This consistent upward shift in healthcare visits likely signals growing respiratory illness activity, correlating with the significant rise in future ILI occurrences.
4. Persistently elevated deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) were reported, increasing from 7.0% (Week 40, 2020) to 8.1% (Week 44, 2020), consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds. This sustained PIC mortality suggests heightened respiratory illness activity, aligning with the future surge to 3284 occurrences.
5. The shift in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to COVID-19, as highlighted in all weeks, altered traditional ILI reporting and surveillance. These disruptions, combined with pandemic-driven health modifications, likely concentrated and delayed recognized ILI cases, ultimately contributing to the sharp future rise observed.
6. Despite very low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.21% in Week 40, 2020, and 0.1% in Week 44, 2020) and minimal influenza-focused lab detections, the increasing ILI occurrences may reflect other contributing respiratory viruses or pathogens. Behavioral adaptation during the pandemic may have also amplified non-specific ILI case reporting in the future.
7. In summary, the reported 3284 future ILI occurrences (Week 49, 2020) can be explained by the overall upward trend in Weeks 43 and 44, 2020, steady growth in ILI outpatient visits, persistently high PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the compounding effects of pandemic-induced disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior and surveillance systems.
