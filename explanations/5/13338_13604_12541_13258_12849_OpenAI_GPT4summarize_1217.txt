1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating trend, with values of ['13338', '13604', '12541', '13258', '12849']. The highest occurrence was observed in Week15, 2024 (13604), following an initial rise from 13338 in Week14, 2024. A subsequent decline to 12541 in Week16, 2024, was followed by a small recovery to 13258 in Week17, 2024, before dropping again to 12849 in Week18, 2024. This indicates an irregular but gradual decline towards the end of the observed period.
2. A direct correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the decreasing trajectory in the latter weeks of the past data (Weeks 16–18, 2024) aligns with the reduced ILI activity observed in the reported future occurrence of 11270 by Week23, 2024. The declining trend acted as a precursor to the lower future ILI occurrences.
3. The outpatient visit rate for ILI consistently declined throughout the 5-week period, from 2.8% in Week14, 2024, to 2.1% in Week18, 2024, remaining below the national baseline. This decline in healthcare utilization suggests reduced patient presentations with ILI, correlating with the lower future ILI occurrence.
4. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza steadily declined from 7.7% in Week14, 2024, to 3.1% in Week18, 2024. Reduced influenza positivity aligns with diminished viral activity and corresponds with the lower future occurrence of 11270 in Week23, 2024.
5. Declining hospitalization rates, attributed to influenza during the reporting weeks, contributed significantly, as cumulative hospitalization rates only marginally increased from 76.0 per 100,000 in Week14, 2024, to 80.3 per 100,000 in Week18, 2024, reflecting a near plateau. This stabilization correlates with the reduced intensity of ILI activity anticipated in Week23, 2024.
6. Co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens like RSV and COVID-19, as noted consistently in Weeks14–18, 2024, might have influenced the ILI trends, yet the gradual regression of overall respiratory illness contributed to the decline seen in future cases.
7. In conclusion, the future ILI occurrences of 11270 in Week23, 2024, can be explained by the fluctuating but predominantly decreasing trend in past ILI occurrences, declining outpatient ILI visit rates, reduced influenza positivity, stabilized hospitalization rates, and the diminishing impact of co-circulating respiratory pathogens during Weeks14–18, 2024.
