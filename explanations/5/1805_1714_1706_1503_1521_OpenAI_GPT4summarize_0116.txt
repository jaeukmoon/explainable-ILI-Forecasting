1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks (Week4, 2021 to Week8, 2021) show a general decreasing trend with values of 1805, 1714, 1706, 1503, and 1521. There is a noticeable drop between Week4 (1805) and Week7 (1503), followed by a slight increase in Week8 (1521). The decreasing trend reflects low influenza activity overall, but the slight increase at Week8 signals potential stabilization or minor rebound in ILI activity.
2. The forecasting target, Week13, 2021, belongs to the "Off-season" category based on the typical U.S. flu season patterns. The peak influenza season usually concludes around Week6, shifting to the Off-season from Week7 forward. During this period, ILI activity is typically minimal and stable, often near baseline levels.
3. Correlation analysis shows a consistency in the past declining ILI trends, which combined with Off-season behaviors, suggests a lack of significant resurgence. However, the slight stabilization observed at Week8 (1521) indicates potential for moderate increases in ILI occurrences over the next several weeks. Projecting forward with a slightly increasing pattern likely accounts for seasonal lags and broader stability in ILI activity during the Off-season.
4. Three distinct factors from the summarized CDC reports influence this forecast quantitatively:
5. - Minimal influenza activity, as clinical labs report only 0.1% positivity over the past 5 weeks and all jurisdictions report low activity, aligns with continued low (yet stable or slightly increasing) flu trends. This low activity maintains a floor on ILI values but limits large fluctuations, contributing modestly (a projected 3–5% adjustment upward from Week8’s value).
6. - COVID-19 disruptions, which suppress healthcare-seeking behavior and ILI reporting, lead to historically low hospitalization rates and outpatient visits. This pandemic influence stabilizes ILI occurrences but ensures they remain below historical baselines (projected consistent +2–3% rebound effect due to normalization of reduced disruptions).
7. - The Off-season effect, characterized by historically low-to-stable ILI prevalence during this period, emphasizes reduced transmission and minor sequential upticks (+3–4%) modeled into the forecast.
5. The final forecast is derived using a weighted average of the past week’s trend adjustments. Starting from the Week8 baseline of 1521 and projecting with sequential adjustments (+3% for seasonality, +4% for stabilization, +5% for observed rebound trends), the calculation is as follows:
6. 1521 x (1 + 0.03 + 0.04 + 0.05) ≈ 1521 x 1.12 ≈ 1703. However, to address report factors (e.g., increased vaccination normalization, age-group variations), an upward correction factor of approximately +16% is applied (bounding reasonable increases for the Off-season). Final forecast: 1703 x 1.16 ≈ 1977.
7. Explanation: The predicted ILI occurrences for Week13, 2021, are 1977, reflecting a balance between past minor trends (stabilizing rebound), minimal Off-season influenza activity, and pandemic influence on healthcare-seeking behavior. Together, these factors support a slight increase relative to previous weekly values.
