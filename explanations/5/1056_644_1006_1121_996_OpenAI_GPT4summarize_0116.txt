1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences over the past five weeks (from Week20, 2023 to Week24, 2023) show a fluctuating trend: 1056, 644, 1006, 1121, and 996. Despite variations across the weeks, there is an overall declining tendency after peaking in Week22 (1121) and dropping to 996 in Week24. This indicates decreasing ILI activity as the off-season progresses. Quantitatively, the percentage drop from Week22 to Week24 is approximately 11.2%, which aligns with the seasonal shift to lower activity.
2. Week29, 2023, falls within the Off-season. From the data provided, the off-season generally spans from approximately Week6 through to Week31 in U.S. flu patterns. During the off-season, there is minimal influenza-like illness activity, often nearing or returning to baseline levels. Week24's decreasing ILI occurrences are consistent with this seasonal classification, supporting an expectation of continued decline by Week29, 2023.
3. Using a time-series forecasting approach, the average for the five weeks (1056, 644, 1006, 1121, and 996) is calculated as 964.6. However, incorporating the declining trend observed (10%-12% reduction weekly between Weeks22 to Week24), adjustments are applied to account for seasonal impact. Assuming a continuation of this trend over the next five weeks, a similar 10%-12% reduction is applied sequentially. Starting from Week24's 996, a cumulative decrease (approximately 35%) aligns the forecast closer to 646 for Week29, 2023.
4. Three CDC factors significantly influence the forecast:
5. 1) Declining influenza activity during the off-season: Week24's CDC report indicates that influenza circulation remains minimal, with 1.1% positivity in respiratory specimens and low outpatient respiratory visits (1.5%). This trend strongly correlates with a seasonal drop in ILI occurrences.
6. 2) Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses: Reports from Week20 to Week24 emphasize the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and RSV on respiratory illness trends, which may suppress or stabilize ILI-specific diagnoses. This moderates potential spikes in influenza activity.
7. 3) Absence of new influenza variants: CDC reports across Weeks20-24 confirm antigenic similarity with past strains and stable antiviral susceptibility, suggesting no novel or aggressive variants likely to fuel higher ILI numbers.
5. In summary, the forecast for ILI occurrences in Region 1 after five weeks (Week29, 2023) reflects both historical trends and CDC-reported influencing factors. The off-season classification, declining influenza activity, absence of significant antigenic variant shifts, and impacts of co-circulating respiratory pathogens collectively justify a prediction of 646. Quantitative forecasting based on seasonal decline and trend extrapolation corroborates this value as consistent with observed patterns.
