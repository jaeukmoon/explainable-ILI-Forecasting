1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week21 to Week25, 2022 are 1983, 1695, 1454, 1180, and 1024. This indicates a steady week-over-week decline in ILI counts, reflecting a downward trend as influenza activity diminishes. There are no significant spikes or deviations during these weeks, suggesting reduced transmission intensity.
2. Week30, 2022 falls during the off-season, as influenza activity and ILI percentages in Weeks21 to Week25, 2022 are consistently below baseline levels, aligning with historical trends of low activity during this period. The off-season is a period of minimal ILI activity and reduced community transmission.
3. The observed historical trend of continuous declines in ILI counts from Week21 to Week25, 2022 signals a likely stabilization at lower activity levels in the subsequent weeks. The progression suggests no anomalous events or heightened activity that would significantly alter the trajectory. Time-series forecasting reflects this declining trend, projecting a minimal baseline ILI occurrence of 835 during Week30, 2022.
4. Influenza positivity rates steadily declined over these weeks, moving from 5.7% (Week21, 2022) to 1.8% (Week25, 2022). This indicates reduced prevalence and aligns with the overall decrease in ILI cases (Week21 #1; Week25 #1).
5. Geographic and jurisdictional reports suggest minimal activity across most areas, with only one state reporting high levels during Week25, 2022 (Week25 #8). The limited area of higher activity reduces the risk of nationwide ILI spikes.
6. Healthcare-seeking behavior for outpatient respiratory illness remains reduced due to COVID-19 behavioral shifts, impacting traditional reporting and transmission surveillance, and supporting lower ILI transmission (Week24 #10, Week25 #10).
7. In summary, the consistent decline in past ILI occurrences, alignment with seasonal off-season timing, decreasing influenza positivity rates, minimal jurisdictional activity, and reduced healthcare-seeking behavior cohesively justify a projected ILI occurrence of 835 in Week30, 2022.
