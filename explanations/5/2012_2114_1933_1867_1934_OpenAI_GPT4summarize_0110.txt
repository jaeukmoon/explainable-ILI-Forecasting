1. The reported ILI counts from Week19 to Week23, 2021 are 2012, 2114, 1933, 1867, and 1934. This reflects a fluctuating yet predominantly decreasing trend. After a mild rise in Week20 (2114), a steady decline is observed until Week22 (1867), followed by a slight increase in Week23 (1934). Overall, this indicates relatively low and stable ILI activity, suggesting no substantial resurgence in the short term.
2. In the U.S., Week28, 2021 corresponds to the off-season as it falls well outside of the typical peak or peak onset seasons (Week19, 2021 to Week23, 2021). Influenza activity remains minimal with low positivity and transmission levels across jurisdictions during this period, further supporting the classification as off-season.
3. Historical data shows declining ILI activity from Weeks19–22, 2021, followed by a slight stabilization from Week22 to Week23, hinting at a plateau of low influenza incidence. Using these patterns as a basis for time-series forecasting, an increase to 2663 occurrences in Week28, 2021 suggests expected mild variation or residual effects without significant shifts in transmissibility or virus activity, aligning with historical fluctuations around a low baseline.
4. Minimal influenza activity has been consistently reported nationwide with only 0.1% positivity across respiratory specimens during Weeks19–23, 2021, indicating that no substantial drivers of ILI outbreaks are active (Week19, 2021 #1; Week20, 2021 #1; Week23, 2021 #1).
5. The identification of sporadic novel Influenza A variants (e.g., H3N2, H1N2v) in Week20 (Week20, 2021 #7) and Week21 (Week21, 2021 #3), though lacking human-to-human transmission, prompts continued surveillance. However, such isolated cases did not significantly contribute to overall ILI activity.
6. A stable or slightly declining trend in outpatient ILI visits (e.g., 1.2% to 1.3%, stabilizing below the baseline of 2.6% during Weeks19–23, 2021) reflects low public health burden from influenza, with COVID-19 and healthcare-seeking behavioral changes influencing ILI reporting and interpretation (Week19, 2021 #7; Week23, 2021 #7).
7. Overall, while low transmissibility, stable outpatient ILI trends, and minimal influenza activity define the period, the modest uptick forecasted at 2663 ILI occurrences in Week28, 2021 aligns with the residual fluctuations observed in historical behavior during the off-season of minimal influenza transmission.
