1. The reported ILI counts from Week44 to Week48, 2021 are 13895, 15312, 16729, 15058, and 17928. The data reveals an increasing trend overall, with fluctuations. From Week44 to Week46 (13895 to 16729), ILI occurrences showed significant growth, followed by a slight dip in Week47 (15058). However, Week48 saw a rise again to 17928, indicating a moderate upward trend in influenza-like illness during these weeks.
2. The forecasted Week1, 2022 falls into the "Peak season" category. In the U.S., the peak season typically begins around Week46 and extends through Week6 of the following year. Several indicators, including the increase in ILI percentages (Week48, 2021 #3, #10) and the growing positivity rate of influenza specimens (Week48, 2021 #1, #2), suggest heightened flu activity, consistent with peak season levels.
3. Based on the past data trends, the increasing trajectory of ILI occurrences through Week48, 2021, and its alignment with the upward momentum of peak season activity, it is anticipated that this trend will persist into Week1, 2022. Training from historical patterns in a time-series model justifies a projected marked rise, aligning with amplified respiratory illness activity during peak flu season.
4. The influenza A(H3N2) subtype continued to dominate (Week48, 2021 #2, #3), spreading widely across regions and driving influenza activity among younger demographics, with expansion into older age groups. This subtype's dominance aligns with increased ILI reports in subsequent weeks (Week48, 2021 #2, #10).
5. Outpatient visits for ILI reached the national baseline of 2.5% in Week48, 2021 (Week48, 2021 #3), with upward trends across all age groups. This benchmark indicates accelerated transmission, and regions reporting levels above baseline (Week48, 2021 #3) further substantiate the likelihood of growing cases.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (Week48, 2021 #10), continues to exacerbate ILI occurrences by amplifying the burden on healthcare systems and increasing the likelihood of respiratory illness referrals contributing to the rise in case numbers.
7. In summary, the ILI forecast for Week1, 2022, arriving at 35304, is justified by the following: a clear upward trend in ILI data from the past weeks, peak-season classification of the target week, dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), rising outpatient ILI visits, and co-circulating respiratory viruses contributing to increased respiratory illness influence. These factors align to project substantial growth in ILI cases for the predicted week.
