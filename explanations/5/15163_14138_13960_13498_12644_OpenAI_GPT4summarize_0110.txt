1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week15, 2024 to Week19, 2024 are 15163, 14138, 13960, 13498, and 12644, showing a consistent decline throughout the five weeks. This indicates a clear downward trend in ILI activity during this timeframe, with no significant spikes or fluctuations, suggesting that ILI activity is steadily diminishing.
2. Week24, 2024 falls in the off-season, as the U.S. off-season typically spans from shortly after Week6 to about Week31 of each year. The continuing decline in ILI activity, along with nationwide low positivity rates and stable or below baseline outpatient visit percentages during Week15, 2024 through Week19, 2024, supports the conclusion that Week24 aligns with the off-season period.
3. The consistent decline in past ILI occurrences from Week15 to Week19, 2024 provides a strong basis for forecasting future counts. Projections suggest that the downward trend will persist, with the rate of decline moderating over time as activity approaches the baseline typical of the off-season. This projects a gradual stabilization of ILI occurrences near 9910 for Week24, 2024 based on time-series forecasting models.
4. Factors from CDC reports influencing the forecast:
5. Nationwide influenza activity has declined week-over-week, with positive respiratory specimen percentages dropping from 5.9% in Week15, 2024 to 2.4% in Week19, 2024, and outpatient visits for ILI have consistently stayed below the national baseline, indicating weak influenza transmission.
6. Co-circulating respiratory illnesses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV remain present; however, their contribution to overall ILI has not caused an upsurge, as influenza-specific activity remains low and regional variability trends stable across the U.S.
7. The influenza vaccination campaign has remained active, with the current vaccine well-matched to circulating strains, maintaining immunity levels in the population and further reducing flu activity.
5. The gradual decline in ILI occurrences, consistent classification of Week24, 2024 as part of the off-season, and favorable conditions like declining positivity, reduced outpatient respiratory visits, and effective vaccination coverage align to justify the forecasted value of 9910 for Week24, 2024. This value reflects steady reductions in activity approaching the off-season baseline while accounting for minimal variability from co-circulating viruses.
