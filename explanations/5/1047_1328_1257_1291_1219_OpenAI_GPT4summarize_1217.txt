1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a slightly fluctuating but predominantly stable trend, with values of ['1047', '1328', '1257', '1291', '1219']. There was a notable increase from 1047 (Week 34, 2024) to 1328 (Week 35, 2024), followed by a small decrease to 1257 (Week 36, 2024) and 1291 (Week 37, 2024). However, the final value dropped to 1219 (Week 38, 2024), reflecting a more stable range overall. This pattern suggests mild activity interspersed with fluctuations.
2. A moderate correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the values in the past time-series hover within a consistent range without dramatic changes. The slight decrease observed in Week 38, 2024, and the generally stable levels across preceding weeks align with the gradual increment to the future reported value of 1378 after Week 43, 2024. This increase correlates with typical seasonal or co-circulatory virus activity patterns leading to the future rise.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently below the national baseline at 1.8% across all weeks (Week 34–Week 38, 2024), despite sporadic increases among the 0–4 and 5–24-year-old populations. This consistent healthcare engagement reflects underlying mild respiratory illness activity, contributing to the future ILI rise. Minimal antiviral resistance was observed, ensuring manageable virus transmission and enabling more infections to align with future ILI metrics. Reports of consistent co-circulation of other respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV and COVID-19) across these weeks, alongside influenza activity, suggest concurrent ILI contributors that cumulatively fuel the increase to 1378 future cases.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, has steadily persisted (documented across Week 34–Week 38, 2024), creating additive respiratory illness case burdens despite the mild influenza season. Weekly surveillance noted stable low positivity for influenza (0.4%), and genetic similarity indicates vaccines effectively align with circulating strains, mitigating severe cases but not eliminating elevated respiratory illness susceptibility in the population.
5. In summary, the reported 1378 future ILI occurrences (Week 43, 2024) primarily stem from the stable upward pattern seen in past ILI occurrences, consistent ILI outpatient visits (1.8%), documented co-circulation of influenza with other respiratory viruses, and mild but steady influenza activity reflected in lab surveillance. These factors collectively contribute to the low but growing ILI activity matched to the predicted future count of 1378 after 5 weeks.
