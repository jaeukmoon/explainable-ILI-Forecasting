1. The reported ILI counts from Week45, 2021 to Week49, 2021 are 15312, 16729, 15058, 17928, and 18608. The trend demonstrates a steady increase from Week45 (15312) to Week46 (16729), followed by a small dip in Week47 (15058) before climbing again in Week48 (17928) and Week49 (18608). The overall trend points to gradual growth, signaling increasing ILI activity leading to Week49, indicating the potential continuation of this upward movement.
2. Week2, 2022 belongs to the peak season. In the U.S., the peak season generally spans from Week46 to Week6. With ongoing increases in influenza positivity, outpatient visits crossing the national baseline, rising hospitalizations, and intensifying flu activity by the end of Week49, 2021, Week2, 2022 is categorized as part of the peak season.
3. The past ILI counts exhibit a consistent upward trend, with two significant growth periods between Week45 to Week46 and Week47 to Week49, indicating momentum in flu activity. Based on time-series projection models, patterns of increasing ILI occurrences in prior weeks suggest further escalation in the subsequent five weeks, aligning with a forecasted value of 26625 for Week2, 2022.
4. Influenza positivity increased steadily, rising from 0.7% in Week45 to 3.5% in Week49, as Influenza A(H3N2) became increasingly dominant, particularly affecting those aged 5-24 years, but also showing growing impact in adults over 25.
5. Outpatient visits for ILI rose consistently, from 2.1% in Week45 to 2.7% in Week49, crossing the national baseline of 2.5% by Week48 and continuing to trend upward. This growth suggests expanding community spread and increasing respiratory illness visits.
6. Hospitalizations due to influenza escalated sharply, with 841 hospitalizations reported in Week48 and 1057 in Week49, reflecting more severe cases and further amplification of healthcare burden.
7. In summary, the steady rise in ILI counts, markers of increasing influenza positivity, outpatient visit trends, and hospitalization rates signals intensifying flu activity in the peak season. These aligned factors support the projected Week2, 2022 ILI occurrence of 26625.
