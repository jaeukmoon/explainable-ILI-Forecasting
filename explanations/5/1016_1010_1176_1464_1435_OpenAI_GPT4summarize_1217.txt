1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating yet generally upward trend, starting at 1016 (Week11, 2021) and peaking at 1464 (Week13, 2021), with a slight decline to 1435 in Week15, 2021. This overall increase highlighted a gradual rise in ILI activity despite minor week-to-week variations.
2. A correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident as the surge from 1010 in Week12, 2021, to 1464 in Week13, 2021, and the sustained high values in Weeks14–15, 2021, parallels the rise to 1856 future occurrences in Week20, 2021. This trend indicates that the higher levels in recent weeks likely influenced the future increase.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI, while historically low, showed a slight increase from 0.9% in Week11–12, 2021, to 1.0% in Week13, 2021, and then 1.1% in Weeks14–15, 2021. This marginal but consistent rise suggests growing respiratory illness activity during this period, aligning with the future ILI increase.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained persistently high, ranging from 12.1% in Week11, 2021, to 12.4% in Week15, 2021, surpassing epidemic thresholds (>6.8%). The continued respiratory morbidity associated with PIC likely contributed to the observed rise in future ILI occurrences.
5. The impact of COVID-19 on healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance, noted in all five weeks, affected ILI data interpretation. These disruptions potentially delayed case detection or concentrated recorded ILI cases, amplifying the surge to 1856 in Week20, 2021. Together with stable flu vaccination efforts and minimal direct flu activity, COVID-19-associated complications remained the primary driver of respiratory illnesses.
6. The consistently low rates of influenza positivity (0.1%) and hospitalization (0.7–0.8 per 100,000) throughout Weeks11–15, 2021, suggest that non-influenza respiratory illnesses and pandemic-related data complexities played a greater role. This pattern explains the significant leap in reported future ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported jump to 1856 future ILI occurrences (Week20, 2021) is backed by the upward trajectory in Weeks12–15, 2021, increasing outpatient ILI visits, persistently high PIC mortality, and overlapping pandemic-driven disruptions in surveillance and healthcare-seeking trends rather than influenza-specific activity.
