1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a generally fluctuating trend with values of ['1189', '1064', '975', '1124', '1063']. There was an initial decline from 1189 (Week 37, 2021) to 975 (Week 39, 2021), followed by an increase to a peak of 1124 (Week 40, 2021) and ending with a slight decrease to 1063 in Week 41, 2021. This demonstrates a variable pattern with no clear consistent upward or downward trajectory but an overall stabilization in the second half of the time frame.  

2. A weak yet notable correlation between past and future ILI occurrences emerges, as the increase recorded in Week 40 to 1124, followed by sustained levels in Week 41 at 1063, foreshadows a moderate rise to 1240 after 5 weeks. The fluctuations in the earlier weeks may reflect underlying factors that gradually contributed to the future trend.  

3. Several factors from the CDC reports have a strong association with the future rise in ILI occurrences:  
   - Outpatient visits for ILI as a percentage of total visits were between 1.8% and 1.9% during Weeks 37 to 41, 2021, consistently below the national baseline. However, the data indicates a uniform presence of non-specific respiratory illnesses, contributing to the overall ILI burden reflected in the future data.  
   - The persistently elevated percentage of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) (ranging from 21.1% in Week 37 to 17.5% in Week 41, 2021) well above epidemic thresholds indicates a heightened burden of respiratory illnesses, aligning with the rise to 1240 future occurrences.  
   - Healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional ILI surveillance. This may have led to inconsistent data reporting and a delayed rise, which became more apparent in the future occurrences.  

4. In summary, the reported 1240 future ILI occurrences (Week 46, 2021) can be explained by the stabilization and slight increase in ILI trends observed in Weeks 40–41, 2021, outpatient ILI visit percentages remaining steady, elevated PIC mortality rates signaling ongoing respiratory illness activity, and surveillance disruptions caused by the pandemic, which likely masked the gradual rise in real-time but became evident in the reported future data.
