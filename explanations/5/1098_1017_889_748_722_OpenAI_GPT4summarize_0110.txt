1. The reported ILI counts from Week23 to Week27, 2023 are 1098, 1017, 889, 748, and 722. There is a consistent downward trend in ILI counts over the last five weeks, with a sharp decline from Week23 (1098) to Week25 (889) followed by a smaller decrease to Week27 (722). Overall, this reflects a steady decline without significant fluctuations.
2. Week32, 2023 falls into the Peak onset season, based on U.S. season definitions. Although the off-season officially ends at Week31, past trends and continued low influenza activity suggest the onset of expected minimal flu activity leading into the Peak onset season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the steady decline of ILI counts from Week23 to Week27 indicates that ILI occurrences are stabilizing near a low baseline. Projecting this trend forward five weeks, a continued moderate decrease is expected, reaching a forecasted value of 719 ILI occurrences in Week32, 2023.
4. Minimal influenza positivity of 0.8%-1.2% has been observed nationally across the last five weeks (Week23, 2023 #1; Week24, 2023 #1; Week25, 2023 #1; Week26, 2023 #1; Week27, 2023 #1), reflecting low overall ILI activity.
5. Nationwide, most regions reported low to minimal influenza activity, with only slight regional fluctuations (Week23, 2023 #8; Week24, 2023 #8; Week25, 2023 #7; Week26, 2023 #8; Week27, 2023 #11). This indicates that widespread influenza activity is unlikely in the near-term forecast window.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, continues to suppress ILI activity due to complex virus interactions without attributing significant spikes to flu (Week23, 2023 #10; Week24, 2023 #9; Week25, 2023 #10; Week26, 2023 #9; Week27, 2023 #10).
7. In summary, the steady decline in ILI counts, consistent minimal positivity rates, and low influenza activity as reported in CDC summaries, along with the transition into the Peak onset season, support the projected occurrence of 719 ILI cases in Week32, 2023.
