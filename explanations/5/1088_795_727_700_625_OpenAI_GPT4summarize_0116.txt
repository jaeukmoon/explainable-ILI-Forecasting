1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks in Region 7 (Week17, 2024 to Week21, 2024) show a clear decreasing trend: ['1088', '795', '727', '700', '625']. The percent decline between consecutive weeks has been progressively less steep: Week17 to Week18 saw a drop of 26.9% ([1088-795]/1088), Week18 to Week19 a decrease of 8.6% ([795-727]/795), Week19 to Week20 a decrease of 3.7% ([727-700]/727), and Week20 to Week21 a decrease of 10.7% ([700-625]/700). This consistent week-to-week decline indicates a downward trend in ILI occurrences as influenza activity slows. The average week-over-week decline over the 5 weeks is approximately 12.5%. Using this average rate of decline, we anticipate further reductions in ILI occurrences as the trend continues for 5 additional weeks.
2. To predict the value for Week26, 2024: Starting from Week21's occurrence value of 625, we repeatedly apply the 12.5% average decline (625 * (1 - 0.125)^5), yielding ≈ 330.
2. Season classification for Week26, 2024: Week26, 2024 falls within the "Off-season" based on the U.S. flu season definitions. The off-season typically spans the period after the peak season (Week1 to Week6) until the next peak onset season (Week32 or later). As Week26 lies far from both peak activity and peak onset, we expect ILI occurrences to remain minimal, coinciding with seasonal norms for low activity.
3. Historical trends and time-series forecasting suggest that during the off-season, ILI occurrences generally decrease to minimal levels due to reduced influenza transmission, as corroborated by the ongoing decline in influenza activity over the past 5 weeks. The average week-over-week decline of 12.5% seen in the time-series data further supports projecting a much lower value for Week26, 2024. Visualizing this progression through exponential decay, a reduction to approximately 330 is consistent with the observed historical trends and the off-season classification.
4. Several detailed factors in the CDC reports influence the forecast:
5. 1. Influenza activity has been consistently falling, with the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza decreasing from 3.9% in Week17, 2024 to 1.7% in Week21, 2024. This reflects a downward trend consistent with the timeline of declining ILI cases, reinforcing projections for continued lower activity in Week26, 2024.
6. 2. Outpatient visits for ILI have remained stable and below the national baseline over the past 5 weeks, further indicating limited influenza-related illness activity expected as the off-season continues.
7. 3. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 persists but does not significantly elevate ILI occurrences, as current surveillance data show these viruses have a negligible compounding effect on overall flu activity. Combined with minimal new influenza variant emergence, this supports an expectation of continued low activity levels.
8. These concrete factors align with the observed decreasing trend and support the larger seasonal expectation that aligns with an off-season period.
5. In summary, the forecast of 330 ILI occurrences for Week26, 2024 in Region 7 is supported by a consistent week-over-week decline in recent ILI cases aligned with the seasonal transition to the off-season, where minimal ILI activity generally occurs. This decline is further corroborated by CDC-reported reductions in influenza positivity rates, low outpatient respiratory illness visits, and an absence of new influenza variants or high-risk conditions exacerbating ILI occurrences.
