1. The reported ILI counts from Week49, 2021 to Week1, 2022 are 18608, 22179, 28956, 43523, and 35304. During this time, a steady increase in ILI counts is observed from Week49, 2021 (18608) to the peak at Week52, 2021 (43523), followed by a decrease in Week1, 2022 (35304). The trend reflects a sharp rise followed by a moderate decline, indicating a progression toward the season's peak and some waning activity after the peak week.
2. Given the background knowledge that the U.S. influenza peak season generally spans from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the following year, and considering the declining trend seen by Week1, 2022 (35304), it is reasonable to forecast that Week6, 2022 remains within the peak season but at the tail end as activity begins to taper off.
3. The past 5-week trend indicates that ILI occurrences surged rapidly during Week49, 2021 to Week52, 2021, and then showed a slight decline in Week1, 2022. Historically, such patterns suggest that ILI occurrences typically plateau or diminish gradually as the peak progresses. Therefore, projecting this trend forward, the forecasted number of 9072 ILI occurrences in Week6, 2022 aligns with the projected trajectory, representing a continued decline in activity as the season's intensity wanes.
4. The observed co-circulation of Influenza A(H3N2) and other respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 likely exacerbates ILI burdens but does not dominate (Week49, 2021 #10; Week52, 2021 #10; Week1, 2022 #11). As A(H3N2) remains the dominant strain (Week49, 2021 #2; Week1, 2022 #2), its behavior and trajectory suggest it has reached a peak, and further declines are anticipated as the season concludes.
5. Flu vaccination uptake was consistently reported to be lower than the previous season (Week49, 2021 #6; Week50, 2021 #7; Week1, 2022 #8). Although reduced vaccination coverage might slow the decline in influenza activity, the recommendation for widespread vaccination and antiviral treatments remains a mitigating factor (Week51, 2021 #8; Week1, 2022 #9).
6. Despite elevated hospitalization and death rates (Week50, 2021 #4; Week1, 2022 #6), influenza-specific mortality remains low, indicating progression through peak seasonality while the slowed rate of positive influenza tests (Week1, 2022 #1; #2) reflects diminished viral spread and aligns with peak tapering.
7. In summary, the forecast of 9072 ILI occurrences for Week6, 2022 is justified by the observed trends of rising and then declining ILI counts, the classification of Week6, 2022 as part of the peak season's tapering phase, and contributing epidemiological factors such as A(H3N2)'s declining dominance, regional variations, and reduced vaccination uptake. These considerations collectively explain the anticipated reduction from the prior week's elevated numbers.
