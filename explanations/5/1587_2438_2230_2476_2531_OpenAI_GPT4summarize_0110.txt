1. The reported ILI counts from Week39 to Week43, 2021 are 1587, 2438, 2230, 2476, and 2531. A significant rise is observed from Week39 (1587) to Week40 (2438), followed by slight fluctuations with a general upward trend, peaking at Week43 (2531). This indicates a pattern of gradual increase, suggesting a consistent climb in activity levels as the season progresses.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically begins around Week46 and persists through Week6 of the following year. Given that the target week (Week48, 2021) falls within this range and that influenza positivity and ILI counts have continued to rise (Week42, 2021 #10; Week43, 2021 #10), Week48, 2021 likely belongs to the peak season classification.
3. Extrapolating from the time series, the upward trajectory from Week39–Week43 suggests sustained growth in future ILI occurrences. Based on the historical progression and modeling, this trend projects further increases over five weeks, aligning with the progression into peak season, resulting in the expected ILI occurrence of 2971 for Week48.
4. Despite low influenza positivity early on, increasing trends are noted in Weeks42 and 43 (Week42, 2021 #1, #10; Week43, 2021 #1, #10), with public health and clinical labs confirming steadily growing influenza A (H3N2 dominant) circulation (Week42, 2021 #3; Week43, 2021 #3).
5. Vaccination coverage by the end of October is emphasized by the CDC (Week40, 2021 #8; Week41, 2021 #8). However, the lack of robust uptake data and delayed immunity in part of the population may not immediately mitigate climbing ILI levels during the early phase of peak influenza activity.
6. Other respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, show persistent co-circulation, contributing to outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses (Week39, 2021 #2, #9; Week40, 2021 #10; Week41, 2021 #10; Week42, 2021 #10; Week43, 2021 #10). Overlapping pathogen impacts alongside climbing influenza positivity rates further support increased future ILI occurrences.
7. The projected ILI occurrence of 2971 for Week48, 2021 is justified by the observed upward trend in ILI cases (Week39–Week43, 2021), progression into the peak influenza season, gradual increases in influenza positivity (Week42–Week43, 2021), ongoing respiratory co-pathogen impact, and initial but incomplete vaccination coverage.
