1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over 5 weeks presented an overall upward trend, progressing from 1566 (Week 41, 2020) to 2092 (Week 45, 2020). After a minimal decline between Week 41 (1566) and Week 43 (1544), a significant and sharp rise was observed, peaking at 2092 (Week 45, 2020). This consistent increase in the latter weeks indicates heightened ILI activity heading into future weeks.
2. The upward surge in the past ILI occurrences during Week 44 (1705) and Week 45 (2092) closely aligns with the reported future increase to 2237 occurrences (Week 50, 2020). This positive correlation suggests that the escalating ILI trends served as a precursor to the future rise, reflecting a continuation of this observed trajectory.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually increased from 1.2% (Week 41, 2020) to 1.5% (Week 45, 2020), consistently moving closer to regional threshold levels. This incremental growth reflects worsening respiratory illness activity, a likely factor explaining the observed future rise in ILI occurrences.
4. PIC-related deaths showed a steady escalation from 7.2% (Week 41, 2020) to 8.9% (Week 45, 2020), consistently exceeding epidemic thresholds. This worsening indicator of respiratory illness likely correlates with the amplified ILI activity contributing to the future rise.
5. Persistent disruptions in traditional ILI surveillance due to healthcare-seeking behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic were repeatedly noted and likely contributed to delayed or concentrated reporting. This systemic factor may have amplified the observed surge in future ILI occurrences to 2237.
6. Despite low positivity rates for influenza (0.3% in Week 41, 2020, dipping to 0.2% in Week 45, 2020) and limited lab-confirmed detections, the continuous increase in ILI data suggests a primary contribution from non-specific respiratory illnesses or other pathogens driving the future rise.
7. In summary, the sharp increase to 2237 ILI occurrences (Week 50, 2020) is driven by a clear upward trend in Weeks 44–45, 2020, increasing outpatient and PIC-related metrics, disruptions to ILI surveillance reliability, and potential amplification from broader respiratory illnesses amid low flu-specific positivity rates.
