1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week8 to Week12, 2022 are 1816, 2040, 2378, 2820, and 3166. The trend shows consistent weekly increases, indicating rising influenza activity across the 5-week period. This pattern suggests a sharp upward trajectory without any significant dips or fluctuations.
2. Week17, 2022 falls outside both the typical peak season (Week46 to Week6) and the peak onset season (Week32 to Week46). Based on historical knowledge and trends seen during this time of year, Week17, 2022 aligns with the off-season period. This suggests that influenza activity, while increasing, has not reached peak levels and is beginning its decline or slight stabilization.
3. Time-series analysis reveals a consistent growth pattern across the past five weeks. Extrapolating the upward trajectory from Week8 to Week12, 2022, a forward projection for five weeks suggests continued growth before stabilization, as seasonal factors and vaccine effects temper the spread. This model accounts for anticipated progression from 3166 to a higher number, such as 4778, by Week17, 2022.
4. CDC reported antigenic mismatches in A(H3N2) viruses, impacting vaccine effectiveness and potentially increasing susceptibility (Week8, 2022 #8; Week9, 2022 #5; Week10, 2022 #9).
5. Regional influenza activity continues rising, with hotspots in central and south-central regions while spreading to the northeast and northwest (Week9, 2022 #1; Week10, 2022 #1; Week12, 2022 #1, #13).
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, RSV) amplifies overall influenza-like illness trends, complicating efforts to curb the spread (Week8, 2022 #6; Week10, 2022 #12; Week11, 2022 #10).
7. In summary, the sustained upward trend of ILI activity, compounded by antigenic mismatches reducing vaccination effectiveness and the influence of regional and co-circulating virus dynamics, strongly supports the projection of 4778 ILI occurrences in Week17, 2022. This projection aligns with the anticipated trajectory from the weekly ILI growth observed through Week12.
