1. From Week9, 2023 to Week13, 2023, ILI occurrences showed a slightly fluctuating trend: starting at 1326 in Week9, increasing to a peak of 1529 in Week12, and then decreasing to 1419 in Week13. This indicates a mild, non-linear fluctuation rather than a sharp rise or consistent drop.
2. Based on established season timelines, Week23, 2023 aligns with the off-season, as it falls after the typical peak season (Week46, 2022 to Week6, 2023) and remains far from the peak onset season (Week32, 2023 to Week46, 2023). The consistently low influenza activity reported further supports this classification.
3. Historical time-series patterns suggest that ILI occurrences are mildly fluctuating but primarily stable around values slightly below those of early Weeks11-13. Projecting forward, this stability aligns with an off-season baseline, with a forecasted value near 1083, consistent with a gradual decrease in seasonal activity.
4. Influenza positivity rates have remained low nationwide, with clinical labs reporting positivity of 0.8%-1.0% from Week9, 2023 through Week13, 2023. This stability in positivity rates aligns with low future ILI activity.
5. Vaccine effectiveness remains robust, with circulating influenza strains antigenically well-matched to the vaccine, and most tested viruses are susceptible to antivirals (Week9, Week10, Week11, Week12, Week13). This reduces the likelihood of sudden surges in influenza cases.
6. Respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, continue to co-circulate but without significant increases or new novel flu variants. Co-circulation affects ILI slightly but does not appear to drive notable spikes (Week9, Week10, Week11, Week12, Week13).
7. In summary, the forecasted ILI occurrence of 1083 for Week23, 2023 is justified by the observed stable or declining historical trends of ILI cases, the current low influenza positivity rates during the off-season, the well-matched vaccine and antiviral susceptibility of circulating strains, and the absence of novel influenza or co-circulation-driven spikes in activity.
