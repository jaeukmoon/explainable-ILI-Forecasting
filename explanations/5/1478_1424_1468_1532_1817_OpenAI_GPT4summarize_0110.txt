1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week28 to Week32, 2023, show an increasing trend: 1478, 1424, 1468, 1532, and 1817. This upward progression is significant, particularly the sharp rise from Week31 to Week32 (1532 to 1817), indicating the transition out of a stable period toward heightened ILI activity.
2. Based on the temporal classification of flu seasons in the U.S., Week37, 2023 falls within the Peak onset season. This period typically spans from Week32 or Week35 to Week46 and is characterized by a gradual rise in ILI activity as observed during the provided period.
3. The time-series progression with the sharp increase in Week32, 2023 suggests a continuation of rising ILI occurrences as the onset intensifies. Modeling this trend forward, with a steep rise expected as the season ramps up, aligns with the predicted count of 3455 after five weeks.
4. Moderate upticks in respiratory illness indicators such as ILI outpatient visits (Week32, 2023 #5) and hospitalization cases (677 during Week32, 2023 #4) corroborate the increased activity.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 (Week30, 2023 #8; Week32, 2023 #10) contribute to overall respiratory illness burdens, intensifying the ILI trend. Their combined impacts, along with the endemic influenza viruses, create a favorable condition for increasing ILI cases.
6. The dominance of Influenza A, especially the H1N1pdm09 subtype, aligned with past trends, shows consistent spread with minimal competition from Influenza B strains (Week31, 2023 #7; Week32, 2023 #9). This dominance often results in spikes as activity transitions into peak onset.
7. Combining the observable upward trend in ILI counts, the CDC's surveillance indicating a moderately increasing flu presence across certain regions (Week32, 2023 #8), and the seasonality aligning with Peak onset, the forecasted value of 3455 aligns with the emergence of heightened flu activity.
