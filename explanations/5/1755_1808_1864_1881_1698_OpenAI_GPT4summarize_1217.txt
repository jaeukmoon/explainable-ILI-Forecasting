1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating and declining trend, with values of ['1755', '1808', '1864', '1881', '1698']. After an initial rise from 1755 (Week16, 2024) to a peak of 1881 (Week19, 2024), the ILI occurrences subsequently declined to 1698 by Week20, 2024. This decreasing trend aligns with reports of declining influenza activity during this period.
2. There is a positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences, as the sharp decline in ILI seen between Week19, 2024, and Week20, 2024, mirrors the continuation of this downward trend to the reported 1397 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week25, 2024). The decline observed at the end of the past period is consistent with the decreasing ILI activity in future data.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI during Weeks16–20, 2024, consistently remained below the national baseline (starting at 2.3% and steadily dropping to 2.0%). This prolonged below-baseline activity, coupled with reports of minimal influenza activity, suggests low respiratory illness impact, correlating with the subsequent decline to 1397. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza showed a steady decrease (from 4.8% in Week16, 2024, to 2.0% in Week20, 2024), indicating reduced influenza prevalence, directly contributing to the overall declining ILI trend. Co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and RSV) were also consistently reported but without significant surges, implying minimal additional contribution to ILI-related activity during this period.
4. Despite stable vaccination recommendations throughout Weeks16–20, 2024, the absence of novel influenza viruses and relatively low hospital admission rates (e.g., Week20’s rate of 0.2 per 100,000) indicate controlled influenza transmission. Declining cumulative hospitalization rates and minimal pediatric deaths further align with the overall decrease in ILI occurrences into the future period.
5. In summary, the reported 1397 future ILI occurrences (Week25, 2024) are explained by the declining trend in Weeks19–20, 2024, below-baseline outpatient ILI visits, reduced influenza positivity rates, minimal co-circulating respiratory virus impact, and controlled hospitalization and mortality metrics, consistent with observed national declines in influenza activity.
