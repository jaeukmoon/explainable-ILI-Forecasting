1. The reported ILI counts from Week5 to Week9, 2022 are 1551, 1757, 1933, 1816, and 2040. Over these weeks, the ILI occurrence demonstrates an upward trend overall, with fluctuations. Specifically, a steady increase is observed from Week5 (1551) to Week7 (1933), followed by a slight dip in Week8 (1816), but then rising again in Week9 (2040). This trend suggests a general growth in ILI activity with minor variability.
2. Based on seasonality patterns in the U.S., Week14, 2022 falls within the off-season, as it occurs after the typical peak season (Week46, 2021 to Week6, 2022). CDC surveillance as of Week9, 2022 indicates sporadic influenza activity with positivity below standard peak thresholds, consistent with off-season classification.
3. Time-series analysis shows a pattern of gradual increases in ILI occurrences with moderate fluctuations. Projecting forward from Week9, 2022, the data suggests continued growth, following the observed upward trend while accounting for seasonal dynamics. This aligns with anticipated ILI increases during the tail end of influenza activity in the off-season.
4. Low vaccination coverage persists compared to previous years, with fewer individuals receiving flu shots by Week9, 2022. This reduction in immunization can facilitate sustained ILI activity despite the off-season (Week5, 2022 #8; Week6, 2022 #8; Week7, 2022 #8; Week8, 2022 #8; Week9, 2022 #10).
5. Genetic antigenic differences in the dominant Influenza A(H3N2) strain reduce vaccine effectiveness, potentially leading to higher infection rates and greater ILI occurrences during this period (Week5, 2022 #10; Week6, 2022 #10; Week7, 2022 #7; Week9, 2022 #5).
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, continues, with approximately 5.9%-6.1% of influenza-positive cases co-infected. Such concurrent activity can contribute to increased ILI cases through overlapping outbreaks (Week5, 2022 #7; Week7, 2022 #9; Week9, 2022 #9).
7. Combining the observed upward trends in ILI data, off-season classification, low vaccination rates, antigenic mismatches in A(H3N2) viruses, and co-circulation of RSV and SARS-CoV-2, the projected ILI occurrences for Week14, 2022 are reasonably expected to rise to 4751.
