1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed fluctuation with an initial rise followed by a slight decline in Week 34, 2021. The values increased from 17202 (Week 30, 2021) to 21495 (Week 33, 2021), the peak in the observed period, before decreasing to 20189 in Week 34, 2021. This pattern indicates heightened respiratory illness transmission with possible plateauing toward Week 34.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is supported by the decline observed in Week 34, 2021 (20189), which aligns with the further reduction to 11116 future occurrences after 5 weeks, reflecting a tapering stage after the initial rise.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently increased weekly during the 5-week period before stabilizing at 2.2% for Weeks 33–34, 2021, below the 2.6% baseline. Peak respiratory illness activity occurred in specific age groups, such as 5–24 years (Weeks 32–34, 2021). This deceleration in growth aligns with the subsequent drop in future ILI occurrences.
4. High PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) mortality percentages, climbing from 9.0% (Week 30, 2021) to 19.4% (Week 34, 2021), reflect ongoing respiratory illness activity dominated by non-influenza causes such as COVID-19. This escalation directly influenced the trend but may have disproportionately skewed ILI activity reporting, contributing to observed drops post-Week 34.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, compounded by overlapping symptoms of non-influenza respiratory illnesses (notably SARS-CoV-2), impaired accurate ILI surveillance. These disruptions potentially obscured real-time trends, resulting in a lower observed ILI occurrence figure of 11116 projected 5 weeks after Week 34, 2021.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 11116 reflects the fluctuating past trends (Weeks 30–34, 2021), weekly increasing outpatient visits interrupted by stabilization in later weeks, persistently high PIC mortality percentages, and pandemic-induced reporting inconsistencies leading to suppressed ILI counts after the observed period.
