1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating pattern, with values of ['1011','1045','1141','1117','1021']. There was an initial increase from 1011 (Week10, 2022) to 1141 (Week12, 2022), followed by a slight reduction to 1117 (Week13, 2022) and 1021 (Week14, 2022). This inconsistency reflects variable trends in ILI activity during the observed period.
2. A clear correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the variability and general fluctuation within the past period align closely with increasing regional flu activity reported in CDC data. The upward trend in outpatient respiratory visits and overall healthcare burdens in Weeks 13–14, 2022, corresponds with the spike to 1809 future occurrences after 5 weeks.
3. The outpatient visits for ILI saw incremental increases during the 5-week period, starting at 1.7% (Week10, 2022) and rising gradually to 2.0% (Week14, 2022). This growth denotes escalating respiratory illness, which influenced the subsequent rise in ILI cases.
4. Mortality due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, ranging from 10.8% (Week10, 2022) to 7.1% (Week14, 2022). Although the percentage decreased slightly, the persistently high PIC-related mortality reinforced a heightened risk context for respiratory illnesses, propelling future ILI occurrences.
5. The dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), as stated in the summarized reports, accompanied by its antigenic drift and mismatched vaccine strains, likely contributed significantly to the observed future rise. Additionally, co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses during the same period compounded the health burden and ILI trends.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1809 (Week19, 2022) can be attributed to the fluctuating but increasing respired healthcare activity, outpatient ILI visit growth, persistent PIC mortality surpassing thresholds, dominance of influenza A(H3N2) with evidence of antigenic mismatch, and co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens in the weeks leading up to the reported spike.
