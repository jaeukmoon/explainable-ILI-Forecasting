1. The reported ILI counts from Week51, 2023 to Week3, 2024 are 15110, 17430, 13366, 10877, and 8551. This trend shows a sharp increase from Week51, 2023 (15110) to Week52, 2023 (17430), followed by a consistent and notable decline from Week52, 2023 (17430) to Week3, 2024 (8551). This pattern indicates a downturn in ILI occurrences after a rapid rise during the peak period, moving toward stabilization.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the next. Given that the target Week8, 2024 is beyond this time frame and considering the declining trend in ILI activity seen currently (Week2, 2024 #3; Week3, 2024 #5), Week8, 2024 most likely belongs to the off-season.
3. The time-series data reflects a steep decline during the last three weeks. Applying this pattern forward using a forecasting model influenced by historical data, we can expect further stabilization in ILI occurrences. The sharp drop after the Week52, 2023 peak indicates a tapering of transmission rates, with a projected count of 11000 aligning with the trajectory toward a lower, stable level in off-season activity.
4. CDC warns of a potential secondary peak following the winter holidays due to ongoing virus circulation (Week1, 2024 #10; Week2, 2024 #7), which could slow the decline temporarily but would not result in another dramatic surge by Week8, 2024.
5. Hospitalization metrics, while elevated, have seen steady decreases over the past three weeks (Week2, 2024 #4; Week3, 2024 #6), suggesting a similar trend of tapering for ILI activity.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses like RSV and SARS-CoV-2 continues to contribute to elevated ILI activity (Week2, 2024 #10; Week3, 2024 #10) but does not seem to be driving significant spikes, instead contributing to stabilizing trends.
7. Despite the well-matched vaccine to circulating strains, vaccination rates are ongoing but not optimal, potentially contributing to milder reductions in transmission (Week2, 2024 #9; Week3, 2024 #9). Combining the downward trend in hospitalization and ILI visits with contributing viral dynamics and off-season timing, the forecasted value of 11000 for Week8, 2024 is justified as consistent with expected continued decline.
