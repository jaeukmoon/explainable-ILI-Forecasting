1. The past time-series ILI occurrences across the 5 weeks showed a clear upward trend, with values ['1931', '1902', '1977', '2104', '2309']. Beginning with 1931 in Week 12, 2022, there was a small initial decline to 1902 by Week 13, 2022. However, subsequent weeks displayed consistent increases, reaching 2309 by Week 16, 2022, the highest in the observed period. This progression highlights a sustained rise in ILI activity leading up to Week 16.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 3593 (observed in Week 21, 2022) correlate strongly with the upward trajectory noted in Weeks 14–16, 2022. The constant weekly increases during this timeframe, particularly the jump from 2104 in Week 15 to 2309 in Week 16, reflect growing momentum in ILI activity, setting the stage for the eventual higher value of 3593 after five weeks.
3. The positivity rate for influenza in clinical labs rose steadily, from 6.5% (Week 12) to 7.8% (Week 16, 2022), indicating increasing viral activity nationwide. This escalation likely contributed to the amplified ILI cases observed in future weeks. Rising hospitalization rates associated with influenza, increasing weekly from 7.2 per 100,000 (Week 12) to 11.1 per 100,000 (Week 16, 2022), further highlight worsening illness severity and transmission trends. Outpatient respiratory illness visits also increased consistently, moving from 1.8% (Week 12) to 2.1% (Week 16, 2022). Although below the national baseline, this gradual rise aligns strongly with the later surge in ILI activity.
4. The dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), which accounted for more than 98.8% of influenza-positive specimens by Week 16, 2022, aligns with the rise in respiratory and ILI-related burdens. This highly transmissible strain's widespread prevalence drove higher illness activity during this period.
5. In summary, the reported 3593 future ILI occurrences (Week 21, 2022) result from a combination of the consistent upward trend in past ILI occurrences across Weeks 12–16, increasing outpatient respiratory visits, rising hospitalization rates, growing influenza positivity, and the predominance of the transmissible A(H3N2) strain. These factors collectively drove the sharp escalation in ILI activity noted after five weeks.
