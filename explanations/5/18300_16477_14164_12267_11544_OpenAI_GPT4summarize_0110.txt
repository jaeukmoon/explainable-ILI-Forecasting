1. The reported ILI counts from Week9 to Week13, 2024, are 18300, 16477, 14164, 12267, and 11544. The trend shows a steady decline in ILI cases week-over-week, with a noticeable reduction in occurrences, indicating a waning phase of influenza activity during this period. This clear downward trend suggests diminishing ILI activity heading into the next few weeks.
2. Week18, 2024, falls well outside the typical peak season, which usually spans from Week46 to about Week6 of the following year. Given the clear decline in ILI activity and the seasonal timing, Week18, 2024, is consistent with the off-season, characterized by reduced ILI activity and minimal community spread.
3. The time-series data presents a consistently declining trend, reflecting lower ILI occurrences each week. Projecting forward using this pattern of reduction, a continuation of the decline leads to the expectation of substantially reduced activity in Week18, 2024, stabilizing around 5698 occurrences. This aligns with typical off-season levels.
4. From the CDC reports, several factors strongly influence the forecast for Week18, 2024. First, the decreasing percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza (from 13.9% in Week9, 2024, to 9.1% in Week13, 2024) aligns with the decreasing observed ILI counts and suggests waning viral activity (Week9, 2024 #1; Week13, 2024 #1). Second, hospitalization rates, although high earlier in the season, are declining consistently (Week9, 2024 #4; Week13, 2024 #5), indicating reduced severe case burdens. Third, widespread co-circulation of influenza with other respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and RSV has likely contributed to elevated activity earlier but is now diminishing as flu activity declines (Week9, 2024 #10; Week13, 2024 #11).
5. Other supporting factors include the continuing effectiveness of the seasonal flu vaccination, which is well-matched to circulating strains, and stable antiviral susceptibility across influenza types (Week9, 2024 #8; Week13, 2024 #9; Week13, 2024 #10). Additionally, despite regional variations, the national trend for outpatient visits shows a continuous decline from 4.1% in Week9, 2024, to 3.0% in Week13, 2024 (Week9, 2024 #3; Week13, 2024 #7), further indicating decreasing ILI activity.
6. The classification of Week18, 2024, as part of the off-season is reinforced by the consistent declines across key influenza indicators, including positivity rates, hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and respiratory illness visits, alongside minimal impact from novel influenza variants reported in Week12, 2024 (Week12, 2024 #6).
7. In summary, the prediction of 5698 ILI occurrences for Week18, 2024, is supported by the observed downward trend from past weeks, alignment with off-season dynamics, decreasing positivity rates, and declining hospitalization and outpatient ILI metrics. Effective vaccination coverage and lack of significant antiviral resistance further aid in controlling flu spread, justifying the forecasted value.
