1. Explanation:
1. The past ILI occurrences from Week26, 2021 to Week30, 2021, are as follows: 1376 → 1469 → 1659 → 1859 → 2036. These values show a steady and consistent **increasing trend**, with week-to-week increments of +93, +190, +200, and +177, respectively. The average weekly increment across these weeks is calculated as: (93 + 190 + 200 + 177) ÷ 4 = 165. Given this consistent growth pattern, projecting forward five weeks to Week35, 2021, would require continuing this average increase (165) over each of the subsequent weeks starting from Week30, 2021 (2036). Hence, the projection for Week35, 2021, is:
2. Week31: 2036 + 165 = 2201
3. Week32: 2201 + 165 = 2366
4. Week33: 2366 + 165 = 2531
5. Week34: 2531 + 165 = 2696
6. Week35: 2696 + 165 = 2861.
7. However, additional adjustments must incorporate external influencing factors, which are considered below.
2. Week35, 2021, aligns with the **Peak onset season**, as it falls within the period when flu activity typically begins to intensify (Week32–Week46). The presence of sustained increases in ILI occurrences over the past five weeks and CDC acknowledgment of potential future shifts due to respiratory illnesses (Week30, 2021) further reinforces this classification. This implies that growing ILI activity in early Peak onset seasons deserves moderate amplification compared to historical trends.
3. Using correlation analysis, the historical trend’s steady increase correlates strongly with expected outputs for Week35, 2021. Applying time-series forecasting methods, continuation of an average growth rate (+165 per week) would predict 2861. However, the observed **accelerated upward trend** seen in the last three weeks (+190, +200, and +177) compared to earlier weeks hints at stronger momentum toward Week35, suggesting a slightly higher projection than basic linear extrapolation. Therefore, applying a weighted growth adjustment of approximately 5% results in a more refined Week35 forecast: 2861 × (1.05) = 3004.
4. Three distinct CDC-reported factors strongly influencing the forecast are:
5. a. **Increase in outpatient respiratory illness visits:** Week30, 2021, notes a steady rise in ILI outpatient visits over the prior three weeks, attributed to increased respiratory illness transmission, though not necessarily dominated by influenza. This suggests increased transmission rates will likely drive more ILI cases in Week35, pushing occurrences further above trendline expectations (approximate upward shift of +2.5%).
6. b. **Minimal influenza circulation but dynamic respiratory patterns:** Week26–Week30 summaries highlight low influenza positivity, but COVID-19 and alternative healthcare behaviors complicate trend interpretation. The CDC emphasizes caution but expects future uncertainties (e.g., slight upward adjustments of +1.5–2%).
7. c. **Seasonality:** Week35 falls in the Peak onset season, during which coordinated increases in community disease spread are traditionally expected. This seasonal factor alone justifies a slightly amplified growth pattern (approx. +3.5%).
5. By incorporating both quantitative trends and qualitative CDC factors, the predicted Week35 occurrences are adjusted from the baseline projection of 2861 to:
6. 2861 × (1 + 0.025 + 0.02 + 0.035) = 2964 (rounded). This final prediction reflects the interaction of a steady upward trend, seasonal influences, and CDC-indicated uncertainties in respiratory activity behaviors.
