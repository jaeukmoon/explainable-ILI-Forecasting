1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating pattern followed by a significant rise, with values of ['1228', '1203', '1223', '1170', '1408']. There was a decline from 1228 (Week 44, 2021) to 1170 (Week 47, 2021), but a notable increase to 1408 (Week 48, 2021), the highest in the sequence. This upward shift in the last week indicates a resurgence of ILI activity, pointing to a possible continuation of this trend into future weeks.
2. The increase in weekly ILI occurrences during Week 48, 2021 aligns with the reported future surge to 3033 occurrences in Week 53, 2021. The sharp rise in the final observed week may act as a precursor to the escalation in future occurrences, demonstrating a correlation between the late-week variability in the past data and the significant increase reported 5 weeks later.
3. The proportion of outpatient visits for ILI rose from 2.1% (Week 44, 2021) to 2.5% (Week 48, 2021), reaching the national baseline. This steady rise in ILI-related health measures suggests increasing activity, likely contributing to the future increase to 3033 occurrences. Laboratory-confirmed hospitalization cases also rose from 295 (Week 44, 2021) to 841 (Week 48, 2021), reflecting a growing burden of ILI-related illnesses likely influencing the observed surge. The high and increasing deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), which rose from 14.1% (Week 44, 2021) to 17.5% (Week 48, 2021), exceeding epidemic thresholds, underscores heightened respiratory illness activity correlating with the sharp increase. Most ILI activity was linked to Influenza A(H3N2), particularly among ages 5-24, consistent with the spike reported after 5 weeks.
4. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, as documented across all weeks, further complicated surveillance and may have contributed to amplifying ILI occurrence data due to overlapping symptoms in reported cases. Vaccination efforts, although substantial during this period (rising from 158.7M doses in Week 44, 2021 to 166.9M doses in Week 48, 2021), may not have immediately offset the observed ILI increase, as uptake trends appeared lower than in prior seasons.
5. The reported future ILI occurrences of 3033 in Week 53, 2021, can be explained by the significant rise in Week 48, 2021, corresponding increases in outpatient ILI visits and hospitalizations, persistently elevated PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses. Together, these factors highlight a systemic escalation in respiratory illness activity likely driving the observed future increase.
