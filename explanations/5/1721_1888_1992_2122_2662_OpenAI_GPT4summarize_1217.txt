1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1721', '1888', '1992', '2122', '2662']. Beginning in Week30, 2023, at 1721, there was a steady increase each week, culminating in 2662 by Week34, 2023. This upward trend over the observed period reflects a growing intensity of influenza-like illness.
2. A strong positive correlation between the past ILI occurrences and the future value of 4126 can be inferred, as the continuous rise from Week30, 2023, to Week34, 2023, suggests persisting and increasing influenza-like activity, which extrapolates into the future data (Week39, 2023). The clear upward trajectory in the last recorded weeks signals momentum leading into the higher future value.
3. The outpatient visits for ILI rose consistently, from 1.2% in Week30, 2023, to 1.7% in Week34, 2023, with the highest rates in children aged 0–4 years. These increases directly indicate heightened healthcare encounters for respiratory illnesses, fueling future ILI occurrences. The pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) mortality percentages remained persistently high, exceeding epidemic thresholds in all weeks, rising from 5.7% in Week30, 2023, to 6.5% in Week34, 2023. This aligns with continuing rises in respiratory illness severity. Hospital admissions for influenza steadily increased as well, from 649 admissions in Week30, 2023, to 779 admissions in Week34, 2023. The growth in hospitalizations signifies a rising burden of illness corresponding to influenza-like activity.
4. Continued co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, as highlighted in each week’s summary, compounded influenza-like illness activity by contributing to the overall respiratory disease burden. This multifactorial interaction likely amplified the surge in future ILI occurrences.
5. In summary, the reported 4126 future ILI occurrences (Week39, 2023) reflect the steady upward trend observed in Weeks30–34, 2023, increasing outpatient ILI visits and growing PIC mortality rates exceeding epidemic thresholds. Rising hospitalizations and the compounded impact of co-circulating respiratory viruses further contributed to the sharp increase, underscoring an escalating burden of influenza-like illness over time.
