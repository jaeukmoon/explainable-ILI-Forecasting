1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent upward trend, with values increasing from 1464 (Week 40, 2023) to 2172 (Week 44, 2023). There was a steady growth, with the most significant jumps occurring between Week 42 (1897) and Week 44 (2172). This continuous rise suggests growing influenza activity during the observed period.
2. A clear positive correlation exists between the past time-series ILI data and the future occurrences after 5 weeks. The progressive rise in Weeks 43–44, 2023, mirrors the sustained increase leading to 4188 ILI occurrences after Week 49, 2023. The sharp escalation observed toward the end of the past data signals heightened respiratory illness activity, potentially forecasting the future surge.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI have been gradually climbing each week, starting from 2.2% (Week 40, 2023) and peaking at the baseline of 2.9% (Week 44, 2023)—the national threshold for influenza activity. This steady increase in healthcare visits aligns with the future rise in ILI occurrences. Deaths attributed to influenza also steadily climbed, from 0.05% in Week 40, 2023, to 0.09% in Week 44, 2023, signaling worsening respiratory outcomes. Increasing regional positivity rates in specific jurisdictions and co-circulation of respiratory viruses (influenza A(H1N1), Influenza B, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2), mentioned frequently in the reports, likely contributed indirectly to the surging ILI rates.
4. Elevated hospitalization trends, such as the rise from 0.1 per 100,000 (Week 40, 2023) to 1.2 per 100,000 (Week 44, 2023), correlate strongly with the uptick in ILI cases. These figures reflect an increasing burden within healthcare systems, consistent with the observed future jump in ILI activity. Furthermore, the heightened activity in high-population regions (e.g., Southeast, South Central) noted by Week 44, 2023, may act as essential contributing factors for the rise to 4188 occurrences by Week 49, 2023.
5. In summary, the future rise to 4188 occurrences can be attributed to the consistent upward trend in past ILI data, increasing healthcare visits for respiratory ailments, growing death and hospitalization patterns, the co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, and the expanding regional influenza activity observed in the summarized reports. These multi-factorial drivers converged to explain the substantial rise in ILI activity over the 5-week period.
