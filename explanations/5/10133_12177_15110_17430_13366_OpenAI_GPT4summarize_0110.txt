1. The reported ILI counts from Week49, 2023 to Week1, 2024 are 10133, 12177, 15110, 17430, and 13366. The trend shows a rapid increase in activity from Week49 (10133) to Week51 (17430), reaching a peak, followed by a significant decline in Week1 (13366). Overall, this indicates a sharp rise during the peak season, followed by an expected normalization as activity begins to stabilize.
2. As Week6, 2024 is the end of the typical peak season in the U.S., it is consistent to forecast that it falls within the peak season, given the ongoing elevated influenza activity seen in the Week1, 2024 data and trends in prior seasons.
3. From a time-series perspective, past patterns of rapid increases followed by normalization suggest that occurrences will further decline from the peak seen during Week51, 2023, but remain elevated within peak season levels. Models forecast that Week6, 2024 will exhibit ILI occurrences slightly above baseline but below the mid-peak levels, projecting normalization around 10157 occurrences.
4. Influenza positivity increased sharply during Week49, 2023 (10.2%) to Week52, 2023 (17.5%), but stabilized slightly in Week1, 2024. This stabilization aligns with the decline in ILI occurrences observed in Week1, 2024 (13366) and supports a projected continued decrease (Week49 #2; Week50 #1; Week51 #1; Week52 #1).
5. Nationwide hospitalization rates were elevated during Week49-Week52, 2023 but have recently shown signs of slowing (Week1, 2024 cumulative rate = 31.7 per 100,000, with weekly hospitalizations decreasing to 18,526 compared to prior weeks). This decline supports the expectation of lower ILI activity in Week6, 2024 compared to earlier peak-period weeks (Week49 #4; Week50 #4; Week51 #5; Week52 #4; Week1 #4).
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, has contributed to elevated respiratory illness visits and unpredictable ILI trends, but no novel influenza viruses have been detected, and vaccine effectiveness remains high against the predominant A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype, mitigating a potential resurgence beyond Week6, 2024 (Week49 #9; Week50 #8; Week51 #9; Week52 #10; Week1 #9).
7. The reduced ILI count of 10157 for Week6, 2024 reflects the composite influence of declining but still elevated ILI positivity, reduced hospitalizations, highly effective vaccination coverage against Influenza A(H1N1), and the conclusion of typical peak season patterns. These factors align with a gradual return to lower activity typical of the transition toward the off-season.
