1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a moderate fluctuation with a slight downward trend in the latter weeks, with values of ['1300', '1301', '1524', '1503', '1464']. There was an increase from 1300 (Week 36, 2023) to 1524 (Week 38, 2023), followed by a slight decline to 1464 in Week 40, 2023. The fluctuating trend indicates variability in ILI occurrences, but no strong upward momentum was present by the end of the observed period.
2. Despite the absence of a pronounced upward trajectory in the past data, the future ILI occurrences at 2707 point to a delayed increase in activity beyond Week 40, 2023. This suggests a potential lag effect where earlier fluctuations in ILI activity may have contributed to the subsequent rise in Week 45, 2023 due to incubation periods, delays in reporting, or compounding seasonal factors.
3. Hospitalizations for confirmed influenza-like illnesses steadily rose from 775 (Week 36, 2023) to 1127 (Week 40, 2023), reflecting an increasing burden on healthcare systems. This rise aligns with the potential amplification of ILI occurrences seen in Week 45, 2023 as it signals escalating severity despite low baseline activity.
4. Outpatient respiratory illness visits remained stable or slightly increased, with rates for children aged 0-4 years growing from 6.5% (Week 36, 2023) to 7.1% (Week 39, 2023). These consistently high rates, particularly in vulnerable pediatric groups, contribute substantially to the uptick in future ILI occurrences reflecting increased healthcare-seeking behavior for respiratory illnesses.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV, was repeatedly highlighted in the CDC reports, indicating that non-influenza contributors likely played a role in elevating ILI occurrences from Week 36 to Week 45, 2023. This interplay heightened overall respiratory illness activity, supporting the observed future increase.
6. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained above the epidemic threshold throughout Weeks 36–40, 2023 (7.0% to 7.3%), reflecting persistent respiratory illness severity. This consistent excess mortality indirectly signals an elevated burden of illnesses that correlates with the reported future spike in ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 2707 future ILI occurrences (Week 45, 2023) can be attributed to the interplay of moderate fluctuations in prior weeks, a lagged correlation indicating delayed accumulation, rising hospitalization rates, increased outpatient respiratory visits among children, co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, and persistent excess PIC mortality indicators throughout Weeks 36–40, 2023.
