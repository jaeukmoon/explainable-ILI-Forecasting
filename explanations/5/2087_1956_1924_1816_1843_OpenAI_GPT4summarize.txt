1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but overall minimal downward trend, transitioning from 2087 (Week 14, 2021) to 1843 (Week 18, 2021). A notable decrease was observed from 2087 in Week 14 to 1816 in Week 17, followed by a minor uptick to 1843 in Week 18. This suggests a relatively stable but slightly lowering level of ILI activity during this period, likely indicative of non-typical seasonality or external factors dampening ILI occurrences.  

2. The future ILI occurrences, reported as 1929 (Week 23, 2021), align with the relatively stable ILI trend observed during the past 5 weeks. The modest rise from 1816 (Week 17, 2021) to 1843 (Week 18, 2021) precedes the slight increase to 1929 after 5 weeks. This suggests a weak positive correlation between the stabilizing ILI activity in the last observed weeks and the small elevation in the future ILI data.  

3. Multiple factors in the CDC reports correlate with the future occurrence of 1929, including:  
   - **Minimal ILI outpatient visits**: For all 5 weeks, outpatient ILI visits consistently remained at 1.1% or 1.2% below the threshold baseline of 2.6%, indicating limited but persistent influenza-like illness activity across jurisdictions, which aligns with the stable ILI numbers.  
   - **Low positivity rates for influenza**: Clinical lab influenza positivity rates were consistently 0.1%, with minimal public health lab detections across weeks, suggesting limited influenza-specific activity as a contributor to ILI trends.  
   - **Overlapping impact of COVID-19**: Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold (e.g., 12.4% in Week 15 to 10.9% in Week 18), primarily driven by COVID-19. This overlap complicates ILI surveillance, contributing to an underrepresentation or shifting of traditional influenza activity trends.  
   - **Behavioral and healthcare-seeking disruptions**: Changes in healthcare access and behaviors due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic likely impacted ILI reporting consistency and future predictions.  

4. In summary, the reported future occurrence of 1929 ILI cases (Week 23, 2021) can be attributed to the relatively stable yet slightly declining trend in past weeks, modest increases toward Week 18, consistently low influenza-specific activity as confirmed by lab results, impacts from COVID-19 as a confounding factor, and disruptions in healthcare-seeking and reporting behaviors during this period. These combined factors sustained a steady but marginal increase in reported ILI cases after 5 weeks.
