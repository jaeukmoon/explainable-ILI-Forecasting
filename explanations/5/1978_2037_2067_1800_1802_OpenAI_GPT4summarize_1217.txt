1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an unsteady trend, with values of ['1978', '2037', '2067', '1800', '1802']. The data indicate an initial increase from 1978 (Week 39, 2021) to a peak of 2067 (Week 41, 2021), followed by a sharp decrease to 1800 (Week 42, 2021) and a slight rise to 1802 (Week 43, 2021). This fluctuating trend reflects varying respiratory illness dynamics across the 5 weeks.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 3646 (Week 48, 2021) exhibit a notable increase compared to the past data. The rise suggests a possible delayed effect of growing respiratory illness activity underlying the early peak of 2067 (Week 41, 2021) that eventually materialized into heightened ILI occurrences after 5 weeks, despite a decline observed in the latter weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable but below baseline, consistently at 1.8%-1.9% from Week 39 to Week 43, 2021. This persistence, coupled with the gradual rise in laboratory-confirmed influenza positives (from 0.1% of specimens in Week 39 to 0.2% in Week 43, 2021), indicates emerging respiratory illness trends contributing to the ILI surge.
4. Elevated deaths associated with pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), consistently above the epidemic threshold, fell from 18.7% (Week 39, 2021) to 15.6% (Week 43, 2021). Despite this gradual decline, the persistently high PIC proportions likely reflect ongoing respiratory disease burden, correlating with the subsequent rise in ILI activity.
5. CDC-reported changes in healthcare-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, documented throughout Weeks 39–43, 2021, complicated surveillance interpretations. These disruptions may have obscured real-time ILI trends, potentially delaying recognition of the eventual surge to 3646 occurrences in Week 48, 2021.
6. Minimal vaccination updates and limited influenza virus circulation during Weeks 39–43, 2021, underscore the role of other respiratory pathogens in driving ILI activity. The rise in respiratory illness trends during Week 43, 2021, signals increasing pathogen activity, suggesting a compound factor leading to the jump in Week 48, 2021.
7. In summary, the reported 3646 future ILI occurrences (Week 48, 2021) can be attributed to the unsteady trend in Weeks 39–43, 2021, increasing ILI-related outpatient visits, persistently high PIC mortality, delayed surveillance interpretations, and emerging respiratory illness activity potentially driven by non-flu pathogens in a low-flu circulation environment.
