1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks indicated a consistent upward trend, with values of ['2036', '2285', '2456', '2751', '3178']. The progression shows a continuous rise in ILI activity from Week30, 2021 (2036) to Week34, 2021 (3178), with substantial increases in the latter weeks, suggesting an intensification of respiratory illness activity leading into the future period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the rising trajectory in the past weeks culminates in the future occurrence of 2639 after 5 weeks. The high peak observed in Week34, 2021 (3178) contrasts with a slight moderation in future data, likely reflecting ongoing impacts of the preceding trend.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI steadily grew over the 5-week period, increasing from 1.9% in Week30, 2021, to 2.2% in Week34, 2021, with consistent increases across all age groups, particularly children and younger adults. The contributing impact of healthcare visits aligns with the rise in future ILI occurrences, signifying heightened respiratory illness transmission. Elevated PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) mortality, climbing from 9.0% in Week30 to 19.4% in Week34, 2021, revealed persistently heightened respiratory-related deaths, driven primarily by COVID-19, indirectly reinforcing the future ILI pattern. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, noted across the summaries, interfered with traditional surveillance systems and amplified ILI reporting, further bolstering the future occurrence increase.
4. Despite minimal influenza-specific activity and low positivity rates for influenza across all 5 weeks (e.g., 0.1% in Week34, 2021), non-influenza respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 are more likely responsible for the increased ILI trend. The interaction between rising respiratory illnesses and altered surveillance contributed significantly to future occurrences.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence of 2639 can be attributed to the preceding upward trend in Weeks30-34, 2021, an incremental rise in ILI-related outpatient visits, the persistently high PIC mortality far surpassing epidemic thresholds, and compounding factors like healthcare behavior shifts and non-influenza respiratory virus activity.
