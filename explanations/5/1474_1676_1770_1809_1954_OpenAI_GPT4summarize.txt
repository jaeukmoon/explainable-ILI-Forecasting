1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend. Starting at 1474 (Week 16, 2022), the cases progressively increased through 1676 (Week 17), 1770 (Week 18), 1809 (Week 19), and peaked at 1954 (Week 20, 2022). This continuous escalation highlights heightened respiratory illness activity during the observed period.

2. The future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks, at 1543, correlate with the upward trend seen in the historical data. However, a decrease from the peak value of Week 20, 2022 (1954), is noted. This decline is likely influenced by the moderating trends in ILI-related outpatient visits and reduced influenza positivity later in the observed period, as reported in the CDC summaries.

3. Nationwide outpatient visits for ILI steadily increased from 2.1% (Week 16, 2022) to 2.4% (Week 19 and 20, 2022), though the rate remained below baseline levels. This steady rise in healthcare encounters signals continued ILI activity capable of influencing future occurrences.

4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, rising from 6.8% (Week 16, 2022) to 8.0% (Week 20, 2022). Although most deaths were due to COVID-19, the persistent respiratory illness burden aligns with elevated ILI trends.

5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, was documented (e.g., 4.5% of influenza-positive specimens also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Week 19 and Week 20, 2022). Such co-infections likely sustained ILI activity while contributing to complex case dynamics.

6. In summary, the reported 1543 future ILI occurrences (Week 25, 2022) can be attributed to the consistent upward trajectory in Weeks 16–20, 2022, reflected in rising ILI outpatient visits, PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, the co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and eventual stabilization of contributing factors post-peak activity.
