1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall fluctuating trend with values ['1541', '1543', '1531', '1502', '1743']. From 1541 in Week32, 2021, there was a slight increase to 1543 in Week33, 2021, followed by a decline to 1531 in Week34, 2021, and 1502 in Week35, 2021. However, there was a notable spike to 1743 in Week36, 2021, indicating a potential resurgence in ILI activity during the later weeks of the period.
2. A positive correlation between past ILI occurrences and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the sharp increase in Week36, 2021, acts as a precursor to the further rise to 2067 occurrences after 5 weeks. The upward trend observed toward the final weeks of the past data suggests a continuation of rising ILI patterns into the future.
3. Outpatient ILI visits remained below the national baseline but showed gradual increases during the observation period, such as rises in ILI percentages for children aged 0-4 and 5-24 (2.1% in Week32 to 2.3% in Week36, 2021). This growth corresponds to amplified respiratory illness activity, likely contributing to higher future ILI occurrences.
4. COVID-19-driven PIC (Pneumonia, Influenza, and COVID-19) mortalities consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, peaking at 21.0% in Week36, 2021. This elevated respiratory illness burden, dominated by non-influenza viruses like SARS-CoV-2, supports the correlation between higher PIC rates and increased future ILI events.
5. Simultaneous circulation of non-influenza viruses (e.g., reported low influenza positivity rates of 0.1% in Week34 and Week36, 2021) and altered healthcare-seeking behaviors during the pandemic disrupted traditional surveillance systems. These factors likely amplified the reported respiratory illnesses, aligning with the observed rise to 2067 occurrences after 5 weeks.
6. In summary, the reported 2067 future ILI occurrences can be explained by the spike in Week36, 2021, increasing outpatient ILI visits among key age groups, excessive PIC mortality primarily due to COVID-19, and the influence of non-influenza viruses and pandemic-driven changes in healthcare-seeking and surveillance dynamics. These interconnected patterns drove the observed surge in occurrences.
