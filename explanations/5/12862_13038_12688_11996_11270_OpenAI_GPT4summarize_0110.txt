1. The reported ILI counts from Week19, 2024 to Week23, 2024 are 12862, 13038, 12688, 11996, and 11270. The trend indicates a consistent decline over the past five weeks after the initial peak in Week20, 2024. This reflects a gradual reduction in ILI occurrences, suggesting decreasing overall activity.
2. Week28, 2024 corresponds to the off-season. In the U.S., off-season spans from immediately after the peak season (Week6, 2024) to the onset of the next peak onset period (Week32, 2024). Weekly CDC reports from Week19, 2024 to Week23, 2024 confirm low influenza metrics and no evidence of increasing activity, consistent with off-season patterns.
3. The observed time-series data suggests a clear downward trajectory from Week19, 2024 to Week23, 2024, with no abrupt fluctuations or resurgence. This decline predicts a continuation of low activity in subsequent weeks. Projected forward to Week28, 2024, the extrapolation aligns with off-season activity levels, explaining the forecasted ILI occurrences of 8129.
4. From the CDC reports:
5. - Nationwide influenza activity remains low, with positivity rates declining from 2.4% in Week19, 2024 to 1.6% by Week23, 2024, reflecting reduced transmission.
6. - Vaccination patterns remain steady, with circulating strains well-matched to vaccines, offering protective coverage and reducing ILI occurrences.
7. - Co-circulating factors (Influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV) contribute variably to respiratory illnesses, but no novel influenza strains or significant co-infection trends have emerged to drive a spike in cases.
5. Antiviral susceptibility remains stable with minimal resistance observed, ensuring effective treatment options remain available and curbing potential severe outcomes and widespread cases.
6. Mortality trends attributed to influenza are stable at 0.1% over the past five weeks, coupled with a low hospitalization rate (0.1-0.2 per 100,000 population), further confirming subdued influenza activity.
7. Based on sustained declining ILI trends, the classification of Week28, 2024 as off-season, protective vaccination matching, low hospitalization and mortality rates, and the absence of significant driving factors like novel strain emergence or treatment resistance, the future ILI occurrences of 8129 are justified as a logical continuation of current epidemiological conditions.
