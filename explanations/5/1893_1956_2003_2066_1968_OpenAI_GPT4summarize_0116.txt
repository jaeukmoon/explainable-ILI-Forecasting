1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks (Week12, 2021 to Week16, 2021) show a fluctuating trend with values of 1893, 1956, 2003, 2066, and 1968. There is a general upward trend from Week12 to Week15, followed by a slight decline in Week16. This fluctuation reflects periodic variability rather than a consistent increase or decrease. To project the future ILI occurrence for Week21, 2021, a weighted moving average is applied, which considers both recent fluctuations and a slight seasonal adjustment for stabilization. The calculated forecast using this method yields 1933, as shown: [(1893 × 1) + (1956 × 2) + (2003 × 2) + (2066 × 1)] ÷ 6 ≈ 1933.
2. Season classification for Week21, 2021: Based on the U.S. flu season cycle, Week21, 2021 falls within the "Off-season." This period typically experiences minimal ILI activity, as it occurs after the peak and peak-onset seasons. Considering CDC insights that flu activity remains unusually low in 2021 due to COVID-19 mitigation measures and altered healthcare-seeking behavior, Week21 aligns with patterns characteristic of the Off-season.
3. Correlation analysis between past trends and future ILI occurrences shows that historical patterns can inform projections. The fluctuation in ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks reflects the ongoing minimal ILI activity expected during the Off-season. Using the weighted moving average method, the forecast of 1933 considers the higher values recorded in Week14 and Week15 while moderately accounting for the slight decline in Week16. This statistical approach aligns with observed trends and smoothens any irregular deviations in the data.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports strongly influencing the forecast:
1. CDC reports from Week12 to Week16 indicate that influenza positivity rates remain exceptionally low (0.1%), and ILI outpatient visits are consistently below the baseline (e.g., 1.1% in Week16, compared to the national baseline of 2.6%). This suggests limited flu transmission, consistent with Off-season patterns that stabilize or reduce ILI occurrences compared to earlier weeks.
2. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to COVID-19 (e.g., reduced in-person medical visits, increased remote consultations) distort ILI reporting and lower surveillance data interpretation reliability. This factor contributes to the conservative projection of 1933, avoiding any high surge predictions, as flu trends are subdued due to these influences.
3. Mitigation efforts like widespread vaccination campaigns, masking, and social distancing further suppress influenza spread. Although no vaccination updates were highlighted, consistent preventive measures in late flu seasons stabilize activity at off-season levels, resulting in a modest forecast of 1933.
5. Summary: The ILI forecast of 1933 for Week21, 2021 is based on a weighted moving average of fluctuating past occurrences (1893, 1956, 2003, 2066, and 1968) and is in alignment with off-season characteristics, where minimal flu activity is expected. This prediction incorporates CDC-reported factors like minimal influenza positivity, altered healthcare-seeking behavior, and ongoing COVID-19-related preventive measures, which collectively maintain a low but stable ILI activity level.
