1. The ILI occurrences from Week16, 2023 to Week20, 2023 show a clear decreasing trend: 1264 → 1205 → 1083 → 1070 → 1056. Over the past 5 weeks, the reduction in ILI occurrences is consistent and gradual, with an average weekly decrease of approximately 52. This trend suggests a steady decline, characteristic of the off-season when influenza activity tends to decrease towards baseline levels. Extrapolating this decline over the next 5 weeks, we estimate a decrease of 260 (52 × 5) from 1056, which equals 796. However, additional considerations from CDC reports and current influenza dynamics further refine this value.
2. Week25, 2023 belongs to the off-season. Based on Background Knowledge, the off-season typically spans from after the Peak season (Week6, 2023) through the beginning of the Peak onset season (Week32, 2023). Influenza activity in the off-season is typically minimal, with occurrences decreasing or stabilizing towards baseline. The low influenza positivity rates from recent weeks (0.8%-1.1%) and below-baseline ILI rates (1.9%-2.0%) coincide with an off-season classification.
3. Historical time-series trends and correlation analyses suggest that the future ILI occurrences will likely continue to decline. The average percentage decrease over the past 5 weeks was approximately 4.5% per week: [(1264 - 1056) ÷ 1264] ÷ 5 ≈ 0.045 (or 4.5%). Applying this rate of decline weekly over the next 5 weeks results in a projected value of 978: 1056 × (1 - 0.045)^5 ≈ 978. This decline aligns with lower overall respiratory activity observed during the off-season, as well as historical data indicative of gradual reductions post-peak influenza periods.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports support the prediction of 978 ILI occurrences:
1. Influenza positivity rates remain low (0.8%-1.1% from Week16 to Week20, 2023), suggesting limited viral circulation. This helps sustain the gradual decline observed in ILI occurrences.
2. Stable and below-baseline ILI outpatient visit percentages (1.9%-2.0% below the 2.5% national threshold) suggest minimal community spread and a lack of factors that might cause rapid increases in occurrences, maintaining the declining trend.
3. Widespread vaccination effectiveness and antigenic similarity of circulating strains to the vaccine prevent significant surges in ILI occurrences. These factors, combined with low hospitalization rates and declining PIC deaths, indicate that influenza activity will remain subdued.
5. In summary, the decreasing trend in time-series data, off-season classification of Week25, and evidence of low virologic activity, effective vaccination, and stable respiratory illness rates collectively forecast ILI occurrences of 978. The quantitative decline rate (4.5% weekly) estimated from historical data directly supports this prediction, aligning with the consistent decline during the off-season.
