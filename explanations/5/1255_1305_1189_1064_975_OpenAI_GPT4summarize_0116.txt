1. Explanation:
1. The trend in the past 5 weeks of ILI occurrences (Week35, 2021 to Week39, 2021) shows a consistent decrease: 1255, 1305, 1189, 1064, and 975. This decline averages a weekly drop of approximately `(1255 - 975)/4 = 70 cases per week` over 4 weeks. However, the decrease is slowing; for example, the largest drop occurs between Week38 and Week39 (from 1064 to 975, a difference of 89), while earlier weekly reductions average in the range of 60-70 cases. These patterns suggest that the weekly declines will lessen, potentially stabilizing in future weeks as the ILI activity approaches baseline levels.
2. Season Classification for Week44, 2021: Based on the flu season cycle, Week44, 2021 falls in the "Peak onset season." The peak onset season is the period when ILI activity starts increasing from baseline toward peak levels (approximately Week35 to Week46). However, the CDC reports indicate minimal influenza activity with low positivity rates, suggesting delayed or suppressed seasonal acceleration. Nevertheless, the classification remains consistent with a potential upward trend typical for this portion of the flu season.
3. Correlation analysis with historical patterns indicates that a slowing decline is consistent with previous years during the peak onset season. While the drops in ILI occurrences from Week35 to Week39 reflect interseasonal trends, the transition to Week44 implies a plateau or slight rise due to seasonal influences. Extrapolating based on a projected deceleration of declines, the reduction rate diminishes to around 23% compared to the earlier weekly decrease average (70 per week). Using past data and considering a change in trend, the 5-week forecast anticipates a rebound closer to 1084.
4. Several key CDC report factors inform this prediction:
5. (1) Testing and surveillance data across all 5 weeks (Week35 to Week39) confirm limited influenza circulation and ILI positivity rates (<0.1%). This suggests that while the ILI occurrences remain suppressed by non-influenza drivers, baseline levels will likely stabilize or recover slightly due to environmental conditions (e.g., seasonal patterns) driving activity. For example, if 5% of ILI occurrences are anticipated to align with peak onset adjustments (adding back ~50 cases), this contributes to plateauing.
6. (2) Vaccination updates stressed flu protection efforts but noted low coverage or shifts influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. This leaves populations less protected than ideal, progressively supporting mild increases by Week44 as the season develops. This adds approximately 3-4% or 30-40 occurrences.
7. (3) External respiratory viral activity, including concurrent COVID-19 circulation, skews low-flu ILI data but is decreasing in dominance through Week39 (as seen by declining PIC deaths driven by COVID-19). This creates space for seasonal influenza activity, influencing a mild upward contribution of 10-20 cases towards the prediction.
5. In summary, the forecasted ILI occurrences for Week44, 2021, are calculated by combining the trend analysis, seasonal classification, and adjustments based on CDC report factors. Averaging past data (975) and compensating for a plateauing trend due to peak onset season (+109), the projected future value is approximately 1084. This reflects the transition dynamics of respiratory activity and aligns with CDC's expectations of low-to-stabilizing seasonal changes.
