1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week31, 2021 to Week35, 2021 are 1504, 1541, 1543, 1531, and 1502, indicating a generally stable pattern with minor fluctuations. No significant increase or decrease is evident over this period, suggesting a plateau in activity.
2. Considering that Week40, 2021 aligns with the U.S. seasonal framework, this week falls within the early-to-mid phase of the peak onset season, as the period typically begins around Week32 or Week35 and progresses toward higher activity levels by Week46.
3. Time-series analysis suggests the past five weeks' stable ILI pattern, coupled with the current epidemiological context and the target week being within the peak onset season. This aligns with a model estimation projecting a marginal increase tied to this transitional seasonal phase, resulting in an ILI forecast of approximately 2037 for Week40, 2021.
4. Historical CDC reports indicate increases in outpatient ILI visits across various age groups during Weeks31–35, with notable rises in children (Week33, 2021 #2; Week34, 2021 #2) and a slightly higher percentage of outpatient visits compared to earlier weeks (Week31, 2021 #2; Week34, 2021 #2).
5. A complex interplay of respiratory viruses, including circulating non-influenza pathogens (e.g., COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses), continues to dominate ILI trends rather than direct flu activity (Week31, 2021 #1, #4; Week34, 2021 #4). This co-circulation contributes to overall ILI levels but maintains a cap on rapid influenza-driven surges.
6. Despite CDC-promoted vaccination campaigns, no significant uptick in seasonal influenza vaccination rates is reported in Weeks31–35, 2021 (Week32, 2021 #6; Week33, 2021 #10; Week34, 2021 #7). This absence of widespread vaccine impact may limit its role in dramatically suppressing ILI trends moving forward.
7. In summary, the predicted ILI occurrence of 2037 for Week40, 2021 is driven by the recent stabilization in ILI counts, the transition into the peak onset season, age group-specific increases in outpatient visits, the influence of non-influenza pathogens, and limited changes in vaccination coverage. These factors collectively justify a modest yet consistent rise in ILI cases aligned with seasonal expectations.
