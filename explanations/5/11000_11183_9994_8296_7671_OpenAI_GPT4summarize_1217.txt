1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a consistent decline: 11000 (Week 8, 2024) to 7671 (Week 12, 2024), reflecting a notable drop in ILI activity. A significant decrease was observed between Week 9 (11183) and Week 12 (7671), signaling a downward trend in reported ILI cases.
2. A strong correlation between the declining ILI occurrences in the past 5 weeks and the future occurrence of 4753 is evident. The sustained downward trend between Weeks 8–12, 2024, aligns with the reduced activity reported after 5 weeks, confirming the continuation of the decline.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually decreased from 4.4% (Week 8, 2024) to 3.1% (Week 12, 2024), indicating a steady reduction in respiratory illness activity, contributing to fewer reported cases. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2, was noted to complicate ILI trends. However, with influenza activity decreasing, this cross-viral influence likely impacted the ILI reduction. National hospitalization rates for influenza progressively declined from Week 8 (10,148 admissions) to Week 12 (sharp drops consistently), showing waning severe cases, aligning with the decline in future ILI occurrences.
4. A reduced percentage of influenza positivity in clinical specimens from 14.2% (Week 8, 2024) to 10.5% (Week 12, 2024) reinforced the downward trend in overall activity, signaling a continued contraction into future weeks. This reduction mirrored ILI surveillance trends. Declining pediatric and influenza-attributed deaths (Week 11 and Week 12 reporting the season lowest rates) further demonstrated diminishing viral impact.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 4753 can be attributed to the clear downward trajectory in past ILI trends from Week 8 to Week 12, 2024, aligning with decreased outpatient ILI visits, reduced positivity in influenza testing, declining hospitalization rates, and diminished mortality associated with the influenza season. Regional and viral dynamics, despite initially sustaining elevated levels, gradually waned, directly impacting the future reduction.
