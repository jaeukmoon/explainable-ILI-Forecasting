1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall increasing trend, with values ['11116', '11730', '11738', '11489', '11880']. After an initial increase from 11116 (Week 39, 2021) to 11730 (Week 40, 2021), there was a slight stabilization, followed by a moderate dip to 11489 (Week 42, 2021). By Week 43, 2021, the numbers rose again to 11880, suggesting a general upward trajectory in ILI activity toward the end of the observed period.
2. A positive correlation between the past time-series and future ILI occurrences is observed, as the upward movement in Weeks 40 to Week 43, 2021, particularly the rise to 11880 in the last recorded week, aligns with the significant jump in future ILI occurrences, reaching 17928 after 5 weeks. This continued escalation indicates a buildup in respiratory illness activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI, while remaining below the national baseline, showed consistent stability or slight increases across weeks, reaching 1.9% again in Week 43, 2021. This stabilization, coupled with rising influenza-positive detections in clinical labs (e.g., 0.1%-0.2% positivity in Weeks 39–43, 2021), reflects a growing respiratory illness burden across the nation.
4. Deaths attributable to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded epidemic thresholds in every week, with rates gradually declining from 18.7% (Week 39, 2021) to 15.6% (Week 43, 2021) yet remaining indicative of persistent respiratory illness severity.
5. Reports of increasing influenza A (H3N2) positivity in Weeks 42–43, 2021, particularly in public health labs, suggest a growing presence of H3N2 cases that can contribute significantly to future ILI trends.
4. Disruptions in ILI surveillance and interpretation due to healthcare-seeking behavior changes, as consistently emphasized across all summarized reports, likely intensified the recorded ILI occurrences. Such shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic may amplify the apparent rise in respiratory illnesses, contributing to the significant occurrence of 17928 after 5 weeks.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 17928 are supported by the generally increasing past trend, rising outpatient ILI visits, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, growing influenza A (H3N2) activity in Weeks 42–43, 2021, and the confounding influences of pandemic-related surveillance challenges. This collection of factors explains the sharp increase in reported ILI activity after 5 weeks.
