1. The reported ILI counts from Week23 to Week27, 2022 are 19923, 17486, 15495, 14144, and 14344. This reflects a consistent decreasing trend from Week23 to Week26 before a slight increase in Week27. The overall pattern demonstrates a declining trajectory for ILI activity, which aligns with typical off-season behavior during late spring and early summer.
2. Week32, 2022 falls into the Peak onset season, as this period typically begins around Week32 and signals the gradual rise in influenza activity toward the Peak season. The historical decrease in cases during Weeks23 to Week27 suggests that Week32 is at the transitional stage of increasing influenza transmission.
3. The ILI occurrences data show declining trends across Weeks23 to Week26 and a slight rebound in Week27. This decline reflects residual off-season effects, while the slight uptick likely denotes the early signs of Peak onset behavior. Projecting these trends forward five weeks to Week32, 2022, using a time-series perspective yields a forecasted ILI occurrence of 11715, reflecting the anticipated early signals of an increase in cases.
4. Low rates of influenza positivity are observed nationwide, declining from 3.4% (Week23, 2022) to 0.7% (Week27, 2022). Despite these low rates, the consistent detection of Influenza A (dominated by H3N2) indicates sustained viral circulation that could contribute to a gradual uptick in activity as seasonal shifts approach.
5. Vaccination levels and public health emphasis remain stable and consistent with the seasonal transition period. However, the mixed antigenic match of vaccines to circulating H3N2 strains (Week23, 2022 #8) may contribute to slower immunity buildup, allowing a gradual increase during the Peak onset season.
6. Healthcare-seeking behaviors for respiratory illnesses remain altered due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This behavioral shift (Week23, 2022 #10; Week24, 2022 #10; Week27, 2022 #10) may lead to underreported outpatient visits, masking early upward trends in ILI activity.
7. The predicted value of 11715 for Week32, 2022 aligns with the observed time-series trends of decreasing ILI activity transitioning into Peak onset season, coupled with stable co-circulation of respiratory viruses, the persistence of Influenza A (H3N2) as a dominant subtype, and evolving vaccination efficacy. This reflects the anticipation of a gradual seasonal rise.
