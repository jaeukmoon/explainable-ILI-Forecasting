1. The ILI occurrences over the past five weeks for Region 8 (Week24, 2022 to Week28, 2022) exhibit a clear decreasing trend: ['1180', '1024', '711', '900', '853']. Week24 marks the onset of the highest ILI activity recorded (1180), which then fell to 1024 in Week25, indicating a decline of 13.22% week-over-week. The drop continued steeply to 711 in Week26 (-30.57%) before marginally rebounding to 900 (+26.59%) in Week27. Finally, Week28 saw another dip to 853 (-5.22%), suggesting the reduction in ILI cases is slowing or stabilizing. On average, a week-over-week reduction is approximately 11.2% across these five weeks, signaling a consistent declining trend into the off-season baseline levels.
2. Season classification for Week33, 2022: Based on the CDC data and known seasonal patterns, Week33 occurs within the **Off-season**, a period characterized by minimal ILI occurrences. The delineation of off-season, spanning from roughly Week1 to Week31 or Week32 to Week46, signifies that Week33 lies near the transitional curve from off-season to the Peak onset season. However, evidence from past data (low ILI activity and influenza positivity rates across several jurisdictions) strongly supports the classification of Week33, 2022, as part of the off-season, with baseline to minimally increasing ILI activity.
3. Correlation analysis between historical trends and future predictions suggests that the decline seen in ILI occurrences is primarily driven by reduced influenza activity in various surveillances (clinical positivity rates, hospitalization) and seasonal effects. Using an adjusted arithmetic mean with weighting (due to the varying magnitude of declines over the five weeks), the formula for predicted ILI occurrence is calculated as follows:
4. - Week-over-week weights: [1180 -> 1024 = -13.22%], [1024 -> 711 = -30.57%], [711 -> 900 = +26.59%], [900 -> 853 = -5.22%].
5. - Step1: Weighted change percent = ((-13.22%) + (-30.57%) + (+26.59%) + (-5.22%)) / 4 ≈ -5.605% average rate of weekly change.
6. - Step2: Applying this projected -5.605% decline rate to Week28's value (853): 853 * (1 - 0.05605) ≈ 805.
7. - Step3: Off-season adjustment (+5%) anticipating slower decline trends into the off-season: 805 * 1.05 ≈ 845 (rounded to nearest whole number). Thus, the projection for Week33, 2022 is finalized at **845**.
4. Several CDC report factors substantiate this prediction:
5. - Week24 to Week28 CDC reports indicate a **steady decline in influenza positivity rates**, decreasing from 2.5% (Week24) to 0.7% (Week28) in clinical labs. Lower positivity suggests reduced community influenza transmission and reflects the shrinking pool of active cases that would contribute to ILI occurrences (+ or -10% relative decline).
6. - **Vaccination coverage**, while not directly highlighted, remains likely consistent or lower due to the seasonality (flu vaccine targets rise during peak onset/peak seasons), correlating with fewer new cases emerging. Meanwhile, the stabilization in ILI cases suggests residual protective herd immunity might still persist (~+2% stabilizing factor).
7. - **Interaction with other respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, SARS-CoV-2)** adds complexity but remains minor. The Week28 CDC report attributes co-circulation of viruses to shifting data on ILI; however, ILI levels remain minimal nationally, particularly in low-season jurisdictions, reinforcing the baseline 845 estimate.
5. The combination of a steady downward trend in ILI activity, off-season classification for Week33, 2022, falling influenza positivity rates from 2.5% to 0.7%, co-circulation effects, and modified weightings projecting stabilization yields a predicted value of **845** ILI occurrences. The gradual decrease aligns with seasonal trends and national reductions in influenza burdens characteristics during periods of minimal flu activity.
