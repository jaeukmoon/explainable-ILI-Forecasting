1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating but overall decreasing trend, with values of ['1077', '1069', '1060', '1115', '916']. There was a slight decrease from 1077 (Week51, 2020) to 1060 (Week53, 2020), followed by a notable spike to 1115 (Week1, 2021) and a sharp decline to 916 (Week2, 2021). This downward trajectory by Week2, 2021, indicates diminishing flu-season activity.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is noted. The sharp decline in Week2, 2021, at 916 potentially reflects suppressed ILI activity due to lower influenza activity overall, which then aligns with the significantly reduced future ILI activity at 512 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week7, 2021). The continuous decline serves as a precursor to sustained low activity.
3. Nationwide ILI visits consistently remained below the national baseline (2.6%), with values at 1.6% (Week51, 2020 to Week53, 2020), increasing slightly to 1.7% (Week1, 2021) before dropping to 1.4% (Week2, 2021). This steady sub-baseline behavior predicts the overall suppressed future ILI activity.
4. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently accounted for high mortality rates ranging from 13.6% (Week51, 2020) to 14.7% (Week2, 2021), dominated by COVID-19. The predominance of COVID-19 over influenza-related outcomes suggests subdued flu activity, aligning with decreased future ILI occurrences.
5. Continued low positivity rates for influenza among respiratory specimens (e.g., 0.3% in Week51, 2020, reducing to 0.1% by Week2, 2021) and fewer reported influenza-related hospitalizations (e.g., 101 in Week51, 2020, increasing slightly to 129 by Week1, 2021) underline reduced flu prevalence. These low levels are indicative of the speculation that future ILI occurrences at 512 are driven by minimal flu activity.
6. COVID-19 pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI reporting heavily impacted traditional surveillance. These shifts likely resulted in diluted ILI reporting and reduced detection, further contributing to the observed suppression in ILI occurrences, including the future value of 512 (Week7, 2021).
7. In summary, the 512 future ILI occurrences (Week7, 2021) can be attributed to the overall decreasing trend in ILI occurrences, persistently low outpatient ILI visits below baseline, influenza positivity rates remaining negligible, and substantial pandemic-driven disruptions that suppressed ILI recognition and reporting.
