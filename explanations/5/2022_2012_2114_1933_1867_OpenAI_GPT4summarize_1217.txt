1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks show a declining trend with values of ['2022', '2012', '2114', '1933', '1867']. While there is a slight increase from 2012 (Week 19, 2021) to 2114 (Week 20, 2021), the overall decay from 2022 (Week 18, 2021) to 1867 (Week 22, 2021) indicates a steady reduction in ILI activity over the observed 5-week period.
2. A negative correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences, as the declining trend in the past data contrasts with the rise to 2482 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks. This shift suggests potential external factors driving the surge beyond the immediate trajectory of the previous weeks.
3. Minimal ILI outpatient visit percentages, consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%, indicate reduced activity during Weeks 18–22, 2021 (1.1%–1.3%). However, the slight rise in ages 0–4 years toward Week 22, 2021, points to a possible resurgence in certain age groups that may foreshadow the future increase.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained above epidemic thresholds in all 5 weeks (ranging from 10.9% in Week 18, 2021, to 7.5% in Week 22, 2021). Although tied primarily to COVID-19, elevated PIC mortality reflects underlying respiratory illness trends that could influence future ILI data.
5. Ongoing disruptions in traditional healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and alternative care systems, complicate accurate ILI monitoring. These inconsistencies may have delayed or masked emerging cases, contributing to the sudden rise in future ILI occurrences to 2482.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrence of 2482 can be attributed to a combination of factors, including potential resurgence from the slight increase in outpatient visits in some population groups, persistent elevated PIC mortality rates signaling respiratory illness activity, and underreporting or delayed identification of cases due to surveillance disruptions. Although the past data exhibited a declining trend, systemic complexities likely influenced this unexpected future rise.
