1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values of ['1271', '1454', '1284', '1170', '1117']. Starting from 1271 (Week53, 2020) and peaking at 1454 (Week1, 2021), there was then a steady decrease across the subsequent weeks, ending at 1117 in Week4, 2021. This downward trajectory reflects reduced ILI activity across the 5-week duration.
2. A negative correlation emerges between past and future ILI occurrences, as the declining trend from Weeks53-4, 2020-21 (1271 to 1117) contrasts with the resurgence to 975 after 5 weeks (Week9, 2021). This suggests external or delayed factors drove the increase despite recent declines.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently decreased, from 1.6% (Week53, 2020) to 1.1% (Week4, 2021), remaining well below the national baseline of 2.6%. This reduction indicates suppressed activity, but the national baseline and regional variabilities signal the potential for sudden increases in later weeks.
4. PIC mortality remained significantly elevated, ranging from 14.5% (Week53, 2020) to 28.4% (Week4, 2021), with most deaths attributed to COVID-19. Although COVID-19 drove this trend, it reflects heightened respiratory system stress nationally, potentially setting up conditions for a rebound in ILI cases.
5. Reports indicate the CDC frequently warned of possible future increases in influenza activity due to suppressed circulation and evolving pandemic-related healthcare behaviors. These anticipations correspond to the observed resurgence in ILI occurrences despite prior declines.
6. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic disrupted ILI reporting and interpretation, complicating accurate trend analysis and potentially delaying recognition of increasing ILI case clusters contributing to the reported rise to 975.
7. In summary, the reported 975 future ILI occurrences (Week9, 2021) are attributed to reduced past ILI trends with latent potential for resurgence, persistently high PIC mortality, the impact of suppressed healthcare-seeking behaviors, and CDC-projected future increases counter to short-term trends.
