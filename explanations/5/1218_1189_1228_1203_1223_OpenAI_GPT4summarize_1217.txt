1. The past time-series ILI occurrences exhibited a relatively stable trend with minor fluctuations. The values ['1218', '1189', '1228', '1203', '1223'] highlight consistent activity with slight decreases in Week 43, 2021 (1189) and Week 45, 2021 (1203) compared to adjacent weeks. However, no significant upward or downward trend is observed, suggesting a baseline level of ILI occurrences without sharp spikes or declines during this period.
2. The future ILI occurrences rise to 1746, which is considerably higher than the relatively stable past occurrences. The increase aligns with the uptick in ILI visits from Week 46, 2021 (2.2%) and the steady rise in positive laboratory detections of influenza A(H3N2) during Weeks 44–46, 2021. The overall evolving epidemiological patterns likely correlate with the future surge.
3. Outpatient ILI visits showed a gradual increase, rising from 1.8% (Week 42, 2021) to 2.2% (Week 46, 2021). While still below the national baseline of 2.5%, the steady rise coincides with growing laboratory-confirmed influenza detections and increased activity in younger age groups (0–4 and 5–24). This trend likely contributed to the higher future ILI occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, shifting from 16.5% (Week 42, 2021) to 14.5% (Week 46, 2021). Although primarily driven by COVID-19 rather than influenza, the consistently elevated mortality rates reflect ongoing widespread respiratory illness activity that might indirectly explain rising future ILI reports.
5. The increasing proportion of influenza A(H3N2) cases, especially among ages 5–24 and localized outbreaks in Michigan, along with the 0.7–1.0% positivity rates in Week 45–46, 2021, show a notable rise in influenza activity compared to prior weeks. This rising virus circulation, combined with behavioral shifts related to healthcare-seeking during the pandemic, likely amplified the reported ILI cases in future weeks to reach 1746.
