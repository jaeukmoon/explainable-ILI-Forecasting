1. The past time-series ILI occurrences exhibited a consistent downward trend over the 5 weeks, with values of ['1954', '2058', '1858', '1595', '1399']. The initial decrease from 2058 (Week 20, 2022) to 1858 (Week 21, 2022) was followed by a continued decline to 1399 in Week 24, 2022, demonstrating a significant drop in ILI activity by the end of the observed period.

2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the declining trajectory observed during Weeks 20-24, 2022, aligns with the reported low level of 845 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 29, 2022). The sustained decrease in Week 23 and Week 24 serves as a precursor to the subsequent lower activity recorded in the future period.

3. Influenza positivity rates decreased consistently, dropping from 6.4% (Week 20, 2022) to 2.5% (Week 24, 2022), with Influenza A(H3N2) predominating. This reduced viral activity aligns with the declining ILI trends and supports the observed low future occurrences.

4. Outpatient visits for ILI also declined, falling from 2.4% (Week 20, 2022) to 1.9% (Week 24, 2022). This decrease in healthcare-seeking behavior is indicative of reduced respiratory illness activity, contributing to the lower ILI occurrences in the future.

5. Co-circulation rates of respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, flu, or RSV, remained stable or decreased slightly from 4.5% (Week 20, 2022) to 4.2% (Week 24, 2022). This stabilization or minor drop reduced the combined impact of co-infections, helping maintain lower ILI occurrences in the later weeks.

6. In summary, the reported decrease to 845 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 29, 2022) can be attributed to the consistent downward trend in ILI activity during Weeks 20-24, 2022, decreasing influenza positivity rates, reduced outpatient ILI visits, stabilization in co-infection rates, and the waning late-season influenza activity reflected in the CDC reports.
