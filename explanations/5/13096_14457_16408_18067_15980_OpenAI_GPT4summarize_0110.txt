1. The reported ILI counts from Week43 to Week47, 2023 are 13096, 14457, 16408, 18067, and 15980. The trend shows a steady increase from Week43 (13096) through Week46 (18067), followed by a slight decline in Week47 (15980). Overall, the pattern represents a rapid upward trajectory characteristic of peak onset season transitioning into peak season, with Week47 showing a modest dip in comparison to Week46.
2. Based on historical patterns for influenza in the U.S., Week52, 2023 aligns squarely within the high-transmission **peak season**, as influenza activity typically intensifies between Week46 and Week06 of the subsequent year. The ongoing trajectory and CDC predictions indicate heightened activity consistent with this classification.
3. The time-series analysis suggests that ILI trends are increasing sharply into the peak season. The prior week's decline (from Week46 to Week47) could reflect short-term fluctuations, but the broader seasonality supports the projection of continued increases. Considering the upward trend until Week46, a peak season surge is anticipated, aligning with the forecast of 26712 occurrences in Week52.
4. Key CDC report factors influencing the forecast: (1) The sharp rise in influenza positivity rates, from 1.9% in Week43 to 6.2% in Week47, signals escalating transmission intensity. This trend strongly correlates with the prediction of heightened Week52 ILI activity. (2) The cumulative hospitalization rate increased from 0.8 per 100,000 in Week43 to 3.7 per 100,000 in Week47, the highest since 2010 for this point in the season, further reflecting significant disease prevalence. (3) Multiple respiratory viruses, including Influenza A (A(H1N1)), RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, are co-circulating, amplifying ILI occurrences via compounded community respiratory illness spread.
5. Rising influenza positivity rates over consecutive weeks, concurrent with significant co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, suggest that elevated transmission trends will persist. Hospitalization data and CDC predictions corroborate these expectations.
6. The continued upward trend in flu activity, alongside regional variability marked by higher hotspots like the South Central and Southeast areas, further supports the projection of heightened transmission and severe ILI cases.
7. In summary, the ILI forecast of 26712 for Week52, 2023 is justified by the sharp historical increases in ILI occurrences over preceding weeks, the classification of Week52 within the well-established peak flu season, co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, and escalating positivity, hospitalization, and flu-related illness trends as reported by the CDC. These combined factors confirm a continuation of heightened ILI activity peaking in Week52.
