1. The reported ILI counts from Week10 to Week14, 2021 are 1585, 1673, 1893, 1956, and 2003. This indicates a steadily increasing trend over five consecutive weeks, with no significant dips or fluctuations. The consistent upward trajectory suggests a gradual rise in influenza-like illness occurrences influenced by underlying patterns or factors.
2. Forecasting target week (Week19, 2021) belongs to the off-season. Given that Week19 falls well outside the typical peak season (which spans Week46 of the prior year through Week6 of the following year) and that influenza activity has remained minimal (e.g., 0.1% positivity in respiratory specimens and ILI outpatient visits consistently below the 2.6% baseline across Week10 to Week14, 2021), it aligns with the off-season status.
3. Based on past trends, the observed consistent increase in ILI counts suggests continuity in this pattern over the subsequent weeks. Utilizing a time-series forecasting model, the numerical trajectory predicts slight moderation and stabilization by Week19, with projected occurrences converging towards the forecasted value of 2012. This reflects seasonal influences and entrenched low influenza activity.
4. Despite minimal ILI activity, the CDC mentioned potential increases in flu activity in the coming months (Week10, 2021 #9; Week11, 2021 #10; Week12, 2021 #10; Week13, 2021 #10). This warning, coupled with sustained rises in ILI counts, informs the forecast.
5. Cross-influences from COVID-19 significantly alter healthcare-seeking behaviors and data interpretation (Week10, 2021 #8; Week11, 2021 #9; Week12, 2021 #10; Week13, 2021 #8; Week14, 2021 #6). These trends complicate differentiating influenza from other respiratory illnesses but have not driven a notable ILI spike.
6. Persistent low influenza positivity rates remain a baseline factor (Week10 to Week14, 2021: #1 of each week, about 0.1%). Despite nominal increases in positivity characteristics, they fail to suggest widespread influenza transmission, allowing ILI to remain within a controlled range near predicted levels.
7. In summary, the forecast of 2012 ILI occurrences for Week19, 2021 integrates a steady upward but moderated trend in ILI counts, off-season classification, minimal influenza virus positivity, stable co-circulation impacts, and a cautious CDC outlook. These factors converge towards stabilized yet slightly increased ILI activity.
