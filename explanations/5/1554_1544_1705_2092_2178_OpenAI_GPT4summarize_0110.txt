1. The reported ILI counts for the past five weeks (Week42 to Week46, 2020) are 1554, 1544, 1705, 2092, and 2178. This demonstrates a progressively increasing trend, particularly with a sharper rise from Week44 to Week46, 2020. The consecutive weekly increases suggest a consistent upward trajectory, moving closer to what might signal peak onset activity for the season.
2. Week51, 2020 corresponds to the peak onset season, as indicated by its timing (Week35 to Week46, 2020 typically marks the peak onset season) and increasing ILI activity over the observed weeks. Nationwide influenza activity remains low (Week46, 2020 #6), but the steady rise and expected seasonal behaviors align with the peak onset phase.
3. Time-series analysis indicates that the ILI counts are rising consistently. With a sharp rise from 1705 in Week44, 2020 to 2178 in Week46, 2020, projecting forward suggests a continuation of this upward movement with stabilization around five weeks later. As influenza activity increases toward the peak season, the forecast ILI count for Week51, 2020 is 1783, assuming moderate growth levels off slightly.
4. Nationwide influenza activity remains low, with outpatient visits for ILI below the baseline (Week42 to Week46, 2020 #4). Although ILI visits have been increasing subtly (1.2% in Week42, 2020 to 1.5% in Week46, 2020), the overall positivity rate remains minimal (0.2% of specimens testing positive in Week46, 2020 #1).
5. Vaccination campaigns have not shown evidence of significant changes in coverage or timing (Week42 to Week46, 2020 #8), but the impact of vaccination efforts is anticipated in later weeks.
6. Healthcare settings and alternative care-seeking behaviors due to the overlapping COVID-19 pandemic complicate traditional ILI surveillance (Week42 to Week46, 2020 #9). This dual burden might moderate the growth in observed ILI cases, aligning with a forecast value of 1783 five weeks from Week46, 2020.
7. Combining these factors—steady increases in ILI trends, alignment with the peak onset season, cautious interpretation of low positivity amidst healthcare disruptions, and a slow vaccination impact rate—the forecast ILI count of 1783 for Week51, 2020 is reasonable. The upward trend and season-specific dynamics are moderated by changes in healthcare behaviors and ongoing uncertainties.
