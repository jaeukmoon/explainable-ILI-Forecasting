1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited an upward trend in the first four weeks followed by a slight decline in the fifth week, with values of ['1827', '2186', '2266', '2402', '2287']. There was a continuous rise from 1827 (Week 49, 2023) to 2402 (Week 52, 2023), peaking at 2402. However, a slight decrease to 2287 was observed in Week 1, 2024. This indicates elevated but slightly fluctuating ILI activity toward the end of the observed period.
2. A clear positive correlation between the past ILI trends and future occurrences after 5 weeks is evident. The consistent rise in weeks leading up to Week 52, 2023, demonstrates increased respiratory illness activity, with the minor decline in Week 1, 2024, being insufficient to disrupt this overall pattern. These data trends align with the significant ILI level reaching 2712 after 5 weeks (Week 6, 2024).
3. Outpatient ILI visit proportions steadily rose over time, from 4.4% in Week 49, 2023, to 6.9% in Week 52, 2023. Elevated levels consistently above the national baseline reflect widespread influenza circulation, contributing to amplified ILI activity aligning with the observed future rise. Significant increases in cumulative influenza hospitalization rates, from 8.0 per 100,000 (Week 49, 2023) to 31.7 per 100,000 (Week 1, 2024), driven by high rates among adults aged 65+, reflect severe illness trends fueling the future peak. Continued increase in flu positivity rates, from 10.2% (Week 49, 2023) to 17.5% (Week 52, 2023), coupled with majority A(H1N1)pdm09 dominance, highlights the escalating viral spread supporting future ILI growth.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, notably COVID-19 and RSV, as noted across regions during this period, compounded the complexity of respiratory illnesses and contributed to elevated ILI occurrences. Rising pediatric influenza-associated deaths, which reached 40 by Week 1, 2024, further indicated expanding vulnerable populations, indirectly reinforcing the upward ILI trend. Regional hotspots, particularly in Regions 8, 6, and 4, as identified by both flu positivity and ILI activity, acted as significant drivers of the nationwide increase, influencing the future spike.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2712 (Week 6, 2024) can be attributed to sustained increases in ILI activity, reflected in rising outpatient visits, flu positivity rates, and hospitalization rates, alongside widespread A(H1N1)pdm09 activity and co-circulating respiratory viruses, which collectively amplified respiratory illness patterns nationwide.
