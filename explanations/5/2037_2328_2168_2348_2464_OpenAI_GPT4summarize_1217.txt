1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a generally increasing trend, starting from 2037 in Week39, 2023, climbing to 2328 in Week40, 2023, followed by a slight dip to 2168 in Week41, 2023, and then increasing again to 2348 in Week42, 2023, and 2464 in Week43, 2023. This pattern indicates a progressive escalation in ILI activity toward the later weeks of the observed period.
2. A clear positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, with the upward trajectory observed in Weeks42 and 43, 2023, corresponding to the reported rise to 4597 ILI cases after 5 weeks. The consistent increase by the end of the 5-week period acts as an indicator of heightened future ILI activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a steady and slight increase, rising consistently from 2.1% (Week39, 2023) to 2.7% (Week43, 2023). This trend reflects gradually increasing respiratory illness activity in healthcare settings, which aligns with the upward trajectory of future ILI cases.
4. Hospitalization rates for influenza also displayed a progressive rise, with cumulative rates increasing from 0.1 per 100,000 (Week40, 2023) to 0.8 per 100,000 (Week43, 2023) and weekly hospitalizations climbing from 1040 (Week39, 2023) to 1607 (Week43, 2023). This escalation in hospitalizations indicates a rising clinical burden, which corresponds to the observed future ILI surge.
5. Regional variations in influenza activity intensified, with moderate ILI activity expanding from minimal jurisdictions in Week39, 2023, to 6 jurisdictions reporting moderate and 2 reporting high activity by Week43, 2023. These localized increases signal the spread of respiratory illnesses, matching the observed higher ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 4597 after 5 weeks can be attributed to the clear upward trend in past time-series ILI data, rising outpatient visit percentages for ILI, increasing hospitalization rates, and expanding regional ILI activity, all of which cumulatively suggest a growing wave of respiratory illness activity during this interval.
