1. The ILI occurrences from Week52, 2023 to Week4, 2024 are as follows: 14304, 12648, 9164, 8046, and 10127. Over the five weeks, the trend shows an initial sharp decline from Week52, 2023 (14304) to Week3, 2024 (8046), followed by a minor rebound during Week4, 2024 (10127). This reflects a decreasing trajectory with a slight late uptick, indicating potential stabilization or a forthcoming secondary increase.
2. Target Week (Week9, 2024) belongs to the off-season. Historically, Week9 marks the beginning of the off-season period in the U.S., as influenza activity typically wanes after the peak which occurs between Week46 and Week6. The ongoing decline in hospitalization and mortality rates (Week3 and Week4, 2024 #6, #7) alongside reduced outpatient visits (Week4, 2024 #3) also support classifying Week9, 2024 as off-season.
3. The time-series data indicates that the sharp decline from Week52, 2023 to Week3, 2024 reflects the waning phase of peak season activity. The slight resurgence during Week4, 2024 (10127) might suggest the possibility of continued fluctuation or a smaller secondary peak. The projection to Week9, 2024 accounts for this interplay of declining trajectory coupled with transient rebounds, forecasting 8192 ILI occurrences as consistent with these patterns.
4. The persistence of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 dominance and genetic stability (Week3 and Week4, 2024 #2, #9) ensures sustained transmission risks, potentially prolonging ILI activity even into the off-season.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 (Week3 and Week4, 2024 #10, #8) continue to contribute to elevated ILI counts, complicating the off-season decline of influenza activity.
6. Despite vaccination recommendations, uptake remains suboptimal in several regions, with moderate ongoing increases in influenza positivity and positivity rates in areas such as HHS Regions 6 and 8 (Week3 and Week4, 2024 #9), which could sustain moderate ILI prevalence in Week9, 2024.
7. In conclusion, the projection of 8192 ILI occurrences for Week9, 2024 is supported by the observed declining yet fluctuating ILI trends, the classification of Week9 as off-season, dominance of A(H1N1)pdm09, persistent co-circulation of other viruses, and ongoing regional variability in activity. These factors collectively suggest moderate activity levels as influenza transitions into the typical off-season phase.
