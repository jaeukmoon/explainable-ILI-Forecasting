1. The reported ILI counts from Week46 to Week50, 2021 are 16729, 15058, 17928, 18608, and 22179. This indicates a consistent and significant upward trend across the 5-week period, with a substantial spike in Week50, 2021. The growth from Week49 to Week50 is especially notable, suggesting accelerated transmission of influenza-like illnesses.
2. Based on historical season definitions, Week3, 2022 falls within the peak season range (Week46, 2021 to Week6, 2022). Increasing ILI visits above baseline levels and rising influenza positivity during Week50, 2021 indicate that flu activity is intensifying as expected during peak season. Hence, forecasting Week3, 2022 aligns with the peak season phase.
3. Past trends demonstrate a steep rise in ILI occurrences, especially toward the latter half of the time series (Week48 to Week50, 2021). The surge in Week50 suggests that this elevated activity is likely to sustain momentum into the ensuing weeks. From a forecasting model perspective, the trend's continuity supports projecting a slightly reduced but still elevated occurrence of 18431 ILI cases in Week3, 2022.
4. Dominance of the A(H3N2) subtype: In Week50, 2021, Influenza A(H3N2) accounted for 99.8% of subtyped influenza viruses nationwide and is known for its association with severe flu seasons (Week50, 2021 #2). The rapid spread of A(H3N2) in age groups 5-24 years (Week48, 2021 #2), increasing infections in adults (Week49, 2021 #8), and co-circulation of other respiratory viruses underscore high transmission potential.
5. Vaccination coverage appears lower this season compared to prior years, as noted in Week48, 2021 (#7) and Week50, 2021 (#7). While vaccination remains a key mitigation tool, reduced uptake may contribute to increasing susceptibility in the population, enabling sustained flu activity going into Week3, 2022.
6. Outpatient respiratory illness visits exceeded the national baseline by Week50, 2021, with 3.1% of visits attributed to ILI (Week50, 2021 #5). This rising trend is a critical indicator of intensifying flu season severity, particularly as eastern and central U.S. regions report high activity (Week50, 2021 #6).
7. The significant growth in ILI numbers, dominance of A(H3N2), lower vaccination uptake, and intensifying flu activity nationwide all converge to support the projected ILI occurrence of 18431 for Week3, 2022, consistent with continued peak-season dynamics.
