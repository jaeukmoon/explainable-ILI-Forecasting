1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but overall declining trend, with values of ['1808', '1864', '1881', '1698', '1711']. The peak occurred in Week17, 2024, at 1881 cases. The subsequent weeks showed a steady decline, with Week21, 2024, registering 1711 cases, indicating a consistent reduction in ILI activity over this period.
2. A negative correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences. The declining trend from Week18, 2024, to Week21, 2024, aligns with the reduction to 1268 reported future ILI occurrences in Week26, 2024. This consistent downward trajectory for the previous 5 weeks foreshadows the reduced future value.
3. Multiple factors from the summarized reports align with the declining ILI occurrences: (1) Declining influenza positivity rates nationally, from 3.9% in Week17, 2024, to 1.7% in Week21, 2024, suggests a reduced influenza burden. (2) Outpatient visits for ILI remained stable or slightly declined, staying below baseline levels for all weeks, from 2.2% in Week17 to 1.9% in Week21, 2024, pointing to diminished respiratory illness activity. (3) Influenza-associated mortality decreased, from 0.2% in Week17 to 0.1% in Week21, 2024, reflecting lower overall severity and transmission of influenza. (4) Reduced hospitalization rates, with a peak at 0.2 per 100,000 in Week20 and Week21, 2024, further validate decreased influenza impacts.
4. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, like RSV and SARS-CoV-2, were present but did not show surges significant enough to offset overall declining trends in respiratory illness activity during the observed period. Controlled antiviral resistance and stable vaccination coverage also limited the potential for influenza resurgence, as highlighted in the summarized reports.
5. In summary, the reported drop to 1268 future ILI occurrences (Week26, 2024) is attributable to the persistent declining trend in past ILI data over Weeks17–21, 2024, coupled with reduced influenza positivity rates, stabilized ILI outpatient visits below baseline, decreasing hospitalization and mortality rates, and subdued activity from co-circulating respiratory viruses. These combined factors emphasize reduced respiratory illness burdens leading to lowered future occurrences.
