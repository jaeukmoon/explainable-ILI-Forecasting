1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks ('1998', '1551', '1757', '1933', '1816') indicated a fluctuating yet overall rising trend with peaks and troughs. Week4, 2022 (1998 cases) marked the highest of the observed period, followed by a significant drop in Week5, 2022 (1551 cases). Weeks 6 to 7, 2022, exhibited a steady increase from 1757 to 1933 cases, with a minor decline by Week8, 2022 (1816 cases). These fluctuations suggest dynamic activity levels, hinting at potential surges in the near term.
2. A positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The gradual increase from Week6 to Week7, 2022, culminating in Week8, 2022, reflects persistent ILI activity that aligns with the subsequent rise to 3793 future occurrences after five weeks. This correlation signifies that the trends in prior weeks acted as a precursor to the intensified ILI activity later observed.
3. The summarized CDC reports highlight significant factors contributing to the future surge. First, the cumulative hospitalization rate, rising steadily over the 5 weeks (from 4.4 per 100,000 in Week4, 2022, to 5.2 per 100,000 in Week8, 2022), indicates increasing severity of cases, fueling higher ILI occurrences. Second, low influenza vaccination rates noted throughout Weeks4–8, 2022, left populations more susceptible to infection, leading to anticipated higher spread in subsequent periods. Third, the co-circulation of Influenza A(H3N2) with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, observed steadily at 5.7%-6.1% co-infection rates, likely compounded respiratory illness levels, contributing further to the future surge.
4. Persistent PIC mortality rates remained above epidemic thresholds throughout Week4-8, 2022, albeit driven primarily by COVID-19. This overlap reflects heightened respiratory illness activity, indirectly correlating with the rise in reported ILI occurrences (e.g., 28.6% in Week4, decreasing to 16.7% in Week8, 2022).
5. In summary, the reported 3793 future ILI occurrences (after Week8, 2022) can be attributed to the steady rising trend in earlier weeks, increasing hospitalization rates, inadequate vaccination coverage, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, which synergistically promoted the higher ILI activity observed.
