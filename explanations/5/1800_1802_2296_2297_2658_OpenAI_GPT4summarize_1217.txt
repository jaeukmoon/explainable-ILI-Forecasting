1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over 5 weeks show a clear upward trend, beginning at 1800 in Week 42, 2021, increasing slightly to 1802 in Week 43, 2021, and then sharply rising to 2296 in Week 44, 2021, followed by a minor increase to 2297 in Week 45, 2021. The trajectory continues upward, peaking at 2658 in Week 46, 2021. This consistent rise signifies an escalation in ILI activity by the end of the observed period.
2. A strong positive correlation is observed between the rising trend of past ILI occurrences and the future increase to 4249 occurrences. The sharp growth in Weeks 44–46, 2021, aligns with the amplified future value reported 5 weeks later, suggesting a continuation of the upward trajectory in ILI activity.
3. Several factors support the future rise in occurrences: First, outpatient ILI visits steadily increased from 1.8% in Week 42, 2021, to 2.2% in Week 46, 2021, signaling heightened respiratory illness activity. Second, Influenza A(H3N2), which predominantly affected younger populations, surged in laboratory detections, rising from 87.5% (Week 42, 2021) to 98.4% (Week 46, 2021). Third, pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) deaths consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, with values like 16.5% in Week 42 and 14.5% in Week 46, indicating severe respiratory infection trends contributing to the ILI surge. Fourth, co-circulation of various respiratory viruses, notably COVID-19, disrupted traditional surveillance and heightened wider respiratory illness impacts.
4. The overall increase in past ILI occurrences, rising inpatient and outpatient burdens, the high prevalence of A(H3N2), and persistent PIC mortality trends offer a compelling explanation for the eventual rise to 4249 ILI occurrences.
