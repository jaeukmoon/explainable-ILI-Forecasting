1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a clear decreasing trend, starting at 18059 (Week8, 2024) and progressively declining to 12267 (Week12, 2024). This decline indicates waning influenza activity over the observed period, aligning with several signals of subsiding flu activity.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is apparent. The steady decline in past data across Weeks8–12, 2024, aligns with the reported sharp drop to 6169 future occurrences after five weeks. The sustained downward trajectory of ILI activity during the observed period suggests a continuation of this declining trend.
3. Influenza positivity rates in clinical labs decreased significantly from 14.2% (Week8, 2024) to 10.5% (Week12, 2024). This consistent reduction in positivity rates reflects declining viral circulation contributing to reduced future ILI activity. Hospitalization rates similarly showed a declining trend, stabilizing at 72.2 per 100,000 by Week12, 2024, pointing toward a lessening severity of flu activity. Deaths attributed to influenza dropped from 0.7% (Week8, 2024) to 0.5% (Week12, 2024), further confirming a reduction in severe outcomes by the end of the period. Outpatient visits for ILI progressively decreased from 4.4% (Week8, 2024) to 3.1% (Week12, 2024), staying above baseline but consistently moving downward, demonstrating reduced demand for healthcare due to influenza-like illnesses.
4. Despite co-circulation of RSV, COVID-19, and other respiratory viruses, these did not counteract the general decrease in ILI trends. Additionally, stable antiviral resistance and effective vaccines matching circulating strains likely curbed ILI activity and helped mitigate further increases.
5. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 6169 align with the observed declining trends in past time-series ILI data, reduced influenza positivity rates, hospitalization rates, mortality, and outpatient visits, all indicating a waning flu season. This decline suggests a sustained reduction in flu intensity and respiratory illness activity.
