1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed fluctuations without a consistent trend, with values of ['1396', '1175', '1271', '1454', '1284']. There was a notable initial decline from 1396 (Week 51, 2020) to 1175 (Week 52, 2020), followed by a rise to 1454 (Week 53, 2020) before dropping again to 1284 (Week 2, 2021). The lack of a clear upward or downward trend during the observed weeks suggests that other external factors, rather than a consistent trajectory, influenced ILI occurrences.

2. A weak negative correlation is apparent between past and future ILI occurrences, as the decline from the peak of 1454 in Week 53, 2020, and lower value in Week 2, 2021 (1284) contrasts with the drop to 914 in the future occurrence data after Week 2, 2021. The future decline may signify the slowing effect of other concurrent factors, such as suppressed influenza transmission due to COVID-19 measures.

3. Minimal influenza activity was consistently reported, with respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza between 0.1% and 0.4% (Weeks 51, 2020 to Week 2, 2021). This exceptionally low positivity rate reflects reduced influenza transmission, directly contributing to the low future ILI occurrences.  
   - Outpatient visits for ILI remained below the national baseline of 2.6%, fluctuating between 1.4% and 1.7% during these weeks. The stable or declining ILI activity in outpatient settings aligns with the subsequent decrease to 914 after Week 2, 2021.  
   - The cumulative hospitalization rate reported was exceptionally low—0.5 per 100,000 population as of Week 2, 2021—indicating reduced severity and prevalence of ILI cases, correlating with the drop in future ILI occurrences.  
   - COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts on healthcare-seeking behavior and traditional surveillance systems were consistently highlighted, further suppressing influenza detection and reporting, and subsequently reducing future ILI occurrences.

4. In summary, the reported 914 future ILI occurrences after Week 2, 2021, can primarily be explained by suppressed influenza activity indicated by extremely low positivity rates, below-baseline outpatient ILI visits, and minimal hospitalization rates. The effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare utilization and surveillance systems played a significant role in maintaining low respiratory illness activity. The weak negative correlation between past and future occurrences in this case reflects these external suppressive influences overriding prior periodic fluctuations.
