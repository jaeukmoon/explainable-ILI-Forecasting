1. The reported ILI counts from Week40 to Week44, 2020 are 1589, 1706, 1484, 1623, and 1558. This time-series data displays mild fluctuation, with a slight increase initially from Week40 (1589) to Week41 (1706), followed by a dip in Week42 (1484) and a modest rise again through Week43 (1623) and Week44 (1558). The overall trend indicates relatively stable ILI activity without significant spikes or consistent growth.
2. Based on U.S. influenza season classifications, Week49, 2020, which aligns as the target week for the future ILI forecast, typically falls within the peak season. Historical background suggests this is a period of heightened ILI activity, with widespread transmission as the influenza season intensifies (Week49 aligns with Week46–Week06 peak season).
3. A time-series forecasting approach relies on the observed mild fluctuation pattern from Week40 to Week44, 2020. The relatively stable past counts and seasonal classification suggest that Week49, 2020, will see moderately higher ILI cases due to the transition into the peak season. Additionally, during such periods, anticipated heightened flu circulation would further increase the baseline level of activity.
4. Influenza positivity rates remain extremely low in clinical labs, fluctuating between 0.1% and 0.3% from Week40 to Week44, 2020 (Week40, 2020 #1; Week42, 2020 #1; Week44, 2020 #1). This indicates limited viral transmission so far but doesn't preclude increasing activity as the season progresses and peak season approaches (Week44, 2020 #10). Public health and clinical labs likewise report minimal influenza detections (Week40, 2020 #3; Week43, 2020 #3), which reflects low initial circulation.
5. Outpatient visits for ILI remain steady but rise modestly from Week40 (1.1%) to Week44 (1.3%), although they remain below the national baseline of 2.6% throughout (Week40, 2020 #4; Week42, 2020 #4; Week44, 2020 #4). This small increase aligns with traditional seasonal patterns and suggests a slight uptick in respiratory illness visits as the influenza season transitions toward its peak.
6. Healthcare-seeking behaviors continue to be impacted by COVID-19, potentially affecting traditional ILI surveillance accuracy (Week40, 2020 #9; Week41, 2020 #9; Week44, 2020 #9). Nevertheless, simultaneous monitoring of COVID-19 and flu activity, along with modified behavior patterns (e.g., alternative care settings), could contribute to uncertainty in ILI trends. Seasonal vaccination promotion remains strong, but no notable vaccination uptake data have been reported (Week44, 2020 #8).
7. Considering the ongoing ILI fluctuation trend, the seasonal transition into peak activity, and compounding factors like stable outpatient visits, low viral positivity, and COVID-19 dynamics, the forecast projects 2078 ILI occurrences for Week49, 2020. This value reflects the gradual increase expected as influenza begins to circulate more widely approaching the core weeks of its peak season.
