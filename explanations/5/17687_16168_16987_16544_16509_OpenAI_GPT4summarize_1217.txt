1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating but overall slightly declining trend, with values of ['17687', '16168', '16987', '16544', '16509']. An initial drop occurred from 17687 (Week 5, 2024) to 16168 (Week 6, 2024), followed by a rise to 16987 in Week 7, 2024. The last two weeks showed a slight decline, ending at 16509 in Week 9, 2024. This general pattern shows some stabilization at slightly reduced levels by the end of the observed period.
2. A moderate correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the observed stabilization near the latter weeks of past data (Weeks 8–9, 2024) aligns with the reported decrease to 13338 cases after 5 weeks (Week 14, 2024). The reduction in ILI trends in recent weeks of the past data appears to preempt the lower future ILI occurrence level.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI held steady around elevated levels during Weeks 5–9, 2024, starting at 4.4% (Week 5, 2024), peaking at 4.5% (Weeks 6–7, 2024), then slightly declining to 4.1% by Week 9, 2024. This plateauing and gradual decrease in ILI-related healthcare visits over time aligns with diminished patient-reported influenza activity that contributes to the decreased future ILI occurrences.
4. Despite high hospitalization rates (cumulative rate of 64.8 per 100,000 as of Week 9, 2024), hospitalizations trended slightly downward after sharp increases earlier in the season. These decelerating hospitalization trends reflect lower severe influenza activity levels, which correlate with reduced future ILI occurrences.
5. Increased circulation of Influenza B (up to 43.1% of clinical lab detections by Week 9, 2024, versus 23.9% initially in Week 5, 2024) potentially influenced overall ILI trends. Historically, Influenza B seasons tend to exhibit slower surges compared to Influenza A-dominant periods, contributing to the observed moderation in ILI cases moving forward.
6. In summary, the future occurrences of 13338 after 5 weeks (Week 14, 2024) can be attributed to the slight decline and stabilization in past ILI trends, steady but reducing outpatient ILI visits, moderate decreases in hospitalization trends, and the shifting influenza subtype mix, which transitions to less-severe activity. These factors collectively point to a broader reduction in ILI activity over time.
