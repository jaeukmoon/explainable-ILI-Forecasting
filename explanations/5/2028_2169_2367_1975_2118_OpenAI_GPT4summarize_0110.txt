1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week52, 2020 to Week3, 2021 are 2028, 2169, 2367, 1975, and 2118. The trend initially increased from Week52, 2020 (2028) to Week1, 2021 (2367), followed by a sharp decline in Week2, 2021 (1975), and then a mild recovery in Week3, 2021 (2118). This pattern reflects fluctuations within a low baseline rather than a sustained increase or decrease.
2. Forecasting for Week8, 2021 would place it in the off-season category, since it is well beyond the typical peak season (Week46, 2020 to Week6, 2021). Low ILI positivity rates and suppressed influenza activity in recent data (Week52, 2020 #1; Week3, 2021 #1) indicate ongoing minimal ILI activity, characteristic of the off-season.
3. The fluctuating patterns in recent ILI data suggest that no abrupt increases are likely in the near future. Based on the general stability in ILI occurrences from Week52, 2020 to Week3, 2021, the projection for Week8, 2021 anticipates a slightly reduced number of 1521, indicative of ongoing low activity.
4. Influenza positivity remains historically low, with clinical lab positivity at 0.3% in Week3, 2021, below seasonal thresholds (Week52, 2020 #1; Week2, 2021 #1; Week3, 2021 #1).
5. Regional and national surveillance reveal that COVID-19 continues to heavily influence PIC mortality and dominates respiratory illness trends, further suppressing traditional influenza activity (Week52, 2020 #9; Week53, 2020 #9; Week3, 2021 #14).
6. CDC reports consistently warn of the potential for increased flu activity but acknowledge suppressed transmission patterns due to pandemic-related factors such as altered healthcare-seeking behavior and reduced viral competition (Week52, 2020 #10, #11; Week53, 2020 #11; Week3, 2021 #8, #10).
7. Combining the recent stability in ILI trends, low influenza positivity, dominant COVID-19 impact, and CDC expectations for low activity, the predicted ILI count of 1521 for Week8, 2021 aligns with observed data and off-season activity levels.
