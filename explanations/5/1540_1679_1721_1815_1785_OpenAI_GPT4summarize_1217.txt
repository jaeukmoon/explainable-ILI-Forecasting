1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an upward trend, with values of ['1540', '1679', '1721', '1815', '1785']. The trajectory began with 1540 (Week 38, 2021), steadily rising to reach a peak of 1815 (Week 41, 2021), followed by a slight decline to 1785 (Week 42, 2021). This overall increase reflects gradually growing ILI activity over the observed period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences can be identified as the rising trend in Weeks 38-41, 2021, and the slight decrease in Week 42 suggests a latent rise in influenza-like illness cases, eventually leading to further growth after five weeks, culminating in the reported number of 1855 in Week 47, 2021.
3. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC)-related deaths consistently remained above the epidemic threshold, gradually declining from 20.9% (Week 38, 2021) to 16.5% (Week 42, 2021). High PIC percentages during these weeks highlight substantial ongoing respiratory illness activity, which aligns with the rise in future ILI occurrences.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI fluctuated slightly but mostly remained stable, with percentages decreasing from 1.9% (Weeks 38-40, 2021) to 1.8% (Weeks 41-42, 2021). This steady, low-level activity suggests there were other indirect contributors, such as healthcare-seeking behavior changes, that could reflect a subsequent increase in ILI occurrences.
5. Minimal influenza circulation, with only 0.1% of specimens testing positive for influenza across Weeks 40-42, 2021, indicates that other respiratory pathogens and changing healthcare behaviors—potentially over-reporting non-influenza-like illnesses—played a role in driving future ILI increases.
6. In summary, the reported 1855 future ILI occurrences (Week 47, 2021) can be attributed to the upward ILI trend in Weeks 38-41, elevated PIC-related mortality above epidemic thresholds, stable outpatient ILI visits, and the interplay of low influenza activity alongside non-specific respiratory pathogen contributions and altered healthcare-seeking behaviors.
