1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks revealed a fluctuating yet stable trend, with values of ['1626', '1786', '1856', '1789', '1817']. An increase from 1626 (Week18, 2021) to 1856 (Week20, 2021) was observed, followed by minor fluctuations, stabilizing around 1817 (Week22, 2021). This trend indicates moderate ILI activity with no sharp upward or downward shifts.
2. A weak positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is suggested as the relatively stable trend in the past around 1817 (Week22, 2021) potentially provided a baseline for the modest increase to 2193 after 5 weeks. The slight rise in activity during earlier weeks (Week18 to Week20, 2021) aligns with the observed future increase.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistent across the timeframe, with values ranging from 1.1% (Week21, 2021) to 1.3% (Week20, 2021), which stayed below the national baseline of 2.6%. Minimal ILI activity nationwide during these weeks likely contributed to moderated future increases.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) fluctuated near or above epidemic thresholds (10.9% in Week18 to 7.5% in Week22, 2021). While primarily linked to COVID-19, such elevated respiratory mortality may indirectly signal increased stress on public health systems, leading to increased ILI activity ahead.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as noted across all summarized reports, have heavily impacted ILI surveillance. These ongoing adjustments, combined with alternative care patterns and syndromic reporting, could account for the increase to 2193 occurrences as data capture adapts to pandemic-related concerns.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 2193 (Week27, 2021) can be explained by a stable baseline trend in Weeks18–22, 2021, slight increases in outpatient ILI visits, elevated PIC mortality rates signaling respiratory stress, and the compounded effects of pandemic-related shifts in healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI data surveillance systems.
