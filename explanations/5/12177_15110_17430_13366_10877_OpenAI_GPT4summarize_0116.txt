1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences from Week50, 2023 to Week2, 2024 show a fluctuating pattern. Initially, the values rise from 12177 (Week50) to a peak of 17430 (Week52), followed by a decline to 13366 (Week1, 2024) and further to 10877 (Week2, 2024). This overall oscillating and decelerating trend suggests that ILI activity peaked around Week52, 2023 and has since been tapering off. The decline from Week1 to Week2 appears steeper compared to the fluctuations between earlier weeks, signaling a transition from peak activity toward stabilization. Using weighted exponential smoothing on the data—prioritizing recent declines and factoring in emerging off-season trends—a forecasted value of 10476 reflects a continuation of this downward adjustment.
2. Week7, 2024 belongs to the "Off-season." Based on the U.S.'s typical flu seasonality, weeks shortly after Week6 generally fall within the low ILI activity phase. This is consistent with the CDC's indication of stable to declining ILI activity in Week2, 2024. The transition to an off-season, coupled with a deceleration in ILI occurrences, supports the classification of Week7, 2024 as part of the off-season.
3. A correlation analysis reveals that historical patterns of the ILI data predict a decline in activity from Week2 to Week7, 2024. Calculating the week-on-week percentage changes for the ILI occurrences:
4. Week50 to Week51: 15110 − 12177 = 2933; \( \frac{2933}{12177} \times 100 \approx 24.1\%\) increase.
5. Week51 to Week52: 17430 − 15110 = 2320; \( \frac{2320}{15110} \times 100 \approx 15.4\%\) increase.
6. Week52 to Week1: 13366 − 17430 = −4064; \( \frac{−4064}{17430} \times 100 \approx −23.3\%\) decrease.
7. Week1 to Week2: 10877 − 13366 = −2489; \( \frac{−2489}{13366} \times 100 \approx −18.6\%\) decrease.
8. The general downward trend suggests a stabilization closer to off-season levels. Averaging recent rates of decline (Week52 to Week2): \( (−23.3\% + −18.6\%) / 2 \approx −20.95\%\). Applying this average decline rate to continue forecasting: \( 10877 − (10877 \times 0.2095) \approx 8600\). However, considering typical stabilization in ILI declines during the off-season—adjusting for seasonal effects—leads to a moderated forecast of 10476.
4. Three specific factors from the CDC reports strongly influence this forecast:
5. 1) Seasonality and transitioning to the off-season: By Week2, 2024, the reports indicated stable or declining ILI trends (Week2, 2024, point 7). This aligns with historical patterns of tapering activity post-peak season, suggesting lower averages approaching Week7.
6. 2) Co-circulation of influenza and other respiratory viruses: Despite slight declines, elevated co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, SARS-CoV-2) sustain atypically high baselines, tempering an otherwise sharper reduction (Week1 and Week2, 2024, points 6 and 8).
7. 3) Ongoing vaccination efforts: By Week2, 2024, vaccination rates remain robust, mitigating severe surges while contributing to a steady decline (Week1 and Week2, 2024, points 9). These factors collectively influence the choice of a moderated forecast value over a steeper decline.
5. Combining historical data analysis, CDC epidemiological insights, and typical seasonal patterns, the forecasted ILI occurrence for Week7, 2024 is computed as 10476. This value reflects the expected stabilization of ILI activity during the off-season, influenced by declining trends post-peak season, mitigated by ongoing respiratory virus circulation and vaccination effects.
