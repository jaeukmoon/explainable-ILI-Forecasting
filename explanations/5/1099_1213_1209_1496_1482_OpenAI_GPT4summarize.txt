1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over 5 weeks showed a clear upward trend, starting at 1099 (Week 11, 2021) and peaking at 1496 in Week 13, followed by a slight decline to 1482 by Week 15. While fluctuations were observed (e.g., a minor drop from 1213 in Week 12 to 1209 in Week 13 before rising sharply), the general pattern indicates increasing ILI activity, particularly between Weeks 12 and 14, suggesting a predisposition for higher activity in subsequent weeks.  

2. A positive correlation is evident between past and future ILI occurrences, as the increasing trend in the latter weeks of the past data (Weeks 13–15, 2021) aligns with the spike to 1645 future occurrences observed 5 weeks later (Week 20, 2021). The past upward movement in ILI occurrences points to heightened future levels, consistent with this trajectory.  

3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed minimal but consistent increases, rising from 0.9% in Weeks 11 and 12 to 1.0% in Week 13 and 1.1% in Weeks 14 and 15, albeit still below the national baseline of 2.6%. This steady growth in ILI-related healthcare interactions correlates with the future rise in occurrences, reflecting an incremental rise in symptomatic illnesses over time.  

4. Persistent excess mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained above epidemic thresholds in all weeks, ranging from 11.4% in Week 12 to 12.4% in Week 15, driven primarily by COVID-19. These elevated PIC levels, indicative of respiratory illness severity, align with the reported rise in future ILI occurrences.  

5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, noted across all summarized CDC reports, disrupted ILI surveillance and likely delayed case detection. Altered reporting systems and overlapping COVID-19 symptoms may aggregate ILI cases, explaining the future increase to 1645.  

6. The CDC’s warnings of potential future increases due to low current influenza activity and overlapping respiratory trends were consistent across Weeks 11–15, 2021. This cautionary stance aligns with the subsequent rise in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks, reflecting the cumulative impact of delayed transmission dynamics.  

7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences reaching 1645 (Week 20, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks 13–15, increasing outpatient visits, persistent PIC mortality exceeding thresholds, disrupted healthcare-seeking and reporting behaviors, and CDC’s anticipation of delayed viral activity trends.
