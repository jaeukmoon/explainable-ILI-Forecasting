1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent upward trend, progressing from 13,484 (Week 16, 2022) to 21,269 (Week 20, 2022). Weekly increases were observed as follows: +859 from Week 16 to Week 17, +1,453 from Week 17 to Week 18, +2,994 from Week 18 to Week 19, and +2,479 from Week 19 to Week 20. This steady escalation highlights intensifying ILI activity, culminating in a peak at Week 20, 2022.

2. A strong positive correlation is evident between the past and future ILI occurrences. The sharp upward trajectory in past ILI occurrences (particularly the significant increases in Weeks 18–20, 2022) is consistent with the reported future value of 15,495 (Week 25, 2022). The observed activity reduction from the Week 20 peak (21,269) to the future value (15,495) corresponds to the typical tapering of activity late in seasonal influenza trends but remains elevated relative to earlier weeks (e.g., Week 16 levels).

3. Influenza activity trends in the CDC reports demonstrate increasing positivity rates for influenza in clinical specimens, starting at 7.8% in Week 16 and reducing slightly to 6.4% in Week 20. This heightened activity, dominated by Influenza A(H3N2) (constituting 98.8%-99.6% of positives across all weeks), strongly correlates with the escalating past ILI occurrences and the subsequent high future value.  
   Additionally, cumulative hospitalization rates rose steadily, from 11.1 per 100,000 in Week 16 to 15.5 per 100,000 in Week 20. This increase reflects heightened severity and healthcare burden, which aligns with the elevated ILI occurrences.  
   Another correlating factor is the upward trend in deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC), surpassing the epidemic threshold in all weeks and rising from 6.8% in Week 16 to 8.0% in Week 20. Persistent PIC mortality signifies a broader burden of severe respiratory illnesses influencing future ILI activity.  
   Furthermore, outpatient visits for ILI rose from 2.1% in Week 16 to 2.4% by Week 20. This gradual increase aligns with rising healthcare-seeking behaviors and the overall reported higher ILI occurrences in both the past and future.

4. The reported 15,495 future ILI occurrences (Week 25, 2022) are attributable to the steady upward trend in past ILI occurrences, compounded by the increasing influenza positivity rates, cumulative hospitalization trends, and elevated PIC mortality and outpatient ILI visit proportions noted in the CDC reports. These factors collectively signify sustained and geographically variable influenza virus activity alongside late-season respiratory illness contributions. This culminates in the observed high future ILI value, although with a moderated decline from the Week 20 peak.
