1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week30 to Week34, 2021 are 1609, 1910, 1936, 2164, and 2131. The trend demonstrates a consistent increase from Week30 to Week33, followed by a slight decrease in Week34. This pattern reflects overall growth with minor fluctuations, suggesting rising influenza-like illness transmission influenced by other respiratory viruses.
2. Based on seasonal classification, Week39, 2021 aligns with the Peak onset season. Historically, the Peak onset season encompasses Week32 to Week46, and recent weekly CDC reports suggest early indications of increased respiratory illness activities, particularly among younger age groups. Additionally, influenza activity remains low, consistent with this transitional phase.
3. The correlation analysis between past ILI trends and future occurrences highlights a rising pattern disrupted only by a slight Week34 decline. Projecting this forward maintains an expectation of stabilizing or decreasing ILI levels after an earlier period of growth. Given the overall low influenza positivity and increases in non-influenza respiratory illnesses, the anticipated value of 1587 aligns with these consistent forecasts during a Peak onset season.
4. Outpatient ILI visits increased across all age groups over five weeks, largely attributable to non-influenza respiratory illnesses (Week30, 2021 #7; Week31, 2021 #1; Week33, 2021 #8).
5. Future influenza activity is uncertain as low flu positivity persists, but ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory viruses and novel influenza variants (Week32, 2021 #2, #9) can shift ILI trends.
6. Changes in healthcare-seeking behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Week31, 2021 #8; Week33, 2021 #9; Week34, 2021 #8) have altered data accuracy and may temper the observed ILI spike. Current ILI trends likely reflect this distortion rather than a substantial influenza resurgence.
7. With a growing trend in ILI occurrences (moderating by Week34), the Peak onset season timing, and a forecast strongly influenced by non-influenza respiratory illness activity and healthcare behavior changes, Week39, 2021’s projection of 1587 is justified.
