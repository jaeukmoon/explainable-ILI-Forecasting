1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showcased an overall upward trend, increasing from 1349 (Week 6, 2023) to 1453 (Week 10, 2023). While minor fluctuations occurred in Weeks 7–8, with values dropping slightly to 1310, there was a notable rise in Weeks 9 and 10, indicating intensified ILI activity by the end of the observed period.
2. A positive relationship exists between the past and future ILI occurrences. The rise observed in the latter part of the past data (Weeks 9–10, 2023) correlates with the reported future value of 1264 after 5 weeks (Week 16, 2023). This declining pattern suggests residual effects of the earlier increase in ILI activity, stabilizing to a lower, sustained level.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained above or near the national baseline, ranging between 2.6% (Week 7, 2023) and 2.4% (Week 11, 2023). The consistency of these values aligns with expected ILI trends, influencing the subsequent occurrence of 1264 future cases.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently surpassed epidemic thresholds, ranging from 9.0% (Week 7, 2023) to 8.6% (Week 10, 2023), signaling persistent respiratory illness activity that aligns with the observed future ILI occurrence.
5. The co-circulation of respiratory pathogens, including Influenza A, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV, continuously documented throughout Weeks 7–11, 2023, complicated the interpretation of ILI patterns. These overlapping illnesses likely contributed to sustained ILI activity, reflected in the future occurrence of 1264 cases.
6. In summary, the reported future occurrence of 1264 (Week 16, 2023) can be attributed to the upward trend in ILI activity in Weeks 9 and 10, 2023, stable outpatient visit proportions, persistent PIC mortality trends exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the compounding effects of multiple co-circulating respiratory pathogens affecting the overall influenza-like illness trajectory.
