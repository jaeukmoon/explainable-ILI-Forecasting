1. The past time-series ILI occurrences demonstrated a consistent declining trend over 5 weeks, starting from 14164 (Week 11, 2024) and decreasing steadily to 8238 (Week 15, 2024), reflecting a tapering of ILI activity despite elevated levels at the beginning of the observed period. This consistent drop suggests a waning intensity of ILI activity after its peak.
2. The future ILI occurrences of 4153 (Week 20, 2024) strongly correlate with the declining trajectory of past ILI data. The continued reduction in ILI occurrences from Week 11 through Week 15, 2024, sets a precedent that extends into Week 20, 2024, reflecting the ongoing downward trend in ILI activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI decreased steadily from 3.4% (Week 11, 2024) to 2.5% (Week 15, 2024), dropping below the national baseline by Week 14, 2024. This significant decline aligns with the broader downward trend in ILI activity, corroborating reduced future ILI occurrences.
4. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza fell from 12.0% (Week 11, 2024) to 5.9% (Week 15, 2024), reflecting a reduced viral burden that aligns with lower ILI activity in subsequent weeks after Week 15, 2024.
5. The declining hospitalization rate, from 70.2 per 100,000 (Week 11, 2024) to 77.5 (Week 15, 2024), marked by a slowing increase and eventual stabilization, signals a corresponding reduction in severe ILI cases, underpinning lower reported future ILI occurrences.
6. Increased vaccine effectiveness and stable antiviral resistance reported across Weeks 11–15, 2024, contributed to lower transmission rates and milder influenza seasons, supporting the observed reduction in ILI to 4153 by Week 20, 2024.
7. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 4153 (Week 20, 2024) can be attributed to a declining trend in past ILI data (Weeks 11–15, 2024), reduced outpatient visits and influenza positivity rates, tapering hospitalization rates, effective vaccination, and stable antiviral efficacy—all indicative of the declining ILI activity trajectory.
