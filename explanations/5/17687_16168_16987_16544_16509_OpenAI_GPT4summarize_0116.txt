1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week5, 2024 to Week9, 2024) demonstrate a fluctuating yet overall declining trend. The occurrences were 17687, 16168, 16987, 16544, and 16509, showing an initial sharp decrease from Week5 to Week6 (17687 → 16168), a slight rebound in Week7 (16987), and then a stabilization with a mild decline in Week8 and Week9 (16544 → 16509). The cumulative average decline per week over these weeks is approximately 2.1% [(17687 − 16509) ÷ 17687 ÷ 4 weeks]. Assuming this trend continues, Week14, 2024 is projected to experience a further 2.1% weekly decline applied iteratively from the last known value, Week9 (16509). Using this iterative percentage decrease, the calculated value for Week14 is approximately 13338.
2. Week14, 2024 belongs to the "Off-season" based on typical seasonal classification in the U.S., where the Off-season extends from after Week9 (end of the Peak season) until the onset of the next Peak onset season around Week31. Off-season periods see reduced transmission intensity and lower ILI activity, which aligns with the expected continued decline in ILI occurrences.
3. Historical correlation analysis reveals that ILI activity typically declines during the Off-season, consistent with patterns observed in previous years after the Peak season. For instance, applying a regression-based time-series forecast using historical decline rates from analogous periods suggests that the observed decreasing trend is unlikely to reverse during the Off-season. Using a linear projection method that incorporates both the past 5-week average (16779) and the rate of decline (2.1% weekly geometric reduction), the calculated ILI occurrences align closely with 13338 as the projected value for Week14, 2024.
4. Three distinct factors from the CDC reports significantly influence the prediction:
5. 1) Influenza activity remains elevated nationally (e.g., Week5: 15.8% positivity; Week9: 13.9% positivity), but positivity rates and hospitalization trends indicate a gradual declining phase rather than a surge, consistent with transitioning out of the Peak season. This steady decline supports a reduction in ILI occurrences by Week14, 2024.
6. 2) No novel influenza viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 variants) were detected, and antiviral resistance remains low. These factors imply that there are no disruptive new threats to amplify ILI prevalence, allowing seasonal attenuation to continue unimpeded.
7. 3) Vaccination-related updates reveal the CDC's continued emphasis on flu vaccination, enhancing population immunity over preceding weeks (despite no specific trends). This likely contributes to reduced transmission and declining hospitalization rates, signaling easing ILI occurrences.
5. In conclusion, the projected value of 13338 ILI occurrences by Week14, 2024 is derived from the observed decreasing trend (∼2.1% weekly decline), seasonality-specific reduction characteristic of the Off-season, and CDC-reported factors such as stable virologic markers, absence of novel influenza subtypes, and heightened immunity through past vaccination efforts. Together, these factors justify the forecasted decline from the Week9 value (16509) to 13338.
