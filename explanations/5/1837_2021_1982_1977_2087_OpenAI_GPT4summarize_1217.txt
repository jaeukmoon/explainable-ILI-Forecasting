1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating trend, with values of ['1837', '2021', '1982', '1977', '2087']. There was an initial rise from 1837 (Week10, 2021) to a peak at 2021 (Week11, 2021), followed by a slight decrease to 1977 (Week13, 2021) before rebounding to 2087 in Week14, 2021. This pattern reflects instability yet ends with the highest occurrence in Week14, suggesting a developing upward phase in ILI activity.
2. A weak positive correlation is noted between the fluctuating nature of the past occurrences and the future ILI occurrences of 1831 (Week19, 2021). The observed peak in Week14, 2021, which is higher than any previous week, slightly hints at ongoing potential for ILI activity, yet the subsequent drop in Week19, 2021, suggests stabilization or decline.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI were consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%, with minimal variations: 0.9% (Week10–Week12, 2021), 1.0% (Week13, 2021), and 1.1% (Week14, 2021). This steady yet slight increase in outpatient ILI visits likely contributed to sustaining ILI occurrences at 1831 after 5 weeks. Minimal ILI activity across all U.S. jurisdictions further suggests limited geographical spread.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained above the epidemic threshold but generally decreased from 13.3% (Week10, 2021) to 11.2% (Week14, 2021). Despite the high PIC contribution by COVID-19, the decline in PIC deaths may have contributed to the slowing of ILI occurrences in the subsequent weeks.
5. Continued low influenza positivity rates, fluctuating between 0.1% across all weeks, with limited lab detections (e.g., 1 Influenza A specimen in Week12, 2021, and 0 specimens by Week14, 2021), support the lack of significant flu-related ILI activity. Behavioral changes due to COVID-19 and restricted flu spread likely suppressed flu contributions to ILI occurrences, mitigating dramatic increases in Week19, 2021.
6. In summary, the future occurrence of 1831 ILI cases (Week19, 2021) is explained by the overall fluctuating trend observed during the past 5 weeks, slight increases in outpatient ILI visit percentages, declining PIC mortality, consistently low influenza test positivity rates, and continued impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare-seeking behaviors, all of which contributed to tempered and stable ILI activity.
