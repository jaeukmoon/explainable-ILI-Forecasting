1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall steady upward trend: ['1719', '1761', '1721', '1888', '1992']. Week 28, 2023, started at 1719, with a minor increase to 1761 in Week 29. A slight dip to 1721 in Week 30 was followed by a significant rise to 1888 in Week 31 and 1992 in Week 32, marking sustained growth in ILI activity by the end of the observed period.
2. A positive correlation exists between the rising trend in past occurrences and the future ILI occurrences of 3647. The steady escalation observed in occurrences during Weeks 31 and 32, 2023, projects sustained higher activity, with the recorded future surge aligning with the established increasing trajectory.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually increased over the analyzed weeks, from 1.2% in Week 28, 2023, remaining consistent at 1.1%-1.2% through Week 31, followed by an increase to 1.3% in Week 32. This upward pattern in healthcare-seeking behavior likely contributed directly to increased reported cases.
4. Consistently high PIC mortality hovered around or exceeded the epidemic thresholds, from 5.8% in Week 28 to 6.1% in Week 32, indicating prominence of respiratory illnesses, including flu, which aligns with the rise in ILI cases.
5. Increased hospital admissions for influenza in the later weeks reinforced the pattern of rising activity, growing from 573 admissions in Week 29, 649 in Week 30, to 677 in Week 32. This reflects a tangible growth in severe cases that closely parallels the observed upward trend in ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, mentioned consistently in Weeks 28-32, alongside influenza, likely amplified the respiratory illness burden. These multiple contributors further drove the rise in future ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the recorded future occurrence of 3647 can be attributed to the steady upward trend in past ILI occurrences during Weeks 28-32, 2023, gradual increases in outpatient ILI visits, elevated PIC mortality rates exceeding thresholds, growth in hospitalizations, and the compounded burden of co-circulating pathogens.
