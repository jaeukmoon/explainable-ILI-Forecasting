1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent upward trend: ['1054', '1075', '1331', '1372', '1609']. The initial weeks demonstrated a modest increase from 1054 (Week 26, 2021) to 1075 (Week 27, 2021), followed by a sharper rise to 1609 by Week 30, 2021. This progressive growth pattern suggests escalating respiratory illness activity during this period.  

2. A clear positive correlation exists between the rising past ILI occurrences and future occurrences of 2388 by Week 35, 2021. The increasing trend in the last three weeks of past data (Weeks 28–30, 2021) serves as a precursor, reflecting heightened respiratory illness activity, which subsequently culminated in the amplified future ILI occurrence.  

3. Outpatient visits for ILI increased steadily, from 1.2% in Week 26, 2021, to 1.9% in Week 30, 2021, with consistent increases across all age groups. This rise in healthcare encounters for respiratory symptoms indicates a broader spread of respiratory illnesses, which likely contributed to the future surge in ILI occurrences.  

4. PIC deaths (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) consistently remained above epidemic thresholds, increasing from 6.2% (Week 26, 2021) to 9.0% (Week 30, 2021). These elevated mortality levels signal ongoing substantial respiratory disease activity, aligning with the surge in future ILI cases.  

5. The cumulative effects of disrupted healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported weekly, hampered accurate ILI surveillance. This disruption may have deferred case identification or intensified concentration of ILI cases, thereby contributing to the escalation to 2388 occurrences after five weeks.  

6. Despite consistently low influenza positivity rates, with negligible specimens testing positive (0.1% in Week 27, 2021), broader non-specific respiratory illnesses and pandemic-related factors likely fueled the rising ILI trends. Behavioral shifts and concurrent respiratory pathogen activity could have amplified the future ILI numbers.  

7. In summary, the future occurrence of 2388 ILI cases (Week 35, 2021) can be attributed to the evident upward trend in the past data, consistent increases in ILI outpatient visits, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and disruptions in healthcare-seeking patterns and surveillance during the pandemic. This confluence of factors collectively shaped the sharp rise in future ILI activity.
