1. The ILI occurrences from Week27 to Week31, 2022 are recorded as 14344, 13771, 13570, 13067, and 11626, respectively. This data reveals a clear decreasing trend in reported cases over the five weeks, with a consistent decline in weekly ILI numbers as no significant spikes or fluctuations were observed. The sustained drop indicates a subdued ILI activity during this period.
2. Week36, 2022 falls within the Peak onset season according to typical U.S. classifications, as it occurs after the off-season but before the traditional Peak season. Although current activity remains low, this timeframe aligns with the period when influenza and ILI activity historically begin to transition from baseline levels toward higher prevalence.
3. From a time-series perspective, the declining pattern seen between Week27 and Week31, 2022 suggests diminishing ILI activity. However, considering that Week36, 2022 is situated in the Peak onset season, a cautious increase from the Week27-Week31 baseline is plausible. Historical seasonality and the typical acceleration of influenza-like illnesses in the Peak onset period contribute to the projected increase to 15839 ILI occurrences, reflecting an uptick while acknowledging prior lower activity.
4. Influenza positivity rates remain extremely low across clinical and public health labs (Week27, 2022 #1, #2; Week31, 2022 #1, #3). Nonetheless, seasonal transitions, healthcare access shifts, and lingering impacts of co-circulating respiratory viruses, such as COVID-19 and other pathogens, complicate the predictability of ILI trends.
5. Vaccination data and trends are not consistently emphasized (Week27, 2022 #8; Week30, 2022 #9), which limits potential protective coverage. This could allow for increased susceptibility to influenza-related illnesses as influenza's seasonal activity begins to rise.
6. The novel Influenza A (H3N2)v variants, reported in Week30 and Week31, 2022 (Week30, 2022 #7; Week31, 2022 #4), although linked to isolated zoonotic exposure without sustained human-to-human transmission, signal the possibility of new variants introducing variability into influenza patterns.
7. In conclusion, the forecast of 15839 ILI occurrences for Week36, 2022 is supported by the seasonal classification of Peak onset, the anticipated rise in activity following a period of decline, and contributing factors such as low vaccination emphasis, the potential impact of new influenza variant cases, and seasonality. Despite the earlier decreasing trend through Week31, 2022, the historical and epidemiological context supports an expectation of increasing ILI activity in the following weeks.
