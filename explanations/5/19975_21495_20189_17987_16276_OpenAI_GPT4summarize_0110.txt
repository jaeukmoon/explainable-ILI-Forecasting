1. The reported ILI counts from Week32 to Week36, 2021 are 19975, 21495, 20189, 17987, and 16276. The trend illustrates a noticeable decrease in ILI occurrences over the five weeks, declining steadily from 21495 in Week33 to 16276 in Week36. This marks a clear and consistent downward trajectory during the given period, with no substantial upward fluctuation or spike in the data.
2. Considering the classification of seasons in the U.S., Week41, 2021 occurs during the Peak onset season, which spans roughly from Week32 to Week46. This aligns with both temporal positioning and the ongoing decline in influenza activity noted during the earlier weeks, suggesting a pre-peak phase of low ILI prevalence.
3. The historical downward trend observed in Weeks32 to Week36 forecasts a continuation of reduced ILI occurrences in the following weeks. Extrapolating this decreasing pattern using a time-series perspective, a projected count of 11738 ILI occurrences for Week41, 2021 aligns with the ongoing decline visible in preceding weeks.
4. Novel influenza variants (Week32, 2021 #2) present minimal influence on human transmission as no human-to-human spread was reported, mitigating their contribution to ILI activity.
5. The consistently low national influenza circulation and minimal positivity rates (Week32, 2021 #7; Week33, 2021 #3; Week34, 2021 #1) strongly suggest limited flu contributions to ILI trends, with other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, accounting for most respiratory illness (Week33, 2021 #3).
6. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes driven by the pandemic (Week34, 2021 #8; Week36, 2021 #9) impact the accuracy of ILI reporting, which could exaggerate the effect of other respiratory illnesses on these trends while dampening actual influenza-related data visibility.
7. Forecasting 11738 ILI occurrences for Week41, 2021 is justified by the notable five-week reduction, the off-peak phase of limited ILI activity, minimal influenza spread with no dominant variant emergence, and potential reporting biases highlighting respiratory illnesses other than influenza.
