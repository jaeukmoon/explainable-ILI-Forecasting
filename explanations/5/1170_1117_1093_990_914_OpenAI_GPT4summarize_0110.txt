1. The reported ILI counts from Week3 to Week7, 2021 are 1170, 1117, 1093, 990, and 914. The trend indicates a consistent decline over the five weeks, with no significant spikes or fluctuations, showing a stable and decreasing trajectory.
2. Based on U.S. influenza seasonality patterns, Week12, 2021 falls after the typical peak season (which ends around Week6) and within the off-season phase. Additionally, minimal ILI activity, as observed in Weeks3-7, 2021, further supports the classification of Week12, 2021 within the off-season period.
3. From the time-series perspective, the continuous decline over the prior five weeks suggests a downtrend stabilization, influenced by low influenza activity and external factors such as COVID-19. Projecting forward to Week12, 2021, this pattern indicates a shift toward stabilization or a slight rebound, leading to the forecasted value of 1213 ILI occurrences, reflecting a potential minor increase compared to Week7, 2021.
4. CDC reports (Week3-7, 2021) highlight unusually low influenza positivity rates, ranging from 0.1% to 0.3% nationally, with declining outpatient ILI visits (Week3, 2021 #4; Week4, 2021 #3; Week7, 2021 #4). These persistently low activity levels correlate directly with the observed decreasing trend in ILI occurrences.
5. COVID-19 continues to adversely affect healthcare-seeking behaviors and data interpretation, limiting traditional ILI trend analysis (Week3, 2021 #7; Week5, 2021 #9; Week7, 2021 #9). This disruption may explain some uncertainty in projections, including the slight rebound anticipated by Week12.
6. Influenza B has been consistently dominant among detected influenza cases (Week3, 2021 #2; Week4, 2021 #7; Week6, 2021 #2), but its overall prevalence remains low, and no new severe variants or unusual patterns were reported, ensuring minimal impact on total ILI occurrences.
7. Combining the prior five-week decline, off-season classification in Week12, 2021, and persistent low activity levels despite external disruptions, the forecasted 1213 ILI occurrences reflect stabilization with a mild potential increase, likely influenced by minor adjustments in healthcare behaviors.
