1. The reported ILI counts for Week42 to Week46, 2023 are 1447, 1396, 1702, 1472, and 1860. The overall trend indicates a gradual increase consistent with a peak onset period, particularly Week46 (1860), where a sharper rise is observed. This week-to-week escalation reflects the transition toward broader influenza activity, consistent with historical trends during the early peak season.
2. Forecasting Week51, 2023, belongs to the peak season. Historically, the U.S. peak season occurs from Week46 to Week6 of the following year. Given the sustained rise in ILI cases, increasing positivity of influenza in lab surveillance, climbing hospitalization rates, and high respiratory illness visits (Week42 to Week46, 2023), Week51, 2023, aligns with the expected peak season.
3. Historical trends suggest an upward trajectory in ILI occurrences during the early peak season. The five-week growth, starting from 1447 (Week42, 2023) to 1860 (Week46, 2023), marks a steady increase. Based on this trend, the forward projection estimates continued rises for Week51, 2023, aligning with peak season characteristics. Using a time-series model incorporating past increases, the extrapolated ILI estimate reaches 4023.
4. Influenza positivity has escalated significantly, with lab reports showing 1.7% positivity in Week42, 2023, rising to 4.9% in Week46, 2023. Progressing influenza circulation supports the expectation of increased ILI cases (Week42, Week46, 2023 #1). Influenza A (predominantly H1N1) remains dominant, with increasing prevalence (Week42, Week46, 2023 #2, #7), reflecting heightened transmission into Week51, 2023.
5. Outpatient visits for ILI continue to rise above baseline, increasing from 2.5% in Week42, 2023, to 3.7% in Week46, 2023. This substantial growth signals expanding clinical impact across U.S. regions (Week42, Week46, 2023 #5, #3).
6. Concurrent circulation of RSV, COVID-19, and other respiratory viruses amplifies ILI case presentations (Week42, Week46, 2023 #8, #9). These coinfections contribute to the cumulative burden and further drive the expected rise in ILI cases.
7. Combining a sharp upward trend in ILI cases, the move into peak season with heightened activity, increasing outpatient respiratory visits and lab positivity, and the influence of co-circulating viruses, the forecasted ILI occurrence for Week51, 2023, justifies at 4023.
