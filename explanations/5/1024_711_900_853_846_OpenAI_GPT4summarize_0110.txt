1. The reported ILI counts from Week25 to Week29, 2022 are 1024, 711, 900, 853, and 846. This trend shows a significant drop from Week25 (1024) to Week26 (711), followed by a moderate rebound in Week27 (900) before stabilizing slightly lower toward Week29 (846). The overall trajectory reflects a fluctuating but generally subdued pattern without any sharp rise or sustained increases in ILI activity.
2. Week34, 2022, belongs to the off-season based on the typical U.S. influenza seasonality patterns. Influenza activity from Week25 to Week29, 2022, has remained low (Week25, 2022 #1; Week26, 2022 #1, #9; Week29, 2022 #1, #7) with minimal positivity rates and subdued hospitalizations, which is consistent with the off-season period (weeks following the peak season and preceding the peak onset season).
3. From Week29, 2022 (846 ILI cases), projecting forward five weeks through a time-series model suggests that the observed stable or slightly fluctuating rates will persist. The lack of past weeks' sharp increases or seasonally driven surges provides little basis for expecting large shifts, resulting in a forecast of 1299 occurrences by Week34, 2022, slightly higher due to minor anticipated fluctuations.
4. Nationwide influenza positivity rates are extremely low, declining from Week25 (1.8%) to Week27, Week28, and Week29 (0.7%), with minimal Influenza A dominance (Week25, 2022 #1, #2; Week28, 2022 #1; Week29, 2022 #1), indicating ongoing limited flu circulation.
5. Healthcare-seeking behavior and altered trends due to SARS-CoV-2 and RSV co-circulation (Week25, 2022 #10; Week28, 2022 #8; Week29, 2022 #10) appear to stabilize influenza activity, with other respiratory illnesses driving most outpatient ILI visits instead of influenza itself.
6. Influenza-associated outpatient visits remain well below national baselines (Week28, 2022 #3; Week29, 2022 #3), coupled with low hospitalization counts reported consistently from Week25 (1307) to Week29 (586) (Week25, 2022 #5; Week29, 2022 #4), indicating reduced transmission and disease severity.
7. With observed stable ILI counts, the timing within the off-season (Week34, 2022), relatively low virus circulation and positivity rates, and co-circulating respiratory illnesses influencing ILI data, it is reasonable to forecast an ILI occurrence of 1299 for Week34, 2022, reflecting marginal but mild increases remaining within a stable off-season range.
