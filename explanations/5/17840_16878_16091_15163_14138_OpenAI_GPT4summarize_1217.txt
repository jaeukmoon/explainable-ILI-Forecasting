1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent downward trend, with values decreasing from 17840 in Week12, 2024, to 14138 in Week16, 2024. This sustained decline reflects reduced influenza activity over time, aligning with seasonal patterns and declining outpatient respiratory illness visits.
2. A strong positive correlation between the past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The steady reduction in ILI activity during Weeks12–16, 2024, directly precedes the reported future value of 12081. This five-week lag suggests that the deceleration pattern in past occurrences was a precursor for continued decline in future activity, albeit at a slower rate.
3. Outpatient ILI visits steadily decreased from 3.1% in Week12, 2024, to 2.3% in Week16, 2024. This decrease below the national baseline reflects diminishing ILI activity, consistent with the lower future value of 12081.
4. Cumulative hospitalization rates, though among the highest observed (from 72.2 per 100,000 in Week12, 2024, to 79.0 per 100,000 in Week16, 2024), showed declining weekly admissions. This reduction in acute respiratory illness severity aligns with the future decline in ILI activity.
5. Persistent co-circulation of other viruses (e.g., RSV, COVID-19) in all five weeks likely reduced the proportion of influenza-specific ILI, contributing to overall lower ILI counts by the future projection of 12081 in Week21, 2024.
6. In summary, the reported 12081 future ILI occurrences (Week21, 2024) can be explained by a steady weekly decline in past occurrences, declining outpatient ILI visits, reduced hospitalization rates, and the influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses diluting influenza-specific impacts.
