1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a steady upward trend, with occurrences of ['13019', '16110', '16863', '18059', '18300']. There was a notable increase from 13019 in Week4, 2024, to 16110 in Week5, 2024, followed by relatively consistent weekly growth peaking at 18300 in Week8, 2024. This pattern reflects a persistent escalation in ILI activity through the observed period.
2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the increasing trend in the past data, particularly the sustained rise from 16863 (Week6, 2024) to 18300 (Week8, 2024), precedes the observed decrease to 9899 future occurrences in Week14, 2024. While the future decrease may suggest diminished ILI activity, the prior intensity likely influenced residual elevated cases.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained above baseline throughout Weeks5–9, 2024, fluctuating between 4.4% and 4.5%. Despite slight regional variations, these elevated visits reflect substantial respiratory illness activity, which aligns with sustained ILI occurrences and aids in understanding the high yet declining numbers of 9899 occurrences in Week14, 2024.
4. High influenza positivity rates, notably 15.8% (Week5, 2024) and progressively reduced to 13.9% (Week9, 2024), combined with significant co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV and COVID-19), complicated care trends and potentially inflated cumulative ILI cases over this period. These factors likely contributed to the persistence of elevated numbers such as 9899 in Week14, 2024.
5. Hospitalization rates climbed from 51.5 per 100,000 (Week5, 2024) to 64.8 per 100,000 (Week9, 2024), with older adults disproportionately affected. Such high hospitalization rates indicate severe overall illness burdens during this period, which likely sustained elevated occurrences even as activity began to decline toward Week14, 2024.
6. In summary, the reported 9899 future ILI occurrences in Week14, 2024, can be attributed to the observed steady increase in ILI occurrences in Weeks4–8, 2024, elevated outpatient ILI visits above baseline, high influenza positivity rates amid co-circulating respiratory viruses, and persistently high hospitalization rates, reflecting cumulative effects despite a downward transition by Week14, 2024.
