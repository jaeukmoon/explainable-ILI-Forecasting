1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week27, 2024 to Week31, 2024) demonstrate an increasing trend. The values are as follows: 1799, 2285, 2234, 2362, and 2432. There was an initial sharp increase from 1799 (Week27) to 2285 (Week28), followed by a small dip to 2234 (Week29), then a consistent rise in Week30 (2362) and Week31 (2432). Overall, there is a steady upward trend in these weeks, suggesting ILI activity is increasing but at a gradual pace. This points to a progressive movement toward higher ILI occurrences.
2. Forecasting target week (Week36, 2024) belongs to the Peak onset season. Based on the background knowledge, the Peak onset season typically spans from Week32 to Week46, directly after the Off-season and before the Peak season. Week36, 2024 fits within this timeline, occurring five weeks into the Peak onset season when ILI activity begins to climb steadily toward its peak levels.
3. Using a time-series forecasting approach, we compute the average weekly growth rate based on past data. From Week27 to Week31, the values increase as follows:
4. Week27 to Week28: (2285-1799)/1799 ≈ 27.04%.
5. Week28 to Week29: (2234-2285)/2285 ≈ -2.23%.
6. Week29 to Week30: (2362-2234)/2234 ≈ 5.72%.
7. Week30 to Week31: (2432-2362)/2362 ≈ 2.96%.
8. The average weekly growth rate across these weeks is approximately (27.04 - 2.23 + 5.72 + 2.96)/4 ≈ 8.87%. Applying this average growth rate over 5 additional weeks to the Week31 value of 2432, we project:
9. 2432 × (1 + 0.0887)^5 ≈ 3241. Thus, the predicted value for Week36, 2024 is 3241.
4. The upward trend in ILI occurrences aligns with factors highlighted in the summarized CDC reports. Three distinct factors from the reports contribute to this projection:
5. 1) Seasonal effect: Week36 belongs to the Peak onset season, a time when ILI activity typically begins to rise due to increased flu transmission. This seasonality amplifies the growth rate observed in the past weeks.
6. 2) Co-circulation of respiratory viruses: Reports from Week27 to Week31 emphasize the impact of multiple co-circulating pathogens (e.g., Influenza, SARS-CoV-2, RSV, H5N1) contributing to increased outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses, which account for 1.4%-1.5% of illnesses during these weeks. This diversity of respiratory pathogen activity reinforces ILI growth trends.
7. 3) Minimal vaccination updates and antiviral resistance: The absence of significant updates on vaccination coverage coupled with minimal antiviral resistance limits any robust intervention to prevent the natural spread of influenza. The reports confirm well-matched vaccine strains but lack evidence of significant uptake, allowing for a continued rise in strain activity.
5. In summary, the forecasted value of 3241 for Week36, 2024 is derived from the observed upward trend in past ILI occurrences, the transition to the Peak onset season, and specific CDC-reported factors (seasonal growth patterns, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and insufficient vaccination updates). These considerations justify the steady and progressive increase in ILI occurrences leading to the numerical prediction.
