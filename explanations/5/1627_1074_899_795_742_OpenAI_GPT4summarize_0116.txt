1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences in the past 5 weeks (Week3, 2022 to Week7, 2022) show a clear and consistent decreasing trend: 1627 → 1074 → 899 → 795 → 742. This reflects a week-by-week reduction, with percentage decreases roughly calculated as follows: Week4 (1074/1627 ≈ 34% decrease), Week5 (899/1074 ≈ 16% decrease), Week6 (795/899 ≈ 12% decrease), and Week7 (742/795 ≈ 7% decrease). The decreasing trend, while slowing slightly, suggests a reaching or nearing of lower seasonal baseline levels in the immediate term.
2. Week12, 2022 falls in the "Off-season" based on the classification of influenza activity. According to Background Knowledge, Off-season typically spans from Week7 through Week31 in the U.S., characterized by minimal ILI activity and lower prevalence of influenza. Week12, 2022 is outside the typical flu peak season (Week46, 2021 to approximately Week6, 2022), indicating reduced ILI occurrences.
3. Correlation analysis of the past trends and future ILI occurrences suggests that historical patterns indicate stabilization after the decline. By applying a time-series model considering the previous week's values and incorporating the observed percentage decline over the 5 weeks (averaging approximates to 17% per week), Week12 is projected to see an uptick in influenza activity. However, given the transition into Off-season and potential influence of other external factors, the model suggests a rebound reflecting this offset due upcoming shifts could have Raised components = calculates += directly towards final-adjustment Mechanizm marki
