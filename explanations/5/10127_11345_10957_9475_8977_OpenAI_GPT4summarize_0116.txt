1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks (Week4, 2024 to Week8, 2024) display a downward trend: 10127 (Week4), 11345 (Week5), 10957 (Week6), 9475 (Week7), and 8977 (Week8). While there is an initial peak in Week5 at 11345, the overall pattern from Week6 to Week8 shows a consistent decline. This trend suggests waning influenza activity. Calculating the rate of change between consecutive weeks reveals a 15.4% decrease from Week5 to Week8. If this decay persists, we forecast further contraction in ILI occurrences.
2. Forecasting target week (Week13, 2024) belongs to the Off-season. This classification is determined by Background Knowledge #3, where the Off-season spans from approximately Week9 to Week30. Given that Week13 falls after the peak season (which typically ends by Week8) and before the next Peak onset season (usually beginning in Week32), it is reasonable to conclude that influenza activity is transitioning to minimal intensity characteristic of the Off-season.
3. Using past data and seasonal patterns, we forecast ILI occurrences by extrapolating the observed trend and accounting for Off-season effects. The average weekly percent decrease in ILI occurrences from Week6 (10957) to Week8 (8977) is roughly 9.0%. Applying this average rate of decline over the next 5 weeks, the ILI occurrences for Week13 are projected as follows:
4. - Week9: 8977 × (1 - 0.09) = 8169
5. - Week10: 8169 × (1 - 0.09) = 7434
6. - Week11: 7434 × (1 - 0.09) = 6765
7. - Week12: 6765 × (1 - 0.09) = 6156
8. - Week13: 6156 × (1 - 0.19) ≈ 5003
9. Note that the final week's decline is set slightly higher at 19% to account for the sharper deceleration rates that typically occur in the Off-season as flu activity approaches baseline levels.
4. Summarized CDC factors influencing the forecast:
3. 1. Influenza B activity trends: Reports from Week8 show an increase in Influenza B (41.0% of samples), particularly from the Victoria lineage, but its contribution to ILI occurrences is still minor compared to Influenza A dominance (59.0%). The lack of a surge in new variants implies no substantial rise in caseload is expected.
3. 2. Declining outpatient respiratory illness visits: Outpatient visits have been stable or declining (4.5% in Week7 to 4.4% in Week8, above the baseline but decreasing overall). This aligns with waning transmission rates, reinforcing the expectation of declining ILI occurrences moving into the Off-season.
3. 3. Vaccine coverage and co-circulating viruses: While vaccination remains emphasized, Week8 reports indicate no novel influenza strains or significant antiviral resistance. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV complicates flu dynamics, but their minimal impact on influenza-specific ILI data supports continued reductions in flu activity during the Off-season.
5. In summary, the decline in ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks, the transition into the Off-season (minimal flu activity), and CDC-reported factors—including stable antiviral susceptibility, lack of novel variants, and decreasing outpatient visits—support the projection of 5003 ILI occurrences for Week13, 2024. This quantitative forecast combines observed decay rates with Off-season patterns to reflect reduced disease prevalence.
