1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1855', '2084', '2117', '2313', '2550']. There was a significant increase from 1855 (Week47, 2021) to 2550 (Week51, 2021), reflecting a steady escalation in ILI activity over the observed period. This increasing trend indicates growing respiratory illness activity by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A clear correlation exists between the increasing trend in the past time-series ILI occurrences (Weeks47–51, 2021) and the subsequent decrease to 1539 future occurrences after 5 weeks (Week05, 2022). The sharp rise to 2550 by Week51, 2021, followed by a decline, suggests that the earlier peak in activity likely led to a tapering period after intensive transmission.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI visibly rose from 2.4% in Week47, 2021, to 3.8% in Week51, 2021, surpassing the national baseline. This consistent growth signals an escalating burden of respiratory illnesses, which potentially peaked by the end of the 5-week period, contributing to the eventual drop in future ILI occurrences. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) rose steadily, starting from 15.5% in Week47, 2021, to 19.2% in Week51, 2021, consistently exceeding the epidemic threshold. This sustained PIC mortality suggests heightened illness severity during this period and may reflect concurrent circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens. Influenza positivity rates doubled or tripled across 5 weeks, with clinical lab specimens rising from 1.5% (Week47, 2021) to 6.2% (Week51, 2021). This rapid increase in influenza activity likely contributed to the surge in ILI cases during the observed period before stabilizing in future weeks. Multiple respiratory viruses, including non-influenza pathogens, co-circulating throughout Weeks47–51, 2021, added complexity to ILI trends. These co-infections likely surged alongside influenza, fueling elevated ILI activity during the last weeks of the past data, followed by a natural decline in later weeks.
4. Vaccination uptake showed early signs of being lower than in the previous season throughout Weeks47–51, 2021, possibly allowing higher ILI activity driven by influenza transmission prior to the observed decline in Week05, 2022.
5. The reported 1539 future ILI occurrences (Week05, 2022) resulted from the upward trajectory in the past data (Weeks47–51, 2021), marked increases in ILI outpatient visits and respiratory virus positivity, persistent PIC mortality surpassing epidemic thresholds, and compounding effects of co-circulating respiratory illnesses. The observed peak in Week51, 2021, was followed by stabilization and a decrease in ILI occurrences by Week05, 2022.
