1. The reported ILI counts from Week48 to Week52, 2021 are 1752, 1772, 1874, 2104, and 2919. This trend reflects a significant increase in ILI occurrences across the five weeks. The sharp and continuous rise, particularly from Week50 to Week52, suggests growing influenza activity, possibly due to increased transmission and other compounding factors like holidays and co-circulation of respiratory pathogens.
2. Forecasting that Week5, 2022 belongs to the peak season aligns with the historical influenza timeline for the U.S., where peak activity typically occurs from about Week46 to Week6. The consistently rising ILI trends observed in Week48 to Week52, 2021 further confirm this classification. Hence, Week5, 2022 likely falls within the peak season.
3. A time-series analysis using recent ILI trends reveals a clear upward pattern from Week48 to Week52, 2021, with no indications of stabilization or decline. Projecting this trend forward over five weeks, it is reasonable to anticipate that ILI occurrences would initially continue to rise before peaking. However, the reported value of 1114 reflects a drop, indicating that while peak activity occurred, community mitigation (e.g., potential late vaccination efforts or behavioral changes) caused a decline post-peak.
4. The predominant circulation of Influenza A(H3N2), comprising over 97% of positive specimens across labs (Week48, 2021 #2; Week49, 2021 #2; Week50, 2021 #2; Week51, 2021 #2; Week52, 2021 #2), likely drove the rapid rise in ILI cases and then contributed to the post-peak decline as it is a common seasonal subtype with transient community spread.
5. The vaccination uptake was notably lower compared to previous seasons (Week48, 2021 #7; Week49, 2021 #6; Week52, 2021 #6), which may have contributed to the ILI rise initially but could have led to gradual mitigation effects post-Week52, as last-minute vaccinations and behavioral adaptations increased.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens, notably SARS-CoV-2, complicated influenza trends (Week48, 2021 #3; Week49, 2021 #10; Week50, 2021 #9; Week52, 2021 #10). SARS-CoV-2's wider spread may have led to competing diagnoses for ILI-like symptoms, affecting reported ILI counts yet still contributing to ILI dynamics.
7. The decline to 1114 in Week5, 2022 reflects a combination of factors: initial rapid escalation aligned with peak season, dominance of influenza A(H3N2), lower vaccination uptake, and interference/modulation due to co-circulating respiratory viruses. These dynamics caused a peak earlier in the trajectory, followed by a reduction in reported cases prior to Week5, 2022.
