1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a steady upward trend, with values of ['1743', '1887', '1889', '1978', '2037']. Starting from 1743 in Week36, 2021, ILI occurrences increased consistently, reaching 2037 in Week40, 2021, marking the highest value in the period. This demonstrates a gradual escalation in ILI activity across the observed weeks.
2. A clear positive correlation exists between the increasing past ILI occurrences and the future occurrences of 2297 in Week45, 2021. The consistent rise in the past data culminated in 2037 (Week40, 2021), serving as a precursor to the further increase to 2297 after 5 weeks.
3. Nationwide outpatient visits for ILI remained steady but slightly below baseline, increasing from 2.3% (Week36) to 1.9% (Week40, 2021). This stabilization of outpatient visits for ILI reflects ongoing respiratory illness activity contributing to the rise in future occurrences.
4. Persistent PIC mortality rates, driven mainly by COVID-19, consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, with 21.0% during Week36, 2021, and 18.0% by Week40, 2021. This signals heightened respiratory disease burden likely impacting overall ILI levels.
5. Limited influenza virus circulation was reported across all weeks, with low positivity rates (e.g., 0.1% in Week36 and Week40, 2021). However, other respiratory non-influenza viruses contributed to increased ILI activity, aligning with the reported future occurrences of 2297.
6. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic influenced ILI data reporting, as acknowledged in all weeks. These disruptions likely led to uncertain reporting trends, amplifying overall case recognition, and contributed to the observed escalation in future data.
7. In summary, the reported 2297 future ILI occurrences (Week45, 2021) can be attributed to the steady increase in past occurrences (Weeks36–40, 2021), stabilization in outpatient ILI visits, persistent PIC mortality, contributions from non-influenza respiratory illnesses, and pandemic-related disruptions in surveillance systems.
