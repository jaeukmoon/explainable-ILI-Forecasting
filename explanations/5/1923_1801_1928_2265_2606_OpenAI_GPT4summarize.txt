1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a clear upward trend, beginning at 1923 (Week 31, 2022) and ending at 2606 (Week 35, 2022). After a slight dip to 1801 in Week 32, the count rose in subsequent weeks to 1928, 2265, and 2606. The steady increase in ILI activity during Weeks 33–35 underscores an accelerating trajectory heading into the future.  

2. The strong positive correlation between the upward past ILI trajectory and the reported future ILI occurrence of 8852 (Week 40, 2022) is evident. The increasing pattern during the latter weeks (Weeks 33–35, 2022), when ILI activity peaked at 2606, supports the expectation of an amplified ILI surge in the succeeding weeks.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually rose from 1.5% in Week 31 to 1.9% in Week 35, 2022, with children aged 0-4 years consistently showing the highest rates (from 6.1% to 7.2%). This broader rise in ILI-related healthcare utilization reflects heightened respiratory illness activity, contributing to the increase in future ILI occurrences.  

4. Laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations also steadily increased, with 506 reported in Week 31 and 509 in Week 35. This consistent escalation in hospitalizations reinforces the idea of a mounting burden of respiratory illness during this time, correlating strongly with the sharp rise in future ILI occurrences.  

5. The percentage of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained well above epidemic thresholds, ranging from 9.9% in Week 32 to 9.6% in Week 35. Though COVID-19 was the predominant cause, influenza’s contribution was non-negligible. Sustained PIC mortality levels align with the observed growth in respiratory illnesses culminating in the future ILI increases.

6. Long-term care facility influenza positivity, though low (0.2% of facilities), alongside unpredictable influenza transmission patterns due to simultaneous circulation with other respiratory viruses like COVID-19, likely affected ILI reporting and escalated future activity.

7. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 8852 (Week 40, 2022) is closely linked to the solid upward trend in ILI cases during Weeks 31–35, increasing outpatient visits for ILI, rising hospitalization trends, persistently high PIC mortality exceeding epidemic thresholds, and co-circulation of respiratory pathogens alongside evolving healthcare and reporting practices.
