1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating pattern with neither a distinct upward nor downward trend, with values of ['1396', '1175', '1271', '1454', '1284']. Week51, 2020 started with 1396, dropped to 1175 in Week52, 2020, then rose to 1271 in Week53, 2020, peaked at 1454 in Week1, 2021, and finally declined to 1284 in Week2, 2021. This variability reflects an inconsistent ILI dynamic over the 5 weeks.
2. A decline in future ILI occurrences (914) compared to the past 5-week average (1316) shows a mismatch in correlation between past and future data trends. The fluctuating values in the past occurrences failed to sustain their higher range, aligning with the CDC's projections of minimal influenza activity amidst suppressed transmission conditions influenced by COVID-19 (Week53, 2020 and Week2, 2021).
3. Outpatient ILI visits remained consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%, with stable to declining percentages across the weeks: 1.6% (Week51, 2020), 1.6% (Week52, 2020), 1.6% (Week53, 2020), 1.7% (Week1, 2021), and 1.4% (Week2, 2021). This persistently low ILI activity closely mirrors the decrease in future ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza positivity rates in clinical labs were remarkably low throughout the period, ranging from 0.3% (Week51, 2020) to 0.4% (Week1, 2021) and dropping again to 0.1% (Week2, 2021). Such limited virologic activity supports the suppressed future ILI occurrences despite the pandemic's potential influence.
5. Healthcare-seeking behaviors and traditional surveillance systems were significantly disrupted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as reported across all weeks. This contributed to low influenza activity detection (e.g., atypical hospitalization trends with 101 to 129 cases across Weeks51, 2020 to Week1, 2021) and likely shifted respiratory illness focus toward other conditions, correlating with the sharp drop to 914 in future occurrences.
6. The reduced future ILI occurrences (914) in Week7, 2021 reflect not only suppressed influenza transmission but also the impact of pandemic-driven shifts in health behavior and surveillance interpretation. Minimal outpatient ILI trends, near-absent influenza lab positivity, and disrupted monitoring mechanisms collectively contributed to the subdued ILI activity observed after 5 weeks.
