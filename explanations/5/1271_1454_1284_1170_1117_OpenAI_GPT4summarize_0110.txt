1. The reported ILI counts from Week53, 2020 to Week4, 2021 are 1271, 1454, 1284, 1170, and 1117. The overall trend shows a consistent decline from Week1, 2021 (1454) to Week4, 2021 (1117) after a peak in Week1, 2021, followed by no notable fluctuations. This decreasing trajectory indicates reduced ILI activity in recent weeks.
2. Forecasting target week (Week9, 2021) belongs to the off-season. In the U.S., the off-season typically starts after Week6 and extends through the late summer months. Observations of consistently low influenza positivity rates, outpatient ILI visits below baseline, and historically low hospitalization rates (Week53, 2020 #1, #4; Week1, 2021 #1, #4; Week4, 2021 #3, #4) align with off-season characteristics, indicating reduced transmission and ILI occurrences for Week9, 2021.
3. From a time-series analysis perspective, the consistent decline in ILI occurrences over five weeks (Week53, 2020 to Week4, 2021) suggests reduced viral spread due to factors like high vaccination coverage or lingering COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Based on this decreasing trend, the forecasted value of 975 ILI occurrences for Week9, 2021 aligns with a continuation of the downward pattern, reflecting adjusted expectations for minimal activity in the off-season.
4. Influenza activity remains unusually low nationwide, with positivity rates consistently at or below 0.4% over the past five weeks (Week53, 2020 #1; Week1, 2021 #1; Week4, 2021 #1). This low positivity reflects minimal transmission and limited potential for sudden surges in ILI cases.
5. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted healthcare-seeking behavior and ILI surveillance, with reduced outpatient visits and alternative care settings creating challenges in interpreting trends (Week53, 2020 #9; Week1, 2021 #9; Week4, 2021 #8). However, adjustments for these factors support the expectation of stable or declining ILI activity.
6. Minimal influenza-associated hospitalizations and pediatric deaths, alongside significantly suppressed influenza transmission (Week53, 2020 #7; Week1, 2021 #7; Week4, 2021 #4, #6), suggest that overall influenza burden remains historically low. These indicators substantiate the forecasted continued decline in Week9, 2021.
7. Based on the declining trend in ILI occurrences, the off-season designation for Week9, 2021, low influenza positivity rates, constrained healthcare-seeking patterns due to COVID-19, and historically low influenza hospitalization rates, the projected ILI value of 975 reflects sustained minimal activity, consistent with current epidemiological conditions.
