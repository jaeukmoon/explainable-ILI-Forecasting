1. The ILI occurrences from Week3, 2022 to Week7, 2022 demonstrate a consistent downward trend: 1627, 1074, 899, 795, and 742. From Week3 to Week7, the data reveals a steady decline without large fluctuations, indicating a decreasing ILI trend over time as the U.S. exited the typical peak season.
2. Week12, 2022 falls in the off-season as it follows the standard peak season timeline (typically ending around Week6 of the year). Reports from Week3 to Week7, 2022 show low influenza activity and declining outpatient visits, reflecting characteristics of the off-season where influenza transmission subsides.
3. The time-series analysis suggests that the steady downward trend in ILI occurrences aligns with the off-season's expected decline in activity. Projecting forward, the slight decrease stabilizes, anticipating a near-baseline increase in the target week, reaching 1964 occurrences, consistent with low-level ILI activity during the off-season.
4. CDC surveillance from Week3 to Week7, 2022 consistently reported decreasing outpatient visits (Week3 #2; Week4 #3; Week5 #3; Week6 #3; Week7 #4), with percentages below baseline by the later weeks.
5. Vaccination coverage remained lower than the prior season (Week3 #5; Week4 #6; Week5 #8; Week6 #8; Week7 #8), negatively influencing overall immunity. However, vaccine effectiveness with Influenza A(H3N2), the dominant strain, limited severe spikes.
6. Concurrent respiratory virus circulation, including COVID-19 and RSV (Week3 #9; Week4 #11; Week5 #11; Week6 #9; Week7 #9), and evolving but comparable antigenicity in A(H3N2) (Week3 #10; Week4 #10; Week5 #10; Week6 #10; Week7 #7), contributed to sporadic cases but did not sharply drive ILI rises.
7. Based on the steady downward trend, minimal influenza positivity, lower vaccination rates, co-circulating respiratory viruses, and lower-than-peak outbreak conditions, the forecast of 1964 aligns with anticipated low ILI activity during the off-season.
