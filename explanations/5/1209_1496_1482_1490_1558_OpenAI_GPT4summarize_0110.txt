1. The reported ILI counts from Week13 to Week17, 2021 are 1209, 1496, 1482, 1490, and 1558. The data shows a steadily increasing trend, with a slight dip in Week15 (1482) but a consistent rise in Week16 (1490) and Week17 (1558). This suggests a slow but steady increase in ILI activity over the 5-week period, indicating a potential continuation of this trend into the coming weeks.
2. Week22, 2021 falls within the off-season in the U.S., as it occurs after the typical peak season, which usually spans Week46 through Week6. Minimal influenza activity during the preceding weeks (Week13, 2021 to Week17, 2021 #1) supports this classification.
3. The time-series data indicates a general upward trend in ILI activity between Week13 and Week17, 2021. This gradual increase, while minor, suggests that ILI occurrences will likely stabilize or increase incrementally in coming weeks. Extrapolating from this pattern, a slight increase is projected by Week22, 2021, leading to an estimated value of 1504.
4. Influenza positivity remains near 0.1% nationwide (Week13, 2021 #1; Week14, 2021 #1; Week15, 2021 #1; Week16, 2021 #1; Week17, 2021 #1), with no indication of significant increases over the last five weeks. This consistently low positivity limits the likelihood of major spikes in ILI occurrences.
5. Vaccination uptake continues to be emphasized by the CDC; however, no changes in vaccination trends were observed (Week13, 2021 #7; Week15, 2021 #10; Week16, 2021 #8). As such, vaccination likely provides a stabilizing effect, helping to moderate any potential increases in ILI counts.
6. Healthcare behavior changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic have influenced ILI data trends and interpretation (Week13, 2021 #8; Week14, 2021 #6; Week16, 2021 #9). These changes, alongside persistently low influenza activity, generate uncertainty but do not signal dramatic shifts in the short term.
7. Given the steady yet mild rise in ILI occurrences (Week13 to Week17, 2021), the off-season timing (Week22, 2021), vaccination stability, and consistently low influenza positivity rates, the projected ILI occurrence is estimated at 1504. This aligns with the expectation of continued low but slightly growing ILI activity.
