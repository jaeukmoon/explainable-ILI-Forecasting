1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed an overall stable trend with minor fluctuations, ranging from '1956' (Week 15, 2021) to '1831' (Week 19, 2021). A slight decline was observed from Week 15 (1956) to Week 17 (1816), followed by marginal increases in Weeks 18 (1843) and 19 (1831). This pattern indicates consistently low ILI activity, with no significant spikes during the observed period.

2. A weak correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is notable, as the relatively stable past ILI values over Weeks 15–19, 2021, do not exhibit a marked upward trend to directly predict the future increase to 2198 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 24, 2021). However, the minor rebound in Weeks 18 and 19 may hint at a potential subtle rise aligning with the future uptick.

3. Several other factors from the CDC reports likely contributed to the future rise in ILI occurrences:
   - Outpatient visits for ILI accounted for 1.1–1.2% throughout Weeks 15–19, 2021, remaining stable but slightly below the national baseline of 2.6%. This low activity may set the stage for subsequent increases as healthcare-seeking behavior stabilizes post-pandemic shifts.
   - Persistent PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) mortality remained above the epidemic threshold, ranging from 12.4% (Week 15) to 10.1% (Week 19). Although COVID-19 was the primary driver, elevated PIC levels suggest sustained respiratory illness burden, potentially influencing subsequent increases in ILI activity.
   - COVID-19's ongoing impact on healthcare access and surveillance systems likely delayed accurate reporting of ILI cases. Altered healthcare-seeking behaviors during the pandemic may have led to under-detection of milder ILI cases, creating a lag effect that contributed to the observed rise after 5 weeks.

4. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences of 2198 (Week 24, 2021) can be attributed to the stable but slightly rising trend in the latter weeks (Weeks 18–19, 2021), stable outpatient ILI activity below the baseline, elevated PIC mortality levels driven by respiratory illnesses, and pandemic-related disruptions to data reporting and healthcare behavior. These combined factors likely contributed to a delayed but noticeable increase in ILI activity.
