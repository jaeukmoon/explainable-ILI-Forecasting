1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week29, 2024 to Week33, 2024 are 1444, 1469, 1509, 1504, and 1562, respectively. This indicates a steady upward trend, showing incremental increases with minor fluctuations observed between Week31 and Week32 (1509 to 1504) before another rise in Week33 (1562). Overall, the pattern suggests gradual growth in ILI activity over the past five weeks without abrupt spikes.
2. Based on seasonal patterns in the U.S., Week38, 2024 occurs during the peak onset season. This period is characterized by steadily increasing ILI activity as influenza starts spreading more broadly. The upward trend observed in the past weeks supports the classification of Week38, 2024 as part of this seasonal phase.
3. A correlation analysis shows that during the peak onset season, historical trends often exhibit sustained increases, as seen in the time-series data. The observed incremental growth over the last five weeks suggests that the projected ILI count of 2656 aligns with an expected continuation of this upward trajectory as influenza transitions toward heightened activity within the broader population during this phase.
4. Influenza positivity in clinical lab testing remains low but stable, with Week33 showing positivity at 0.4% (Week33, 2024 #1), slightly down from previous weeks. While co-circulating respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and RSV complicate trends, the influenza-specific activity is rising (Week32, 2024 #10; Week33, 2024 #8).
5. Novel variant detections, including two human infections with H1N1v and H1N2v linked to swine exposure, emphasize zoonotic threats (Week33, 2024 #7). While these do not exhibit human-to-human transmission, monitoring such cases is crucial for projecting increases due to potential spillover events.
6. Current influenza strains remain well-matched to vaccine formulations, and antiviral resistance levels are low (Week32, 2024 #10; Week33, 2024 #9). However, the CDC noted minimal vaccine effectiveness improvements, potentially limiting vaccination's current impact in curbing transmission (Week32, 2024 #9; Week33, 2024 #10).
7. Taken together, the gradual rise in ILI occurrences, alignment with the peak onset season, ongoing stable influenza positivity with novel variant threats, and moderate vaccine impact justify the predicted count of 2656 for Week38, 2024. These factors indicate continuous, moderate growth in ILI activity as influenza transmission increases during this transitional period.
