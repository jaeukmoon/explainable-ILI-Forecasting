1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a fluctuating trend within a narrow range, with values of ['2012', '2114', '1933', '1867', '1934']. Initially, there was an increase from 2012 (Week 19, 2021) to 2114 (Week 20, 2021), followed by a notable decline to 1933 (Week 21, 2021) and a continued drop to 1867 (Week 22, 2021). However, there was a slight rebound to 1934 in Week 23, 2021. This variation illustrates inconsistent but overall suppressed ILI activity during this period.
2. A modest positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is indicated by the small-scale fluctuations and the eventual uptick in Week 23, 2021. The rise in occurrences to 1934 by the final observed week serves as an indicator of a potential rebound or stabilization in ILI activity, aligning with the larger reported future ILI occurrences of 2663 after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently minimal and below the national baseline, ranging narrowly between 1.1% (Week 21, 2021) and 1.3% (Week 20, 2021). These low yet stable percentages suggest limited direct transmission of influenza but reflect a gradual buildup in respiratory illnesses, which may contribute to future increases in occurrences.
4. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeded epidemic thresholds each week, decreasing from 10.1% (Week 19, 2021) to 7.6% (Week 23, 2021). While the majority were related to COVID-19, the sustained high PIC mortality across weeks reflects the persistent burden of respiratory illnesses, which may be linked to the ILI uptick.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic disrupted ILI data integrity across all weeks. These disruptions likely led to underreporting or delayed recognition of cases, contributing to an eventual reported surge in future ILI occurrences.
6. Despite minimal influenza activity with positivity rates consistently around 0.1% and low hospitalization rates (0.8 per 100,000 population by Week 20, 2021), the future rise in occurrences to 2663 suggests the influence of other respiratory illnesses or altered surveillance patterns driven by the pandemic.
7. In summary, the reported 2663 future ILI occurrences (Week 28, 2021) can be attributed to the mixed but slightly upward trends in Weeks 22–23, 2021, underlying respiratory illness reflected in elevated PIC mortality, effects of healthcare-seeking changes, and non-influenza contributions to overall ILI data during this period.
