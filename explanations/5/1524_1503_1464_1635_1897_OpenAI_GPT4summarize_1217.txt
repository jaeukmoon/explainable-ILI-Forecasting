1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5-week period demonstrated a fluctuating yet notable upward trend, with values of ['1524', '1503', '1464', '1635', '1897']. After a slight decline during Weeks38–39, 2023, the ILI cases surged significantly in Weeks40–42, 2023, with a steady increase culminating at 1897 in Week42, 2023. This upward trajectory suggests growing respiratory illness activity toward the end of the 5-week period.
2. A positive correlation is observed between the past rising ILI cases in Weeks41–42, 2023, and the reported future occurrence of 3100 after 5 weeks (Week47, 2023). The sharp increase from Week41 onward appears to set the stage for the amplified ILI activity seen in the future report.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI displayed a consistent week-by-week rise, from 2.0% (Week38, 2023) to 2.5% (Week42, 2023), remaining under the baseline but indicating increasing activity. Additionally, hospitalization rates for ILI rose gradually, reflecting enhanced severity and healthcare burden.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) continued to exceed epidemic thresholds during all weeks (e.g., 7.2% in Week38 to 7.3% by Week39, 2023), signaling a heightened respiratory disease burden which supports the projected future surge in ILI activity.
5. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, especially SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, were widely reported throughout Weeks38–42, 2023, adding to the complexity of respiratory illness surveillance and likely contributing to the increased ILI case counts compared to historical norms.
6. In summary, the future occurrence of 3100 ILI cases by Week47, 2023, can be explained by the combined effect of an escalating upward trend in Week41–42 ILI cases, increasing outpatient visits and hospitalization rates, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and overlapping contributions of co-circulating respiratory viruses that amplified the burden of influenza-like illness.
