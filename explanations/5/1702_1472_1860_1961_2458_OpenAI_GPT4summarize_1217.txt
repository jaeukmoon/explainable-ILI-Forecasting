1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 observed weeks showed a clear upward trend, starting at 1702 (Week 44, 2023), decreasing to 1472 (Week 45, 2023), then sharply escalating to 1860 (Week 46, 2023), 1961 (Week 47, 2023), and peaking at 2458 (Week 48, 2023). This progression demonstrated an increasing trend in ILI cases, with the highest value recorded in the final week, signaling sustained growth in influenza-like activity.
2. A strong positive correlation between past ILI occurrences and future ILI cases is evident. The significant rise in Week 47 and Week 48, 2023, aligns with the reported surge to 3911 future ILI occurrences by Week 53, 2023. The steady escalation observed during the last two weeks of the past time-series indicates a continuation of this growth trajectory, reflected in the reported future spike.
3. Outpatient respiratory illness visits, consistently exceeding the national baseline of 2.9%, climbed steadily across the summarized reports, from 2.9% in Week 44, 2023, to 4.0% in Week 48, 2023. This aligned growth in outpatient visits indicates increased healthcare encounters for respiratory illnesses, contributing to the observed future rise in ILI activity.
4. Hospitalization rates attributed to influenza increased rapidly from 1.2 per 100,000 (Week 44, 2023) to 5.5 per 100,000 (Week 48, 2023), with the elderly (65+ years) being most affected. This upward trajectory reflects escalating severe influenza activity and supports the rise in future occurrences reported after 5 weeks.
5. The percentage of positive influenza lab specimens also rose steeply, doubling from 3.0% in Week 44, 2023, to 6.8% in Week 48, 2023. Regions with the highest positivity rates correspond to areas with increasing ILI trends, reinforcing the future surge of 3911 cases. The compounding circulation of multiple respiratory viruses like RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and Influenza further fueled these trends.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI surge to 3911 (Week 53, 2023) can be attributed to the consistent upward trend in the past time-series (culminating at 2458 in Week 48), the escalation of outpatient visits and hospitalization rates, increased influenza positivity rates, and the co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, all signaling intensified respiratory illness activity.
