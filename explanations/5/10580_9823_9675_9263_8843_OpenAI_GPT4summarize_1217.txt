1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent decline, with values of ['10580', '9823', '9675', '9263', '8843'], indicating a steady reduction in ILI cases. Starting from 10580 in Week13, 2023, the data progressively decreased to 8843 in Week17, 2023. This downward slope reflects continuously declining ILI activity over the given period.
2. The decline in past ILI occurrences aligns with the reported future decrease to 8655 cases (Week22, 2023). Although the decline in the 5-week past data suggests a correlation to the continued reduction in activity, the slower rate of decrease and the slightly higher-than-expected future value of 8655 suggest a stabilizing trend influenced by other factors.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses consistently trended below the national baseline, starting at 2.3% (Week13, 2023) and gradually decreasing to 2.0% in Week17, 2023. This steady reduction corresponds with the overall decline in ILI cases during this timeline. Additionally, while influenza positivity remained low (hovering between 0.8% and 1.0%), the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 (Week14 and Week16, 2023) likely contributed to sustaining ILI occurrences.
4. Elevated PIC mortality, consistently above epidemic thresholds, ranged from 7.9% in Week13, 2023, to 7.3% in Week17, 2023. Although driven primarily by non-flu respiratory illnesses or COVID-19 rather than influenza itself, this persistent mortality indicates sufficient residual impacts of respiratory diseases that indirectly align with reported future ILI cases.
5. Despite the declining trend in ILI metrics, stable vaccination uptake and near-complete antiviral susceptibility (Week16 and Week17, 2023) likely mitigated further reductions in cases by preventing potential surges. Additionally, changes in healthcare-seeking behavior (Week17, 2023), influenced by alternative pandemic-related care methods, may have contributed to delaying or redistributing reported ILI cases.
6. In summary, the future value of 8655 (Week22, 2023) is attributed to the downward trend observed in the past 5-week data, a steady decline in outpatient respiratory visits and lab-positive influenza rates, persistent PIC mortality driven by other respiratory illnesses, consistent vaccine coverage, and healthcare-seeking behavioral shifts affecting ILI reporting and surveillance.
