1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a declining trend, with values of ['1038' (Week 11, 2022), '973' (Week 12, 2022), '1002' (Week 13, 2022), '972' (Week 14, 2022), and '918' (Week 15, 2022)]. While there was a slight increase from 973 in Week 12, 2022, to 1002 in Week 13, 2022, the overall trend was one of consistent decline, reaching the lowest value of 918 in Week 15, 2022. This downward trajectory indicates reduced ILI activity during the observed period.

2. A negative correlation is noted between the past time-series ILI occurrences and the future ILI occurrence of 762 by Week 20, 2022. The consistent decline in ILI activity seen in the last few weeks (Weeks 14–15, 2022) aligns with the observed reduction in future occurrences. This suggests that the downward trend continued beyond the recorded past weeks, leading to the lower future ILI value.

3. Several factors from the summarized CDC reports may have contributed to this declining trend and the future ILI occurrence of 762:
   - Percent positivity of influenza in clinical labs remained relatively steady but low, ranging from 7.7% (Week 11, 2022) to 8.9% (Week 15, 2022). Although some areas saw increased activity, overall influenza positivity failed to show significant surges, limiting ILI growth.
   - Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistently below the baseline throughout the observed period, rising only incrementally from 1.8% (Week 11, 2022) to 2.1% (Week 15, 2022). The low national rates of outpatient visits indicate milder ILI activity.
   - Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses may have influenced trends. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 coinfection rates ranged from 3.5% to 5.4% in specimens over the weeks, reflecting competing contributions to respiratory illness that could confound ILI tracking and potentially mitigate influenza-related spikes.
   - Mortality due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained slightly above the epidemic threshold but declined from 9.1% (Week 11, 2022) to 7.1% (Weeks 14–15, 2022). This reduction in severe outcomes aligns with the reduction in ILI occurrences.

4. In summary, the decline to 762 future ILI occurrences (Week 20, 2022) is directly tied to the downward trend observed in past ILI data, low and stable influenza positivity rates, persistently below-baseline outpatient visits for ILI, and a decline in PIC mortality. The combined effect of these factors suggests waning ILI activity influenced by broader epidemiological patterns during this period.
