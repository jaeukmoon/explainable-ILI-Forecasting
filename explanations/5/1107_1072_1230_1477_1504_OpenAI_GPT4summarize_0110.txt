1. The reported ILI counts from Week27 to Week31, 2021 are 1107, 1072, 1230, 1477, and 1504. Over these weeks, the ILI occurrences show a gradual increase from Week28 (1072) through Week31 (1504), after an initial slight dip between Week27 (1107) and Week28 (1072). The trend reflects a steadily rising trajectory over the last four weeks, suggesting an underlying growth in respiratory illness activity, though levels remain moderate relative to higher seasonal peaks.
2. Week36, 2021 falls within the peak onset season, as this period typically begins in Week32 and leads up to the peak season around Week46. Increases in ILI visits and reports of moderate activity in some regions (Week31, 2021 #9) indicate a slow transition toward increased flu activity, consistent with this categorization.
3. The steadily rising trend in reported ILI occurrences from Week27 to Week31 supports a forecasted continuation in mild growth through Week36. A time-series model projects that the observed increase in ILI could stabilize within a moderate range, yielding a forecast of 1743 occurrences. This aligns with the prior data’s progression and the moderate rises observed over the last weeks.
4. Nationwide influenza activity remains minimal, with clinical and public health labs reporting low virus circulation (Week31, 2021 #4). This suggests that flu remains largely suppressed as of Week31, though respiratory illnesses linked to other pathogens such as COVID-19 may partially influence ILI counts (Week30, 2021 #7; Week31, 2021 #1).
5. Influenza vaccination trends were not highlighted over these weeks (Week27 to Week31, 2021), but the CDC continues to recommend vaccinations for the upcoming flu season (Week30, 2021 #9), which could contribute to mitigating a major spike in ILI.
6. Outpatient ILI visits showed an increasing trend for four consecutive weeks, from 1.3% in Week27 (Week27, 2021 #3) to 2.0% in Week31 (Week31, 2021 #2). This steady rise suggests growing care-seeking behavior for respiratory symptoms, likely impacting ILI occurrence numbers.
7. The moderate increase in ILI occurrences to 1743 by Week36, 2021 is primarily influenced by the gradual upward trend in past ILI counts, the transition into the peak onset season, and growing outpatient activity levels. Co-circulation of non-influenza pathogens and the lack of significant influenza virus circulation collectively support a moderate rise rather than a sharp escalation to peak-season levels.
