1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed fluctuations but an overall increasing trend, with values of ['1203', '1223', '1170', '1408', '1325']. There was a slight increase from 1203 (Week 45, 2021) to 1223 (Week 46, 2021), followed by a drop to 1170 (Week 47, 2021). However, a sharp rise to 1408 (Week 48, 2021) and a slight decrease to 1325 (Week 49, 2021) reveal an upward momentum towards the end of the observed period, suggesting increasing flu activity.
2. A clear correlation exists between the increasing trend in past ILI occurrences and the future value of 2895. The sharp rise during Week 48, 2021 (1408 cases), along with sustained elevated activity in Week 49 (1325 cases), foreshadows the substantial future surge after 5 weeks, reflecting seasonal influenza dynamics and ongoing activity spikes.
3. The proportion of outpatient visits for ILI rose steadily each week, from 2.1% (Week 45, 2021) to 2.7% (Week 49, 2021), crossing the national baseline in Week 48. This upward trajectory in healthcare visits strongly correlates with the sharp increase in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
4. The steadily increasing hospitalizations due to influenza, climbing from 332 (Week 45, 2021) to 1,057 (Week 49, 2021), are indicative of worsening respiratory illness conditions, further driving the future ILI rise to 2895.
5. The rise in influenza positivity rates, from 0.7% (Week 45, 2021) to 3.5% (Week 49, 2021), combined with the growing dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), signals accelerating viral transmission, further supporting the substantial surge in future ILI activity.
4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 2895 (Week 3, 2022) can be explained by the overall upward trajectory in past ILI occurrences, increasing outpatient visits for ILI exceeding the national baseline, rising influenza hospitalizations, and the consistent growth in influenza positivity rates, particularly of Influenza A(H3N2).
