1. The past ILI occurrences from Week30 to Week34, 2024, show a steady increase: 1469, 1509, 1504, 1562, and 1634, respectively. This upward trend indicates a gradual rise in ILI cases over five weeks, suggesting increasing transmission as the peak onset season progresses. No significant fluctuations are noted during this period, pointing to a consistent growth pattern.
2. Forecasting Week39, 2024, suggests it falls within the peak onset season. In the U.S., the peak onset season typically spans from Week32 or Week35 through Week46. This aligns with Week39, 2024, and the observed upward ILI trend, consistent with early seasonal intensification.
3. The time-series data reflects a moderate growth trend. The increase in ILI cases over the past five weeks suggests a sustained transmission level progressing into the peak onset season. A time-series forecasting model would project this growth forward, resulting in a predicted value of 2411 occurrences for Week39, 2024, based on this upward trajectory.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, complicates ILI trends. Past CDC reports highlight co-circulation (Week30, 2024 #6; Week31, 2024 #8; Week32, 2024 #8; Week33, 2024 #7; Week34, 2024 #11), contributing to the increased respiratory illness burden, which can drive ILI occurrences higher.
5. The slight increase in outpatient visits for ILI (Week30 to Week34, 2024: ~1.5% to 1.8%) suggests a growing community-level spread (Week34, 2024 #4). This aligns with the reported upward trajectory of ILI weekly data, supporting the forecasted growth in occurrences over the next five weeks.
6. While influenza activity remains low nationally (positivity ~0.4%-0.7%, Week30, 2024 #1; Week31, 2024 #1; Week32, 2024 #1; Week33, 2024 #1; Week34, 2024 #1), ongoing antigenic similarity between circulating strains and vaccines supports overall low influenza-specific outbreaks (Week33, 2024 #8; Week34, 2024 #8). However, weak vaccination uptake trends (Week33, 2024 #10; Week34, 2024 #11) can still allow for gradually increasing cases.
7. In summary, the steady rise in ILI counts, classification of Week39, 2024, within the peak onset season, the influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses, rising outpatient visits for ILI, and incomplete vaccination coverage collectively justify the forecast of 2411 ILI occurrences.
