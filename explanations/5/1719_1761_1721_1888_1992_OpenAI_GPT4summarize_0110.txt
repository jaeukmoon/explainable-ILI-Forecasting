1. The ILI occurrences from Week28 to Week32, 2023 were 1719, 1761, 1721, 1888, and 1992, representing a gradual increase with slight fluctuations. The most notable rise occurred from Week31 (1888) to Week32 (1992), indicating a potential upward trajectory, transitioning from stable minimal activity toward moderate levels. No significant spikes are observed, but the pattern suggests an early upward trend heading into the next phase of influenza activity.
2. Forecasting Week37, 2023 aligns with the peak onset season, as it follows the off-season (Week1 to Week31, 2023) and lies within the typical onset window (Week32 to Week46, 2023). The observed uptick in cases during Week32, 2023 supports the classification of an early peak onset period.
3. Based on past trends, the ILI occurrences showed growth from Week28 to Week32, albeit at a slow pace. Extrapolating the incremental pattern using a time-series approach, including the increasing rate from Week31 (1888) to Week32 (1992), suggests a continued rise five weeks forward. This projection, coupled with historical seasonality, supports the forecast of 3647 occurrences for Week37, 2023.
4. Co-circulating respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 remain present across jurisdictions and could contribute to an increase in respiratory illness visits (Week30, 2023 #8; Week31, 2023 #8; Week32, 2023 #8).
5. Pediatric impacts remain high, with consistent reports of elevated ILI percentages among children aged 0-4 (Week28, 2023 #4; Week30, 2023 #3; Week32, 2023 #5). The vulnerability of this group may amplify overall ILI numbers heading into the forecasted week.
6. ILI activity observed in Week32, 2023 showed moderate regional increases (Week32, 2023 #8) alongside PIC deaths exceeding the epidemic threshold for consecutive weeks (Week31, 2023 #5; Week32, 2023 #6), potentially signaling an early rise.
7. The projected ILI occurrences for Week37, 2023 (3647) align with the gradual upward trend in recent weeks, the transition into the peak onset season, and contributing factors such as co-circulating respiratory viruses, pediatric vulnerability, and rising weekly activities. These combined observations substantiate the forecasted value.
