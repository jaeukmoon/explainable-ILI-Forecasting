1. The reported ILI counts from Week33 to Week37, 2021 are 1040, 1101, 1255, 1305, and 1189. The trend shows a steady increase from Week33 (1040) to Week36 (1305), followed by a slight decrease in Week37 (1189). This pattern exhibits an initial rise, likely influenced by non-influenza respiratory viruses, and then a minor dip, reflecting seasonal fluctuations rather than sustained growth.
2. In the U.S., the period from Week32 to Week46 generally aligns with the peak onset season. Given that Week42, 2021 falls in this span and observations from the past five weeks indicate minimal influenza circulation but gradually rising ILI trends, Week42, 2021 is classified as part of the peak onset season.
3. From a time-series perspective, the observed upward trend followed by marginal decline suggests a leveling-off phase. Based on this historical pattern, the expected five-week trajectory projects further stabilization at lower levels as influenza circulation remains minimal. This leads to the forecasted value of 969 occurrences for Week42, 2021.
4. Minimal influenza virus circulation is evidenced by low positivity rates (Week33, 2021 #3; Week34, 2021 #4; Week37, 2021 #6), with ILI increases primarily driven by non-influenza respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (Week33, 2021 #3; Week36, 2021 #2).
5. COVID-19 significantly influences ILI surveillance trends and healthcare-seeking behaviors (Week33, 2021 #9; Week34, 2021 #8; Week37, 2021 #9), which complicates ILI monitoring and contributes to reduced peaks in influenza occurrences.
6. Vaccine promotion persists, but no significant shifts or surges in vaccination are noted for this period (Week34, 2021 #7; Week36, 2021 #8; Week37, 2021 #8), implying limited additional impact on ILI trends.
7. The forecasted value of 969 for Week42, 2021 aligns with the steady nature of ILI levels due to minimal influenza circulation, impacts of non-influenza respiratory viruses, and ongoing pandemic effects on healthcare behavior. The classification of Week42, 2021 as part of the peak onset season further supports this prediction.
