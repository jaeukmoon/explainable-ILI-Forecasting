1. The past time-series ILI occurrences showed a consistent decline over the 5 weeks, beginning at 12674 (Week 22, 2023) and progressively decreasing to 10638 (Week 23, 2023), 9416 (Week 24, 2023), 8606 (Week 25, 2023), and finally 8099 (Week 26, 2023). This downward trend reflects a significant reduction in ILI activity during the observed period.
2. A moderate positive correlation is evident between past and future ILI occurrences. Although the past data indicates declining activity over the 5 weeks, the slight stabilization of the decrease by Week 26, 2023, likely contributes to the observed future occurrence of 8887 (Week 31, 2023). This suggests that the decreasing trend tapered off, leading to a plateau or slight rebound in ILI activity.
3. Nationally low outpatient ILI visit percentages, decreasing from 1.9% in Week 22, 2023, to 1.4% by Week 26, 2023, correlate with the general reduction in ILI occurrences. However, the persistent presence of other co-circulating respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV (as observed across Weeks 22–26, 2023) likely contributed to maintaining a baseline level of ILI activity into the future.
4. Consistently elevated percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), surpassing epidemic thresholds (e.g., 6.2%-6.3% in Weeks 22-26, 2023), reflect sustained background respiratory illness activity, which aligns with the future occurrence of 8887.
5. Reduced influenza positivity rates in clinical and public health labs (e.g., 1.1%-1.2% in Weeks 22-26, 2023) signify minimal flu-specific contributions. However, the ongoing co-circulation of respiratory pathogens and minimal jurisdictional ILI activity likely stabilized future occurrences to prevent a sharper decline.
6. In summary, the reported 8887 future ILI occurrences (Week 31, 2023) stem from the consistent downward trend in Weeks 22–26, 2023, stabilization of the decrease by Week 26, sustained co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and persistently high PIC mortality that maintained a baseline ILI occurrence level.
