1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week16 to Week20, 2021 are 1968, 2118, 2022, 2012, and 2114. The trend demonstrates mild fluctuations with slight increases in Week17 (2118) and Week20 (2114) compared to earlier weeks. However, no significant upward or downward trajectory is observed, indicating a generally stable pattern around the 2000 range.
2. Week25, 2021 occurs after the typical peak season (Week46 to Week06) and is consistent with the off-season, characterized by minimal ILI activity. Data from Weeks16–20, 2021 indicate low influenza circulation and reduced hospitalization rates, further reinforcing this classification.
3. Historical trends indicate a stable level of ILI occurrences in the preceding weeks. Extrapolating this generally neutral trend into Week25, 2021, combined with the seasonal off-peak nature, suggests no significant change in ILI dynamics. The forecasted value of 2350 likely represents a slight increase from Week20, 2021, while maintaining overall stability.
4. The CDC reports highlight three key influencing factors: (a) Extremely low influenza positivity rates (0.1%) during Weeks16–20, 2021 (#1 across all weeks), consistent with minimal ILI activity. (b) Minimal ILI outpatient visit percentages (1.1% to 1.3%) well below the 2.6% baseline (#3 across all weeks), signaling limited spread during the off-season. (c) Continued impacts of COVID-19, which alters healthcare-seeking behavior and complicates data interpretation (#9 across all weeks), potentially leading to an underestimation of traditional influenza measures.
5. Despite stable ILI trends and low flu activity, the slight increase in Week25, 2021 to 2350 could be attributed to residual COVID-19 effects, which might alter reporting dynamics or drive non-specific ILI visits.
6. Given the relatively low influenza activity, off-season timing, and historically stable pattern of ILI counts in Weeks16–20, 2021, the projection of 2350 occurrences for Week25, 2021 aligns with mild fluctuations around the observed stability.
7. In conclusion, the future ILI occurrence forecast of 2350 is justified by a stable trend in recent weeks, off-season classification, minimal flu positivity and outpatient visits, and indirect effects from ongoing COVID-19 dynamics affecting healthcare behaviors.
