1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent downward trend, with values of ['1627', '1074', '899', '795', '742'], indicating a progressive decline in ILI activity. From 1627 (Week3, 2022) to 742 (Week7, 2022), each subsequent week reflected a steady drop, marking the lowest value in Week7. This overall decreasing trajectory suggests reduced ILI activity during this period.
2. Despite the observed decline in past ILI occurrences, the future rise to 1964 occurrences suggests a lagged rebound effect. Trends from the latter weeks of past data (Week6 and Week7, 2022) remained sporadic but hinted at slight increases in laboratory-confirmed influenza positivity (3.0% to 4.2%) and regional activity, aligning with the significant rise reported after 5 weeks (Week12, 2022).
3. The cumulative hospitalization rate increased each week, from 4.3 per 100,000 (Week3, 2022) to 4.9 per 100,000 (Week7, 2022), driven by Influenza A(H3N2). The rising trajectory in hospitalization rates, particularly among seniors (12.9 per 100,000 by Week7, 2022), aligns with the amplified ILI activity observed 5 weeks later.
4. Flu vaccination coverage remained consistently lower compared to previous seasons throughout the 5-week period, as noted in all summarized CDC reports. With reduced immunization rates across the country, susceptibility to influenza increased, contributing significantly to the sharp rise to 1964 occurrences by Week12, 2022.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, was a prevalent factor, as observed in 5.7% to 6% of flu-positive cases across Week3 to Week7, 2022. The interplay of multiple pathogens likely aggravated respiratory illness trends, driven further by antigenic differences in Influenza A(H3N2) strains. Such factors culminated in the observed increase in future ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the reported 1964 future ILI occurrences (Week12, 2022) can be attributed to a lagged rebound from declining past trends, increasing influenza positivity and hospitalization rates, persistently low vaccination coverage, and compounded effects of respiratory virus co-circulation and antigenic drift in Influenza A(H3N2).
