1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed an overall upward trend with minor fluctuations, marked by values of ['1209' (Week 46, 2020), '1464' (Week 47, 2020), '1472' (Week 48, 2020), '1695' (Week 49, 2020), and '1661' (Week 50, 2020)]. After a sharp rise from Week 46 to Week 49, a slight dip was observed in Week 50. Despite the dip, the elevated levels in the most recent weeks indicate substantially sustained ILI activity.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the sustained high ILI activity observed in Weeks 49 and 50 aligns with the reported value of 1259 after 5 weeks (Week 5, 2021). Although the slight weekly decline in Week 50 suggests stabilization, the earlier peak during Weeks 48–49 serves as a precursor to elevated occurrences in Week 5, 2021.

3. Several factors from the summarized reports likely contributed to the future ILI occurrences of 1259.  
   - Outpatient visits for ILI remained consistent at 1.6%, below the national baseline of 2.6%, during Weeks 47–50, indicating minimal but stable ILI activity. Stabilized outpatient trends could act as a sustaining factor for future cases.  
   - COVID-19, masking, and distancing measures were highlighted as key drivers of unusually low influenza circulation; however, overlaps between ILI and COVID-19 symptoms complicated case reporting and surveillance reliability. This surveillance disruption may have deferred accurate reporting of ILI cases, influencing future data.  
   - PIC mortality percentages remained well above epidemic thresholds (e.g., 14.3% in Week 49 and 13.3% in Week 50), primarily driven by COVID-19 but also reflective of overall respiratory illness activity. The persistent elevated PIC mortality may indicate lagging respiratory illness impacts contributing to ILI occurrences in Week 5, 2021.

4. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 1259 are driven by the upward trend of ILI activity, consistently elevated PIC mortality, and disruptions in surveillance that impacted data capture and interpretation. Stability in outpatient ILI visits and the influence of pandemic-driven healthcare behaviors also contributed to this outcome.
