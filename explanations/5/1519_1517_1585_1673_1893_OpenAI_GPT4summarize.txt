1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated an overall upward trend, with values of ['1519', '1517', '1585', '1673', '1893']. While the initial weeks (Week 8–9, 2021) showed stability (1519 to 1517), subsequent weeks (Week 10–12, 2021) saw consistent increases, peaking at 1893 in Week 12, 2021. This steady growth in ILI occurrences suggests a building momentum in ILI activity by the end of the 5-week observation period.  

2. A direct correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The continuous increase in ILI cases through Weeks 10–12, 2021 (from 1585 to 1893), aligns with the subsequent jump to 2118 in future data (Week 17, 2021). This pattern underscores that the upward trajectory observed in the past weeks acted as a precursor to the elevated ILI occurrences 5 weeks later.

3. The steadily low outpatient visits for ILI, measured at 0.9% from Weeks 8–12, 2021, suggest significant unmeasured respiratory illnesses within the population, potentially later captured as part of the future increase to 2118 occurrences.  
4. The sharp rise in ILI among children aged 0–4 years, noted in the summarized trends (Week 9, 2021), likely contributed to the continued growth observed in both Week 12 and Week 17, 2021.  
5. The overlap of COVID-19-related healthcare impacts throughout Weeks 8–12, 2021, contributed to more complex ILI data interpretation, possibly delaying recognition of cases that ultimately contributed to the spike by Week 17.  
6. Historic lows in hospitalization rates and overall influenza activity during Weeks 8–12, 2021, combined with pandemic-induced shifts in healthcare behaviors, likely concentrated respiratory illness cases into future week data, further explaining the rise to 2118.

7. In summary, the increase to 2118 future ILI occurrences (Week 17, 2021) can be attributed to the consistent upward trend observed in ILI cases from Week 10–12, 2021, the rise in pediatric ILI trends, disrupted data interpretation due to the pandemic, and deferred contributions of unrecognized cases or overlaps with non-specific respiratory illnesses.
