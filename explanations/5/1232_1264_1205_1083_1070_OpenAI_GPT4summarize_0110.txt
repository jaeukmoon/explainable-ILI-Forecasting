1. The reported ILI counts from Week10 to Week14, 2023, were 1362, 1453, 1529, 1419, and 1284. This represents an initial rise from Week10 (1362) to Week12 (1529), followed by a steady decline in Week13 (1419) and Week14 (1284). Overall, the trend displays fluctuations with a mild downward trajectory after a peak in Week12, indicating declining activity as it moves deeper into the off-season.
2. Week24, 2023, falls in the off-season as it is well beyond the typical peak season, which spans Week46 of one year through Week6 of the next. Additionally, the low ILI positivity rates and declining counts reported through Week10 to Week14, 2023, are consistent with off-season trends.
3. Based on the time-series data, the downward trend after Week12, 2023, indicates reducing ILI counts as the season progresses. Projecting forward, ILI occurrences for Week24, 2023, are anticipated to remain low, stabilizing near 1070 due to continued off-season activity patterns observed historically.
4. Influenza positivity rates remained very low throughout Weeks10 to 14, 2023, ranging from 0.8% to 1.0% (Week10, 2023 #1; Week11, 2023 #1; Week12, 2023 #1; Week13, 2023 #1; Week14, 2023 #1), with no surge evident during this time frame.
5. Vaccination and antiviral effectiveness remain strong as most circulating strains match well with the vaccine, and antivirals show near-universal susceptibility (Week10, 2023 #15, #16; Week11, 2023 #7; Week12, 2023 #9; Week13, 2023 #8; Week14, 2023 #10). This reduces the likelihood of ILI surges.
6. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory pathogens continues (Week10, 2023 #14; Week11, 2023 #9; Week12, 2023 #10; Week13, 2023 #10; Week14, 2023 #9), but these are not driving significant increases in ILI activity, as evidenced by stability in outpatient ILI visits.
7. Given the observed decreasing trend in ILI occurrences, the classification of Week24, 2023, as off-season, consistently low influenza positivity rates, strong vaccination and antiviral protection, and stable epidemiologic factors, the forecast of 1070 ILI occurrences aligns with expected off-season dynamics.
