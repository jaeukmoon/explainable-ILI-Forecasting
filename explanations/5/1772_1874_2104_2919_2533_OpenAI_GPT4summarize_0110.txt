1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week49, 2021 to Week1, 2022 are 1772, 1874, 2104, 2919, and 2533. This exhibits a significant increasing trend from Week49 (1772) to Week52 (2919), followed by a slight decline in Week1 (2533). Overall, this pattern demonstrates rapid growth with a minor decrease, likely corresponding to regional variations or reporting delays noted during the holidays.
2. Week6, 2022 typically aligns with the late portion of the U.S. peak season for ILI activity, which generally runs from Week46 through Week6. Based on the current elevation in ILI counts and influenza trends, Week6, 2022 is classified as part of the peak season.
3. The increasing ILI occurrences over the past five weeks, paired with modest declines by Week1, 2022, suggest a pattern of high activity with potential stabilization. Extrapolating from this trajectory using time-series forecasting, it is reasonable to anticipate a continued, yet moderated, decline five weeks forward, leading to the predicted 888 ILI occurrences by Week6, 2022.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) dominance (Week49, 2021 #2; Week50, 2021 #2; Week51, 2021 #3; Week52, 2021 #2; Week1, 2022 #3) with genetic alignment to vaccine strains but some antigenic differences (Week50, 2021 #10; Week51, 2021 #9; Week52, 2021 #7) indicates ongoing viral circulation despite vaccination efforts.
5. Lower vaccination uptake compared to previous seasons (Week49, 2021 #6; Week50, 2021 #7; Week51, 2021 #8; Week52, 2021 #6; Week1, 2022 #8) reduces herd immunity, potentially slowing the decline of influenza activity.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, alongside significant regional variability (Week49, 2021 #10; Week50, 2021 #9; Week51, 2021 #4; Week52, 2021 #10; Week1, 2022 #10), complicates infection monitoring and imposes additional strain on healthcare systems, potentially amplifying ILI reports.
7. The predicted 888 ILI occurrences for Week6, 2022 arise from the observed decline in ILI counts after a sharp peak, typical of late-peak season dynamics. Additionally, Influenza A(H3N2)'s persistence, lower vaccine uptake, and regional co-circulation of viruses contribute to sustained but gradually decreasing ILI activity, aligning with reduced weekly reports.
