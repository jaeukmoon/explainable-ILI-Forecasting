1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a clear upward trend, with values increasing from 1807 in Week24, 2021, to 2546 in Week28, 2021. After roughly stable occurrences in Weeks24 (1807), 25 (1791), and 26 (1794), there was a significant increase in Week27 (2193) and Week28 (2546). This pattern indicates a notable escalation in ILI activity during the final two weeks of this 5-week period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between the increasing trend in past ILI occurrences and the future value of 3400 after 5 weeks (Week33, 2021). The sharp rise beginning in Week27 and intensifying in Week28 suggests an ongoing upward trajectory, aligning with the future increase.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI showed a gradual rise, from a stable 1.2% (Weeks24–26, 2021) to 1.3% (Weeks27–28, 2021). Even though still below the national baseline, this gradual increase in healthcare encounters for ILI reflects a growing burden of respiratory illnesses, contributing to the rise to 3400 in future ILI occurrences.
4. Persistent pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) mortality percentages above the epidemic thresholds were reported throughout the 5 weeks, e.g., 6.2% (Week26, 2021) to 7.1% (Week28, 2021). Although most attributed to COVID-19, this sustained activity suggests broader respiratory illness patterns, correlating with the increase in future ILI cases.
5. Disruption of healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as documented in all CDC reports, likely delayed accurate case identification and contributed to an underestimation of ILI occurrences in earlier weeks. This disruption, combined with increasing ILI activity in later weeks, could have amplified the jump to 3400 occurrences by Week33, 2021.
6. Virologic surveillance consistently reported minimal influenza activity (e.g., <0.1% positivity in all weeks), suggesting that the increase in future ILI cases might stem from other circulating pathogens or pandemic-related reporting artifacts, rather than traditional influenza virus trends.
7. In summary, the reported 3400 future ILI occurrences (Week33, 2021) are driven by a sharp escalation in ILI trends during Weeks27–28, 2021, increasing outpatient ILI visits, persistent PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, pandemic-induced disruptions to healthcare behaviors, and an underlying respiratory illness burden that extends beyond traditional influenza virus activity.
