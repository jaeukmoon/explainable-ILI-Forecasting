1. The ILI occurrences from the past five weeks (Week13, 2023 to Week17, 2023) show a generally decreasing trend, with values of 1097, 958, 895, 807, and 902. The overall trend indicates a decline from Week13 to Week16, followed by a minor rebound in Week17. This suggests that ILI activity is stabilizing at lower levels, with no significant resurgence. Using a simple linear regression model to estimate the future data trend forward five weeks (assuming a continued general decrease and stabilization), the slope can be calculated to predict Week22. Calculating the average week-to-week decrease (Week13 to Week17: -139, -63, -88, +95, yielding a mean weekly change of approximately -48.75) and extending this to Week22 projects a value near 618 after five weeks.
2. Season classification for Week22, 2023: Week22 falls under the "Off-season" category as per U.S. flu patterns. This period typically follows the peak season and is characterized by decreased ILI activity. Based on historical flu calendar cycles, this period occurs before the next peak onset season (beginning Week31 through Week46) and thus aligns with the off-season when ILI activity is expected to remain at or near its baseline levels.
3. Correlation analysis between past trends and future ILI occurrences suggests that the historical pattern of decreasing ILI values will likely continue. Using a time-series model with weighting toward more recent weeks (given the higher relevance of nearer data points), the decrease in ILI activity is quantified. Applying the weekly average percentage change (-4.45%), the projection for Week22 considers the cumulative effect over five weeks: 902 × (1 - 0.0445)^5 ≈ 618.
4. Key factors from the CDC reports impacting the forecast:
5. 1. Low influenza positivity rates: For Weeks13 to Week17, 2023, influenza positivity across respiratory specimens was consistently low (ranging from 0.8% to 1.0%). This indicates minimal flu activity, aligning with a continued decline in ILI cases.
6. 2. Stable vaccination effectiveness: CDC reports state that circulating viruses remain antigenically similar to vaccine strains with near 100% antiviral susceptibility. This likely suppresses new flu cases and prevents any resurgence in transmission.
7. 3. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses: The presence of other respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, is contributing to a portion of ILI cases. However, these contributions appear stable or declining, as suggested by Week16's report of a greater-than-5% decrease in hospitalizations and Week17's unchanged outpatient ILI visits at 2.0%.
5. The predicted ILI occurrences of 618 for Week22, 2023 account for the continued trend of decreasing ILI cases (-48.75 average weekly decrease), the off-season classification when influenza activity is minimal, and supporting CDC factors that confirm overall suppressed flu activity. These quantitative and seasonal insights collectively justify the projected reduction in ILI cases.
