1. The reported ILI counts from Week32 to Week36, 2023 are 1817, 2106, 3088, 4133, and 3514. The trend initially shows a gradual increase from Week32 (1817) to Week33 (2106), followed by a rapid spike in Week34 (3088) and Week35 (4133). However, a slight decline is observed in Week36 (3514). This pattern suggests an overall upward trajectory with some week-to-week variability and indicates a trend of increasing ILI activity in this time frame.
2. According to U.S. influenza seasonality, Week41, 2023 typically falls into the peak onset season, spanning from approximately Week32 to Week46 of the year. The increasing ILI cases, combined with the expected ramp-up of flu activity in this transitional phase toward peak levels, suggest that Week41, 2023 aligns with the peak onset season.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the strong growth observed from Week32 to Week35, 2023 hints at a continued upward trajectory despite the slight dip in Week36. Extrapolating this trend forward by five weeks (to Week41, 2023), the anticipated ILI occurrences point to a moderate increase, leading to a forecast of 3964 cases. This projection assumes stable external factors with no dramatic shifts in viral activity, vaccination coverage, or healthcare-seeking behavior.
4. The CDC reports indicate low but steadily increasing influenza positivity rates, from 0.8% in Week32 (#1) to 0.7% in Week36 (#1), with Influenza A consistently dominating. The rising positivity rates alongside the increasing ILI occurrences support the hypothesis of escalating influenza activity approaching its seasonal peak onset.
5. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 continues to contribute to ILI cases (Week33 #10, Week36 #9), creating an additive effect on influenza activity. The ongoing presence of these viruses impacts ILI counts, making it reasonable to predict higher case numbers in forthcoming weeks.
6. Pediatric populations consistently exhibit significantly higher ILI visit rates compared to other age groups (Week32 #5, Week34 #5, Week36 #4), with the national percentages rising from 1.3% (Week32 #5) to 2.0% (Week36 #4). This indicates increasing community spread, as children are key drivers of transmission during the onset phase.
7. The combination of an overall increasing trend in ILI occurrences, persistent co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, and the seasonality of influenza activity as it advances through the peak onset phase strongly supports the prediction of 3964 ILI occurrences in Week41, 2023.
