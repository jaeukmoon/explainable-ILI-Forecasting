1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week37 to Week41, 2021, are 1189, 1064, 975, 1124, and 1063, respectively. The trend initially decreased from Week37 (1189) to Week39 (975), followed by a slight increase in Week40 (1124) and a minor dip in Week41 (1063). Overall, the pattern indicates a fluctuating trend with no sustained rise or decline, suggesting stable but varying activity levels within this period.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically starts around Week46. As Week41, 2021 data indicates continued low influenza circulation (Week41, 2021 #1, #4), the target week (Week46, 2021) aligns with the beginning of the peak season. Thus, Week46, 2021, marks the transition into the peak season period.
3. Time-series analysis shows fluctuating ILI counts within a narrow range, suggesting a stable baseline. Projecting forward, the increase in ILI occurrences observed in Week40 (1124) and the stable trajectory in Week41 (1063) hint at potential gradual growth by Week46, 2021. Accounting for this incremental rise, the projected occurrence of 1240 reflects a modest amplification of the recent trend without major perturbations.
4. Low influenza virus circulation continues across laboratory reports, with positivity rates below 0.1%-0.2% (Week40, 2021 #1; Week41, 2021 #1). Despite this low level, reports of Influenza A(H3N2) in public health labs (Week40, 2021 #3; Week41, 2021 #3) suggest potential seasonal upticks.
5. Vaccination recommendations stress achieving high coverage by the end of October (Week40, 2021 #8; Week41, 2021 #8). While no current updates on progress are available, vaccination trends generally contribute to limiting severe outcomes during peak season and support steady ILI levels.
6. Minimal flu-related deaths and hospitalization trends (Week39, 2021 #4; Week40, 2021 #5-#6; Week41, 2021 #5-#6) are consistent with ongoing low ILI activity. However, higher PIC deaths primarily due to COVID-19 (Week40, 2021 #6; Week41, 2021 #5) may interact with healthcare dynamics, contributing to some ILI fluctuations but not significant increases.
7. Considering the stable yet fluctuating trend in ILI counts, the upcoming peak season timing (Week46, 2021), low influenza positivity with potential H3N2 contributions, and vaccination efforts, the projection of 1240 ILI occurrences reflects a moderate increase driven by gradual seasonal transition and continued respiratory illness patterns.
