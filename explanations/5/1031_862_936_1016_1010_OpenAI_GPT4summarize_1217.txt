1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a fluctuating but slightly upward trend toward stabilization, with values of ['1031', '862', '936', '1016', '1010']. While there was a significant drop from 1031 in Week8, 2021, to 862 in Week9, 2021, subsequent weeks showed a moderate recovery to 936 (Week10, 2021) and then increased to 1016 (Week11, 2021), stabilizing around 1010 by Week12, 2021. This pattern suggests gradual stabilization following earlier fluctuations in ILI activity.
2. The correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident through the stabilizing pattern observed in the latter weeks of the past data (Weeks 11–12, 2021), which serves as a foundation for the sharp increase to 1759 reported in Week17, 2021. The steady activity in Weeks11–12 aligns with the potential for amplified ILI occurrences after 5 weeks, likely driven by delayed recognition or other contributing factors.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained steady but very low over the observed weeks, at 0.8–0.9% across Weeks8–12, 2021, consistently below the 2.6% national baseline. This minimal activity aligns with reported low typical influenza levels but still reflects the potential for delayed or gradual growth contributing to the future rise.
4. Pediatric ILI activity trends were noted to increase slightly among children aged 0–4 years across Weeks9–12, 2021. This population's increasing contribution, though minimal, may have influenced the escalation to 1759 occurrences.
5. Although influenza positivity rates remained extremely low (e.g., 0.1% in Weeks8–12, 2021), changes in surveillance interpretation due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have misrepresented non-specific ILI occurrences. Behavioral changes in healthcare seeking, overlapping symptoms, and COVID-19 influences potentially amplified the future ILI figures.
6. The sharp rise to 1759 in Week17, 2021, can be attributed to stabilizing trends in ILI occurrences by Weeks11–12, 2021, underlying increases in pediatric ILI activity, changes in healthcare-seeking behavior impacting ILI reports, and COVID-19-related disruptions in surveillance systems. Consolidation of contributing factors explains the observed future increase.
