1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks (Weeks 36–40, 2021) showed a fluctuation with minimal but observable growth overall: ['1687', '1639', '1540', '1679', '1721']. The ILI occurrences initially declined from 1687 (Week 36, 2021) to 1540 (Week 38, 2021) but rose consistently in the final weeks, reaching 1721 in Week 40, 2021—the highest in this 5-week period. This trend highlights a resurgence in ILI activity during the latter weeks.  

2. A positive correlation between the past 5-week trajectory and future ILI occurrences (Week 45, 2021) is observed, as the increasing pattern at the end of the past period (Weeks 39–40, 2021) aligns with the reported future surge to 2109. The sustained increase in Weeks 39–40 suggests a continuation of this trend into Week 45, leading to the higher projected figure.  

3. In the summarized reports, non-influenza respiratory viruses were consistently attributed as significant contributors to ILI visits, with notable low influenza virus circulation. The increases in ILI activity (1.9% outpatient visits by Week 40, 2021) signal that other respiratory pathogens sustained and amplified the respiratory burden, reflected in the rise to 2109 occurrences in Week 45, 2021.  
4. Death percentages attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained exceedingly high, with rates like 18.0% (Week 40, 2021) far above the epidemic threshold, primarily driven by COVID-19. This persistent respiratory mortality likely mirrors heightened ILI-related healthcare-seeking behaviors during the reporting periods.  
5. The CDC observed healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic consistently across all weeks, disrupting ILI surveillance and inflating non-specific respiratory illness reporting. These distortions in data interpretation imply a delayed recognition of true ILI activity, contributing to the notable increase in Week 45, 2021.  

6. In summary, the 2109 future ILI occurrences (Week 45, 2021) are explained by the upward trajectory in Weeks 39–40, 2021, persistent impacts of non-influenza respiratory viruses on rising ILI activity, elevated PIC mortality driven by respiratory illnesses, and the compounding effects of pandemic-induced changes in healthcare-seeking and surveillance systems.
