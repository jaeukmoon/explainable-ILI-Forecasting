1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed fluctuations but an overall downward trend, with values of ['12757', '13026', '13095', '12870', '12523']. There was a minor peak at 13095 in Week 18, 2023, followed by subsequent decreases, reaching the lowest value of 12523 in Week 20, 2023. This decline indicates a reduction in ILI activities by the end of the 5-week period.
2. A negative correlation is evident, as the downward trend observed in the past ILI occurrences does not align with the future occurrences of 8606 in Week 25, 2023. The declining trend may suggest stabilization or lower respiratory illness activity; however, the future ILI occurrences represent a substantial drop, reflecting a sharper decline than anticipated by the past data.
3. ILI outpatient visits remained stable and below the national baseline across Weeks 16–20, 2023, ranging from 1.9% to 2.0%, indicating low healthcare-seeking behaviors for respiratory illnesses, likely contributing to the reduced future ILI counts. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently declined (7.5% in Week 16 to 6.5% in Week 20, 2023), showing reduced overall respiratory-related mortality and aligning with decreased ILI trends. The continued co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory pathogens, as reported weekly, may lead to misclassification or subdued reporting of influenza-related ILI, further lowering future ILI occurrences. Additionally, stable rates of influenza virus positivity in specimens (ranging from 0.8% in Week 16 to 1.1% in Week 20, 2023) signify limited influenza-specific activity during this period, which correlates with the reduced future ILI count as influenza plays a significant role in driving ILI patterns.
4. Despite respiratory illnesses remaining low in recent weeks per CDC reports, the confluence of low ILI positivity, subdued outpatient visits for ILI, and declining PIC mortality collectively reflects a downward trajectory in respiratory illness burdens, likely explaining the sharp decline to 8606 ILI occurrences by Week 25, 2023.
