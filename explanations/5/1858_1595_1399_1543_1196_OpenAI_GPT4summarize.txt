1. The past time-series ILI occurrences (Weeks 22–26, 2022) showed a clear downward trend: 1858 (Week 22) to 1196 (Week 26). There was a steady decline each week, with Week 23 recording 1595, Week 24 noting 1399, and Week 25 at 1543 before reaching the lowest level in Week 26. This continuous downward trajectory highlights decreasing influenza-like illness activity over the observed weeks.

2. A negative correlation between past ILI occurrences in Weeks 22–26, 2022, and future ILI occurrences (719, Week 31, 2022) is evident. The steady decline in ILI activity during Weeks 22–26 aligns with the significantly reduced occurrences reported after 5 weeks. The decreasing trend in past weeks acts as a precursor to the low levels of ILI activity observed in Week 31, 2022.

3. Influenza positivity rates and outpatient ILI visits declined steadily through Weeks 22–26. For example, influenza positivity decreased from 5.9% (Week 22) to 1.4% (Week 26), and outpatient visits for ILI fell from 2.3% to 1.7% over the same period. This widespread reduction in influenza and respiratory illness activity likely contributed to the low future ILI occurrences of 719 in Week 31.  
   Similarly, reduced hospitalization rates were observed, dropping from 2,089 new cases (Week 23) to 964 (Week 26), while minimal flu activity was reported in most regions by Week 26, signaling a tapering season.  
   Additionally, post-COVID-19 pandemic healthcare-seeking behaviors, as mentioned consistently across Weeks 25–26, influenced surveillance trends, possibly suppressing ILI reporting and amplifying the recorded decline in cases over time.

4. In summary, the reported 719 occurrences in Week 31, 2022, can be attributed to the consistent downward trend in past ILI occurrences, marked reductions in influenza positivity rates and outpatient respiratory illness visits, declining hospitalization rates, and behavioral changes affecting healthcare-seeking and surveillance systems noted in Weeks 22–26, 2022. These factors collectively explain the decreased ILI activity observed after 5 weeks.
