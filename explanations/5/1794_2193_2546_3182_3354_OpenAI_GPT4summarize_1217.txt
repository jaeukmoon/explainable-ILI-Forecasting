1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrate a clear upward trend, with values of ['1794', '2193', '2546', '3182', '3354']. Beginning at 1794 in Week 26, 2021, there was an increase each week, culminating in 3354 by Week 30, 2021. This consistent escalation in ILI activity suggests increasing respiratory illness prevalence by the end of the observed period.
2. A strong positive correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences. The continuous rise in ILI activity from Week 26–30, 2021, particularly the steep trajectory observed between Week 28 and Week 30, aligns with the progression to 3452 future occurrences after 5 weeks, indicating that this upward momentum carried forward.
3. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) showed sustained incremental growth over time, increasing from 1.2% (Week 26, 2021) to 1.9% (Week 30, 2021). This rising healthcare-seeking behavior reflects broader transmission of respiratory illnesses and likely contributed to the continued rise in future ILI occurrences.
4. The percentage of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded the epidemic threshold, increasing from 6.2% in Week 26, 2021, to 9.0% in Week 30, 2021. This trend indicates heightened respiratory-related mortality, which aligns with and potentially signals rising respiratory illness activity contributing to future ILI increases.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, as detailed throughout the CDC reports, disrupted traditional reporting and likely delayed cases. This disruption in capturing real-time ILI data may have concentrated reported cases later, driving the notable rise to 3452 occurrences in the future period.
6. Minimal virologic influenza activity was reported consistently, with positivity rates near zero and negligible influenza detection. However, the steady rise in ILI cases suggests contributions from non-specific respiratory illnesses or disruptions caused by ongoing COVID-19 dynamics. These factors likely compounded and influenced the future rise in ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 3452 future ILI occurrences can be attributed to the upward trajectory throughout Weeks 26–30, 2021, driven by increasing outpatient visits for ILI, consistently elevated PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, healthcare-seeking behavior disruptions, and amplification of non-specific respiratory trends due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
