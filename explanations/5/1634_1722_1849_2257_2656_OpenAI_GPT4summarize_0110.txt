1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week34 to Week38, 2024, are 1634, 1722, 1849, 2257, and 2656. The trend demonstrates a steady increase in ILI activity over the five weeks, with a notably sharper rise beginning in Week36 (2257) to Week38 (2656). This consistent upward trajectory suggests an ongoing escalation in ILI activity.
2. Forecasting target Week43, 2024, aligns with the peak onset season. Historical patterns in the U.S. show that the period from Week32 to Week46 typically corresponds to an early increase in ILI activity before it reaches the peak season window. The recent sharp upward trend (Week36-Week38, 2024) strongly supports this seasonal classification.
3. From a time-series forecasting perspective, the continuous growth in ILI observations over the past five weeks creates a momentum effect likely to carry forward into Week43, 2024. Projecting from this consistent growth trajectory, the target ILI count of 3269 reflects an extrapolated continuation of rising seasonal activity, consistent with prior escalation patterns observed during peak onset seasons.
4. Nationally, co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, persists, as reported from Week34 to Week38, 2024 (e.g., Week34 #11; Week36 #10; Week38 #10). This multi-virus dynamic contributes to increasing respiratory illness visits and subsequent ILI occurrences.
5. Positive antigenic matching between vaccine strains and circulating viruses was reported (>95% compatibility in Week38, 2024, #8), but with no significant improvement in vaccination coverage indicated (Week34 #10; Week35 #7; Week36 #9; Week38 #9). The underreported uptake limits protective benefits for broader population immunity.
6. Outpatient visits for ILI remain below the baseline (Week34 #4; Week36 #4; Week38 #4), but the steady rise in ILI occurrences and slight increases in younger age groups (Week34 #4; Week37 #3; Week38 #10) suggest increasing transmission potential and the onset of higher activity trends.
7. The steady upward trend in ILI occurrences (1634 to 2656) alongside co-circulating respiratory viruses, limited vaccination impact, and peak onset season classification collectively forecast 3269 ILI occurrences in Week43, 2024. This value reflects the projected continuation of rising ILI activity aligned with observed seasonal and epidemiological patterns.
