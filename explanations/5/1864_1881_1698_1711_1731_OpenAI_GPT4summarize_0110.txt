1. The ILI occurrences from Week18 to Week22, 2024 were 1864, 1881, 1698, 1711, and 1731, showing an initial slight increase from Week18 to Week19 but then a dip to Week20 (1698), followed by a small rebound through Week22 (1731). This indicates a general decline with mild fluctuations over the 5-week period. The absence of sharp spikes suggests relatively stable activity at low levels.
2. Forecasting target week (Week27, 2024) belongs to the off-season. Based on the U.S. seasonality cycle, Week27 falls well within the off-season, which generally spans from Week9 to Week30 each year. Additionally, consistently low national influenza activity and the below-baseline rates observed in recent weeks further validate this classification.
3. Time-series analysis of past trends indicates that ILI occurrences are tapering with minor fluctuations. The declining trajectory observed from Week18 to Week22, 2024 suggests continued low ILI levels moving into the next weeks. Projecting this forward aligns with the stable off-season pattern, with the prediction of 1015 occurrences in Week27, 2024 consistent with seasonal norms for reduced influenza activity.
4. National influenza activity is low, with positivity rates declining gradually from 3.1% in Week18, 2024 to 1.8% in Week22, 2024, signaling decreasing community transmission and minimal infection pressure.
5. Vaccination effectiveness remains robust, as genetic characterization shows circulating influenza viruses match the seasonal vaccine (Week21, 2024 #10; Week22, 2024 #13). This limits influenza spread during the off-season and further contributes to the low projected ILI levels in Week27, 2024.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV persist but do not indicate significant spikes in overall respiratory illness trends (Week18, 2024 #10; Week20, 2024 #12; Week22, 2024 #10). The lack of novel influenza virus outbreaks supports stable ILI activity.
7. Combining the observed decline in ILI counts, off-season timing, reduced influenza transmission indicators, vaccine coverage effectiveness, and stable respiratory illness trends, the forecast of 1015 ILI occurrences in Week27, 2024 is grounded in a consistent pattern of low activity amidst effective epidemiological measures.
