1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week43 to Week47, 2021 were 1802, 2296, 2297, 2658, and 2589. This sequence indicates an overall upward trend from Week43 (1802) to Week46 (2658), with a minor dip in Week47 (2589). The trend signifies a pattern of increasing influenza-like illness activity with slight fluctuation but no clear stabilization or peak yet.
2. Forecasting places Week52, 2021 in the peak season. Typically, peak season spans Week46 to Week6 of the next year, aligning with the period of highest ILI activity. The increasing influenza positivity in laboratory detections, outpatient visits, and wider transmission during Week46 and Week47, 2021 supports this classification as peak season.
3. The time-series trend analysis shows an initial rise from Week43 to Week46, consistent with transitioning into peak season. By Week47, the slight decrease (2589) does not offset the general upward momentum. Extrapolating five weeks ahead (to Week52, 2021), a continuation of ILI growth is expected given seasonal patterns and trends during similar phases in previous years, projecting an occurrence of 6147.
4. The novel dominance of Influenza A(H3N2), representing over 90% of influenza detections, signifies a higher transmissibility rate than other influenza subtypes and concentrates within high-contact age groups such as 5-24 years (Week 46, 2021 #3, #10; Week47, 2021 #4).
5. Vaccination coverage reached 166.9 million doses as of Week47, 2021 (Week47, 2021 #9), but trends indicate potential under-utilization in high-contact populations (e.g., younger age groups). This incomplete protection may contribute to sustained increases in ILI activity.
6. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and others, complicate surveillance and reinforce elevated outpatient visit rates for respiratory illnesses. Changes in healthcare-seeking behavior continue to influence ILI tracking (Week44, 2021 #10-13; Week47, 2021 #12).
7. In summary, the steady upward trend in ILI occurrences, alignment with the peak season timeline, dominance of Influenza A(H3N2) in a vulnerable age group, incomplete vaccine utilization, and co-circulation of respiratory illnesses all contribute to the expected forecast of 6147 occurrences for Week52, 2021.
