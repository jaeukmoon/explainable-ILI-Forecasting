1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5-week period indicate a clear upward trend, with weekly values of ['11057', '14311', '17202', '18422', '19975']. This steady rise suggests escalating ILI activity, peaking at 19975 in Week 32, 2021, the highest in the observed timeframe. The consistent week-to-week increases reflect intensifying respiratory illness activity.

2. A positive correlation can be observed between the past and future ILI occurrences. The continual rise in the latter weeks (Weeks 31 and 32, 2021) supports the reported future ILI occurrence of 12979 in Week 37, 2021. Though there is a downward fluctuation after Week 32, the elevated past ILI levels likely contributed to maintaining considerable activity in subsequent weeks.

3. The consistent increase in outpatient visits for ILI, from 1.3% (Week 28, 2021) to 2.1% (Week 32, 2021), highlights the broadening impact of respiratory illnesses, driven by pathogens other than influenza. This rise, coupled with increased ILI activity in younger and working-age populations (Week 29–32, 2021), correlates strongly with the elevated future occurrences.

4. High percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) during this period, escalating from 7.1% (Week 28, 2021) to 14.6% (Week 32, 2021), reflect significant respiratory illness burdens. While COVID-19 is the major contributor, this persistent PIC mortality trend suggests a broader increase in respiratory illness activity, aligning with the future ILI elevation.

5. Disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported consistently across Weeks 28–32, 2021, impacted ILI surveillance. These disruptions, along with alternative care-seeking patterns, may have delayed accurate recognition, resulting in a surge in future-reported occurrences.

6. Despite minimal influenza positivity and no substantial virologic trends (e.g., Week 32, 2021), increases in respiratory illness transmission were observed, attributed to other respiratory viruses and non-specific ILI drivers like pandemic dynamics. These factors likely exaggerated the apparent rise in future occurrences.

7. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 12979 (Week 37, 2021) can be attributed to the upward trend in Weeks 28–32, 2021, rising outpatient ILI visits, increased PIC mortality beyond epidemic thresholds, disrupted surveillance from pandemic-related healthcare changes, and the influence of other respiratory pathogens outside influenza.
