1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a declining trend initially, with values dropping from 16276 (Week36, 2021) to 11116 (Week39, 2021). However, a slight rebound to 11730 in Week40, 2021, signals a potential recovery in ILI activity, indicating an overall fluctuating yet modest resurgence toward the end of the observed period.
2. A positive correlation is observed between past and future ILI occurrences, as the slight recovery in ILI activity in Week40, 2021 (11730) resonates with the reported rise to 15312 after 5 weeks in Week45, 2021. The declining trend in earlier weeks aligns with the subdued levels of ILI activity nationally, while the rebound acts as a precursor to the amplified future number.
3. Weekly percentages of outpatient visits due to ILI hovered below the national baseline but displayed consistent values of 1.9% (Weeks38-40, 2021). This stability, coupled with regional influences and subtle increases in non-influenza respiratory illness activity, indicates sufficient momentum to contribute to higher future occurrences.
4. High percentages of deaths associated with pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC), sustaining elevated levels between 18.0%–21.1% across all weeks, suggest significant respiratory illness activity despite minimal influenza circulation. This suggests overlapping burdens of respiratory infections, likely influencing future ILI trends.
5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors due to COVID-19, as consistently reported across Weeks36-40, 2021, caused challenges in accurate surveillance. These disruptions may have delayed recognition, condensed data reporting, or contributed to an accumulation effect seen in the future sharp rise to 15312.
6. In summary, the reported future ILI occurrences (15312 in Week45, 2021) can be attributed to the modest resurgence in Week40 (11730), consistent outpatient ILI visit percentages, elevated PIC mortality throughout the 5 weeks, and pandemic-driven disruptions to data surveillance systems. The interplay of these factors aligns with the reported increase after 5 weeks.
