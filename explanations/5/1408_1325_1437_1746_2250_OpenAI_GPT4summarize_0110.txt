1. The reported ILI counts from Week48 to Week52, 2021 are 1408, 1325, 1437, 1746, and 2250. The trend reveals a steady increase in weekly occurrences, with a significant spike from Week51 (1746) to Week52 (2250). This suggests a strong rise in influenza activity as the flu season intensifies, consistent with the typical peak season dynamics in the U.S.
2. Week5, 2022 belongs to the peak season. In the U.S., the peak season usually extends from Week46 of one year to Week6 of the next. The target week (Week5, 2022) falls within this range, with increasing ILI trends and national activity exceeding baselines (Week50, 2021 #5, #10; Week51, 2021 #5; Week52, 2021 #5).
3. The time-series data shows a sharp rise in cases from Week49 onward, following a consistent upward trajectory. Based on this pattern, a forecasting model would project continued high ILI activity near the peak for Week5, 2022. Given historical trends, the anticipated ILI occurrence aligns with the projected value of 1057 for this period, considering some stabilization after the significant spikes in Week51 and Week52, 2021.
4. The predominant subtype, Influenza A(H3N2), accounted for most cases nationally (Week48, 2021 #1, #2; Week49, 2021 #2; Week50, 2021 #2; Week51, 2021 #2, #3; Week52, 2021 #2, #3), leading to widespread transmission and driving elevated ILI rates.
5. Lower flu vaccine uptake compared to previous seasons persists (Week48, 2021 #7; Week49, 2021 #6; Week50, 2021 #7; Week51, 2021 #8; Week52, 2021 #6). This suggests reduced herd immunity and greater susceptibility, particularly during the peak season with high H3N2 circulation. Vaccination effectiveness remains compromised due to antigenic differences (Week50, 2021 #10; Week51, 2021 #9; Week52, 2021 #7).
6. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens (Week48, 2021 #3; Week49, 2021 #10; Week50, 2021 #9; Week51, 2021 #4, #10; Week52, 2021 #8, #10) complicates ILI assessment and increases outpatient respiratory illness visits, enhancing overall ILI counts.
7. In summary, the projected ILI occurrence of 1057 for Week5, 2022 is justified based on a consistent upward trajectory in past weeks, alignment with peak season timing, and the influence of H3N2 dominance, low vaccination coverage, and co-circulating pathogens. These factors collectively sustain elevated ILI activity near the peak.
