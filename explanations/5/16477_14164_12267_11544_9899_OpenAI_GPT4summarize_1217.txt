1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a declining trend, with values of ['16477', '14164', '12267', '11544', '9899']. Week10, 2024 marked the highest value of 16477; however, each subsequent week experienced a steady decline, culminating in 9899 during Week14, 2024. This consistent reduction suggests a waning influenza activity during this period.
2. A strong negative correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as evidenced by the declining trend in past ILI data from Week10 to Week14, 2024, followed by a steep reduction to 4658 after 5 weeks by Week19, 2024. This continuation of the downward trajectory indicates a progressive resolution of influenza-like illness activity mirrored in the future occurrences.
3. Decreasing ILI outpatient visit percentages, from 3.7% in Week10, 2024, to 2.8% in Week14, 2024, signal relief in healthcare burden, foreshadowing the substantial drop reflected by 4658 future ILI occurrences in Week19, 2024. Flu positivity rates in clinical respiratory specimens also diminished, from 15.4% in Week10 to 7.7% in Week14, 2024, indicating subsiding transmission. Cumulative hospitalization rates peaked early and subsequently reduced, with consistent declines in weekly hospital admissions leading to lower healthcare demand by Week14, 2024.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, contributed to broader respiratory burden but did not manifest as substantial or prolonged influenza surges, minimizing their role and enabling the observed decline in ILI. Vaccination efforts emphasized by the CDC across all reports remained productive, with the vaccine matching circulating strains, concurrently reducing future ILI burdens. Lastly, regional variances in viral spread noted across Weeks10–14, 2024 exhibited an overall decreasing trend nationally, setting the stage for lower ILI activity by Week19.
5. The reported decline to 4658 future ILI occurrences by Week19, 2024, is primarily attributed to the clear downward trajectory in Weeks10–14, 2024, including diminishing ILI outpatient visits, declining hospitalization rates, falling flu positivity percentages, the efficacy of vaccinations, and the weakening co-circulation of respiratory viruses. This convergence of factors reflects the rapid alleviation of influenza-like illness during this period.
