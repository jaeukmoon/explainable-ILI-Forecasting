1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a consistent decrease followed by a slight uptick, with values of ['1268', '1015', '1025', '874', '930']. There was a significant decline from 1268 (Week26, 2024) to 874 (Week29, 2024), indicating reduced ILI activity in this period. However, the slight rise to 930 in Week30, 2024, suggests a marginal rebound in respiratory illness activity, though it remained low overall.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the declining trend during Weeks26–29, 2024, contributed to an overall reduction leading to the 797 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week35, 2024). The slight uptick in Week30 is insufficient to offset the general decrease.
3. Weekly outpatient visits for respiratory illness remained consistently below the national baseline, fluctuating between 1.4% (Week26 to Week29, 2024) and 1.5% (Week30, 2024). This trend signifies low ILI activity contributing to the observed lower future occurrences. Hospitalization rates were consistently minimal at 0.1 per 100,000 across all weeks, with no regions reporting moderate or high influenza activity, further affirming the subdued ILI impact. Novel avian influenza A(H5N1) cases persisted in isolated clusters (e.g., Colorado), but these likely did not significantly affect overall ILI numbers.
4. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza, COVID-19, and RSV, posed a continual risk; however, influenza positivity rates remained low (ranging from 0.7% to 1.0% across Weeks26–30, 2024). The low influenza activity and stable antiviral resistance trends suggest minimal additional respiratory burden impacting future ILI occurrences.
5. In summary, the reported 797 future ILI occurrences (Week35, 2024) can be attributed to the overall decreasing trend in past ILI data through Week29, consistently low outpatient respiratory illness visits, minimal hospitalization rates, and low influenza positivity during Weeks26–30, 2024. Although co-circulating viruses posed potential threats, their limited impact, combined with low influenza activity, underpins the observed subdued future occurrences.
