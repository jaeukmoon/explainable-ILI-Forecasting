1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week14 to Week18, 2022 show a consistent upward trend: 10778, 12532, 13484, 14343, and 15796. This pattern indicates a steady increase in ILI activity, with no significant fluctuations or dips observed, reflecting growing transmission and ILI-related illnesses.
2. Based on the timeline and data, Week23, 2022 falls within the off-season. Though Week19 can represent an atypical peak, the data leading up to Week18 indicates rising but not peak-level flu activity, and Week23 aligns with a period typically characterized by diminishing influenza activity in regions outside the primary epidemic season.
3. The time-series trend indicates a steady growth in ILI cases over the prior five weeks, with an average weekly increase of approximately 1254 cases. Applying this consistent growth trajectory forward by five weeks aligns with an expectation of approximately 19923 cases, considering the sustained upward momentum and likely slowing dynamics around the off-season.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) dominated throughout Weeks14-18, 2022 (e.g., detected in 99.9%-100% of subtyped cases), contributing to widespread increases in laboratory positivity rates and respiratory illness visits. This dominance underpins the ongoing upward trend in ILI occurrences.
5. The cumulative hospitalization rate rose significantly from 8.9 per 100,000 in Week14 to 13.4 per 100,000 in Week18, along with weekly hospital admissions increasing or remaining high. Such trends reflect heightened severity and community spread reinforcing elevated future ILI occurrences.
6. Co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses (e.g., Week17, 2022 #9; Week18, 2022 #7) adds complexity by increasing respiratory illness visits and potentially exacerbating ILI-linked counts. However, their influence doesn't significantly reduce flu activity.
7. Despite ongoing vaccination efforts, antigenic mismatches in A(H3N2) strains may have reduced vaccine effectiveness (e.g., Week14, 2022 #2, #10; Week15, 2022 #10; Week17, 2022 #8), contributing to a higher spread of Influenza A and rising ILI over time.
8. In summary, the forecasted ILI count of 19923 for Week23, 2022 is driven by the observed consistent rise in ILI activity from Week14-18, the dominant spread of A(H3N2), limited vaccine effectiveness, increased hospitalization rates, and co-circulatory factors, all of which sustain elevated occurrences despite transitioning into the off-season.
