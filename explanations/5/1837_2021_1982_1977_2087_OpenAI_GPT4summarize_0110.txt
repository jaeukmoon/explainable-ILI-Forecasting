1. The reported ILI counts from Week10 to Week14, 2021 are 1837, 2021, 1982, 1977, and 2087. This indicates a slightly fluctuating trend with marginal week-to-week increases and decreases, showing a stable-to-gradually increasing trajectory over the period rather than any drastic upward or downward shift.
2. Week19, 2021 falls outside the typical U.S. peak season window, which generally spans Week46 to Week06, and the low influenza activity during Weeks10–14, 2021 further supports this classification. It is consistent with the off-season period due to minimal reported transmission and nationwide low positivity. Therefore, Week19, 2021 belongs to the off-season.
3. The time-series pattern reveals that the ILI occurrences are relatively stable across the five-week period, with minor upward and downward fluctuations averaging slightly above 1900 occurrences. Given this stability and the off-season designation, extrapolation over the next five weeks suggests ILI counts around or marginally below this baseline, forecasting 1831 occurrences for Week19, 2021.
4. Influenza activity remains exceptionally low across all U.S. jurisdictions, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza during each of Weeks10–14, 2021. This unusually low nationwide influenza positivity (Week10, 2021 #1; Week11, 2021 #1; Week12, 2021 #1; Week13, 2021 #1; Week14, 2021 #1) strongly indicates continued low transmission in subsequent weeks.
5. Healthcare behavior changes driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced healthcare-seeking for respiratory illnesses and overlapping symptoms between influenza and COVID-19, impact ILI trends. These behavioral shifts limit the impact of influenza spread while complicating ILI interpretation (Week10, 2021 #8; Week11, 2021 #9; Week13, 2021 #8; Week14, 2021 #6, #11).
6. Despite CDC noting a potential increase in influenza activity, no significant trend reversal is apparent, as flu remains minimal across jurisdictions with stable outpatient ILI visits (Week10, 2021 #3; Week11, 2021 #4; Week12, 2021 #4; Week14, 2021 #5). These stable trends suggest that any rise, if it occurs, would remain limited during the off-season.
7. The forecast of 1831 ILI occurrences for Week19, 2021 aligns with the observed low positivity rate, confounding effects of COVID-19 on ILI trends, and the stable-to-slightly fluctuating pattern of ILI counts over the prior weeks. Together, these factors justify a conservative estimate consistent with off-season activity.
