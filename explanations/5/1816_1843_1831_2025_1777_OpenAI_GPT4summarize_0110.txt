1. The reported ILI counts from Week17 to Week21, 2021 are 1816, 1843, 1831, 2025, and 1777. The trend shows a minor increase from Week17 (1816) to Week19 (2025), followed by a noticeable decline by Week21 (1777). This pattern indicates mild fluctuations with a slight overall decline across the five weeks rather than any sharp rise or consistent increase.
2. Week26, 2021 occurs well outside the usual peak influenza season (Week46 to Week6) and also follows a period of unusually low influenza activity (Week17, 2021 #1; Week18, 2021 #1; Week20, 2021 #1). Considering the historical seasonality and recent trends, Week26, 2021 aligns with the off-season classification for ILI activity.
3. From a time-series perspective, prior fluctuations indicate a slight decrease following a modest peak in Week19. Projecting forward to Week26, 2021, the time-series model anticipates a stabilization around slightly higher levels due to the periodic variability and baseline influences. This predictive framework aligns with the recorded value of 2237 ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza circulation remained extremely low in clinical labs, with only 0.1% of specimens testing positive across all five weeks (Week17, 2021 #1; Week18, 2021 #1; Week19, 2021 #1; Week20, 2021 #1; Week21, 2021 #1). This continued low activity limits the likelihood of a significant surge in ILI.
5. COVID-19 remains the primary driver of pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) deaths, with influenza-related outpatient visits far below baseline levels (Week17, 2021 #5, #7; Week18, 2021 #6; Week19, 2021 #5, #7; Week20, 2021 #6; Week21, 2021 #4). Downward pressure on ILI activity is likely stemming from the co-circulation of COVID-19 and behavioral modifications due to the pandemic.
6. While minimal ILI activity was reported nationwide across all jurisdictions (Week17, 2021 #7; Week18, 2021 #12; Week19, 2021 #8; Week20, 2021 #10; Week21, 2021 #10), sporadic detection of novel variants, such as Influenza A(H1N2)v and other swine-origin strains, underscores the continued potential for localized fluctuations (Week20, 2021 #7; Week21, 2021 #3). These factors contribute to slight increases in expected ILI but remain insufficient for widespread transmission.
7. In conclusion, the projected value of 2237 ILI occurrences for Week26, 2021 reflects a combination of slightly fluctuating previous trends, sustained minimal influenza activity consistent with off-season patterns, and the influence of endemic COVID-19, which continues to overshadow traditional flu dynamics. These factors together explain a modest rebound in ILI counts without any significant surge.
