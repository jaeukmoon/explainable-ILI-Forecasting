1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed a consistent upward trend, with values of ['1230', '1477', '1504', '1541', '1543']. This steady increase culminates with a plateau in Weeks 32 and 33, 2021, suggesting a stabilization at elevated levels. The regular rise over the observed period reflects escalating activity in respiratory illnesses, particularly those grouped under ILI.

2. A positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident. The steady increase in ILI occurrences in Weeks 29–33, 2021, aligns with the reported rise to 1889 cases after 5 weeks (Week 38, 2021). The upward trend in Weeks 31–33 signals an ongoing elevation, which likely continued to influence the future peak.

3. The increase in outpatient visits for ILI is notable, moving from 1.7% in Week 29, 2021, to 2.2% by Week 33, 2021, across all age groups. This steady rise indicates increased respiratory illness transmission, likely driven by non-influenza respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Notably, pediatric (ages 0–4) and younger age groups (ages 5–24) contributed significantly to these increasing trends.  

4. Elevated percentages of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) far exceeded the epidemic threshold of 5.5%, rising from 7.4% (Week 29) to a significant 17.2% (Week 33, 2021). This reflects heightened respiratory illness severity and likely corresponds with the increasing ILI occurrences during this period and the subsequent future rise.

5. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have affected ILI surveillance, resulting in potential underreporting or delayed recognition of cases. The redistribution and overlap of respiratory illnesses within healthcare systems likely contributed to the amplified ILI counts observed 5 weeks into the future.

6. Despite influenza virus activity being minimal and lab detections remaining low (e.g., public health labs reporting minimal findings each week), the increasing ILI occurrences likely stem from other respiratory pathogens, particularly non-influenza viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Reports of activity above baseline in specific regions and CBSAs indicate localized escalation.

7. In summary, the reported 1889 future ILI occurrences (Week 38, 2021) can be attributed to the consistent upward trend in Weeks 29–33, 2021, rising outpatient ILI visits across all age groups, persistent PIC mortality far exceeding epidemic thresholds, and the compounding effects of pandemic-driven healthcare-seeking and surveillance challenges. These factors collectively explain the observed future surge in ILI cases.
