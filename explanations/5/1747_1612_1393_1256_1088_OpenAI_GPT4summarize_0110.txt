1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week13 to Week17, 2024 are 1747, 1612, 1393, 1256, and 1088. This data indicates a consistent decline in ILI counts over the 5 weeks, with each week showing a substantial reduction from the previous. No significant spikes or deviations are observed, suggesting a stable downward trend in activity.
2. Week22, 2024 falls within the off-season for ILI activity based on U.S. seasonality patterns. Influenza activity typically tapers off after the peak season, which concludes by Week6. Additionally, declining ILI trends in national outpatient visits (Week13, 2024 #7; Week14, 2024 #3; Week15, 2024 #3; Week16, 2024 #3; Week17, 2024 #5) affirm that Week22, 2024 aligns with the off-season period.
3. The time-series forecasting model, based on the consistent ILI decline observed, anticipates that this downward trajectory will continue over the next few weeks. Projecting forward, the rate of decline is expected to stabilize further, leading to a reduction in ILI occurrences to a value of 549 by Week22, 2024. The absence of significant deviations or novel factors reinforces the reliability of this projection.
4. Recent declining test positivity rates for influenza reinforce the forecast of reduced ILI activity. Positivity rates decreased steadily from Week13 (9.1%) to Week17 (3.9%) (Week13, 2024 #1; Week14, 2024 #1; Week15, 2024 #1; Week16, 2024 #1; Week17, 2024 #1), indicating lower community transmission levels.
5. High vaccine compatibility with circulating strains and consistent vaccination recommendations have contributed to reduced hospitalizations and outpatient visits. CDC reported that circulating viruses are well-aligned with vaccine components (Week13, 2024 #10; Week14, 2024 #7; Week15, 2024 #9; Week16, 2024 #9; Week17, 2024 #6), indicating effective immunization efforts.
6. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and RSV (Week13, 2024 #11; Week14, 2024 #8; Week15, 2024 #8; Week16, 2024 #10; Week17, 2024 #7) continues to influence ILI trends but has not contributed to a resurgence of influenza-related illnesses. These factors have likely supported the stabilization and decline of overall ILI occurrences.
7. In conclusion, the forecast of 549 ILI occurrences for Week22, 2024 is grounded in the observed consistent downward trend in ILI cases, the off-season timing, decreasing flu positivity rates, protective vaccine effectiveness, and lack of significant contributions from other respiratory viruses. These elements collectively point toward continued reduction in influenza activity.
