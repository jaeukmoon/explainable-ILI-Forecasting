1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week45 to Week49, 2020 are 2092, 2178, 2157, 1770, and 1822. Initially, the ILI counts increased from Week45 (2092) to Week46 (2178), followed by a stable yet slightly lower level in Week47 (2157). A significant drop occurred in Week48 (1770), with a minor recovery in Week49 (1822). Overall, this trend indicates a mild decrease and stabilization, moving towards lower ILI levels rather than a consistent upward trajectory.
2. Forecasting target Week1, 2021 belongs to the peak season. Though influenza activity remains unusually low due to mitigating factors, the timing (Week1) falls within the U.S. typical peak season window, when higher ILI activity is expected despite current suppressed levels.
3. From the time-series trend, stable declines in Week47 and Week48, 2020 suggest continuing low ILI activity in future weeks. The minimal stabilization observed in Week49, 2020 hints that ILI levels may not dip substantially further. Projecting forward based on historical trends, the ILI occurrences in Week1, 2021 are forecasted to remain lower than earlier high points but above the lowest dip, leading to the prediction of 1941 ILI occurrences.
4. Influenza activity remains significantly low, with clinical lab positivity remaining at or below 0.2% from Week45 through Week49, 2020. These unusually low rates indicate continued reduced ILI occurrences (Week45, #1; Week46, #1; Week48, #1; Week49, #1).
5. Persistent impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures, including social distancing, masking, and altered healthcare-seeking behaviors, has limited influenza spread and may continue to suppress flu cases during Week1, 2021. These public health measures are highlighted as influential in lowering ILI rates during Week48 and Week49, 2020 (Week48, #10; Week49, #10).
6. Vaccination efforts were emphasized during this time, although specific data on uptake trends were not detailed. Nonetheless, such promotions likely contribute to preventing ILI spread and reducing the forecasted severity (Week45, #8; Week46, #7; Week49, #7).
7. Combining the steady decline in prior ILI trends, the peak season timing, reduced influenza positivity, public health measures, and vaccination promotions, the forecast of 1941 ILI occurrences for Week1, 2021 is reasonable and consistent with observed historical data and factors highlighted by the CDC.
