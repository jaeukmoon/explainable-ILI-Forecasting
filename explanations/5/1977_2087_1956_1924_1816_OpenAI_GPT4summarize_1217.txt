1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over 5 weeks showed a declining trend, with values of ['1977', '2087', '1956', '1924', '1816']. The initial peak of 2087 in Week13, 2021, was followed by a consistent decrease, reaching 1816 in Week17, 2021, the lowest value in the observed period. This trend highlights a diminishing ILI activity over the 5 weeks.
2. A moderate correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is observed as the declining pattern of the past 5 weeks (Week13–Week17, 2021) somewhat aligns with the subsequent lowered occurrence of 1831 in Week22, 2021, reflecting a stabilization near the Week17, 2021 value (1816). The slight increase from Week17, 2021, to Week22, 2021, shows a potential leveling off after the downward trend.
3. Influenza activity remained persistently low, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive across all 5 weeks (Week13–Week17, 2021), contributing to the minimal ILI activity and consistent decline in occurrences. The absence of significant influenza transmission is a critical factor influencing the low future ILI values.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI were stable at 1.0%-1.1% during Weeks13–Week17, 2021, significantly below the national baseline of 2.6%. This stability in visits corresponds to the low ILI activity and supports the modest future value of 1831.
5. The minimal jurisdiction-reported ILI activity across all 5 weeks (Week13–Week17, 2021), with no regions experiencing moderate or high activity levels, underscores the persistently low ILI occurrences, indicating the expected continuation of this trend reflected in the future value.
6. Healthcare-seeking behavioral changes driven by the COVID-19 pandemic impacted ILI data interpretation during Week13–Week17, 2021. These changes may have partly masked true fluctuations in ILI cases, contributing to the stabilization of subsequent occurrences.
7. In summary, the reported 1831 future ILI occurrences (Week22, 2021) are attributed to the declining trend from Week13–Week17, 2021, persistently low influenza positivity rates, stable outpatient visits for ILI below baseline levels, the lack of high or moderate ILI activity across jurisdictions, and the continued impact of COVID-19 on healthcare-related behaviors and ILI reporting.
