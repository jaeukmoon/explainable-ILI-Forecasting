1. The reported ILI counts from Week3 to Week7, 2022 are 1971, 1539, 1125, 1111, and 1182. The time-series data shows a significant decline from Week3 (1971) until Week7 (1182), with a slight uptick in Week7 compared to Week6 (1111). This suggests a general downward trend with minor fluctuations, indicating decreased ILI activity overall through this period.
2. Week12, 2022 is situated after the typical peak season for influenza, which generally ends around Week6. Given the declining pattern in ILI activity and the sporadic influenza activity reported in recent CDC surveillance summaries, Week12, 2022 aligns with the off-season category.
3. Analyzing the trend, the recurrent decrease in ILI occurrences hints at stabilization within a lower activity range. Using time-series forecasting principles, projecting the reduced levels into future weeks implies a moderate rise around 2032 occurrences in Week12, 2022, reflecting seasonal variation and external influences from co-circulating factors.
4. CDC report data highlight ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, notably SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, which adds complexity to predicting ILI occurrences (Week3, 2022 #9; Week6, 2022 #9). Though declining overall, these viruses may maintain some pressure on respiratory illness levels but not drive a sharp increase.
5. Vaccination coverage remains lower this season compared to previous ones (Week3, 2022 #5; Week4, 2022 #6; Week7, 2022 #8). This reduced uptake, coupled with antigenic differences in Influenza A(H3N2) strains (Week5, 2022 #10; Week6, 2022 #10; Week7, 2022 #7), suggests limited immunity protection slowing reductions in ILI occurrences.
6. Influenza A(H3N2), which constitutes the majority of influenza detections (Week3, 2022 #1; Week4, 2022 #2; Week7, 2022 #2), shows some antigenic drift from the vaccine strain but has not significantly driven up hospitalization or critical illness rates overall. This dynamic supports a controlled trajectory in ILI trends.
7. To summarize, the declining past trends in ILI activity, reduced vaccination coverage, continuing co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and sporadic influenza activity categorized as off-season collectively justify the Week12, 2022 forecast of 2032 occurrences. This value reflects a moderate stabilization with small upwards adjustments stemming from seasonal dynamics and limited immunity concerns.
