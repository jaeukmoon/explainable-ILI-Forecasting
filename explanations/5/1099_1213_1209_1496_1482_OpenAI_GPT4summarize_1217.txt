1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibit an overall upward trend, with values of ['1099', '1213', '1209', '1496', '1482']. Although there was a slight decrease from 1213 in Week12, 2021 to 1209 in Week13, 2021, the subsequent significant rise to 1496 in Week14, 2021 and stabilization at 1482 in Week15, 2021 suggests growing ILI activity by the end of the observed period.
2. A strong positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident as the notable increase during Week14 and Week15, 2021 corresponds to the escalated occurrences measured at 1645 after 5 weeks. This suggests the sustained upward trend in the later weeks acted as a precursor to the elevation in future occurrences.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually rose from 0.9% in Week11, 2021, to 1.1% in Week14 and Week15, 2021, indicating a continuous increase in ILI-related healthcare activity. This growth correlates with the higher future ILI count of 1645.
4. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds, ranging from 12.1% in Week11, 2021, to 12.4% in Week15, 2021. The persistently elevated PIC mortality signifies broader respiratory illness burdens, aligning with the later ILI rise.
5. Historical data interpretation challenges due to changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and overlapping pandemic trends in all summarized weeks likely contributed to systematic underreporting or delayed recognition of cases, culminating in the observed surge to 1645 occurrences over time.
6. In summary, the future occurrence of 1645 ILI cases can be attributed to the upward trend in past time-series data (notably Weeks 14 and 15, 2021), rising outpatient ILI percentages, persistent PIC mortality exceeding epidemic levels, and pandemic-induced healthcare dynamics disrupting surveillance accuracy.
