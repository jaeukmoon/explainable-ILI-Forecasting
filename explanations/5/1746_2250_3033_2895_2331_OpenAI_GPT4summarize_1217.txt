1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks demonstrated a fluctuating pattern with an overall decline toward the end. Starting from 1746 (Week 51, 2021), ILI occurrences increased to a peak of 3033 (Week 53, 2021) before declining sharply to 2331 (Week 2, 2022). This indicates a transient surge in activity during Weeks 52 and 53, 2021, followed by a decrease in influenza-related illnesses over Weeks 1–2, 2022.
2. The future ILI occurrence of 773 (Week 8, 2022) correlates with the declining trend observed in the later weeks of the past time-series data. The significant drop from 3033 (Week 53, 2021) to 2331 (Week 2, 2022) suggests a waning of influenza-like illness activity, which aligns with the reduced occurrence of 773 reported five weeks later.
3. Outpatient respiratory illness visits for ILI showed a consistent decrease, dropping from 4.8% (Week 52, 2021) to 2.8% (Week 3, 2022), reflecting a reduction in overall healthcare visits for respiratory symptoms. This declining trend in outpatient ILI activity supports the lower future ILI occurrence.
4. The drop in positivity rates for influenza across clinical labs, declining from 6.2% (Week 51, 2021) to 1.9% (Week 3, 2022), indicates reduced viral transmission and circulation, which is highly correlated with the reported decline to 773 future ILI occurrences.
5. The regional variation in influenza activity showed declining trends across most areas, with less intense activity and lower hospitalization rates during the later weeks (Week 3, 2022). The ongoing impact of lower flu vaccination coverage observed throughout the past period, though significant, likely had minimal effect due to the reduced overall case burden by Week 3, 2022.
6. In summary, the future ILI occurrence of 773 in Week 8, 2022, can be attributed to the overall declining trend in past ILI occurrences, decreasing outpatient visits for respiratory illness, reduced lab positivity rates for influenza, and diminishing regional and national influenza activity during Weeks 1–3, 2022.
