1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a significant upward trend, starting from 1895 in Week43, 2023, increasing to 2172 in Week44, 2023, further to 2707 in Week45, 2023, and peaking at 3350 in Week46, 2023, followed by a slight decline to 3100 in Week47, 2023. This pattern demonstrates sustained growth in ILI activity, with a minor dip in the final week, suggesting escalating respiratory illness prevalence during this period.
2. The positive correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the sharp increases observed in the past weeks (Week43–Week46, 2023) closely align with the steep rise to 5760 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week52, 2023). The peak at Week46, 2023, followed by only a slight dip, likely forecasted the continued escalation that culminated in the elevated future value. This upward trend serves as a precursor for the amplified ILI activity.
3. Outpatient respiratory visits for ILI escalated from 2.7% in Week43, 2023, to 3.5% in Week45, 2023, before reaching 3.9% in Week47, 2023. The persistent increase in outpatient activity above the national baseline of 2.9% highlights a steady rise in healthcare encounters for respiratory illnesses, directly correlating with the increasing future ILI reports. Additionally, hospitalization rates for influenza rose sharply, with rates as high as 3.7 per 100,000 and elderly adults predominantly affected (8.9 per 100,000 by Week47, 2023). Regions with the highest flu activity (e.g., South Central and Southeast) showed notable virologic positivity rates, aligning with the expanding ILI cases.
4. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses such as RSV and SARS-CoV-2 during Week43–Week47, 2023, likely contributed to the compounded burden of ILI, as evident in the CDC's reports of moderate-to-high respiratory illness activity in multiple jurisdictions. This interplay of viruses accelerates ILI trends and infection spread, particularly in vulnerable populations. Increasing influenza positivity rates, rising hospitalizations, and spikes in flu-attributed pediatric deaths (reaching 8 by Week47, 2023) reflect an intensifying respiratory illness burden anticipated to push ILI occurrences higher in subsequent weeks.
5. In summary, the future ILI occurrences of 5760 (Week52, 2023) can be attributed to the strong upward trend observed in past time-series data, the corresponding rise in outpatient ILI visits and virologic positivity, compounded by the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, and the high burden of hospitalizations and severe influenza activity concentrated in specific regions. These factors together underscore the significant surge in ILI occurrences after 5 weeks.
