1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a consistent upward trend, starting from 1117 (Week13, 2022) to 1676 (Week17, 2022). This represents a steady increase in ILI activity, with a notable rise in the last two weeks, from 1474 (Week16, 2022) to 1676 (Week17, 2022), reflecting escalating respiratory illness patterns over time.
2. A clear positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences. The steady upward trend in Weeks13–17, 2022, culminating at 1676, signals increased transmission dynamics, which directly correlates with the further rise to 1858 after 5 weeks (Week22, 2022), evidencing a natural progression in ILI activity.
3. Weekly outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses gradually increased from 1.9% in Week13 to 2.2% in Week17, remaining below the national baseline but steadily rising. This trend highlights growing healthcare encounters for ILI-related symptoms, reinforcing the projected increase in future ILI occurrences.
4. Hospitalizations due to influenza steadily grew throughout the observation period, climbing weekly from 8.0 per 100,000 in Week13 to 12.2 per 100,000 in Week17. This continual rise in severe cases reflects heightened ILI pressures on healthcare systems, aligning with the observed escalation in ILI occurrences by Week22, 2022.
5. The persistent predominance of A(H3N2) influenza, which accounted for >98% of influenza-positive cases and exhibited antigenic drift relative to the vaccine strain, underscored the potential for increased transmission. The co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens likely compounded overall respiratory illness burdens, explaining the further rise in future ILI occurrences.
6. In summary, the increase to 1858 ILI occurrences by Week22, 2022, is driven by the consistent upward trend in ILI activity in Weeks13–17, 2022, the gradual rise in outpatient visits and hospitalizations, the dominant circulation of A(H3N2), and co-circulating respiratory viruses. These factors collectively heightened transmission potential and contributed to the reported surge.
