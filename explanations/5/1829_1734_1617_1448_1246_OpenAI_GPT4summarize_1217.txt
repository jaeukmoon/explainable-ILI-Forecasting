1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks showed a steady downward trend, with values of ['1829', '1734', '1617', '1448', '1246']. The data reflects a consistent decline from 1829 in Week18, 2023, to 1246 in Week22, 2023, indicating diminishing ILI activity over this period.
2. A negative correlation between past and future ILI occurrences is evident, as the persistent decline in ILI activity recorded over the 5 weeks contrasts with the sharp decrease to 722 occurrences reported 5 weeks later. The consistent downward trajectory in Week18 to Week22, 2023, aligns with a lower future ILI incidence, reflecting a sustained reduction in influenza-like illnesses.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI across Weeks 18–22, 2023 remained below the national baseline (2.5%) and displayed stability (e.g., 2.0% in Week18, 1.9% in Week19, Week21, and Week22, and again 2.0% in Week20). This subdued ILI activity in healthcare settings contributes to the observed decrease in future occurrences.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) showed marginal fluctuation but remained near or slightly above the epidemic threshold (e.g., 6.9% in Week18, 6.8% in Week19, 6.5% in Week20, 7.0% in Week21, and 6.2% in Week22). Despite hovering near epidemic thresholds, the absence of significant spikes suggests the overall mortality trend aligns with declining ILI occurrences.
5. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, RSV) throughout Weeks 18–22 contributed to respiratory illness patterns. However, the low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.9% in Week18, 1.0% in Week19, and stable 1.1% in Weeks20 and 22) and well-matched vaccination effectiveness mitigated influenza's impact, supporting a decrease in future ILI activity to 722 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week27, 2023).
