1. The reported ILI counts from Week33 to Week37, 2023 are 13107, 17363, 17147, 16455, and 15359. The trend showed a sharp increase from Week33 (13107) to Week34 (17363), followed by a slight dip in Week35 (17147) and Week36 (16455), then a further decline in Week37 (15359). Overall, this pattern indicates an initial significant rise in ILI occurrences, followed by a gradual decrease, underscoring a transitional phase of fluctuating yet tapering activity.
2. In the U.S., the target Week42, 2023 occurs during the Peak Onset Season, which typically spans Weeks35–46. While current ILI positivity and activity remain low (Week37, 2023 #1, #9), historical patterns suggest a gradual upward trajectory in ILI occurrences around this time of year as the season progresses. Based on this, Week42, 2023 aligns with the Peak Onset Season classification.
3. From the time-series perspective, the sharp rise in Week33–34, followed by a tapering decline in Week35–37, strongly suggests a seasonal upswing transitioning into moderate activity. Projecting this trend forward to Week42, 2023 aligns with seasonal increases in viral activity and ILI reports. This justifies forecasting a notable rise in occurrences to 19370 while factoring in the expected peak onset dynamics.
4. Influenza positivity remains low but gradually rising, with Influenza A constituting the majority of detected strains (Week33, 2023 #1; Week34, 2023 #1, #2; Week35, 2023 #1, #2; Week36, 2023 #1, #2; Week37, 2023 #1, #2).
5. Vaccination efforts continue, but explicit recent uptake data is not provided, while CDC emphasizes annual flu vaccination (Week33, 2023 #9; Week34, 2023 #10; Week35, 2023 #8; Week36, 2023 #10; Week37, 2023 #8). Delayed vaccinations could contribute to a marginal rise in cases.
6. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses (including RSV and SARS-CoV-2) affects healthcare-seeking trends and could elevate ILI reports (Week33, 2023 #10; Week34, 2023 #10; Week35, 2023 #9; Week36, 2023 #9; Week37, 2023 #9). This ongoing dynamic further supports the projection of increased ILI activity in future weeks.
7. Considering the observed tapering but still elevated trends in ILI cases, alignment with the Peak Onset Season (Week42, 2023), and key factors such as low but rising influenza positivity, vaccination delays, and co-circulation of respiratory viruses, the predicted ILI occurrence of 19370 reflects the gradual seasonal rise consistent with historical and current epidemiological patterns.
