1. The ILI occurrences from Week16 to Week20, 2024 were 1256, 1088, 795, 727, and 700, showing a clear and consistent decline over this period. This trend suggests a reduction in influenza activity, reflecting a transition into a lower activity phase consistent with off-season dynamics.
2. Forecasting indicates that Week25, 2024 belongs to the off-season. In the U.S., the off-season typically spans after Week6 through Week31 of each year, marked by minimal ILI activity. Coupled with reduced outpatient visits and national positivity rates declining below baseline levels (Week16-Week20, 2024 #3), this aligns Week25, 2024 with off-season status.
3. The consistent downward trajectory in the ILI occurrences from Week16 to Week20, 2024 resembles common end-of-season patterns which steadily decrease toward baseline. Applying past trends to Week25, 2024, ILI activity is expected to stabilize at a significantly lower count, similar to historical observations during off-season weeks. Thus, the projected future occurrence of 372 reflects a continued decline driven by this seasonal pattern.
4. Nationwide positivity rates decreased from 4.8% in Week16 to 2% in Week20, 2024 (Week16-Week20, 2024 #1, #2, #8), indicating sharply declining influenza activity.
5. Circulating strains of Influenza A and B (e.g., A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria) showed no signs of novel or resistant variants (Week16-Week20, 2024 #2, #8), while antiviral susceptibility remained robust. This stability minimizes future ILI surges.
6. Vaccination and antiviral recommendations remained consistent and effective (Week16-Week20, 2024 #9, #8), reducing severe cases and limiting ILI spread. Despite consistent co-circulation of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and RSV (Week16-Week20, 2024 #10), these do not suggest a resurgence in influenza activity.
7. In summary, the forecasted value of 372 for Week25, 2024 is justified by the steady decline in ILI occurrences (Week16-Week20, 2024) typical of the off-season. Combined with declining positivity rates, effective vaccination and antiviral utilization, and stable co-circulation trends, this projection aligns with historical off-season patterns.
