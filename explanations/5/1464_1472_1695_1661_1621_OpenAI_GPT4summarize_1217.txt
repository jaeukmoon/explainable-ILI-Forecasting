1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks illustrated a fluctuating but decreasing trend, with values of ['1464', '1472', '1695', '1661', '1621']. After an initial rise from 1464 (Week47, 2020) to 1695 (Week49, 2020), there was a gradual decline to 1621 by Week51, 2020. This overall downward trend highlights a general decrease in ILI activity during this period.
2. A negative correlation is evident between the past and future ILI occurrences. The declining ILI occurrences in the latter weeks (Weeks50–51, 2020) contrast with the lower future ILI occurrences of 1042, suggesting that ongoing decreases in activity during the 5-week observation period may have acted as a precursor to the significant drop in ILI cases noted after 5 weeks.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI consistently remained stable at 1.6% throughout Weeks47–51, 2020, staying well below the national baseline of 2.6%. This prolonged stability in ILI outpatient visit percentages reflects suppressed influenza activity, aligning with the lower future occurrence of 1042 cases.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) remained elevated, climbing from 11.3% (Week47, 2020) to 13.6% (Week51, 2020), consistently surpassing the epidemic threshold. However, these were primarily driven by COVID-19 rather than influenza, reflecting low influenza-specific impact during this period and corresponding with decreased future ILI occurrences.
5. Unusually low influenza positivity rates (e.g., 0.2% in Week47, 2020, and 0.3% in Week51, 2020) and minimal lab detections of influenza A and B mirror subdued influenza circulation. This reduced viral activity, coupled with the continued community public health measures (e.g., masking, distancing), likely drove the lower future ILI occurrence of 1042.
6. Disruptions to healthcare-seeking behavior and surveillance caused by the overarching COVID-19 pandemic impacted data reliability, as emphasized across all CDC reports. These disruptions may have led to an underrepresentation or delay in capturing ILI trends, contributing to the decline in reported future ILI occurrences.
7. In summary, the significant drop to 1042 future ILI occurrences (Week56, 2020) can be attributed to the overall declining trend in ILI activity during Weeks50–51, persistent stability in outpatient ILI visits at low levels, limited influenza detections amidst community COVID-19 measures, and continuous disruptions in healthcare-seeking and surveillance behaviors caused by the pandemic.
