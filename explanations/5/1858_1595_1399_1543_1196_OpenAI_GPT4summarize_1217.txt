1. The past time-series ILI occurrences (Weeks 22–26, 2022) showed a consistent decline, with values of ['1858', '1595', '1399', '1543', '1196']. There was a notable drop from 1858 in Week 22 to 1196 by Week 26, despite a slight uptick in Week 25. This steady downward trend highlights decreasing ILI activity over the observed five-week period.
2. A strong negative correlation is evident between past and future ILI occurrences. The consistently declining trend during Weeks 22–26, 2022, aligns with the substantial drop to 719 ILI occurrences in the future (Week 31, 2022). This suggests that the observed decreasing pattern in past weeks set the foundation for greatly reduced activity later.
3. The national percentage of outpatient ILI visits showed a continuous decline from 2.3% in Week 22, 2022, to 1.7% by Week 26, 2022. This steady waning of healthcare visits for ILI likely contributed to the intensified reduction in future occurrences. The seasonal influenza positivity rate dropped progressively from 5.9% (Week 22, 2022) to 1.4% by Week 26, 2022, confirming widespread waning flu activity. Regional influenza activity also shrank, with jurisdictions reporting high activity decreasing from four in Week 22 to none by Week 26, signaling a substantial reduction in overall transmission.
4. Circulating respiratory viruses showed minimal coinfection or contribution to ILI rates, with Influenza A(H3N2) remaining dominant but rapidly declining in prevalence, accounting for 97–99% of detected cases in successive weeks. This decline reflects reduced viral activity, aiding in the marked drop in ILI trends by Week 31, 2022. Surveillance disruptions and healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic continued, likely compounding the drop by underreporting some cases.
5. In summary, the future reported reduction to 719 ILI occurrences (Week 31, 2022) is primarily the result of a consistent downward trend in Weeks 22–26, 2022, declining outpatient visits for respiratory illness, a significant reduction in seasonal influenza positivity, minimal regional activity, as well as reduced contribution of co-circulating respiratory viruses and healthcare reporting shifts amid pandemic behaviors.
