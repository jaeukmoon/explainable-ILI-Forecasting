1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited a fluctuating but overall decreasing trend. Values dropped from 1293 (Week 47, 2020) to 1230 (Week 48, 2020), rose to 1340 (Week 49, 2020), then declined over the next two weeks to 1263 (Week 50, 2020) and 1077 (Week 51, 2020). The declining pattern in the last two weeks reflects reduced ILI activity in the observed period.
2. A strong negative correlation exists between past and future ILI occurrences, as the consistent decline in ILI numbers during the last two weeks of past data (Weeks 50–51, 2020) aligns with the significant drop to 783 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 6, 2021). This indicates a continuation of a downward trend in ILI activity.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remained steady at 1.6% for five consecutive weeks (Weeks 47–51, 2020), consistently below the national baseline of 2.6%. Stability in outpatient visits suggests minimal increases in respiratory illness activity, contributing to the observed future ILI decline.
4. Low influenza positivity rates were reported in clinical and public health labs across all weeks (e.g., 0.2% in Week 47, 2020, and 0.3% in Week 51, 2020), indicating exceptionally low influenza circulation. This minimal virologic activity aligns with the reduction in future ILI occurrences.
5. Significant ongoing disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, were noted across all five weeks, with ILI data deemed less reliable for influenza activity interpretation. Altered healthcare-seeking patterns may have suppressed ILI outpatient visit reports, contributing to the future decline to 783.
6. Elevated percentages of PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) deaths remained consistent but primarily driven by COVID-19 (e.g., 11.3% in Week 47, 2020, and 13.6% in Week 51, 2020). The dominance of COVID-19 over influenza could account for the limited ILI activity reflected in future data.
7. In summary, the reported 783 future ILI occurrences (Week 6, 2021) can be attributed to the overall declining trend in Weeks 50–51, 2020, stable and minimal ILI outpatient visits, historically low influenza positivity rates, healthcare-seeking disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, and the overshadowing impact of COVID-19 over influenza-related respiratory illnesses.
