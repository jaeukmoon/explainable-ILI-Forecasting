1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week40 to Week44, 2021 are 1124, 1063, 969, 1008, and 1084. The trend demonstrates an initial decline from Week40 (1124) to Week42 (969), followed by a slight recovery in Week43 (1008) and Week44 (1084). Overall, the pattern reflects a mild fluctuation with a net decrease from Week40 alongside small upward adjustments toward Week44. This suggests that while ILI activity remains subdued, there is some potential for gradual increases.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically begins around Week46, with heightened transmission and activity lasting until about Week6 of the following year. Week49, 2021 falls within this characteristic peak season timing. Considering the recent reports of increasing influenza activity (Week44, 2021 #1, #10), including localized outbreaks (Week44, 2021 #11) and upward momentum in positive cases, the forecast aligns Week49, 2021 with the peak season.
3. Historical trends from Week40 to Week44, 2021 suggest a return to increased ILI occurrences after a preceding decline. Time-series forecasting would extrapolate this upward recovery phase, compounded by the typical seasonal influenza peak around Week49. The increase in cases from Week42 to Week44 mirrors past trends corresponding to the transition into peak seasons, where ILI counts rise significantly. Consequently, projecting forward five weeks leads to an expected value of 1772 ILI occurrences, which reflects this seasonal amplification.
4. Influenza positivity rates are rising steadily (Week40, 2021 #1; Week43, 2021 #1; Week44, 2021 #1, #2). Despite starting at minimal levels, these indicators suggest entering a period of heightened transmission.
5. An outbreak of Influenza A(H3N2), particularly in Michigan and among younger populations (Week44, 2021 #5, #11), indicates potential regional surges that contribute notably to the forecasted increase in ILI activity nationwide.
6. Vaccination uptake shows substantial coverage (Week44, 2021 #9), but potential delays in uptake timing (Week40, 2021 #8; Week41, 2021 #8) and regional variations (Week44, 2021 #5) may limit immediate protective effects, leaving populations vulnerable as activity intensifies.
7. The forecast of 1772 is supported by the observed upward ILI trends from Week42 onwards, the onset of the typical peak season, rising positivity levels, regional outbreaks of Influenza A(H3N2), and vaccination timing. Together, these factors justify heightened occurrences expected by Week49, 2021.
