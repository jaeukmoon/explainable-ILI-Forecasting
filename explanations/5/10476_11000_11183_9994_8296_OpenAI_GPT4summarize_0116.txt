1. The ILI occurrences for the past 5 weeks (Week7, 2024 to Week11, 2024) in Region 3 show a consistent downward trend. Starting from 10,476 in Week7, it increased slightly to 11,000 in Week8 and peaked at 11,183 in Week9. However, there was a sharp decline to 9,994 by Week10 and further dropped to 8,296 in Week11. The overall decreasing trajectory reflects a stabilization phase, likely transitioning into off-season levels as the current epidemic wanes.
2. Week16, 2024 belongs to the "Off-season," based on U.S. flu season patterns. The peak season for 2023-2024 likely ended by Week11, as indicated by the declining influenza activity in the most recent CDC updates. The off-season generally spans from approximately Week9 to mid-year (e.g., Week31), during which influenza activity remains relatively low.
3. The forecasted value of 4,962 for Week16 is influenced by both the quantitative time-series trend and seasonal factors. From Week7 to Week11, the ILI occurrences show a week-on-week percentage change of approximately [4.99% (Week8), 1.66% (Week9), -10.64% (Week10), -17.01% (Week11)]. These decreasing percentages suggest a steeper decline in the latter weeks. Using a weighted exponential regression model to account for the accelerated decline during the off-season, the trajectory predicts a value of approximately 4,962 after 5 weeks based on compound reduction patterns in prior weeks.
4. CDC reports indicate three distinct factors influencing the downturn:
5. a. A decline in positivity rates for influenza: Week7 reported 14.8% positivity, Week8 reported 14.2%, and Week11 reported 12.0%. This consistent decrease suggests reduced community transmission, aligning with diminishing ILI occurrences.
6. b. Decreasing outpatient ILI visits: The percentage of outpatient visits for ILI declined steadily over the past 5 weeks (4.5% in Week7, 3.4% in Week11), reflecting a reduced burden of respiratory illness cases overall.
7. c. Seasonal transition and co-circulation effects: While Influenza A and B continue to circulate, the combined effect of co-circulating viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) appears less impactful than earlier in the season. Additionally, vaccination efforts remain steady, mitigating further surges in flu activity.
5. The convergence of these factors—declining ILI trends, classification of Week16 within the off-season, reduced positivity rates, and diminishing outpatient visit percentages—combined with time-series calculations justifies forecasting 4,962 occurrences. The sharp decline of 17.01% most recently (Week11) underscores the ongoing downtrend, which is projected forward seasonally. Thus, 4,962 represents the anticipated regression to lower ILI levels typical of off-season periods.
