1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week2, 2024 to Week6, 2024 are 1777, 1470, 1756, 2311, and 2712. The trend displays an initial decrease from Week2 (1777) to Week3 (1470) followed by a slight recovery in Week4 (1756). A sharp upward spike is evident in Week5 (2311) and Week6 (2712). This reflects a clear increasing trend marked by significant growth in the last two weeks, indicating escalating ILI activity.
2. Week11, 2024 is forecasted to belong to the off-season since it occurs after Week6, where peak season typically concludes. Though current activity remains elevated and increasing, historical U.S. patterns indicate that Week11 aligns with post-peak seasonal declines. Hence, Week11, 2024 falls into the off-season.
3. From the time-series perspective, the escalating growth in the last two weeks (Week5 and Week6, 2024) strongly suggests continued elevated ILI occurrences in the near term. However, as Week11 occurs five weeks later, the trend is expected to stabilize somewhat based on historical dynamics during the transition from peak to off-season, projecting a moderate decline from extremely high recent values to 2431 occurrences.
4. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 dominance, which accounted for 67.5% of subtyped Influenza A cases in Week5 and remained the predominant subtype in Week6, continues to drive elevated activity and severe outcomes. Positivity rates for influenza remain high (15.8% in Week5 and 15.7% in Week6), particularly in regions such as Regions 3, 5, and 7, which reported increased activity.
5. Cumulative hospitalization rates (54.9 per 100,000 by Week6, 2024) and influenza-associated deaths show substantial ongoing impact, signaling severe disease outcomes for vulnerable populations, sustaining heightened ILI activity despite the nearing off-season.
6. Vaccination coverage and antiviral effectiveness remain critical factors. While vaccination is emphasized continuously, susceptibility to antivirals such as oseltamivir (with minimal resistance) mitigates severity. However, co-circulation with other respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, complicates disease burden, contributing to persistent elevated ILI rates.
7. Given the recent significant growth in ILI occurrences, Week11 placement within the transition to off-season, the dominance of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and the influence of co-circulating respiratory viruses, projected ILI occurrences of 2431 in Week11, 2024 are consistent with expectations for moderate stabilization at still elevated levels.
