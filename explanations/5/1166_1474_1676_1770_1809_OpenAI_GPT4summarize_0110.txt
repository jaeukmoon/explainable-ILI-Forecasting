1. The reported ILI occurrences from Week15 through Week19, 2022 are 1166, 1474, 1676, 1770, and 1809, respectively. This shows a consistent upward trend with a weekly increase in cases, reflecting a clear rise in influenza activity. Notably, the growth rate has slowed somewhat from Week18 (1770) to Week19 (1809) compared to previous weeks.
2. Forecasting target week (Week24, 2022) belongs to the off-season. Historically, Week24 falls within the U.S. off-season period, when ILI activity has typically declined from the peak window and stabilizes at reduced levels. This aligns with the observed slowing trend in Week19, 2022, indicating diminishing activity post an unusual second peak in Week19, 2022.
3. From a time-series perspective, the steady growth from Week15 to Week19 suggests the second of two annual peaks is tapering off. Extrapolating forward, the slowing of increases indicates a projected decline or stabilization in ILI counts beyond Week19. As Week24 approaches the midsummer window, a decrease in transmission intensity is expected, resulting in 1399 projected cases.
4. Influenza A(H3N2) dominates (>98%) across all regions, with low prevalence of Influenza B variants (Week15, 2022 #2, #3; Week17, 2022 #2, #6). Given the dominance of A(H3N2) and its slightly reduced vaccine effectiveness due to antigenic differences (Week15, 2022 #10; Week18, 2022 #8; Week19, 2022 #9), these factors contribute to a persistent—albeit declining—level of ILI cases during the off-season.
5. Hospitalization data show an upward yet stabilizing trend by Week19 (cumulative hospitalization rate of 14.4 per 100,000; Week15, 2022 #7; Week19, 2022 #3). This reflects ongoing community transmission but at a slowing rate, driven by co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 and lingering influenza activity (Week15, 2022 #9; Week17, 2022 #9; Week19, 2022 #8).
6. Outpatient respiratory visits remain consistently below baseline nationally (Week15-Week19) despite localized heightened activity in some regions (Week15, 2022 #4; Week18, 2022 #2; Week19, 2022 #6). This signals a generally low but uneven community burden, characteristic of off-season influenza periods.
7. The consistent rise in ILI cases from Week15 to Week19, the dominance of A(H3N2) with its reduced vaccine match, the slowing hospitalization and outpatient visits trends, and the off-season timing for Week24, 2022 collectively lead to the projection of 1399 future ILI occurrences as influenza activity begins to stabilize at reduced off-season levels.
