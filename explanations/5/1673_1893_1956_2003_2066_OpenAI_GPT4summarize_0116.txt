1. The ILI occurrences from the past 5 weeks (Week11, 2021 to Week15, 2021) show a steady increasing trend, with values of 1673, 1893, 1956, 2003, and 2066. This consistent upward movement reflects ongoing growth in ILI activity. The week-over-week growth rates are calculated as follows: from Week11 to Week12 (1893 - 1673) / 1673 ≈ 13.1%, from Week12 to Week13 (1956 - 1893) / 1893 ≈ 3.3%, from Week13 to Week14 (2003 - 1956) / 1956 ≈ 2.4%, and from Week14 to Week15 (2066 - 2003) / 2003 ≈ 3.1%. The average weekly growth rate over these 5 weeks is approximately (13.1% + 3.3% + 2.4% + 3.1%) / 4 ≈ 5.5%. Extrapolating this rate, the forecasted value for Week20, 2021 can be calculated as 2066 × (1 + 5.5%)^5 ≈ 2114. This prediction assumes the trend continues but at a slightly stabilized average rate.
2. Week20, 2021 falls within the "Off-season." According to U.S. influenza activity patterns, the off-season spans from just after the peak season (Week6) until the next peak onset season starts (Week32). Week20 is well within this period, and the CDC reports from Week11 to Week15 strongly emphasize persistently low influenza activity this season, compounded by pandemic-related factors. Consequently, Week20 is expected to be a time of minimal ILI activity despite a gradual increase in occurrences in recent weeks.
3. Historical trends support continued ILI activity growth moderated by seasonal effects. Based on a time-series progression, stable weekly increases have been observed despite an unseasonably low baseline for influenza activity. The observed ILI trends underpin a projection toward 2114; while growth occurs, it reflects an attenuated flu season overall. The calculated 5.5% weekly growth is adjusted slightly to reflect typical off-season constraints on transmission by influenza.
4. Factors from CDC reports influencing predictions include:
5. 1) Persistently low influenza activity in the U.S., highlighted by only ~0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive across all weeks (Week15, 2021). This reduces the baseline starting point of ILI activity in Region 3 but does not eliminate gradual week-over-week growth.
6. 2) The overlap with pandemic-related behaviors and healthcare-seeking changes. Reports from Week11 to Week15 (e.g., Week14: "changes in healthcare behaviors affect surveillance") indicate mild distortions in data, potentially overstating the apparent ILI stabilization. Adjusted trajectory models factor this variability into growth projections.
7. 3) No significant virologic threats from novel variants or surging strains. Both Week14 and Week15 reports reinforce minimal novel influenza transmission, reducing the likelihood of sudden unexplained increases in ILI activity beyond observed slow trends in Region 3.
5. In summary, the forecast for Week20, 2021 reflects a sustained but moderate increase in ILI occurrences due to recent stable growth in cases, typical seasonality constraints during off-seasons, and the consistently low influenza burden observed across regions. The steady upward trajectory over 5 weeks, combined with the absence of disruptive influences (e.g., novel strains or vaccine variability), leads to a projection of 2114 occurrences in Region 3.
