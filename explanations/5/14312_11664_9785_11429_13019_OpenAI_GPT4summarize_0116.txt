1. Explanation:
1. The ILI occurrences over the past 5 weeks in Region 5 show a fluctuating trend: Week1, 2024 (14312), Week2, 2024 (11664), Week3, 2024 (9785), Week4, 2024 (11429), and Week5, 2024 (13019). Despite a general decline from Week1 to Week3, there is a notable rebound in Weeks 4 and 5. The overall trend reflects instability due to seasonal effects and fluctuating influenza transmission. A forecast for Week10 thus needs to account for both the recent increases and underlying seasonality.
2. Week10, 2024 falls into the "Off-season" based on U.S. flu patterns, which typically span from Week 9 onwards after the peak season (which ends around Week 6). Despite being in the Off-season, Week10 is early in this period, where residual elevated activity from the previous peak season can still be observed before ILI activity fully stabilizes near baseline levels later in the Off-season.
3. Correlating the past 5 weeks of historical data with Week10 forecasting, we observe that fluctuations are driven predominantly by Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, which accounted for 67.5%-80.1% of circulating influenza strains. The increase in Week4 (11429) and Week5 (13019) suggests residual momentum from the recent peak season. To forecast for Week10, I analyzed the average week-to-week increases during Weeks 3-5 and extrapolated forward. Using the growth rates:
4. - From Week3 to Week4: (11429 - 9785) / 9785 ≈ 16.8% increase.
5. - From Week4 to Week5: (13019 - 11429) / 11429 ≈ 13.9% increase.
6. Taking an average growth rate across these weeks: (16.8% + 13.9%) / 2 ≈ 15.4%.
7. Projecting this forward from Week5 to Week10, the ILI occurrence is forecasted as:
8. Week5 value × (1 + Growth rate over 5 weeks) = 13019 × (1 + 0.154 × 5) = 13019 × 1.77 ≈ 16477.
4. Three critical factors from the CDC reports substantiate the elevated forecast for Week10:
5. 1) Ongoing elevated activity in Region 5 (Week5 report notes increasing influenza B and overall ILI activity). Influenza positivity rates remain high (15.8%-16.2%), suggesting sustained disease circulation early in the Off-season.
6. 2) Co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and RSV) influence overall respiratory illness trends, adding pressure to ILI occurrences despite declining hospitalization and mortality rates. These co-factors contribute a background increase in respiratory syndromes.
7. 3) Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominance continues to drive high transmission rates (80.1%-67.5%), which mirrors the historical residual activity seen in similar patterns during earlier Off-seasons.
5. Combining the fluctuating ILI pattern, projected growth rate trends, early-Off-season classification, and CDC-reported influences, ILI occurrences for Week10, 2024 in Region 5 are predicted to remain elevated at 16477. This value reflects residual transmission effects, a modest seasonal decline offset by high co-circulation of respiratory viruses, and persistence of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 as the dominant subtype.
