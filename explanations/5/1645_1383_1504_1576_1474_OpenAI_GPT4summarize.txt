1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks displayed significant fluctuations but no consistent trend, with values of ['1645', '1383', '1504', '1576', '1474'] observed between Week 20–24, 2021. After an initial decline from 1645 in Week 20, 2021, to a low of 1383 in Week 21, 2021, there was a rebound in Week 22, 2021, to 1504, followed by a peak at 1576 in Week 23, 2021, before decreasing again to 1474 in Week 24, 2021. This irregular pattern, coupled with slightly lower values in the final two weeks, suggests moderate but variable ILI activity in the lead-up to the observed future outcome.

2. Despite the uneven pattern in past ILI occurrences, the rise to 1859 occurrences after 5 weeks (Week 29, 2021) may correlate with the rebound observed in Week 23, 2021, when ILI activity peaked at 1576 after prior fluctuations. This indicates that brief increases in activity during Week 22–23, 2021, potentially laid the groundwork for the future surge in ILI occurrences.

3. Minimal national ILI activity (1.1%–1.3% of outpatient visits consistently below the baseline of 2.6%) reported across Week 20–24, 2021, shows stable low levels. However, the slight uptick in pediatric ILI visits (ages 0–4) during Week 22 and Week 24, 2021, could signify unnoticed transmission pockets contributing to the future increase in ILI occurrences.   

4. Persistent elevated mortality due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) throughout Week 20–24, 2021 (ranging from 7.1%–9.5% and exceeding epidemic thresholds), indicates overall heightened respiratory illness burden. This trend, though primarily influenced by COVID-19, underscores broader respiratory risks, possibly fueling future ILI activity.

5. Disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior and the impact of COVID-19 on traditional ILI surveillance were repeatedly highlighted across Week 20–24, 2021. These factors could delay ILI reporting and recognition, leading to a concentration of cases, which may explain the future surge to 1859 occurrences.

6. In summary, the reported 1859 future ILI occurrences (Week 29, 2021) are linked to fluctuating ILI trends in Week 20–24, 2021, the slight increase in pediatric ILI visits, the persistent elevation in PIC mortality beyond epidemic thresholds, and the influence of COVID-19-related disruptions affecting surveillance and reporting systems. These elements collectively contributed to the observed increase after 5 weeks.
