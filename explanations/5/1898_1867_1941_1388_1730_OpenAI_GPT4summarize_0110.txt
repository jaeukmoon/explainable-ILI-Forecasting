1. The reported ILI counts from Week52, 2020 to Week3, 2021 are 1898, 1867, 1941, 1388, and 1730. The data shows a fluctuating trend with a slight decline from Week52 (1898) to Week2 (1388) before a moderate rise in Week3 (1730). This pattern suggests variability without a consistent increase or decrease.
2. In the U.S., the peak season typically spans Week46 to Week6. Week8, 2021 occurs shortly after this window, and given that influenza activity and positivity remain minimal (Week52, 2020 #1; Week1, 2021 #1; Week3, 2021 #1), Week8, 2021 aligns with the off-season when ILI levels typically remain suppressed.
3. Based on time-series analysis, the fluctuating trend in ILI occurrences (e.g., mild declines followed by an increase by Week3) suggests that ILI activity will likely stabilize or decline moderately into Week8, 2021. Using past trends to project forward, the forecast models align with reduced levels, resulting in a prediction of 1031 occurrences.
4. Influenza activity remains historically low this season, with positivity rates far below baseline (Week52, 2020 #1; Week1, 2021 #1; Week3, 2021 #1).
5. COVID-19 remains the dominant driver of PIC-related mortality, overshadowing influenza activity and complicating typical ILI trends (Week52, 2020 #6; Week2, 2021 #6; Week3, 2021 #6).
6. Reduced circulation of influenza strains, with limited hospitalizations and minimal positive detection in labs, underpins the unusually low transmission this season (Week53, 2020 #1; Week1, 2021 #7; Week2, 2021 #5).
7. Given the consistently low influenza activity, the off-season classification of Week8, 2021, and suppressed transmission driven by various factors (COVID-19 dominance, healthcare-seeking changes), the predicted ILI count of 1031 reflects a continuation of these atypically low patterns.
