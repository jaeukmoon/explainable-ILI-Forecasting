1. The past time-series ILI occurrences over the 5 weeks exhibited an overall upward trend, with values of ['1623', '1558', '1873', '2139', '2066']. After an initial decline from 1623 (Week 43, 2020) to 1558 (Week 44, 2020), there was a notable increase in Week 45 to 1873, peaking at 2139 in Week 46, 2020, before slightly decreasing to 2066 by Week 47. This pattern reflects a general escalation in ILI activity, despite minor fluctuations in the second half of the observed period.

2. A positive correlation exists between the past and future ILI occurrences, as the peak and subsequent stabilization of values in the latter weeks of the past dataset (Weeks 46–47, 2020) align with the continued elevation to 2028 reported 5 weeks later. The upward movement from Week 44 and the sustained high levels in Weeks 46–47 act as a precursor to the continued high ILI activity in the future.

3. Outpatient visits for ILI gradually increased over the 5 weeks, rising from 1.2% (Week 43, 2020) to 1.6% (Week 47, 2020). Although these percentages remained below the national baseline of 2.6%, the steady growth in ILI-related visits signals increasing respiratory illness activity, which correlates with the subsequent rise to 2028 in future ILI occurrences.  
   Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) consistently exceeded epidemic thresholds throughout, climbing from 8.2% in Week 43, 2020, to 11.3% by Week 47. This sustained elevation in respiratory-related mortality reflects heightened overall activity consistent with future ILI growth.  
   Ongoing disruptions in healthcare-seeking behaviors and surveillance systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as documented across all weeks, likely concentrated reporting of respiratory illnesses, amplifying future ILI occurrences as seen in the rise to 2028.

4. In summary, the reported 2028 future ILI occurrences after 5 weeks can be explained by the overall upward trend in Weeks 43–47, increasing outpatient visits for ILI, persistently elevated PIC mortality above epidemic thresholds, and the compounding effects of pandemic-driven shifts in healthcare behaviors and disrupted surveillance practices. These factors collectively contribute to the significant future burden of ILI observed.
