1. The reported ILI counts for the past five weeks (Week43 to Week47, 2020) show the following occurrences: 1079, 1171, 1320, 1416, and 1293. The trend indicates an initial consistent increase in ILI occurrences from Week43 (1079) through Week46 (1416), followed by a slight decrease in Week47 (1293). This suggests a fluctuating but generally elevated trajectory, with a recent leveling off.
2. The target week (None) falls shortly after Week47, 2020, placing it within the typical peak-onset to peak-season transition period. Given the low influenza positivity and the minimal flu activity reported, the forecast indicates None aligns closer to the peak-onset season.
3. Based on the observed upward trajectory in ILI data, followed by stabilization, a projection to week None anticipates ILI activity to moderately decline compared to Week47. The transition phase combined with stable upward trends suggests a projected occurrence of 1069.
4. Flu activity remains unusually low for this time of year, as indicated repeatedly (Week43, 2020 #6, #10; Week46, 2020 #6, #10; Week47, 2020 #1, #6). Despite COVID-19 complicating healthcare-seeking and data accuracy, actual influenza cases contribute minimally to ILI.
5. The CDC emphasizes vaccination, with continued promotion and no sharp drops in vaccination trends (Week43, 2020 #8; Week45, 2020 #8; Week47, 2020 #7), likely supporting milder outcomes and restrained seasonal impact on ILI occurrence.
6. Co-circulating viruses like COVID-19 drive elevated PIC deaths (above epidemic thresholds) but do not contribute substantially to influenza activity (Week44, 2020 #6; Week46, 2020 #4; Week47, 2020 #4). As such, ILI remains stable rather than surging.
7. Considering the stabilizing ILI counts, peak-onset timing, low flu activity, vaccination effects, and the absence of significant drivers of a surge, the forecast of 1069 ILI occurrences after 5 weeks aligns with observed trends and influencing factors.
