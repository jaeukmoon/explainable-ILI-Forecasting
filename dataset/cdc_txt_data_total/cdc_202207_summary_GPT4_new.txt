1. Influenza activity is sporadic nationwide, with some areas observing increased activity; 4.2% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza.
2. Influenza A(H3N2) accounts for the majority of cases (98%-99.7%), with minimal Influenza B activity (0.3%-2%).
3. Hospitalizations have increased for the past three weeks, with a cumulative hospitalization rate of 4.9 per 100,000, higher than 2020-2021 but lower than pre-pandemic seasons.
4. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness remained stable at 1.5% of visits, below baseline, with moderate activity reported in two jurisdictions.
5. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) account for 20.4%, primarily due to COVID-19; 12 influenza-related deaths occurred.
6. One pediatric influenza death was reported, bringing the season total to six.
7. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses showed some antigenic differences from vaccine strains, though genetically similar.
8. Flu vaccination coverage remains lower than the previous season, and vaccination continues to be recommended.
9. No significant co-circulation with SARS-CoV-2 was observed; 6% of reported influenza-positive cases were co-infected.
10. Most hospitalizations involved older adults (65+ years, 12.9 per 100,000) and children aged 0-4 years (7.1 per 100,000), with underlying conditions common in severe cases.

11. Summary insights suggest influenza activity is increasing in areas, with Influenza A(H3N2) dominant, a steady hospitalization rise, and lower vaccination coverage, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance.
