Week42, 2020
- **Viruses, illness, and deaths**: Influenza activity remains low, with 0.3% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza. Influenza A accounts for 54.5% of clinical lab positives, while Influenza B accounts for 45.5%. 7.6% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), exceeding the epidemic threshold of 5.8%. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported for the 2020-2021 season.

- **U.S. virologic surveillance**: Clinical labs reported 0.3% positivity for influenza from respiratory specimens. Public health labs showed no recent positive influenza A or B specimens.

- **Cumulative hospitalization rate**: Hospitalization rates are not yet available for the season.

- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza**: 7.6% of deaths during week 42 were attributed to PIC, above the epidemic threshold.

- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B**: Among clinical lab positives, 54.5% were Influenza A, and 45.5% were Influenza B. Public health labs reported no positive influenza specimens recently.

- **Novel influenza virus (like COVID-19)**: No novel influenza viruses were reported. COVID-19 remains a contributing factor to PIC mortality.

- **Vaccination trends**: CDC emphasizes vaccination as the best protection against influenza. Everyone 6 months or older is recommended to get vaccinated by the end of October.

- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits**: ILINet reported 1.2% of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI), below the national baseline of 2.6%. Most jurisdictions reported minimal activity, with only one reporting low activity.

- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC**: Influenza activity remains expectedly low but is being monitored closely alongside COVID-19 trends.

- **Other key factors**: Routine geographic spread data reporting has been suspended for this season due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILI surveillance. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes may also affect data interpretation for ILI trends.
