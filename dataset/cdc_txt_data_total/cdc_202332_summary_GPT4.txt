Week32, 2023
- **Viruses, Illness, and Deaths**: Influenza activity remains low in the U.S., with 0.8% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in week 32. Of these, 52.3% were Influenza A and 47.7% Influenza B. The mortality rate for pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) was 6.1%, above the 5.5% epidemic threshold, with 6 deaths attributed to influenza.  
- **U.S. Virologic Surveillance**: Clinical labs report 52.3% of positive specimens as Influenza A and 47.7% as Influenza B. Public health labs show 58.8% of positives as Influenza A (81.8% H1N1, 18.2% H3N2), and 41.2% as Influenza B (all Victoria lineage).  
- **Cumulative Hospitalization Rate**: 677 influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported during week 32. Influenza-related hospitalization surveillance stopped collecting data after April 30, 2023, for the season.  
- **Trends of Deaths Attributed to Influenza**: 6 influenza-related deaths were reported out of 1,414 PIC deaths in week 32.  
- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B**: Influenza A constituted 58.8% (public health labs) and 52.3% (clinical labs) of positive specimens, while Influenza B accounted for 41.2% and 47.7%, respectively.  
- **Novel Influenza Virus (like COVID-19)**: No detection of novel influenza viruses was reported.  
- **Vaccination Trends**: No updates on vaccination trends were noted.  
- **Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits**: 1.3% of outpatient visits were for ILI, below the national baseline. ILI rates were highest in children aged 0-4 years (4.4%). Minimal ILI activity was observed in 54 jurisdictions, while one had low activity.  
- **Expectation of Flu Activity from CDC**: No significant changes in influenza activity expected as activity remains low.  
- **Other Key Factors**: Multiple respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, continue to co-circulate, influencing ILI rates.
