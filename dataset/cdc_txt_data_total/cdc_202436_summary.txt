According to the latest FluView report, seasonal influenza activity remains low in the United States.

In the clinical lab, 3.1% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza, which is similar to the previous week.

Influenza A viruses, including H3N2 and H1N1pdm09, dominated in the public health lab.

ILI activity remains below the national baseline, but it slightly increased from the previous week, with 1.4% of visits to healthcare providers being for ILI.

Most jurisdictions experienced minimal ILI activity, but Louisiana had moderate ILI activity.

Only four out of 53 jurisdictions reported local flu activity, while the rest reported sporadic or no flu activity.

The hospitalization rates and P&I mortality are below their respective threshold levels.

No influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported for the current season so far.

CDC expects flu activity to remain low but increase in the coming weeks.

The CDC recommends everyone 6 months or older to get a flu vaccine by the end of October.

Flu antiviral drugs are also available for treatment.

Virologic surveillance monitors the percentage of positive specimens and the distribution of virus types and subtypes.

Outpatient ILI surveillance tracks the percentage of visits for respiratory illness and compares it to national baselines.

Geographic activity varies, with some areas experiencing minimal ILI activity and others experiencing moderate activity.

Severe disease indicators, such as hospitalization rates and mortality rates, are below the epidemic threshold.

Virus characterization provides information on genetic and antigenic properties and antiviral susceptibility.

These factors combined enable a robust approach to predict and respond to future ILI occurrences.
