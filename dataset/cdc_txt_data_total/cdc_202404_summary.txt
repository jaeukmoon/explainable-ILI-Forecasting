During Week 4, seasonal influenza activity remained elevated nationally with increases in some parts of the country. In clinical laboratories, 16.2% of specimens tested positive for influenza, with a predominance of influenza A viruses. Outpatient respiratory illness accounted for 4.3% of visits to healthcare providers, remaining above the national baseline for the thirteenth consecutive week. Thirteen jurisdictions experienced moderate ILI activity, while 20 jurisdictions had high or very high ILI activity. FluSurv-NET reported a cumulative hospitalization rate of 47.8 per 100,000 population, with the highest rates among adults 65 years and older. The percentage of deaths attributed to influenza was 0.9%, below the epidemic threshold. Eight influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during Week 4, bringing the season total to 65. Vaccination and antiviral treatment were recommended for prevention and control. Virologic surveillance provided information on circulating virus types and antiviral susceptibility. Overall, these factors allowed for prediction and monitoring of future ILI occurrences.
