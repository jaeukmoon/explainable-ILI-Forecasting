Firstly, virologic surveillance is conducted through clinical laboratories, where 1.2% of tested specimens were positive for influenza, with Influenza A accounting for 67.1% of positive cases. Public health laboratories reported that 2.4% of tested specimens were positive for influenza, with Influenza A accounting for 35.3% of positive cases.

In terms of outpatient illness surveillance, 1.4% of patient visits reported through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) were due to influenza-like illness (ILI), which includes fever plus cough or sore throat. The activity levels of ILI varied by jurisdiction, with minimal activity reported in the majority of jurisdictions.

Geographically, local influenza activity was reported in four states, while sporadic activity was reported in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 40 states. Six states reported no influenza activity.

Hospitalization rates and pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality rates are updated weekly and vary based on the data received. During the reported period, 6.1% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19, which is above the epidemic threshold.

There were no reported influenza-associated pediatric deaths during the reported period, and a total of 160 influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported during the current season.

These surveillance data, along with virologic characterization and recommendations for influenza vaccination, are used to predict and monitor influenza activity and guide public health interventions.
