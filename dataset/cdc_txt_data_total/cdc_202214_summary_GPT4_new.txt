Week14, 2022
1. Influenza activity increased nationally, with the highest levels observed in the central and south-central regions and rising in most regions.
2. Clinical labs reported 8.4% of specimens positive for influenza, with 99.3% being Influenza A and 0.7% Influenza B, predominantly A(H3N2).
3. Public health labs detected only Influenza A (100%) this week, with 99.9% of subtyped viruses identified as A(H3N2).
4. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness accounted for 2.0% of healthcare visits, still below the national baseline, though increasing in some jurisdictions.
5. Cumulative hospitalization rates reached 8.9 per 100,000, higher than the 2020-21 season but lower than pre-pandemic seasons; older adults had the highest rates.
6. Mortality from pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) was 7.1%, slightly above the epidemic threshold, with COVID-19 being the primary driver of PIC deaths.
7. Three pediatric deaths caused by Influenza A(H3N2) were reported, bringing the season’s total to 19.
8. Vaccination is ongoing, with influenza vaccines shown to have some antigenic mismatch for A(H3N2) but good matches for B/Victoria strains.
9. Among co-circulating respiratory viruses, 5.1% of specimens tested for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 were positive for COVID-19.
10. Hospital admissions for influenza have risen weekly for the past 10 weeks, with 3,170 new admissions reported this week.
11. Long-term care facilities reported influenza in 0.9% of facilities this week.
12. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, contributing variably to outpatient respiratory visits depending on location.

13. Summary insights highlight increasing influenza activity, a predominance of A(H3N2), rising hospitalizations, and significant co-circulation of COVID-19, all of which could influence future trends.
