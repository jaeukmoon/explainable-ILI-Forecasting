First, virologic surveillance is conducted to monitor the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories. During week 29, 0.7% of specimens tested positive for influenza, with influenza A accounting for 92.9% of positive specimens and influenza B accounting for 7.1%.
Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance tracks visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) and captures respiratory illness visits due to any pathogen that can present with similar symptoms to ILI. During week 29, 1.6% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus cough or sore throat.
Geographic activity of ILI varies, with some regions experiencing higher ILI activity than others. The ILI activity map for week 29 shows moderate activity in one state, low activity in four states, and minimal activity in 50 states.
The geographic spread of influenza, as assessed by state and territorial epidemiologists, indicates local or sporadic activity in most areas. Four states reported local flu activity, while the rest reported sporadic activity or no flu activity.
Severe disease indicators such as hospitalizations and mortality rates provide insights into the impact of influenza. The flu hospitalization surveillance network (FluSurv-NET) monitors laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations, and data for the 2021-2022 season is still being updated. As for mortality, during week 29, 9.8% of deaths were due to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19, above the epidemic threshold.
Regarding pediatric mortality, one influenza-associated pediatric death was reported during week 29, bringing the total for the 2021-2022 season to 33.
Overall, CDC expects flu activity to remain low but cautions that it can increase in the coming weeks. The agency emphasizes the importance of flu vaccination and antiviral treatment to prevent and manage influenza illness.
