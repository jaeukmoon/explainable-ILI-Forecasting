First, it is noted that seasonal influenza activity remains low nationally. The percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories remained stable compared to the previous week, with 1.1% of specimens testing positive. In terms of the circulating viruses, influenza A(H1N1) viruses were most frequently reported in public health laboratories.

Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance showed that 2.2% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness, which is below the national baseline of 2.9%. The activity map indicates that most jurisdictions reported minimal activity, with one jurisdiction experiencing moderate activity.

FluSurv-NET data indicated a low hospitalization rate for laboratory-confirmed influenza, and the NCHS mortality surveillance data showed that the percentage of deaths due to pneumonia and influenza remained stable and below the epidemic threshold.

There were no reported influenza-associated pediatric deaths during the 2023-2024 season, and only one influenza-associated pediatric death from the previous season was reported.

It is recommended that everyone 6 months and older get an annual influenza vaccine, and there are antiviral drugs available for treatment.

These surveillance components, along with virus characterization, provide important insights into influenza activity and help guide public health recommendations and interventions.
