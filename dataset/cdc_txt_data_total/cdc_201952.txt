Geographic Spread
The number of jurisdictions reporting regional orwidespread inﬂuenza activity increased to 50 thisweek compared to 48 last week.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsThe overall hospitalization ratefor the season increased to 9.2per 100,000. This is similar towhat has been seen at this timeduring recent seasons.
P&I MortalityThe percentage of deathsattributed to pneumonia andinﬂuenza is 5.5% which is belowthe epidemic threshold.
Pediatric DeathsFive new inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric deaths occurring duringthe 2019-2020 season werereported this week. The total forthe season is 27.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive.U.S. Virologic SurveillanceClinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below. Data from clinical laboratories(the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for inﬂuenza) are used to monitor whether inﬂuenza activity isincreasing or decreasing.Week 52Week 52Data Cumulative since Data Cumulative since September 29, 2019September 29, 2019(week 40)(week 40)No. of specimens testedNo. of specimens tested45,749450,253No. of positive specimens (%)No. of positive specimens (%)12,016 (26.3%)55,251 (12.3%)Positive specimens by typePositive specimens by type      Inﬂuenza A    Inﬂuenza A3,859 (32.1%)16,247 (29.4%)    Inﬂuenza B    Inﬂuenza B8,157 (67.9%)39,004 (70.6%)Key PointsKey PointsInﬂuenza activity is high nationally with outpatient visits for ILI and the percentage of respiratory specimenstesting positive for inﬂuenza at levels similar to what have been seen at the peak of recent seasons. However, thisweek’s data may in part be inﬂuenced by changes in healthcare seeking behavior that can occur during theholidays.Inﬂuenza B/Victoria viruses are predominant nationally, which is unusual for this time of year. A(H1N1)pdm09viruses are the next most common. A(H3N2) and B/Yamagata viruses are circulating at very low levels.CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 6.4 million ﬂu illnesses, 55,000 hospitalizations and2,900 deaths from ﬂu.It’s not too late to get vaccinated. Flu vaccination is always the best way to prevent ﬂu and its potentially seriouscomplications.Antiviral medications are an important adjunct to ﬂu vaccine in the control of inﬂuenza. Almost all (>99%) of theinﬂuenza viruses tested this season are susceptible to the four FDA-approved inﬂuenza antiviral medicationsrecommended for use in the U.S. this season.

The predominant virus varies by region. Regional and state level data about circulatinginﬂuenza viruses can be found on FluView Interactive. The predominant virus also varies by age group. Nationally,inﬂuenza B/Victoria viruses are the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among children age 0-4 years (48% ofreported viruses) and 5-24 years (59% of reported viruses), while A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are the most commonlyreported inﬂuenza viruses among persons 25-64 years (42% of reported viruses) and 65 years of age and older (43% ofreported viruses). Additional age data can be found on FluView Interactive.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatinginﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionarychanges that continually occur in circulating inﬂuenza. CDC also tests susceptibility of inﬂuenza viruses to antiviralmedications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonucleaseinhibitor baloxavir.CDC genetically characterizedgenetically characterized 714 inﬂuenza viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29, 2019, to December 28,2019.VirusVirusSubtype orSubtype orLineageLineageGenetic CharacterizationGenetic CharacterizationTotal No. ofTotal No. ofSubtype/LineageSubtype/LineageTestedTested                CladeCladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)                SubcladeSubcladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)A/H1A/H12056B.1A205 (100%)A/H3A/H31893C.2a189 (100%)2a1189 (100%)    2a20      2a302a403C.3a03a0B/VictoriaB/Victoria295V1A295 (100%)V1A0V1A.131 (10.5%)V1A.3264 (89.5%)B/YamagataB/Yamagata25Y325 (100%)CDC antigenically characterizesantigenically characterizes a subset of inﬂuenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or neutralizationbased Focus Reduction assays (FRA).

This percentage is above the national baseline of 2.4%. Theincrease in the percentage of patient visits for ILI during week 52 compared to week 51 may be inﬂuenced in part by areduction in routine healthcare visits surrounding the holidays occurring during week 52 as has occurred during previousseasons.

The overall hospitalization rate was 9.2 per 100,000 population. The highest rateof hospitalization was among adults aged ≥65 (19.9 per 100,000 population), followed by children aged 0-4 (17.8 per100,000 population) and adults aged 50-64 (10.0 per 100,000 population). Among 2,667 hospitalizations, 1,374 (51.5%)were associated with inﬂuenza A virus, 1,274 (47.8%) with inﬂuenza B virus, 10 (0.4%) with inﬂuenza A virus and inﬂuenzaB virus co-infection, and 9 (0.3%) with inﬂuenza virus for which the type was not determined. Among those with inﬂuenzaA subtype information, 259 (80.7%) were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 62 (19.3%) were A(H3N2) viruses.
