According to the CDC's weekly influenza surveillance report, the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence are as follows:

1. Seasonal influenza activity is increasing in most parts of the country, especially in the South Central, Southeast, Mountain, and West Coast regions.
2. Influenza A viruses, including H1N1pdm09 and H3N2, were the most frequently reported strains.
3. ILI activity is above the national baseline, with an increase in outpatient visits for respiratory illness.
4. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, contributing to ILI activity.
5. The hospitalization rate for laboratory-confirmed influenza is increasing, especially among adults aged 65 years and older.
6. The majority of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza are below the epidemic threshold.
7. No pediatric deaths associated with influenza have been reported for the current season.
