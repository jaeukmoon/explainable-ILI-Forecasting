1. Nationwide influenza activity remains low, with 0.9% of clinical lab specimens testing positive for influenza.
2. Public health labs reported 67.2% of viruses as Influenza A and 32.8% as Influenza B; 58.8% of Influenza A viruses were A(H3N2).
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness were 2.3%, below the national baseline of 2.5% and stable compared to the previous week.
4. Four influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported, bringing the season total to 138.
5. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza remains elevated at 60.8 per 100,000 population, with adults aged 65+ most affected.
6. PIC (pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19) deaths accounted for 8.3% of all deaths, above the epidemic threshold of 7.1%.
7. 67.2% of public health lab-detected viruses were Influenza A, while 38.3% of clinical lab-detected viruses were Influenza B.
8. All tested influenza viruses remain susceptible to the antivirals oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and baloxavir.
9. Influenza vaccination is still recommended, with the current vaccine covering the majority of circulating strains.
10. Other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, continue to co-circulate, affecting ILI assessment.

11. Summary of trends: Influenza activity is stable but tracking below baseline, with low hospitalization rates and ongoing PIC mortality slightly elevated. Vaccination and antiviral efficacy remain strong indicators for containment.
