Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map
The number of jurisdictions experiencing high ILI activity decreased from 43 last week to 40 this week.
Geographic Spread
The number of jurisdictions reporting regional or widespread inﬂuenza activity remained at 50 this week.Severe DiseaseHospitalizationsThe overall cumulative hospitalization rate for the season increased to 65.1 per 100,000.
P&I MortalityThe percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and inﬂuenza is 7.1%, below the epidemic threshold of 7.3%.
Pediatric Deaths5 inﬂuenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2019-2020 season were reported this week. The total forthe season is 149.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive.Key PointsKey PointsNationally, the percent of specimens testing positive for inﬂuenza at clinical laboratories continued to decreasewhile ILI activity increased for the second week in a row after declining for three weeks. Due to the ongoingCOVID-19 pandemic, more people may be seeking care for respiratory illness than usual at this time.Nationally, inﬂuenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are now the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses this season.Previously, inﬂuenza B/Victoria viruses predominated nationally.Laboratory conﬁrmed inﬂuenza-associated hospitalization rates for the U.S. population overall remain moderatecompared to recent seasons, but rates for children 0-4 years and adults 18-49 years are now the highest CDC hason record for these age groups, surpassing rates reported during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.  Hospitalization ratesfor school-aged children (5-17 years) are higher than any recent regular season but remain lower than ratesexperienced by this age group during the pandemic.Pneumonia and inﬂuenza mortality levels have been low, but 149 inﬂuenza-associated deaths in children havebeen reported so far this season. This number is higher than recorded at the same time in every season sincereporting began in 2004-05, except for the 2009 pandemic.CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 38 million ﬂu illnesses, 390,000 hospitalizationsand 23,000 deaths from ﬂu.Antiviral medications are an important adjunct to ﬂu vaccine in the control of inﬂuenza. Almost all (>99%) of theinﬂuenza viruses tested this season are susceptible to the four FDA-approved inﬂuenza antiviral medicationsrecommended for use in the U.S. this season.U.S. Virologic SurveillanceClinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

For theseason, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are the predominant virus nationally. Regional and state level data about circulatinginﬂuenza viruses can be found on FluView Interactive.The predominant virus also varies by age group. Nationally, for the season overall, inﬂuenza B viruses are the mostcommonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among persons 5-24 years, while inﬂuenza A viruses are the most commonlyreported inﬂuenza viruses among persons 0-4 years and 25 years and older. In the most recent three weeks, inﬂuenza Aviruses are the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses in all age groups.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatinginﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionarychanges that continually occur in circulating inﬂuenza viruses. Antigenic characterization data are based on an animalmodel (inﬂuenza-naive ferrets), and do not reﬂect pre-existing protection provided by past inﬂuenza infections andvaccinations. Additional antigenic characterization studies involving people vaccinated with current inﬂuenza vaccines areconducted later in the season; these data account for pre-existing protection in diﬀerent populations against circulatinginﬂuenza viruses. Genetic and antigenic characterization data are not used to make calculations about vaccineeﬀectiveness (VE). CDC conducts VE studies each year to measure the beneﬁts of ﬂu vaccines in people. Interim estimatesof 2019-2020 ﬂu vaccine eﬀectiveness have been released.CDC genetically characterizedgenetically characterized 2,224 inﬂuenza viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29, 2019, to March 14,2020.VirusVirusSubtype orSubtype orLineageLineageGenetic CharacterizationGenetic CharacterizationTotal No. ofTotal No. ofSubtype/LineageSubtype/LineageTestedTested                CladeCladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)                SubcladeSubcladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)A/H1A/H17866B.1A786 (100%)A/H3A/H34833C.2a454 (94.0%)2a1454 (94.0%)    2a20      2a302a403C.3a29 (6.0%)3a29 (6.0%)B/VictoriaB/Victoria869V1A869 (100%)V1A0V1A.157 (6.6%)V1A.3812 (93.4%)B/YamagataB/Yamagata86Y386 (100%)CDC antigenically characterizesantigenically characterizes a subset of inﬂuenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or neutralizationbased Focus Reduction assays (FRA). Antigenic drift is evaluated by comparing antigenic properties of cell-propagatedreference viruses representing currently recommended vaccine components with those of cell-propagated circulatingviruses. CDC antigenically characterized 446 inﬂuenza viruses collected in the United States from September 29, 2019, toMarch 14, 2020. These data are not used to make calculations about vaccine eﬀectiveness (VE).

The decrease in the percent of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses similar toA/Brisbane/02/2018 is due to some of the recent viruses selected for testing having a single amino acid change thatis antigenically distinguishable in antigenic assays using ferret sera. Similar viruses were observed last season as welland these represented a small proportion of virus circulating. We have observed an increase in the proportion ofH1N1pdm09 viruses with this change late in the US season.A (H3N2):A (H3N2): 76 A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by FRA with ferret antisera, and 31 (40.8%) wereantigenically similar to cell-propagated A/Kansas/14/2017-like reference viruses representing the A(H3N2)component for the 2019-20 Northern Hemisphere inﬂuenza vaccines.Inﬂuenza B VirusesInﬂuenza B VirusesB/Victoria:B/Victoria: 165 B/Victoria lineage viruses, including viruses from both co-circulating sub-clades, were antigenicallycharacterized by HI with ferret antisera, and 106 (64.2%) were antigenically similar to cell-propagatedB/Colorado/06/2017-like reference viruses representing the B/Victoria component for the 2019-20 NorthernHemisphere inﬂuenza vaccines.B/Yamagata:B/Yamagata: 28 B/Yamagata lineage viruses were antigenically characterized by HI with ferret antisera, and all 28(100%) were antigenically similar to cell-propagated B/Phuket/3073/2013-like reference viruses representing theB/Yamagata component for the 2019-20 Northern Hemisphere inﬂuenza vaccines.CDC also assesses susceptibility of inﬂuenza viruses to the antiviral medicationssusceptibility of inﬂuenza viruses to the antiviral medications including the neuraminidaseinhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using next generationsequence analysis supplemented by laboratory assays.

Four A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses showed highlyreduced inhibition to oseltamivir and peramivir while showing normal inhibition to zanamivir. In addition, one B/Victoria virus showed highly reduced inhibitionto peramivir and reduced inhibition to oseltamivir and zanamivir, while another inﬂuenza B/Victoria virus showed reduced inhibition to zanamivir.A total of 556 additional viruses (211 A(H1N1)pdm09, 32 A(H3N2), and 313 B) collected in Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Illinois,Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia andWisconsin were analyzed for resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors by pyrosequencing assay. Three (1.4%) of the 211A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested had the H275Y amino acid substitution in the neuraminidase and showed highly reducedinhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir. No molecular markers associated with reduced or highly reduced inhibition byneuraminidase inhibitors were detected in A(H3N2) and type B viruses tested.Outpatient Illness SurveillanceILINetNationwide during week 11, 5.8% of patient visits reported through the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-like Illness SurveillanceNetwork (ILINet) were due to inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI). This percentage is above the national baseline of 2.4%.

*Data collected in ILINet may disproportionally represent certain populations within a state, and therefore, may not accurately depict the full picture ofinﬂuenza activity for the whole state. Diﬀerences in the data presented here by CDC and independently by some state health departments likely representdiﬀering levels of data completeness with data presented by the state likely being the more complete.Among the 40 jurisdictions with high ILI activity, ILI increased relative to the previous week in 26, remained stable in 10and declined in 4. Thirty-ﬁve of the jurisdictions with high ILI activity also had clinical laboratory data available and inthose, the percent of specimens testing positive for inﬂuenza decreased in 30, remained stable in 4 and increased in only1.Additional information about medically attended visits for ILI for current and past seasons:Additional information about medically attended visits for ILI for current and past seasons: Surveillance Methods | FluView Interactive: National, Regional, and State Data or ILI Activity MapGeographic Spread of Inﬂuenza as Assessed by State andTerritorial EpidemiologistsThe inﬂuenza activity reported by state and territorial epidemiologists indicates geographic spread of inﬂuenza virusesbut does not measure the severity of inﬂuenza activity.During week 11, the following inﬂuenza activity was reported:Widespread – Puerto Rico and 47 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut,Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland,Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, NewMexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, SouthCarolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin)Regional – two states (Minnesota and Wyoming)Local – the District of Columbia and one state (Hawaii)Sporadic – the U.S. Virgin IslandsGuam did not report.A Weekly Inﬂuenza Surveillance Report Prepared by the Inﬂuenza DivisionWeekly Inﬂuenza Activity Estimates Reported by State and Territorial Epidemiologists*<< Play Pause >>WeeksWeek Ending Mar 14, 2020 - Week 11
