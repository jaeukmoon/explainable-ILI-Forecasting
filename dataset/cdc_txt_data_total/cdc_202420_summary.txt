During Week 20, seasonal influenza activity remained low nationally. The percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories remained stable at 2.0%. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B viruses were all co-circulating during this week. The genetic and antigenic characterization of the influenza viruses will be updated in the future when sufficient numbers of specimens have been tested. Outpatient respiratory illness visits accounted for 2.0% of patient visits, which is below the national baseline. The geographic spread of influenza varied, with two jurisdictions experiencing moderate ILI activity and the majority reporting minimal activity. Hospitalization rates and mortality rates from pneumonia and influenza were below epidemic thresholds. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported for the current season. CDC expects flu activity to remain low but anticipates an increase in the coming weeks. Vaccination and antiviral drugs are recommended for prevention and treatment of influenza.
