Inﬂuenza (Flu)Weekly U.S. Inﬂuenza Surveillance Report
Key Updates for Week 40 ending October 5, 2019According to this week’s FluView report, seasonal inﬂuenza activity remains low in the United States.According to this week’s FluView report, seasonal inﬂuenza activity remains low in the United States.Viruses
Clinical Lab3.1% of respiratory specimenstested in clinical laboratorieswere positive for inﬂuenzaviruses. This is approximately thesame as the previous week.
Public Health LabInﬂuenza A virusespredominated this week withequal numbers of (H3N2) and(H1N1)pdm09 viruses reported.
Virus CharacterizationInﬂuenza virus characterizationinformation will be updatedweekly starting later this season.
Illness
Outpatient Illness: ILINet1.4% of visits to a health care provider were for ILI. ILI activity remains below the national baseline of 2.4% butincreased slightly from the previous week.Outpatient Illness: ILI Activity Map
The majority of jurisdictions experienced minimal ILIactivity; however, Louisiana experienced moderate ILIactivity.
Geographic Spread
4 out of 53 jurisdictions reported local ﬂu activity; theremainder reported sporadic or no ﬂu activity.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsHospitalization rates will beupdated weekly starting later thisseason.
P&I Mortality5.0 % of deaths were attributedto pneumonia and inﬂuenza(P&I).  This is below the epidemicthreshold of 5.6%.
Pediatric DeathsNo inﬂuenza-associated pediatricdeaths occurring during the2019-20 season have beenreported to CDC. 138 pediatricdeaths occurring during the2018-2019 season have beenreported.
All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.An overview of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent, is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm.Key Messages from CDCKey Messages from CDCCDC expects ﬂu activity to remain low but increase in the coming weeks.An annual ﬂu vaccine is the best way to protect against inﬂuenza and its potentially serious complications.CDC recommends everyone 6 months or older gets a ﬂu vaccine by the end of October.There also are ﬂu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat ﬂu illness.U.S. Virologic Surveillance:The results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.  Data from clinical laboratories(the percent of specimens tested that are positive for inﬂuenza) are used to monitor whether inﬂuenza activity isincreasing or decreasing.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatinginﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionarychanges that continually occur in inﬂuenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of inﬂuenza virusesto antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PAendonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated weekly starting later this season when suﬃcient numbers of specimens havebeen tested.Outpatient Illness Surveillance:Nationwide during week 40, 1.4% of patient visits reported through the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-like Illness SurveillanceNetwork (ILINet) were due to inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI). This percentage is below the national baseline of 2.4%. (ILI isdeﬁned as fever (temperature of 100°F [37.8°C] or greater) and cough and/or sore throat.)On a regional level, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 0.8% to 2.2% during week 40. All regionsreported a percentage of outpatient visits for ILI below their region-speciﬁc baselines
