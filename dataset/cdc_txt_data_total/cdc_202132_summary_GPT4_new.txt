Week32, 2021
1. Influenza activity remains low nationwide, with 2.1% of outpatient visits due to ILI and only one region above the baseline of 2.6%, suggesting increased circulation of other respiratory viruses.
2. Two human infections with novel Influenza A(H1N2)v were reported in Wisconsin, both linked to swine exposure at a county fair, with no human-to-human transmission detected.
3. Outpatient ILI visits have increased over the past four weeks for all age groups, with significant rises among individuals aged 5–24 in week 32.
4. Pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) deaths accounted for 14.6% of mortalities, primarily due to COVID-19, with flu-related deaths minimal.
5. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported in week 32; only one pediatric death has been reported for the 2020–2021 season.
6. Flu vaccination trends were not explicitly indicated in the report; CDC emphasizes routine annual influenza vaccination.
7. National virologic surveillance shows very low influenza virus activity, with minimal positive specimen detections from clinical and public health labs.
8. Healthcare-seeking behaviors continue to affect ILI surveillance due to COVID-19-related alternative care settings and overlapping symptoms.
9. Future flu activity might increase if other respiratory viruses continue to spread in parallel with novel influenza variants reported in isolated human cases.
10. Continued monitoring of swine-related influenza and cross-pathogen impacts, as well as changes in healthcare access, are critical for predicting future trends.
