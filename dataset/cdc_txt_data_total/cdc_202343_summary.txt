During Week 43, seasonal influenza activity remained low nationally but slightly increased in most parts of the country. The clinical lab positivity rate for influenza was 1.9%, with influenza A viruses predominating. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness (ILI) were at 2.7%, below the national baseline of 2.9%. Hospitalizations due to influenza were low but increasing, with a cumulative hospitalization rate of 0.8 per 100,000 population. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza was 0.06%, below the epidemic threshold. Three pediatric deaths associated with influenza were reported, one in the current season and two from the previous season. Antigenic and genetic characterization of circulating influenza viruses were performed, and susceptibility to antiviral medications will be reported later in the season. The CDC recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older and the use of antiviral drugs for treatment. Additional information on influenza surveillance can be found on the CDC's websites, as well as on international platforms and collaborating centers.
