First, virologic surveillance plays a critical role in monitoring inﬂuenza activity by analyzing the percentage of specimens testing positive for inﬂuenza in clinical laboratories. During the reported period, 0.4% of specimens tested in clinical laboratories were positive for inﬂuenza, with Inﬂuenza A viruses (90.2%) being more prevalent than Inﬂuenza B viruses (9.8%).

Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance tracks the percentage of patient visits for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI) and provides insights into inﬂuenza activity. During the reported period, 1.5% of patient visits reported through the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat.

Geographic spread of inﬂuenza varies across jurisdictions, with different levels of ILI activity reported. Some jurisdictions experienced very high or high ILI activity, while others had minimal or insuﬃcient data.

Hospitalization rates, mortality rates from pneumonia and inﬂuenza (P&I), and pediatric deaths provide insights into severe inﬂuenza disease. During the reported period, the P&I mortality rate was 10.0%, above the epidemic threshold of 5.5%.

Factoring in all these surveillance components, the CDC expects inﬂuenza activity to remain low but increase in the coming weeks. The annual inﬂuenza vaccine is recommended as the best way to protect against inﬂuenza and its complications, and it is recommended for everyone aged 6 months or older by the end of October. Antiviral drugs can also be used to treat inﬂuenza illness.
