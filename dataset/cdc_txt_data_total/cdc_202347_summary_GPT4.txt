- **Viruses, illness, and deaths**: Seasonal influenza activity is increasing nationwide, especially in the South Central, Southeast, Mountain, and West Coast regions. Influenza A(H1N1) is predominant. 0.1% of deaths were attributed to influenza in week 47, with 1,100 influenza-related deaths estimated so far this season. Five pediatric deaths were reported in week 47, increasing the season total to 8.

- **U.S. virologic surveillance**: 6.2% of clinical specimens tested positive for influenza (up from previous weeks). Of clinical lab positives, 75.1% were Influenza A and 24.9% were Influenza B. Among public health lab positives, 82.1% were Influenza A (82.2% A(H1N1) and 17.8% A(H3N2)), and 17.9% were Influenza B.

- **Cumulative hospitalization rate**: The cumulative flu-related hospitalization rate is 3.7 per 100,000 population, the second highest for week 47 since the 2010-2011 season. The highest hospitalization rates are among adults aged 65+ (8.9 per 100,000).

- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza**: Deaths attributed to influenza are stable at 0.1%, slightly trending upward since October.

- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B**: Clinical labs show 75.1% of flu cases are Influenza A and 24.9% are Influenza B. For public health labs, 82.1% are Influenza A (majority A(H1N1)) and 17.9% are Influenza B.

- **Novel influenza virus like COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)**: No novel influenza viruses were reported. Multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, are co-circulating.

- **Vaccination trends**: CDC emphasizes the need for annual flu vaccines, noting they are widely available. Vaccination remains the best preventive measure.

- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits**: Nationwide, 3.9% of outpatient visits were for influenza-like illness (ILI), above the baseline of 2.9% for the fourth consecutive week. Regions 8 (13.2%), 4 (10.3%), and 6 (7.7%) have the highest positivity rates. Ten jurisdictions reported moderate ILI activity, and 13 jurisdictions reported high or very high.

- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC**: CDC anticipates flu activity to continue increasing in the coming weeks, notably in regions above baseline levels.

- **Other key factors**: Influenza B is more prevalent in Regions 4 and 6 (38% of samples) compared to others. Recent pediatric deaths were associated with both Influenza A(H1N1) and Influenza B (unspecified lineage).
