Outpatient Illness: ILINetThe percentage of patient visits to a health care provider for in!uenza-like illness (ILI) in week 20 was 1.3%, remainingstable (±0.1%) compared to week 19. Nationally, ILI remains below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILI surveillance maybe impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.
Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map
During week 20, all jurisdictions experienced minimal ILI activity. ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsFluSurv-NET sites reported acumulative hospitalization rate of0.8 per 100,000 population,which is about one-tenth the rateof the low-severity 2011-12season.
NCHS Mortality9.5% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia, in!uenza, orCOVID-19 (PIC). This is above theepidemic threshold of 6.3%.Currently, the majority of PICdeaths are due to COVID-19.
Pediatric DeathsNo in!uenza-associated pediatricdeaths occurring during the2020-21 season were reported toCDC this week. The total for theseason is one.5/29/21, 1:54 PMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC

CDC also tests susceptibility of in!uenza viruses to antiviral medications including theneuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.CDC genetically characterizedgenetically characterized 10 in!uenza viruses collected in the U.S. from September 27, 2020, to May 22, 2021.In!uenza A VirusesIn!uenza A VirusesA (H1N1A (H1N1)pdm09:)pdm09: 2 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were genetically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene ofthese viruses showed that 1(50%) belonged to the 5A1 subclade of the 6B.1A clade, which is the same subclade asthe 2020-21 NH vaccine candidate, A/Hawaii/70/2019, while the other 1(50%) belonged to the 5B subclade.A (H3N2):A (H3N2): 4 A(H3N2) viruses were genetically characterized.

In addition, health care-seeking behaviors have changeddramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are accessing the health care system in alternative settings,which may or may not be captured as a part of ILINet. Therefore, ILI data, including ILI activity levels, should beinterpreted with caution. It is particularly important at this time to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including thatfrom ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of bothin!uenza and COVID-19 activity.

Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patientvisits for ILI by age group. The percentages of visits for ILI reported in ILINet in week 20 continued to increase for one agegroup (0–4 years) and remained stable (change of ≤0.1%) for the remaining age groups (5–24 years, 25–49 years, 50–64years, and 65 years and older) compared with week 19.
