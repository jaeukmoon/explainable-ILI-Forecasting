The current weekly surveillance report indicates that the United States is experiencing high ILI activity, with very high activity in New York City, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. This is determined by tracking outpatient visits for respiratory illness that includes fever plus a cough or sore throat. The ILI activity level in other areas ranges from high to minimal. It is important to note that ILI activity does not necessary indicate laboratory-confirmed influenza, as it may also capture visits due to other respiratory pathogens causing similar symptoms. This information provides insights into the current flu activity and can help inform public health measures and responses.
