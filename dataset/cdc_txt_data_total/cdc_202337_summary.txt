First, virologic surveillance is conducted through clinical and public health laboratories to monitor the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza. During the reported period, 0.8% of specimens tested positive in clinical laboratories, with Influenza A accounting for 67% and Influenza B for 33% of positive specimens. In public health laboratories, 1.8% of specimens tested positive, with Influenza A accounting for 73.5% and Influenza B for 26.5% of positive specimens.
Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance, specifically through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), monitors visits for influenza-like illness (ILI). During the reported period, ILI accounted for 2.0% of patient visits nationwide, with higher percentages in the age groups of 0-4 years (6.3%) and 5-24 years (3.0%). ILI activity levels varied across states/jurisdictions, with minimal activity reported in the majority of areas.
Hospitalization surveillance, conducted through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), provides data on laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations. However, no data specific to hospitalizations were reported during the specified period.
Mortality surveillance, based on data from the National Center for Health Statistics, indicated that 7.6% of deaths during the reported week were due to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19. Among the deaths, 615 had COVID-19 listed as an underlying or contributing cause, while 13 were associated with influenza.
Regarding pediatric mortality, two influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during the current season, bringing the total for the season to 176 deaths.
Overall, the data show that influenza activity remains low during the reported period, with low ILI activity and a low percentage of positive influenza specimens. However, it's important to note that the data are preliminary and subject to change as more reports are received.
