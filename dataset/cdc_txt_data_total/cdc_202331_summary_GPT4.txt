Week31, 2023
- **Viruses, illness, and deaths:** Overall influenza activity remains low. For week 31, 1.0% of clinical specimens tested positive for influenza, with Influenza A accounting for 55.9% and Influenza B for 44.1%. Among deaths, 5.9% were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC), surpassing the epidemic threshold of 5.6%. Of the 1,295 PIC deaths, 12 were due to influenza, and 262 to COVID-19. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported this week; a cumulative total of 166 pediatric deaths have been reported for the 2022-2023 season.

- **U.S. virologic surveillance:** Public health labs detected 64.0% of positive specimens as Influenza A, with 88.9% being H1N1pdm09 and 11.1% H3N2. Influenza B made up 36.0%, exclusively from the Victoria lineage. Out of all cumulative cases since week 40, 97.4% of detections were Influenza A and 2.6% were Influenza B. 

- **Cumulative hospitalization rate:** Hospitalization data remain preliminary; 638 patients with lab-confirmed influenza were admitted to hospitals during week 31.

- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza:** Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 rose above the epidemic threshold. Influenza remains a minor contributor to overall PIC deaths.

- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B:** For week 31, clinical labs reported Influenza A accounting for 55.9% and Influenza B for 44.1%. Public health labs reported 64.0% Influenza A and 36.0% Influenza B.

- **Novel influenza virus (like COVID-19):** No novel influenza viruses or variant cases (e.g., H3N2v) were reported this week. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating and contributing to illness.

- **Vaccination trends:** No updates on current vaccination trends for this week were provided.

- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits:** 1.1% of outpatient visits nationwide were for ILI, below baseline levels, with the highest proportion among children 0-4 years old (4.1%). ILI activity is predominately minimal across most regions, with 53 jurisdictions and 625 CBSAs reporting minimal activity.

- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC:** Influenza activity is expected to remain low but could vary regionally due to multiple respiratory viruses.

- **Other key factors:** Minimal ILI activity levels nationwide suggest low flu transmission; notable circulation of other respiratory pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 could contribute to PIC mortality rates exceeding the epidemic threshold.
