Week40, 2023
1. Influenza activity remains low nationally, with 1.1% of specimens testing positive in clinical labs and 2.2% of outpatient visits for respiratory illness reported this week, both below baseline levels.
2. Public health labs reported 58 positive specimens; 86.2% were Influenza A (90.9% subtype H1N1) and 13.8% were Influenza B (100% Victoria lineage).
3. The cumulative hospitalization rate is 0.1 per 100,000, with 1,127 hospitalized cases reported this week—an increase from the previous week.
4. Deaths attributed to influenza were stable this week at 0.05% of total deaths.
5. Influenza A accounted for 60.4% of positive specimens in clinical labs, while Influenza B accounted for 39.6%.
6. No novel influenza virus detections were reported, and COVID-19 and RSV continue to co-circulate with influenza.
7. CDC strongly recommends flu vaccination by the end of October; no specific increases in vaccination trends were observed this week.
8. Outpatient respiratory illness saw slight increases in two age groups (0–4 years and 5–24 years) and remained stable in others.
9. Moderate influenza activity was reported in one jurisdiction, while no jurisdictions experienced high or very high activity.
10. Integrated monitoring of influenza, COVID-19, and RSV, along with detailed genetic and antigenic characterization of viruses, aids in predicting evolutionary changes and future activity.
