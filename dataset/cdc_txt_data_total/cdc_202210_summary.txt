Based on the CDC's weekly influenza surveillance report for Week 10 ending March 12, 2022, the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence are:

1. Influenza activity is increasing in most of the country, particularly in the central and south-central regions.

2. The majority of detected influenza viruses are influenza A(H3N2).

3. Antigenic data show that the majority of characterized H3N2 viruses are antigenically different from the vaccine reference viruses.

4. The percentage of outpatient visits for respiratory illness, including ILI, increased slightly but remains below baseline.

5. Influenza is contributing to respiratory illness, but other respiratory viruses are also circulating.

6. Hospital admissions for laboratory-confirmed influenza have been increasing each week.

7. The cumulative hospitalization rate is higher than the rate for the previous season but lower than rates seen in seasons preceding the COVID-19 pandemic.

8. Three influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during Week 10, bringing the total for the season to 13.

9. Mortality surveillance data show that 10.8% of deaths during Week 10 were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19, above the epidemic threshold.

10. Influenza virus susceptibility to antiviral medications is assessed, and antiviral resistance to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persists.

These facts provide important information for predicting future ILI occurrence and guide public health recommendations, including the importance of vaccination and antiviral treatment.
