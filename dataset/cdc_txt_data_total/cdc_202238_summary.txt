First, virologic surveillance is performed by clinical laboratories and public health laboratories to monitor the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza and the distribution of influenza virus types and subtypes. During the reported period, 1.3% of specimens tested positive for influenza in clinical laboratories, with Influenza A viruses predominating. In public health laboratories, 90.4% of positive specimens were Influenza A, with 36.4% being H1N1pdm09 and 63.6% being H3N2.

Outpatient ILI surveillance, conducted through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), tracks the percentage of patient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI). During the reported period, 2.2% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat. The percentage of visits for respiratory illness varied by age group, with the highest percentage among children aged 0-4 years.

Geographic activity is assessed based on ILI activity levels reported by state/jurisdiction and Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA). During the reported period, there were no jurisdictions or CBSAs with very high ILI activity. Moderately high activity was reported in 3 jurisdictions and 13 CBSAs, while low activity was reported in 2 jurisdictions and 29 CBSAs. The majority of jurisdictions reported minimal ILI activity.

Hospitalization surveillance is conducted through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) and HHS Protect. Preliminary data from FluSurv-NET indicated that during the reported period, 31 of 14,528 reporting long-term care facilities reported at least one influenza positive test among their residents. HHS Protect data showed that 739 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza were admitted to the hospital.

Mortality surveillance involves monitoring deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC). Based on NCHS mortality surveillance data, 8.7% of deaths during the reported period were due to PIC, which exceeds the epidemic threshold of 5.6%. It should be noted that the majority of PIC mortality was due to COVID-19 rather than influenza.

No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during the current season. Two influenza-associated pediatric deaths from a previous season were reported during the reported period, both associated with influenza A viruses.

Additional influenza surveillance information is available through FluView Interactive, which provides visual interpretations of influenza data, and from national and international sources such as WHO and public health agencies in various countries.

Overall, the data suggest varying levels of influenza activity across different surveillance components, with low to moderate activity reported in some jurisdictions and minimal activity in others. It is important to continue monitoring these surveillance measures to predict future influenza occurrence and inform public health interventions.
