Week25, 2023
- **Viruses, Illness, and Deaths**: Seasonal influenza activity remains low, with 1.0% of respiratory specimens testing positive during week 25. 6.2% of overall deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), slightly above the epidemic threshold of 5.9%. Eight deaths were linked to influenza. One pediatric death, associated with influenza B/Victoria, occurred in week 21, bringing the season total to 160 pediatric deaths.  
- **U.S. Virologic Surveillance**: Clinical labs reported 58.4% of positive specimens as Influenza A and 41.6% as Influenza B. Public health labs reported 85.7% of positive specimens as Influenza A (100% H1N1pdm09) and 14.3% as Influenza B (100% Victoria lineage).  
- **Cumulative Hospitalization Rate**: No new hospitalization data for FluSurv-NET; HHS Protect reported 768 laboratory-confirmed influenza hospital admissions during week 25.  
- **Trends of Deaths Attributed to Influenza**: A total of eight deaths in week 25 were linked to influenza. PIC deaths increased slightly above the epidemic threshold.  
- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B**: Influenza A accounted for 58.4% (clinical labs) and 85.7% (public health labs), and Influenza B for 41.6% (clinical labs) and 14.3% (public health labs).  
- **Novel Influenza Virus (Like COVID-19)**: No reports of novel influenza viruses, including variants, for week 25.  
- **Vaccination Trends**: No specific updates on vaccination trends included for this week.  
- **Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits**: 1.4% of outpatient visits were for ILI nationwide. ILI visits by age: 4.8% (0-4 years), 2.2% (5-24 years), 1.3% (25-49 years), 0.8% (50-64 years), and 0.6% (65+ years). Most jurisdictions (49) reported minimal ILI activity.  
- **Expectation of Flu Activity from CDC**: Influenza activity is low, with multiple respiratory viruses co-circulating.  
- **Other Key Factors**: No jurisdictions reported very high ILI activity. Minimal activity was widespread, with only a few states (e.g., Puerto Rico) reporting moderate or high activity. Substantial co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens, including RSV and COVID-19, may impact future ILI trends.
