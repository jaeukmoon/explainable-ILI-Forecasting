1. Seasonal influenza activity remains low nationally, with 0.4% of clinical lab specimens testing positive, and Influenza A accounting for 85.7% of positive results while Influenza B contributed 14.3%.
2. Public health labs noted 55 positive specimens, predominantly Influenza A (96.4%), with subtypes H1N1 (61.7%) and H3N2 (38.3%) dominating; all Influenza B positives (3.6%) were Victoria lineage.
3. Outpatient respiratory illness visits were at 1.8%, below the national baseline, with increases among ages 0–24 years but stable across other groups.
4. There were no new influenza-associated hospitalizations reported this week (0.0 per 100,000), and cumulative hospitalizations remain largely Influenza A-related (84.6%).
5. Influenza-attributed deaths accounted for 0.06% of total deaths, and one pediatric death associated with Influenza A(H3) was reported, bringing the season total to 195.
6. No new human cases of novel Influenza A viruses were detected this week, although ongoing H5N1 monitoring continues due to animal outbreaks and occupational exposures.

8. Vaccinations continue to be recommended, with no detailed vaccination coverage data reported in this summary.
9. Antiviral resistance remains rare; high levels of resistance to adamantanes persist, making them ineffective against Influenza A.
