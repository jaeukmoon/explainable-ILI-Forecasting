First, the virologic surveillance system tracks the percentage of respiratory specimens that test positive for influenza in clinical laboratories. During Week 34, 0.8% of specimens tested positive for influenza, with Influenza A accounting for 63.9% of positive specimens and Influenza B accounting for 36.1%.
Second, the outpatient respiratory illness surveillance system monitors the percentage of patient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) in outpatient healthcare settings. During Week 34, 1.7% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI.
Third, the geographic spread of influenza activity varies across jurisdictions. During Week 34, there were no jurisdictions with very high or high ILI activity levels. One jurisdiction had moderate activity levels, six jurisdictions had low activity levels, and 45 jurisdictions had minimal activity levels.
Fourth, hospitalization surveillance through the FluSurv-NET system provides data on laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in select counties. This data is currently not available for the 2022-2023 season.
Fifth, mortality surveillance tracks the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC). During Week 34, 6.5% of deaths were due to PIC, above the epidemic threshold of 5.5%.
Lastly, there were no influenza-associated pediatric deaths reported during Week 34. During the 2022-2023 season, a total of 172 influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported.
These surveillance systems play a crucial role in monitoring and predicting future influenza activity and informing public health interventions.
