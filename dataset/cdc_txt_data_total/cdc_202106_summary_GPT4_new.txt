1. Influenza activity remains unusually low, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive nationwide this week.
2. Of the 14 positive specimens reported by clinical labs, 14.3% were Influenza A and 85.7% were Influenza B.
3. Public health labs reported three positive specimens: 33.3% Influenza A and 66.7% Influenza B (one Victoria subtype).
4. Outpatient visits for ILI accounted for 1.1% of visits, stable from last week and below the baseline of 2.6%.
5. Cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza are 0.6 per 100,000, the lowest recorded since 2005 for this time of year.
6. 22.3% of deaths were attributed to PIC (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19), well above the epidemic threshold, primarily due to COVID-19.
7. No new influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported; the season's total remains one.
8. CDC emphasizes annual influenza vaccination; no updates on vaccination rates were provided.
9. ILI trends are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with altered healthcare-seeking behaviors limiting reliable data analysis.
10. Nationwide, all jurisdictions reported minimal ILI activity, with ongoing uncertainty about future flu activity due to pandemic influences.

11. Summary of factors useful for prediction: Minimal influenza activity, low hospitalization rates, dominant Influenza B detections, and COVID-19 disruptions to surveillance and healthcare trends suggest continued atypical flu trends.
