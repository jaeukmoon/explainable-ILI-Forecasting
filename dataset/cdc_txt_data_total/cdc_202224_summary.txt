Based on the provided information, here are the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence:

1. Virologic surveillance in clinical and public health laboratories tracks the percentage of positive respiratory specimens for influenza and monitors the distribution of influenza virus types and subtypes.

2. Outpatient ILI surveillance monitors the percentage of healthcare visits for ILI and compares it to national baselines to determine influenza activity.

3. Geographic activity varies, with some jurisdictions experiencing moderate ILI activity while others have minimal or no activity.

4. The geographic spread of influenza is monitored, with reports of local or sporadic flu activity in certain jurisdictions.

5. Severe disease indicators, such as hospitalization rates, mortality rates from pneumonia and influenza, and pediatric deaths, are important for understanding the impact of the flu.

6. Virus characterization provides information on the genetic and antigenic properties of circulating viruses and their susceptibility to antiviral medications.

7. Long-term care facility surveillance tracks influenza virus infections among residents in nursing homes and other care facilities.

8. HHS Protect hospitalization surveillance reports the number of patients admitted with laboratory-confirmed influenza.

9. NCHS mortality surveillance monitors pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 deaths, providing data on the severity of influenza-related outcomes.

10. Influenza-associated pediatric mortality is tracked to identify any influenza-related deaths among children.

11. Additional national and international influenza surveillance information is available from organizations such as WHO and public health agencies in various countries.

These factors, combined with public health recommendations for flu vaccination and antiviral treatment, contribute to predicting and managing future ILI occurrences.
