According to the latest weekly inﬂuenza surveillance report from CDC (Week 16, ending April 24, 2021), the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence are as follows:

1. Virologic Surveillance:
- The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza at clinical laboratories is 0.1% for the reported week.
- The number of influenza positive specimens reported by public health labs remains unusually low.

2. Outpatient Illness Surveillance:
- For the third week in a row, 1.1% of patient visits to a health care provider were for influenza-like illness (ILI).
- Nationally, ILI remains below the national baseline of 2.6%.

3. Geographic Spread:
- All jurisdictions experienced minimal ILI activity during week 16.

4. Severe Disease:
- The current cumulative hospitalization rate for laboratory-confirmed influenza is 0.8 per 100,000 population, which is much lower than average for this point in the season.
- Of the deaths occurring during week 16, 11.8% were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), which is above the epidemic threshold.
- No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported to CDC during week 16.

Overall, seasonal influenza activity remains lower than usual for this time of year, and influenza activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to note that ILI surveillance data should be interpreted with caution due to changes in health care-seeking behaviors and the impact of COVID-19 on ILI presentations.
