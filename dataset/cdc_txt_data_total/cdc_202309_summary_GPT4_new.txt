Week9, 2023
1. Influenza activity remains low nationally, with 0.9% of clinical specimens and 1.4% of public health lab specimens testing positive for influenza.
2. Among clinical lab positives, 70.1% were influenza A and 29.9% were influenza B; public health labs reported 81.8% influenza A and 18.2% influenza B.
3. Influenza A subtypes were 54.9% H3N2 and 45.1% H1N1 in public health lab samples.
4. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) were 2.4%, below the national baseline, and decreased compared to the previous week.
5. Flu hospitalizations totaled 17,565 this season, with a cumulative rate of 60.0 per 100,000 people, decreasing compared to the previous week.
6. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 8.9% of deaths, above the epidemic threshold, with influenza contributing to 22 deaths.
7. Eight pediatric deaths brought the season's total to 125, all involving influenza A, predominantly H3N2.
8. The 2022-2023 flu vaccine remains well-matched to circulating strains; vaccination is recommended as flu activity persists.
9. Antiviral susceptibility testing showed nearly all viruses remain susceptible to oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and baloxavir, with only one exception.
10. CDC predicts influenza activity will remain low, though co-circulation of respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) continues to influence ILI trends.

11. Summary of predictive insights: Influenza A (H3N2) predominance, co-circulating respiratory viruses, stable antiviral effectiveness, vaccination adherence, and ongoing PIC mortality trends may influence future flu patterns.
