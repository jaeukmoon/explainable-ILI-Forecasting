First, virologic surveillance is conducted through clinical and public health laboratories to monitor the presence and distribution of influenza viruses. This includes tracking the percentage of positive specimens and identifying the types and subtypes of influenza viruses circulating.
Outpatient illness surveillance, specifically the ILINet, tracks the percentage of patient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI). The data shows that during the reported period, 0.9% of patient visits were due to ILI, which is below the national baseline of 2.4%.
The ILI activity map provides a state-level measure of ILI activity. During the reported period, Puerto Rico had a high ILI activity level, while most other states had minimal or low activity levels.
Geographic spread of influenza is reported by state and territorial epidemiologists. During the reported period, four states had local flu activity, while the rest reported sporadic activity or no activity.
Other surveillance components, such as hospitalization rates, pneumonia and influenza mortality rates, and pediatric deaths, provide information on the severity and impact of influenza.
Overall, the data suggests that influenza activity is currently low, with minimal ILI activity and low percentages of positive specimens. However, it is important to continue monitoring and following public health recommendations, such as getting vaccinated and using antiviral drugs for treatment.
