P&I Mortality4.8% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia and inﬂuenza(P&I). This is below the epidemicthreshold of 6.4%.
Pediatric DeathsOne new inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric death occurring duringthe 2019-2020 season wasreported to CDC this week. Thetotal for the season to date is 6.
All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods page. Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive.U.S. Virologic SurveillanceClinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

H1N1 virusesare the next most common, followed by H3N2 viruses, which are decreasing in proportion.The ﬂu season is just getting started; elevated ﬂu activity is expected to continue for weeks. It’s not too late to getvaccinated. Flu vaccination is the best way to reduce the risk from ﬂu and its potentially serious complications.

The predominant virusvaries by region. The proportion of inﬂuenza B/Victoria viruses is increasing in some regions, while the proportion ofA(H3N2) viruses is decreasing overall. Regional and state level data about circulating inﬂuenza viruses can be found onFluView Interactive. The predominant virus also varies by age group. Nationally, inﬂuenza B/Victoria viruses are the mostcommonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among children age 0-4 years (46% of reported viruses) and 5-24 years (60% ofreported viruses), while A(H3N2) viruses are the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among persons 65 years ofage and older (54% of reported viruses). Among adults aged 25-64 years, approximately equal proportions of inﬂuenzaA(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria viruses (35% and 34%, respectively) have been reported. Additional age data can be foundon FluView Interactive.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatinginﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionarychanges that continually occur in circulating inﬂuenza. CDC also tests susceptibility of inﬂuenza viruses to antiviralmedications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonucleaseinhibitor baloxavir.CDC genetically characterizedgenetically characterized 299 inﬂuenza viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29, 2019 to November 30,2019.VirusVirusSubtype orSubtype orLineageLineageGenetic CharacterizationGenetic CharacterizationTotal No. ofTotal No. ofSubtype/LineageSubtype/LineageTestedTested                CladeCladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)                SubcladeSubcladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)A/H1A/H1666B.1A66 (100%)A/H3A/H31113C.2a111 (100%)2a1111 (100%)    2a20      2a302a403C.3a03a0B/VictoriaB/Victoria112V1A112 (100%)V1A0V1A.119 (17.0%)V1A.393 (83.0%)B/YamagataB/Yamagata10Y310 (100%)CDC antigenically characterizesantigenically characterizes a subset of inﬂuenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or neutralizationbased Focus Reduction assays (FRA).

The overall hospitalization rate was 2.7 per 100,000 population. The highestrate of hospitalization was among adults aged ≥65 (7.0 per 100,000 population), followed by children aged 0-4 (4.6 per100,000 population) and adults aged 50-64 (2.7 per 100,000 population). Among 784 hospitalizations, 451 (57.5%) wereassociated with inﬂuenza A virus, 325 (41.5%) with inﬂuenza B virus, 4 (0.5%) with inﬂuenza A virus and inﬂuenza B virusco-infection, and 4 (0.5%) with inﬂuenza virus for which the type was not determined. Among those with inﬂuenza Asubtype information, 60 (60.6%) were A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and 39 (39.4%) were A(H3N2).
