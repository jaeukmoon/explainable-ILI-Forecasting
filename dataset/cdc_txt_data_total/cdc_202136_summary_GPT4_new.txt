Week36, 2021
1. Influenza activity remains low nationally, with 2.3% of outpatient respiratory illness visits due to ILI, below the national baseline of 2.6%.
2. Increased ILI activity in three regions (3, 7, and 9) likely reflects the circulation of non-influenza respiratory viruses.
3. Clinical labs reported low influenza circulation, with 0.1% of tested specimens positive for influenza.
4. Public health labs reported limited Influenza A and B viruses, no significant subtype characterization provided.
5. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported this week, and one total pediatric death has been reported for the 2020-21 season.
6. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 21.0%, well above the epidemic threshold of 5.5%, but mainly driven by COVID-19.
7. Current hospitalization rates for flu are unavailable as data for admissions after April 2021 are not included in FluSurv-NET.
8. Vaccine updates were not highlighted, but annual vaccination remains recommended to prevent influenza spread.
9. Healthcare-seeking behavior changes due to COVID-19 create challenges in tracking accurate ILI trends through traditional surveillance systems.
10. CDC indicates future flu activity may vary due to low baseline influenza circulation and ongoing pandemic impacts on healthcare access.

11. Summary of key patterns influencing prediction: Minimal influenza circulation, high respiratory illness from other viruses, pandemic influence on data interpretation, and substantial PIC mortality driven by COVID-19 signal an environment of continued low influenza activity with unpredictable future trends.
