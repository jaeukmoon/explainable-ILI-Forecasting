Week40, 2024
1. Seasonal influenza activity remains low, with 0.7% of clinical specimens testing positive for influenza and stable positivity rates overall, except for a slight increase in Region 10.
2. Of the 380 clinical lab positive specimens, 87.6% were Influenza A and 12.4% Influenza B; all 56 public health lab positives were Influenza A, with 55.8% A(H1N1)pdm09 and 44.2% A(H3N2).
3. Two cases of human infections with Influenza A(H5) were reported; both were dairy farm workers and associated with an ongoing outbreak of avian HPAI A(H5N1) virus.
4. No pediatric deaths from influenza were reported for the 2024-2025 season; influenza caused 0.06% of total deaths for Week 40, a stable trend.
5. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) were 1.9%, stable compared to the previous week and below the national baseline of 3.0%, though showing slight regional variations.
6. Hospitalization rates for influenza were 0.0 per 100,000 population, with 15 confirmed cases reported since the start of October.
7. Genetic and antigenic characterization showed strong alignment of circulating strains with the 2024-2025 vaccine components; resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir was observed in 0.4% of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.
8. Vaccination efforts were emphasized, with recommendations for all individuals aged six months and older to be vaccinated by the end of October.
9. COVID-19, RSV, and other respiratory viruses are contributing to overall respiratory illness levels, complicating the attribution of symptoms solely to influenza.
10. Ongoing surveillance of avian influenza outbreaks in domestic animals and human cases is critical for assessing risks of novel virus transmission.
