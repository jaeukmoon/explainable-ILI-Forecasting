The virologic surveillance conducted by clinical laboratories and public health laboratories provides important information on the prevalence and distribution of influenza viruses. During the reported period, 1.0% of specimens tested positive for influenza in clinical laboratories, with a predominance of Influenza A and Influenza B viruses. In public health laboratories, 33.3% of specimens tested positive for Influenza A and 66.7% tested positive for Influenza B.

Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance, specifically the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), tracks the percentage of patient visits related to influenza-like illness (ILI). During the reported period, 1.6% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. It should be noted that ILI visits can be caused by other respiratory pathogens as well.

Geographic activity of ILI varied across states, with some states experiencing high or moderate ILI activity, while others had low or minimal activity.

Hospitalization surveillance, conducted through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), provides information on laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations. The data for the current season were not provided in the report.

Mortality surveillance, based on National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data, indicated that 6.3% of deaths during the reported week were due to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC). This percentage exceeded the epidemic threshold for the week.

There were three influenza-associated pediatric deaths reported during the reported week, with two associated with Influenza B viruses and one associated with an unidentified Influenza A virus.
