Week19, 2023
1. Influenza activity remains low nationally, with only 1.0% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical labs.
2. Influenza B accounted for 63.4% of clinical lab positives and 55.6% of public health lab positives, with the Victoria lineage comprising all characterized B viruses.
3. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) were stable at 1.9%, below the national baseline of 2.5%, with 9 of 10 HHS regions also below baselines.
4. Cumulative hospitalization rate for the season was 62.6 per 100,000, with the highest rate among adults aged 65+ (186.7 per 100,000).
5. Deaths from pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) were stable at 6.8%, slightly above the epidemic threshold of 6.6%.
6. Two pediatric influenza-associated deaths were reported this week, bringing the season total to 152.
7. Vaccination relevance remains, as most circulating viruses are antigenically similar to strains in the current vaccine. CDC continues to recommend annual flu vaccination.
8. 97.5% of public health lab samples this season were Influenza A, predominated by H3N2 (72.9%), followed by H1N1 (27.1%).
9. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV, complicates interpretation of ILI trends.
10. Flu antiviral susceptibility is unchanged, with over 99.9% of viruses being susceptible to recommended treatments.

11. Summary Insights: Overall, low influenza activity, widespread vaccination effectiveness, and stable ILI trends indicate minimal immediate concern, but the ongoing overlap of SARS-CoV-2 and RSV adds uncertainty to future prediction.
