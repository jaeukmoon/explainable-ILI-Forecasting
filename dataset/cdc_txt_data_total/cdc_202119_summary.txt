Based on the weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report, here are the key facts regarding predicting future ILI (influenza-like illness) occurrence:

1. Virologic surveillance measures the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical labs and analyzes the distribution of influenza virus types and subtypes in public health labs.

2. Outpatient ILI surveillance tracks the percentage of healthcare visits for ILI and compares it to national baselines.

3. Geographic activity provides insights into variations in ILI activity across regions.

4. Severe disease indicators, such as hospitalization rates, mortality rates from pneumonia and influenza (P&I), and pediatric deaths, help understand the impact of the flu.

5. Virus characterization identifies genetic and antigenic properties of circulating viruses and assesses their resistance to antiviral medications.

6. Seasonal trends and comparisons to historical baselines provide context for monitoring flu activity.

7. Public health recommendations, including widespread flu vaccination and the use of antiviral drugs, play a critical role in prevention and response strategies.

8. Current data indicate that flu activity remains low compared to usual levels for this time of year.

9. Data from clinical laboratories show a low percentage (0.1%) of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza.

10. ILI activity remains below the national baseline (1.2% of patient visits) but increased slightly compared to the previous week.

11. The majority of jurisdictions experienced minimal ILI activity, while no inﬂuenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during the week.

12. Geographic spread of influenza, as reported by state and territorial epidemiologists, indicates the spread of viruses but doesn't measure severity.

13. The cumulative hospitalization rate for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations is low (0.8 per 100,000 population).

14. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) exceeds the epidemic threshold.

15. No inﬂuenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during the week, and only one has been reported for the season.

It's important to note that all data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. These facts provide an overview of the current flu activity and the surveillance systems in place to monitor and predict future ILI occurrence.
