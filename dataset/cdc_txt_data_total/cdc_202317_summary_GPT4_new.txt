1. Influenza activity remains low nationwide, with 1.0% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza.
2. Public health labs reported Influenza B as the most frequently detected virus, accounting for 64.0% of cases, while Influenza A made up 36.0% (75.0% H1N1 and 25.0% H3N2 among subtyped Influenza A).
3. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza is 61.9 per 100,000 population; adults 65 and older have the highest rate at 184.3 per 100,000.
4. Respiratory illness visits accounted for 2.0% of outpatient visits, remaining below the national baseline of 2.5%, with minimal activity reported in most jurisdictions.
5. Influenza-associated pediatric deaths increased by four, reaching a cumulative total of 149 for the 2022-23 season.
6. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 7.3% this week, slightly above the epidemic threshold of 6.8%.
7. Genetic and antigenic analysis suggests the majority of circulating influenza viruses are similar to vaccine strains and susceptible to antivirals; however, one A(H1N1) virus displayed reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir.
8. Over 26 million flu illnesses, 290,000 hospitalizations, and 19,000 deaths have occurred so far, with healthcare-seeking impacted by alternative care during the pandemic.
9. Vaccine coverage and trends remain consistent, with CDC emphasizing annual flu vaccination for all individuals aged six months and older.
10. Future flu activity is anticipated to remain low but contingent on the co-circulation of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and evolving healthcare behaviors.
