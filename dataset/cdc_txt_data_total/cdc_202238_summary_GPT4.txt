Week38, 2022
- **Viruses, illness, and deaths**: Influenza activity remains relatively low with 1.3% of clinical specimens testing positive for influenza during week 38. Influenza A constitutes 92.8% of positives, while Influenza B accounts for 7.2%. 8.7% of deaths were due to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC), primarily driven by COVID-19. Two influenza-associated pediatric deaths (Influenza A) were reported this week, bringing the season total to 39.

- **U.S. virologic surveillance**: Clinical labs reported 92.8% Influenza A and 7.2% Influenza B among positive specimens. Public health labs confirmed 90.4% Influenza A (63.6% H3N2, 36.4% H1N1pdm09, and <0.1% H3N2v) and 9.6% Influenza B.

- **Cumulative hospitalization rate**: 739 patients were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza during week 38. Data through June 11, 2022, showed hospitalization rates, but no further cumulative updates were available for this report.

- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza**: Roughly 8.7% of deaths attributed to PIC were above the epidemic threshold of 5.6%, but most deaths were due to COVID-19 rather than influenza.

- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B**: Influenza A accounted for most positive specimens (92.8% clinical labs, 90.4% public health labs), while Influenza B was minimal (7.2% clinical labs, 9.6% public health labs).

- **Novel influenza virus (like COVID-19)**: No novel influenza variants of concern were detected, apart from four H3N2v cases since October 2021. COVID-19 remains a primary driver of PIC mortality.

- **Vaccination trends**: No direct vaccination data was reported. The CDC emphasizes vaccination as the key to flu prevention.

- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits**: ILINet reported 2.2% of outpatient visits for ILI, with highest rates among children aged 0-4 (9.0%) compared to older populations. Multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza, co-circulated.

- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC**: Flu activity appears low but is influenced by various respiratory pathogens. No specific prediction for increases was included in this report.

- **Other key factors**: Only 0.2% of long-term care facilities reported at least one influenza-positive test. Minimal to low outpatient ILI activity was reported in most jurisdictions, with only a few areas observing moderate to high levels. 

Analysis suggests current influenza trends are subdued, with activity influenced by other respiratory pathogens predominantly. Monitoring and vaccination remain critical as the season progresses.
