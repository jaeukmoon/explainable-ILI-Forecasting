First, virologic surveillance is tracking the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories. During the reported week, the percentage was 0.2%, indicating low influenza activity. In public health labs, influenza activity has been low in recent weeks with few positive specimens reported.
Outpatient illness surveillance, specifically the ILINet, shows that 1.5% of patient visits were for influenza-like illness (ILI). This is below the national baseline of 2.6%. However, one of ten surveillance regions reported ILI activity above their region-specific baseline.
Geographic spread of influenza, as assessed by state and territorial epidemiologists, has been suspended for the 2020-21 influenza season due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILI surveillance. Hospitalization rates and pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality rates indicate the severity of influenza-related disease. Hospitalization rates will be updated weekly later in the season, and for P&I mortality, 8.9% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19, above the epidemic threshold.
No influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported in the current season. Virus characterization data, including genetic and antigenic information, will be updated later in the season. The CDC emphasizes the importance of the annual flu vaccine and the use of antiviral drugs for treatment.
These surveillance components are part of the CDC's comprehensive approach to monitor and predict influenza activity in order to inform prevention and response strategies.
