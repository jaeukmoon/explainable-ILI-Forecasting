1. Influenza activity is increasing nationally, with notable rises in the South Central, Southeast, and West Coast regions; 3.0% of clinical lab specimens tested positive for influenza this week.
2. Of the 192 positive public health lab specimens, 77.1% were Influenza A and 22.9% Influenza B. Among subtyped Influenza A specimens, 90.6% were A(H1N1) and 9.4% A(H3N2).
3. Outpatient visits for ILI remain at the national baseline of 2.9%, with increases in Regions 1-6, 8, and 9; Region 9 is at baseline, while Regions 4 and 6 exceed their baselines.
4. Cumulative hospitalization for influenza reached a rate of 1.2 per 100,000, the second highest cumulative rate for this time in recent seasons, with 1,962 admissions reported last week.
5. Deaths due to influenza remained very low at 0.09% this week, unchanged compared to the prior week. One pediatric death linked to Influenza A(H1N1) from the 2022-2023 season was reported.
6. Influenza A comprised 69.8% of clinical lab positives, while Influenza B accounted for 30.2%. The Victoria lineage represented all subtyped Influenza B specimens tested.
7. Vaccination is recommended for everyone aged 6 months and older, but trends in vaccination uptake were not reported this week.
8. Co-circulation of influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 may influence regional ILI trends and disease burden.
9. Increased hospital admissions for influenza suggest a potential rise in flu severity, especially in Regions 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 last week.
10. The CDC anticipates further flu activity increases as surveillance data shows an upward trend across multiple metrics.
