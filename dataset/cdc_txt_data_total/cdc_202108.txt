Outpatient Illness: ILINetDuring week 8, 0.9% of patient visits to a health care provider were for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI), remaining stable(change of ≤0.1%) compared to week 7 (1.0%). National ILI remains below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILIsurveillance may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map
During week 8, all jurisdictions experienced minimal activity. ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsFluSurv-NET sites have reporteda current cumulativehospitalization rate of 0.7 per100,000 population. In 2011-12, alow severity season, the rate was2.3 times higher at this time thatseason.
NCHS Mortality16.4% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia, inﬂuenza, orCOVID-19 (PIC). This is above theepidemic threshold of 7.2%.Currently, a majority of PICdeaths are due to COVID-19.
Pediatric DeathsNo new inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric deaths were reportedto CDC during week 8. The totalfor the 2020-21 season is one.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods (http://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm) page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/ﬂuviewinteractive.htm).Key PointsKey PointsFlu activity is unusually low at this time but may increase in the coming months.An annual ﬂu vaccine is the best way to protect against ﬂu and its potentially serious complications.If you haven’t gotten your ﬂu vaccine yet, get vaccinated now (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/season/protect-your-health.html).There are also ﬂu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat ﬂu illness.U.S. Virologic Surveillance:(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281228772)Clinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating inﬂuenzaviruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitorevolutionary changes that continually occur in inﬂuenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility ofinﬂuenza viruses to antiviral medications, including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir)and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated later this season when a suﬃcient number of specimens have been tested.Outpatient Illness Surveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932)Please note, the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits forinﬂuenza-like illness (ILI), not laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza, and will capture visits due to other respiratory pathogens,such as SARS-CoV-2, that present with similar symptoms. In addition, healthcare-seeking behaviors have changeddramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are accessing the healthcare system in alternative settings,which may or may not be captured as a part of ILINet. Therefore, ILI data, including ILI activity levels, should beinterpreted with extreme caution. It is particularly important at this time to evaluate syndromic surveillance data,including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate pictureof both inﬂuenza and COVID-19 activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVIDData Tracker Weekly Review (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html).ILINetNationwide during week 8, 0.9% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. This percentage is below thenational baseline of 2.6%.(http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/ﬂuportaldashboard.html)View Chart Data (current season only) (/ﬂu/weekly/weeklyarchives2020-2021/data/senAllregt08.html) | View Full Screen (/ﬂu/weekly/weeklyarchives2020-2021/ILI08.html)During week 8, compared with week 7, the percentage of visits for ILI decreased for two regions (Regions 2 and 6) andremained stable (change of ≤ 0.1%) in the remaining eight regions. All regions reported percentages of outpatient visitsfor ILI below their region-speciﬁc baselines.ILI Visits by Age GroupAbout 65% of ILINet providers provide both the number of patient visits for ILI and the total number of patient visits forthe week broken out by age group. Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patientvisits for ILI by age group. The percentages of visits for ILI reported in ILINet in week 8 remained stable (change of ≤0.1%)for all age groups (0–4 years, 5–24 years, 25–49 years, 50–64 years, and 65 years and older) compared with week 7.However, during the past seven weeks there has been a slightly decreasing trend among four age groups (5–24 years, 25–49 years, 50–64 years, and 65 years and older).

*Data collected in ILINet may disproportionally represent certain populations within a jurisdiction or CBSA, and therefore, may not accurately depictthe full picture of inﬂuenza activity for the entire jurisdiction or CBSA. Diﬀerences in the data presented here by CDC and independently by somehealth departments likely represent diﬀering levels of data completeness with data presented by the health department likely being the morecomplete.Additional information about medically attended visits for ILI for current and past seasons:Additional information about medically attended visits for ILI for current and past seasons:Surveillance Methods (https://wcms-wp.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932) | FluView Interactive: National,Regional, and State Data (http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/ﬂuportaldashboard.html) or ILI Activity Map(https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/main.html)Geographic Spread of Inﬂuenza as Assessed by State andTerritorial Epidemiologists(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1568388833450)The geographic spread of inﬂuenza as reported by state and territorial epidemiologists indicates geographic spread ofinﬂuenza viruses but does not measure the severity of inﬂuenza activity. Due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILIsurveillance, and the fact that the state and territorial epidemiologists report relies heavily on ILI activity, reporting forthis system will be suspended for the 2020-21 inﬂuenza season. Data from previous seasons is available on FluViewInteractive.Additional geographic spread surveillance information for current and past seasons:Additional geographic spread surveillance information for current and past seasons:Surveillance Methods (https://wcms-wp.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1568388833450) | FluView Interactive(https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/FluView8.html)Inﬂuenza-Associated Hospitalizations:(http://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#Hospitalization)The Inﬂuenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza-related hospitalizations in select counties in 14 states and represents approximately 9% of the U.S.population.Between October 1, 2020, and February 27, 2021, FluSurv-NET sites in 14 states reported 193 laboratory conﬁrmedinﬂuenza hospitalizations for an overall cumulative hospitalization rate of 0.7 per 100,000 population. This is much lowerthan average for this point in the season and lower than rates for any season since routine data collection began in 2005,including the low severity 2011-12 season. During the 2011-12 season, the rate was 2.3 times higher at this time in theseason. Hospitalization rates stratiﬁed by age will be presented once case counts increase to a level that produces stablerates by age.Additional hospitalization surveillance information for current and past seasons and additional age groups:Additional hospitalization surveillance information for current and past seasons and additional age groups:Surveillance Methods (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#Hospitalization) | FluView Interactive: Rates by Age(https://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/FluHospRates.html) or Patient Characteristics (https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/FluHospChars.html)National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) MortalitySurveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281356004)Based on NCHS mortality surveillance data available on March 4, 2021, 16.4% of the deaths that occurred during theweek ending February 27, 2021 (week 8), were due to pneumonia, inﬂuenza, and COVID-19 (PIC). This percentage is abovethe epidemic threshold of 7.2% for week 8. Among the 3,531 PIC deaths reported for this week (week 8), 2,727 hadCOVID-19 listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death on the death certiﬁcate and three listed inﬂuenza,indicating that the current increase in PIC mortality is due primarily to COVID-19 and not inﬂuenza.Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually coded causes of deathcollected from death certiﬁcates. Prior to week 4 (the week ending January 30, 2021), the percentages of deaths due toPIC were higher among manually coded records than more rapidly available machine coded records. Improvements havebeen made to the machine coding process that allow for more COVID-19 related deaths to be machine coded, and goingforward, the percentage of PIC deaths among machine coded and manually coded data are expected to be more similar.The data presented are preliminary and expected to change as more data are received and processed, but the amount ofchange in the percentage of deaths due to PIC should be lower going forward. Weeks for which the largest changes in thepercentage of deaths due to PIC may occur are highlighted in gray in the ﬁgure below and should be interpreted withcaution.
