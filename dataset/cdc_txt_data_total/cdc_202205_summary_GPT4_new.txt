Week5, 2022
1. Influenza activity remains sporadic across the country, with 2.0% of clinical lab specimens testing positive for influenza this week.
2. Influenza A(H3N2) accounted for the majority of detections, comprising 97.6% of clinical lab positives and 99.5% of public health lab positives. Only 2.4% were Influenza B.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness were 1.7%, below the national baseline, with all age groups showing a downward trend.
4. Hospitalization rates increased slightly, with a cumulative rate of 4.5 per 100,000; seniors aged 65+ had the highest hospitalization rates.
5. Pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 26.3% of deaths, surpassing the epidemic threshold, though influenza contributed minimally compared to COVID-19.
6. No pediatric influenza-associated deaths were reported this week; the season total remains at 5.
7. Of 6,774 influenza specimens tested this season, 5.9% were also positive for SARS-CoV-2, indicating co-circulation.
8. Flu vaccination coverage is lower than last season, and vaccine uptake remains critical as CDC continues to recommend the annual flu vaccine.
9. Moderate influenza activity was reported in 4 jurisdictions, while others reported low or minimal activity with no high or very high regions.
10. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses are largely similar to this season's vaccine strain but show some antigenic differences as these viruses evolve.

11. Key predictive insights: The low vaccination rate, continued co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2, evolving antigenicity in H3N2 viruses, and sporadic flu activity may influence future ILI trends.
