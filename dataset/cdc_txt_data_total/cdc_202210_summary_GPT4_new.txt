Week10, 2022
1. Influenza activity is increasing in most of the country, with regions 6 and 7 (central and south-central parts) showing the largest increases.
2. 6.8% of specimens tested by clinical labs were positive for influenza, with 98.9% being Influenza A and 1.1% Influenza B.
3. Public health labs detected 347 positive specimens; all were Influenza A, with 56.5% identified as H3N2 and no Influenza B.
4. Outpatient visits for ILI accounted for 1.7% of visits, below the national baseline; Region 7 is above its baseline, and respiratory illness visits increased among children and young adults.
5. 10.8% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), exceeding the epidemic threshold, though most were due to COVID-19.
6. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza was 5.9 per 100,000, higher than the 2020-2021 season but lower than pre-COVID-19 seasons.
7. Hospitalizations increased weekly for six consecutive weeks, with 94.6% attributed to Influenza A and 3.9% co-infected with SARS-CoV-2.
8. Three pediatric deaths were reported this week, for a total of 13 this season, all associated with Influenza A.
9. Influenza A(H3N2) remains the dominant strain; most H3N2 viruses are genetically related to the vaccine but show some antigenic differences.
10. CDC continues to urge vaccination, as vaccinated individuals are still better protected, though vaccination trends and uptake rates were not specified in this summary.
11. Long-term care facilities reported a low influenza positivity rate of 0.7%.
12. Multiple respiratory viruses—including influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2—are co-circulating, complicating data interpretation.
13. No antiviral resistance was detected among Influenza A or B viruses, and characterization shows high effectiveness against circulating strains.
14. CDC suggests that flu activity will likely continue to rise in the coming weeks, particularly in central and south-central regions.
