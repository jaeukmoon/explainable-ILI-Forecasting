Week47, 2022
1. Influenza activity is increasing in most regions, with a notable rise in the South Central, Southeast, Mountain, and West Coast regions.
2. Of the 379 positive specimens reported by public health labs, 82.1% were Influenza A and 17.9% Influenza B. Most Influenza A viruses were A(H1N1) (82.2%), followed by A(H3N2) (17.8%).
3. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) accounted for 3.9% of visits, remaining above the national baseline (2.9%) for the fourth consecutive week.
4. Influenza-associated hospitalization rates increased, reaching a cumulative rate of 3.7 per 100,000—a high for this point in the season compared to previous years since 2010, except for the 2022-23 season.
5. Five pediatric influenza-associated deaths were reported this week, totaling 8 deaths so far this season.
6. Clinical labs reported 75.1% of positive specimens as Influenza A and 24.9% as Influenza B, while public health labs detected a greater proportion of Influenza B (38%) in Regions 4 and 6.
7. Vaccination efforts continue, with CDC urging individuals aged six months and older to get vaccinated, as vaccines remain widely available.
8. Mortality surveillance showed 0.1% of deaths attributed to influenza, trending slightly upward since early October but stable compared to the previous week.
9. No significant antiviral resistance has been detected among circulating influenza viruses tested to date, ensuring the continued effectiveness of available treatment options.
10. Multiple respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, are co-circulating, complicating the attribution of respiratory illness trends to influenza alone.

11. Summary indicates rising flu activity, elevated hospitalization and outpatient trends, and emphasizes vaccination and early antiviral treatment to mitigate impact.
