Based on the latest surveillance report from the CDC, here are the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence:

1. Virologic Surveillance: The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories remained stable at 1.4% during week 6. Influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of positive specimens.

2. Outpatient Respiratory Illness: Nationwide, 2.6% of patient visits reported through the ILINet were due to respiratory illness (ILI) in week 6. This percentage remained stable over the past four weeks but remains above the national baseline of 2.5%.

3. Geographic Activity: ILI activity varied across different regions, with seven of the 10 HHS regions reporting ILI activity below their respective baselines.

4. Hospitalizations: The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza-associated hospitalizations was 59.5 per 100,000 population. The highest hospitalization rates were observed among adults aged 65 and older and children aged 0-4 years.

5. Mortality: 9.4% of deaths during week 6 were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19. The proportion of deaths due to influenza has been declining over the past eight weeks.

6. Pediatric Deaths: Five influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during week 6, bringing the total to 111 for the season.

Overall, seasonal influenza activity remains low nationally, but it is important to continue monitoring surveillance data for any changes in ILI activity. Vaccination and antiviral treatment are recommended to prevent and manage influenza.
