Week15, 2023
1. Influenza activity remains low nationwide; 1.0% of clinical lab specimens tested positive for influenza, with 44.8% Influenza A and 55.2% Influenza B.
2. Public health labs reported 37 positive specimens, 59.5% Influenza A and 40.5% Influenza B, with 92.3% of Influenza A cases being H1N1 and 7.7% H3N2.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness accounted for 2.0%, below the national baseline of 2.5%, and decreased compared to the previous week.
4. Cumulative hospitalization rate for the season is 61.5 per 100,000, with adults aged 65+ seeing the highest hospitalization rate of 183.4 per 100,000.
5. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 7.5%, above the epidemic threshold of 6.9%. Two new pediatric deaths were reported, bringing the seasonal total to 143.
6. Vaccination remains recommended; current influenza viruses are antigenically similar to those in this season’s vaccine, with near 100% antiviral susceptibility.
7. Moderate respiratory illness activity was reported in four jurisdictions, with none experiencing high or very high activity.
8. Flu-associated hospitalization cases show significant co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 at 3.8%, impacting surveillance data interpretation.
9. Long-term care facilities reported a slight increase in influenza-positive tests, with 0.4% of facilities affected.
10. CDC continues to expect low flu activity as trends remain stable, with no dramatic changes in virologic or clinical indicators.

11. Summary analysis suggests ongoing low influenza activity and stable trends, aided by effective vaccination coverage and antiviral susceptibility, though co-circulation of other respiratory viruses and co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 may influence future predictions and healthcare trends.
