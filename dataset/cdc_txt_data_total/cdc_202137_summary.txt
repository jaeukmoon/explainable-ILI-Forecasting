Based on the recent CDC inﬂuenza surveillance report:
- The virologic surveillance system monitors the percentage of specimens tested positive for influenza and the distribution of influenza virus types and subtypes.
- Outpatient illness surveillance tracks the percentage of healthcare visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) and compares it to national baselines.
- Geographic activity varies, with some areas experiencing moderate ILI activity while others have minimal activity.
- The geographic spread of influenza is reported by state and territorial epidemiologists, indicating the level of local, sporadic, or no activity.
- Severe disease indicators, such as hospitalization rates, mortality rates, and pediatric deaths, are monitored to understand the impact of the flu.
- Virus characterization provides insights into the genetic and antigenic properties of circulating viruses and their resistance to antiviral medications.
- Public health recommendations include widespread flu vaccination and the use of antiviral drugs to reduce illness severity.
- Monitoring and analyzing these surveillance components help predict and mitigate future ILI occurrences.
