First, seasonal influenza activity remains low nationally and virologic surveillance indicates stable or decreasing levels of positive influenza specimens in both clinical and public health laboratories. In week 17, 1.0% of clinical specimens and 36.0% of viruses reported by public health laboratories were positive for influenza. In terms of illness, outpatient visits for respiratory illness (ILI) remained stable at 2.0% of patient visits, below the national baseline of 2.5%. Moderate ILI activity was reported in 2 jurisdictions, while minimal activity was reported in 49 jurisdictions. 

Hospitalization rates due to influenza have remained low, with a cumulative rate of 61.9 per 100,000 population. Mortality rates attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 decreased to 7.3%, which is still above the epidemic threshold of 6.8%. Five influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during week 17, bringing the total for the season to 149. 

In terms of virus characterization, genetic and antigenic testing of influenza viruses shows that the majority of circulating viruses are well-matched to the vaccine strains, and all tested viruses remain susceptible to antiviral medications. 

Overall, the data suggest that seasonal influenza activity remains low but stable, with no significant changes in key indicators compared to previous weeks. It is important to continue practicing preventive measures such as vaccination and antiviral treatment to reduce the impact of influenza.
