The virologic surveillance report indicates that during week 26, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories was below the national baseline, with a predominance of Influenza A and minimal influenza B activity. Data from public health laboratories also showed a similar pattern with a higher proportion of Influenza A viruses. Outpatient illness surveillance revealed that ILI activity was below the national baseline, with 1.2% of patient visits attributed to ILI. The ILI activity map indicated minimal activity in most jurisdictions. The geographic spread of influenza showed local activity in four states, sporadic activity in 40 states, and no activity in six states. The mortality surveillance data indicated that 6.2% of deaths during week 26 were attributable to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19, above the epidemic threshold. However, none of the reported pediatric deaths were associated with influenza during this season.
