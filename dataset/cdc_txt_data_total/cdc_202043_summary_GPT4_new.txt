1. Influenza activity in the U.S. remains low, with 0.2% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories.
2. Of the 24 positive clinical lab specimens, 54.2% were Influenza A and 45.8% were Influenza B.
3. Public health labs reported 4 positive specimens, all being Influenza A, and one subtype was H3N2. No Influenza B viruses were identified.
4. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) accounted for 1.2% of visits, slightly up from 1.1% the previous week but well below the national baseline of 2.6%.
5. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported so far for the 2020-21 season.
6. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) are at 8.2%, exceeding the epidemic threshold of 5.9%.
7. Hospitalization rates and detailed virus characterization data will be updated later in the season as specimen numbers increase.
8. CDC recommends influenza vaccination for all individuals aged 6 months and older by the end of October, with no specific trends reported.
9. Healthcare-seeking for respiratory illnesses is affected by alternative care settings during the COVID-19 pandemic, complicating traditional ILI data assessment.
10. Flu activity predictions remain uncertain due to evolving healthcare behaviors and limited influenza virus circulation amidst ongoing COVID-19 tracking.

11. Additional factors to consider: a low ILI activity map, minimal public health lab detections, and unchanged flu antiviral treatment recommendations suggest limited influenza spread at this time.
