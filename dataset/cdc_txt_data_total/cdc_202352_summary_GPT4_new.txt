Week52, 2023
1. Influenza activity is elevated and increasing across most of the United States with 17.5% of respiratory specimens testing positive this week.
2. Of the 651 viruses reported by public health labs, 89.2% were Influenza A and 10.8% were Influenza B; subtype testing showed 87.7% of Influenza A viruses were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 12.3% were A(H3N2).
3. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) accounted for 6.9% of visits, above the national baseline of 2.9% and increasing compared to the previous week.
4. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza is 22.3 per 100,000, with the highest rate among adults aged 65 years and older (58.2 per 100,000).
5. Influenza-related deaths account for 0.9% of deaths reported this week, slightly increasing from the prior week.
6. Seven pediatric deaths were reported this week, all associated with Influenza A (five identified as A(H1N1)), bringing total pediatric deaths this season to 27.
7. Since October, Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 has been the predominant strain in all regions, indicating continued dominance.
8. CDC estimates at least 10 million illnesses, 110,000 hospitalizations, and 6,500 deaths from influenza so far this season.
9. Vaccinations remain recommended for everyone over six months as influenza viruses continue to spread, with late-season benefits still anticipated.
10. Respiratory illnesses now reflect co-circulation of influenza, COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), and RSV, contributing to complex ILI patterns.

11. Summary of additional trends:
12. - Regions 8, 4, 6, and 3 report the highest percentages of positive influenza specimens.
13. - A(H1N1)pdm09 is the most genetically and antigenically consistent subtype with current vaccines.
14. - Resistance remains low to antiviral medications, but usage of older treatments like adamantanes is not advised due to high resistance among Influenza A strains.
15. - Flu-related hospital admissions continue to rise, with significant increases in nine of ten HHS regions, alongside nationally rising outpatient ILI visits.
