Week38, 2021
1. Influenza virus circulation remains low nationwide, with 1.9% of outpatient visits attributed to ILI, below the national baseline of 2.6%.
2. Of the overall respiratory specimens, there are no notable increases in influenza virus detection at clinical or public health laboratories.
3. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 20.9% of deaths, significantly above the epidemic threshold of 5.6%, primarily driven by COVID-19.
4. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported this week; only one pediatric death for the 2020-21 season has been recorded so far.
5. The percentages of ILI visits are steady or declining across all age groups, reflecting low overall influenza activity.
6. Vaccination data or trends were not included in this report, and CDC continues to recommend annual influenza vaccination.
7. Healthcare-seeking behavior shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to influence ILI data interpretation, requiring integration with other surveillance systems.
8. There is no mention of novel influenza viruses, and respiratory illness appears more related to other circulating viruses.
9. Future flu activity remains difficult to predict due to low flu virus circulation and the impact of concurrent respiratory pathogens.

10. Summary of insights: Influenza activity is minimal, with attention required on the high percentage of PIC-related deaths due to COVID-19. Monitoring shifts in respiratory virus patterns and vaccination efforts will be critical for predicting future ILI trends.
