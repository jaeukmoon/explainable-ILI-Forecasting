During the reported period, virologic surveillance showed that the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza was 0.9% in clinical laboratories and 1.6% in public health laboratories. Influenza A viruses were the most commonly reported, with both H3N2 and H1N1 strains detected. Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance indicated that 1.2% of patient visits were due to influenza-like illness (ILI), which was 0.8% lower than the previous week. ILI activity varied by jurisdiction, with minimal activity reported in most areas and moderate activity in one state. The geographic spread of influenza was sporadic in most jurisdictions, with only a few reporting local activity. Hospitalization rates were not available during this report, and the mortality rate from pneumonia and influenza was below the epidemic threshold. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported for the current season. Overall, the CDC expects flu activity to remain low but increase in the coming weeks and recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone aged 6 months and older.
