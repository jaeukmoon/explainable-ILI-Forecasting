Week36, 2024
- **Viruses, illness, and deaths**: Seasonal influenza activity remains low nationally. One pediatric influenza-associated death was reported, bringing the total to 195 for the 2023-2024 season. 0.06% of deaths were attributed to influenza this week. 
- **U.S. virologic surveillance**: Clinical lab positivity for influenza was 0.4% this week, with 85.7% being Influenza A and 14.3% Influenza B. Public health labs identified 96.4% of viruses as Influenza A (61.7% H1N1, 38.3% H3N2) and 3.6% as Influenza B (100% Victoria lineage).
- **Cumulative hospitalization rate**: The weekly hospitalization rate was 0.0 per 100,000 population, with a cumulative rate of 25,405 hospitalizations (84.6% Influenza A, 14.8% Influenza B, 67.6% of Influenza A subtyped as H1N1).
- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza**: The percentage of deaths due to influenza remained stable at 0.06% this week.
- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B**: Influenza A dominated in both clinical (85.7%) and public health (96.4%) labs, with the remainder being Influenza B.
- **Novel Influenza virus like COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)**: No new human infections with novel influenza A viruses were reported this week. A total of 20 novel influenza A cases have been reported this season, including avian-related H5N1 and variant influenza (H1N2v, H3N2v, H1N1v).
- **Vaccination trends**: Vaccine virus components are well-matched with circulating strains, and antiviral susceptibility remains high for most drugs except adamantanes.
- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits**: Respiratory illness visits were 1.8%, below the national baseline. Visits increased for ages 0-4 and 5-24 but remained stable for other age groups. Minimal ILI activity was reported in 53 jurisdictions.
- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC**: CDC maintains low influenza activity nationwide but continues monitoring co-circulating respiratory viruses.
- **Other key factors**: Ongoing avian H5N1 outbreaks in domestic animals underline the importance of continued monitoring for zoonotic influenza transmission.
