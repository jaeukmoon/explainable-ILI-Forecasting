Of the 342 in@uenza A viruses subtyped during Week 52, 300 (87.7%) were in@uenzaA(H1N1) and 42 (12.3%) were A(H3N2).Seven in@uenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during Week 52, bringing the 2023-2024 season totalto 27 pediatric deaths.CDC estimates that there have been at least 10 million illnesses, 110,000 hospitalizations, and 6,500 deaths from@u so far this season.CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual @u vaccine as long as in@uenza viruses arespreading.Vaccination now can still provide beneht this season.There also are prescription @u antiviral drugs that can treat @u illness; those should be started as early as possibleand are especially important for higher risk patients.Flu viruses are among several viruses contributing to respiratory disease activity.

Therefore, use of theseantivirals for treatment and prevention of in@uenza A virus infection is not recommended and data from adamantaneresistance testing are not presented.Outpatient Respiratory Illness Surveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/:u/weekly/overview.htm#ILINet)The U.S. Outpatient In@uenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for respiratory illnessreferred to as in@uenza-like illness [ILI (fever plus cough or sore throat)], not laboratory-conhrmed in@uenza, and willtherefore capture respiratory illness visits due to infection with pathogens that can present with similar symptoms,including in@uenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. It is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including thatfrom ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a more complete and accurate picture ofin@uenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. CDC is providing integrated information about COVID-19,in@uenza, and RSV activity on a website (https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/index.html) that is updated weekly. Informationabout other respiratory virus activity can be found on CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System(NREVSS) website (https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/index.html).Outpatient Respiratory Illness VisitsNationwide during Week 52, 6.9% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that includedfever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. This has increased compared to Week 51 and has remainedabove the national baseline of 2.9% since Week 44. All regions are above their region-specihc baselines this week.Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of in@uenza virus infection to ILI varies bylocation.1/6/24, 8:20 AMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC
