First, the virologic surveillance data shows that the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical labs is 0.1%. This indicates that seasonal influenza activity is lower than usual at this time. The number of influenza positives reported by public health labs also remains unusually low.

Outpatient illness surveillance reveals that 1.1% of patient visits to healthcare providers were for influenza-like illness (ILI), which is below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.

The geographic spread of influenza, as reported by state and territorial epidemiologists, indicates that all jurisdictions experienced minimal activity during the reported week.

Severe disease indicators include hospitalizations and mortality rates. So far this season, there have been 155 laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations, resulting in an overall cumulative hospitalization rate of 0.5 per 100,000 population. Additionally, 28.4% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), exceeding the epidemic threshold of 7.1%. It's important to note that the majority of PIC deaths are due to COVID-19.

No new influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during the reported week, and the total for the 2020-2021 season stands at one.

Overall, influenza activity is unusually low at this time but may increase in the coming months. Getting a flu vaccine and utilizing flu antiviral drugs are recommended preventive measures.
