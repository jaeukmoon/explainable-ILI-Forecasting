Additional information on the current and previous influenza seasons for each surveillance component are available on FluView Interactive. Key Points Seasonal influenza activity remains low nationally. CDC estimates that there have been at least 35 million illnesses, 400,000 hospitalizations, and 25,000 deaths from flu so far this season. There are prescription flu antiviral drugs that can treat flu illness; those should be started as early as possible and are especially important for higher risk patients.3 Seasonal flu viruses are among several viruses contributing to respiratory disease activity. CDC is providing updated, integrated information about COVID-19, flu, and RSV activity on a weekly basis. U.S. Virologic Surveillance Nationally, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories remained stable (change of ≤0.5 percentage points) compared to the previous week. Nationally, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Victoria viruses are all co-circulating. However, the distribution of circulating viruses varies by region. For regional and state level data and age group distribution, please visit FluView Interactive.

Additional information regarding human infections with novel influenza A viruses: Surveillance Methods | FluView Interactive Influenza Virus Characterization CDC performs genetic and antigenic characterization of U.S. viruses submitted from state and local public health laboratories according to the Right Size Roadmap submission guidance. These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating influenza viruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current influenza vaccines. The data are also used to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur in influenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir. CDC has genetically characterized 5,127 influenza viruses collected since October 1, 2023. Influenza Virus Characterization from viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29, 2019 Virus Subtype or Lineage Genetic Characterization Total No. of Subtype/Lineage Tested HA Clade Number (% of subtype/lineage tested) HA Subclade Number (% of subtype/lineage tested) A/H1 1,890 6B.1A.5a 1,890 (100%) 2a 451 (23.9%) 2a.1 1,439 (76.1%) A/H3 1,775 3C.2a1b.2a 1,775 (100%) 2a.1b 1 (0.1%) 2a.3a 1 (0.1%) 2a.3a.1 1,772 (99.8%) 2b 1 (0.1%) B/Victoria 1,462 V1A 1,462 (100%) 3a.2 1,462 (100%) B/Yamagata 0 Y3 0 Y3 0 (0%) CDC antigenically characterizes influenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) (H1N1pdm09, H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses) or neutralization-based HINT (H3N2 viruses) using antisera that ferrets make after being infected with reference viruses representing the 2023-2024 Northern Hemisphere recommended cell or recombinant-based vaccine viruses. Antigenic differences between viruses are determined by comparing how well the antibodies made against the vaccine reference viruses recognize the circulating viruses that have been grown in cell culture. Ferret antisera are useful because antibodies raised against a particular virus can often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody titer differences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared to the reference (vaccine) virus. In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer differences of less than or equal to 8-fold. Viruses selected for antigenic characterization are a subset representing the genetic changes in the surface proteins seen in genetically characterized viruses. Influenza A Viruses A (H1N1)pdm09: 523 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized by HI, and 522 (99.8%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/67/2022-like reference viruses representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. A (H3N2): 604 A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by HI or HINT, and 574 (95.0%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer in HI or reacting at titers that were less than or equal to 8-fold of the homologous virus in HINT) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021-like reference viruses representing the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. Influenza B Viruses B/Victoria: 400 influenza B/Victoria-lineage virus were antigenically characterized by HI, and all were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown B/Austria/1359417/2021-like reference viruses representing the B/Victoria component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. B/Yamagata: No influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were available for antigenic characterization. Assessment of Virus Susceptibility to Antiviral Medications CDC assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to the antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using next generation sequence analysis supplemented by laboratory assays. Information about antiviral susceptibility test methods can be found at U.S. Influenza Surveillance: Purpose and Methods | CDC. Viruses collected in the U.S. since October 1, 2023, were tested for antiviral susceptibility as follows: Viruses collected in the U.S. tested for antiviral susceptibility Antiviral Medication Total Viruses A/H1 A/H3 B/Victoria Neuraminidase Inhibitors Oseltamivir Viruses Tested 5,037 1,864 1,744 1,429 Reduced Inhibition 1 (0.02%) 1 (0.1%) 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 5 (0.1%) 5 (0.3%) 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) Peramivir Viruses Tested 5,037 1,864 1,744 1,429 Reduced Inhibition 3 (0.1%) 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) 3 (0.2%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 6 (0.1%) 5 (0.3%) 0 (0.00%) 1 (0.1%) Zanamivir Viruses Tested 5,037 1,864 1,744 1,429 Reduced Inhibition 1 (0.02%) 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) 1 (0.1%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) PA Cap-Dependent Endonuclease Inhibitor Baloxavir Viruses Tested 4,960 1,820 1,723 1,417 Decreased Susceptibility 1 (0.02%) 0 (0.00%) 1 (0.1%) 0 (0.00%) Four A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses had NA-H275Y amino acid substitution and one A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-H275Y/H, conferring highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir. One (H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-I223V and NA-S247N amino acid substitutions and showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. Two B viruses had NA-A245G amino acid substitution and showed reduced inhibition by peramivir. One B virus had NA-D197N amino acid substitution and showed reduced inhibition by zanamivir and peramivir. One B virus had NA-H273Y amino acid substitution and showed highly reduced inhibition by peramivir. One A(H3N2) virus had PA-I38T amino acid substitution and showed reduced susceptibility to baloxavir. High levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) viruses (the adamantanes are not effective against influenza B viruses). Therefore, use of these antivirals for treatment and prevention of influenza A virus infection is not recommended and data from adamantane resistance testing are not presented. Outpatient Respiratory Illness Surveillance The U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness [ILI (fever plus cough or sore throat)], not laboratory-confirmed influenza and will therefore capture respiratory illness visits due to infection with pathogens that can present with similar symptoms, including influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. It is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a more complete and accurate picture of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. CDC is providing integrated information about COVID-19, influenza, and RSV activity on a website that is updated weekly. Information about other respiratory virus activity can be found on CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) website. Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits Nationally, the percentage of visits for respiratory illness that were reported through ILINet remained stable (change of ≤ 0.1 percentage points) compared to the previous week and is below the national baseline. All 10 regions are below their region-specific baselines. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varies by location. * Effective October 3, 2021 (week 40), the ILI definition (fever plus cough or sore throat) no longer includes “without a known cause other than influenza.” View Chart Data (current season only) | View Full Screen Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits by Age Group About 70% of ILINet participants provide both the number of patient visits for respiratory illness and the total number of patient visits for the week broken out by age group. Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patient visits for respiratory illness by age group. The percentage of visits for respiratory illness reported in ILINet increased in the 0-4 years age group and remained stable for all other age groups in Week 30 compared to Week 29.

FluSurv-NET hospitalization data are preliminary. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly. A total of 25,319 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites between October 1, 2023, and July 27, 2024. The weekly hospitalization rate observed in Week 30 was 0.1 per 100,000 population. The peak weekly hospitalization rate observed this season was 9.0 per 100,000 population and occurred during Week 52. Among 25,319 hospitalizations, 21,400 (84.5%) were associated with influenza A virus, 3,735 (14.8%) with influenza B virus, 51 (0.2%) with influenza A virus and influenza B virus co-infection, and 133 (0.5%) with influenza virus for which the type was not determined. Among those with influenza A subtype information, 4,286 (67.7%) were A(H1N1) pdm09 and 2,047 (32.3%) were A(H3N2).
