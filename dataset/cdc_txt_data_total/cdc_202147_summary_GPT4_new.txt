Week47, 2021
1. Influenza activity remains low nationwide, but reports of positive influenza specimens and outpatient visits for respiratory illness have increased.

2. Clinical laboratories reported 632 positive influenza specimens this week (1.5%), with 96.2% being Influenza A and 3.8% Influenza B.

3. Public health laboratories found 330 Influenza A (99.4%) and 2 Influenza B (0.6%) viruses; most Influenza A cases were H3N2 (99.6%).

4. Influenza A(H3N2) made up the majority of viruses detected, with over 80% of cases reported in those aged 5-24 years.

5. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) accounted for 2.4% of visits, trending upward but remaining below the national baseline of 2.5%.

6. Hospitalizations for influenza totaled 495 this week; full-season cumulative hospitalization rates are not yet available.

7. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 15.5% of deaths, above the epidemic threshold, mainly driven by COVID-19.

8. No pediatric influenza-associated deaths have been reported this season.

9. Vaccination efforts have distributed 166.9 million flu vaccine doses in the U.S., with CDC recommending flu vaccination for those 6 months and older.

10. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, suggesting varying contributions to ILI across regions and age groups.

11. Regional differences show some areas experiencing moderate to high ILI activity, with most jurisdictions reporting minimal or low activity.

12. Data interpretation remains affected by healthcare-seeking changes due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, complicating traditional surveillance methods.

13. The CDC continues to recommend antiviral drugs as a treatment option and highlights future updates on virus characterization and hospitalization rates.

14. Summary: Influenza activity remains low but is gradually increasing, led by Influenza A(H3N2), with most cases in younger age groups. Vaccination efforts are substantial, though impacts of co-circulating respiratory illnesses and healthcare-seeking behavior limit predictions of flu activity trends.
