Based on the CDC's FluView Summary ending on March 16, 2024, the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence are as follows:

1. Seasonal influenza activity remains elevated but is decreasing nationally. Activity is decreasing or stable in nine of the 10 HHS regions, with a slight increase in the Pacific Northwest region.

2. Influenza viruses are still circulating, with 12.0% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical labs.

3. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B viruses are co-circulating in the population, with varying distributions by region.

4. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness, including ILI, remain above baseline at 3.4% but have decreased compared to the previous week.

5. Geographic spread of influenza varies, with 13 jurisdictions experiencing moderate activity and 9 jurisdictions experiencing high or very high activity.

6. The cumulative hospitalization rate is 70.2 per 100,000 population, with the highest rates among adults aged 65 years and older.

7. Pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality remain below the epidemic threshold, with 0.6% of deaths attributed to influenza.

8. Five influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported in Week 11, bringing the total for the season to 121 deaths.

9. Antigenic characterization of influenza viruses shows a good match to the reference viruses used in current vaccines.

Overall, while influenza activity is decreasing, it is still important to monitor the ongoing circulation of influenza viruses and take preventive measures such as vaccination and antiviral treatment.
