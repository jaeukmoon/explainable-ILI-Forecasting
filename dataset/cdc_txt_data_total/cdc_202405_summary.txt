Here are the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence from the provided report:

1. Virologic surveillance: The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories was stable at 15.8%. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most frequently reported.

2. Outpatient ILI surveillance: 4.4% of patient visits were due to respiratory illness, which is above the national baseline of 2.9%. Some regions experienced high or very high ILI activity.

3. Geographic spread: Local flu activity was reported in four states, while sporadic activity was reported in 40 states and areas.

4. Severe disease: Cumulative hospitalization rate was 51.5 per 100,000 population. 0.8% of deaths were attributed to influenza, below the epidemic threshold.

5. Pediatric deaths: Eight influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during the current season.

6. Virus characterization: Genetic and antigenic characterization of circulating influenza viruses is ongoing, and antiviral susceptibility testing is being conducted.

7. Public health recommendations: CDC recommends annual flu vaccination and use of antiviral drugs for treatment.

These facts provide insights into the current state of influenza activity and the measures being taken for surveillance and prevention. It is expected that flu activity will remain elevated with fluctuations in different regions.
