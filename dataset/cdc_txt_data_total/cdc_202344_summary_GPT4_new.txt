1. Influenza activity is increasing in most parts of the U.S., particularly in the South Central, Southeast, and West Coast regions; 3.0% of clinical lab specimens tested positive for influenza this week.
2. Of 192 viruses reported by public health labs, 77.1% were Influenza A (90.6% A(H1N1) and 9.4% A(H3N2)), and 22.9% were Influenza B (100% Victoria lineage).
3. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza so far is 1.2 per 100,000, which is the second highest for this point in the season since 2010.
4. Deaths due to influenza accounted for 0.09% of all deaths, stable compared to last week. One pediatric death from a prior season was newly reported this week.
5. Influenza A comprised 69.8% of positive clinical lab specimens this week, and 30.2% were Influenza B.
6. There is no indication of novel influenza-like viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, although integrated respiratory virus surveillance is ongoing.
7. The CDC continues to strongly recommend annual influenza vaccination for everyone aged six months and older.
8. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) accounted for 2.9% of patient visits this week, at the national baseline; activity is increasing in 8 of 10 HHS regions.
9. CDC expects influenza activity to continue increasing, with antiviral treatment recommended for early intervention in diagnosed cases.
10. Other key factors: hospitalization rates are highest among adults aged 65+ (3.0 per 100,000); respiratory coinfections with other viruses like RSV are contributing to current trends; and regions 4, 6, and 9 show the highest outpatient and virologic positivity rates.
