Week12, 2022
1. Influenza activity is highest in central and south-central U.S. but declining, while increasing in the northeast and northwest regions.

2. 6.5% of clinical lab specimens tested positive for influenza, with 99.2% being Influenza A and 0.8% Influenza B.

3. Public health labs reported 339 positive specimens, all Influenza A, with 100% of subtyped specimens being H3N2.

4. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) are at 1.8%, below baseline, with increases noted in younger age groups (0-64 years).

5. The cumulative hospitalization rate is 7.2 per 100,000, higher than last season but lower than pre-COVID-19 years; 94.9% of hospitalizations are associated with Influenza A.

6. Pediatric deaths increased by one this week, bringing the total for the season to 14.

7. Mortality due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) is at 8.3%, above the epidemic threshold, with the majority attributable to COVID-19.

8. Influenza vaccination continues to be encouraged; no significant new trends in vaccination uptake reported.

9. Co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (5.4% coinfection in tested specimens), impact interpretation of ILI trends.

10. Antiviral susceptibility remains stable, with no significant resistance observed aside from one H3N2 virus with reduced baloxavir susceptibility.

11. Expectation of flu activity remains uncertain due to regional variation and evolving virus strains, with H3N2 continuing to dominate.

12. Data from long-term care facilities show 0.7% reporting at least one influenza-positive test.

13. The northeast and northwest regions may see increasing ILI activity in coming weeks.
