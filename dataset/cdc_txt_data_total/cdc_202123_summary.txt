First, virologic surveillance involves monitoring the percentage of positive influenza specimens in clinical laboratories and identifying the circulating influenza virus types and subtypes. During the reported period, 1.2% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI, which is below the national baseline of 2.6%. The ILI activity varied across jurisdictions, with some experiencing very high or high activity levels, while others had low or minimal activity. In terms of hospitalizations, the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in select counties. Data on hospitalizations are updated periodically.
Furthermore, the mortality surveillance data indicate that 7.6% of deaths during the reported week were due to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19, which is above the epidemic threshold. It's important to note that current pediatric mortality is primarily due to COVID-19, and no influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during the reported week. The CDC also provides additional national and international influenza surveillance information through various sources, such as FluView Interactive, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and state and local influenza surveillance programs.
These surveillance systems and data components allow for monitoring influenza activity, assessing the severity of the disease, and informing public health recommendations, such as vaccination and antiviral treatment.
