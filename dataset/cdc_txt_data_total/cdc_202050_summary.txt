Based on the provided CDC surveillance reports, here are the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence:

1. Virologic Surveillance: The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories is an important indicator of influenza activity. In Week 40 of the reported season, 3.1% of tested specimens were positive for influenza viruses, which was similar to the previous week. Influenza A viruses predominated, with equal numbers of H3N2 and H1N1pdm09 viruses reported.

2. Outpatient Illness Surveillance: ILINet monitors outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI). In Week 40, 1.4% of visits to healthcare providers were for ILI, which remained below the national baseline of 2.4%. ILI activity increased slightly from the previous week. Louisiana experienced moderate ILI activity, while the majority of jurisdictions reported minimal activity.

3. Geographic Spread: Out of 53 jurisdictions, 4 reported local flu activity, while the remainder reported sporadic or no flu activity. This indicates that flu activity was localized and not widespread during the reported period.

4. Severe Disease: Hospitalization rates and P&I mortality rates provide insights into the severity of influenza-related illness. Hospitalization rates were not provided in the reports, but 5.0% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I), which was below the epidemic threshold. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported for the 2019-2020 season.

5. Virus Characterization: Influenza virus characterization, including genetic and antigenic analysis, provides information about the similarity of circulating viruses to reference viruses used for vaccine development. The characterization data were not provided in the reports.

6. CDC Recommendations: CDC expects flu activity to remain low but increase in the coming weeks. Vaccination with an annual flu vaccine is the best way to protect against influenza and its complications. CDC recommends everyone aged 6 months and older to get vaccinated by the end of October. Antiviral drugs can also be used to treat flu illness.

These facts indicate that during the reported weeks, influenza activity remained low in the United States, with minimal ILI activity. The majority of jurisdictions had sporadic or no flu activity. However, it is important to note that the provided reports are specific to a particular season, and predictions for future ILI occurrence should consider the current flu season, vaccine coverage, and other factors that may affect influenza activity.
