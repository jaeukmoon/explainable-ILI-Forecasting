1. Influenza activity remains minimal in the U.S., with just 1.0% of specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical labs.
2. Of the positive specimens reported by clinical labs, 55.9% were Influenza A and 44.1% were Influenza B; public health labs reported 64.0% Influenza A and 36.0% Influenza B, with all Influenza B being Victoria lineage.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI accounted for 1.1% of all visits, remaining below the national baseline and varying by age group, with children aged 0-4 showing the highest percentage (4.1%).
4. Hospital admissions for influenza included 638 laboratory-confirmed cases during Week 31.
5. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 5.9%, slightly exceeding the epidemic threshold of 5.6%; of these, 12 deaths were influenza-related.
