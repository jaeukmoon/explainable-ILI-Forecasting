Week27, 2023
- **Viruses, illness, and deaths:** Influenza activity is low with 0.8% of respiratory specimens testing positive. Influenza A accounted for 58.3% and Influenza B for 41.7%. Among mortality, 5.5% of deaths were due to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC), below the epidemic threshold of 5.8%. Five influenza-associated deaths were reported, including two pediatric deaths during the 2022-2023 season, bringing the total to 162.

- **U.S. virologic surveillance:** Clinical labs show 97.6% of cumulative positive specimens since week 40 are Influenza A, with 2.4% Influenza B. Public health labs indicate 96.1% of positives are Influenza A, mostly H1N1 (94.4%), while Influenza B (3.9%) is all Victoria lineage.

- **Cumulative hospitalization rate:** 641 hospitalizations due to laboratory-confirmed influenza were reported during week 27. Data for season totals are capped at April 30, 2023.

- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza:** Influenza-associated deaths remain low. Among reported PIC deaths, only five were influenza-related during week 27.

- **Percentage of Influenza A and B:** Influenza A constitutes 58.3% of clinical lab positives and 56.8% of public health lab positives (mainly H1N1), while Influenza B makes up 41.7% and 43.2%, respectively.

- **Novel influenza virus like COVID-19:** No novel influenza viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, were reported in week 27.

- **Vaccination trends:** No vaccination data was reported for week 27, though vaccination remains critical for prevention.

- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits:** 1.3% of outpatient visits were for ILI. Children aged 0-4 years had the highest visit rate of 4.2%, while the 65+ group reported the lowest (0.6%). Multiple respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, are co-circulating.

- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC:** CDC indicates sustained low influenza activity.

- **Other key factors:** All jurisdictions reported minimal (53) or low (11) outpatient ILI activity, except one with moderate activity. Overall, respiratory virus activity appears more prevalent among younger age groups.
