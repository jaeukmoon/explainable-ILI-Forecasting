Week27, 2021
- **Viruses, illness, and deaths**: Influenza activity remains minimal in the U.S. No influenza-related deaths were reported, but 6.5% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC), primarily due to COVID-19.  
- **U.S. virologic surveillance**: Data provided predominantly tracks virologic activity. Details on specific influenza subtypes for this week are not provided.  
- **Cumulative hospitalization rate**: Hospitalization rate updates ceased after April 30, 2021; no new data is available for week 27.  
- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza**: No influenza-associated deaths were reported, and PIC mortality is dominated by COVID-19.  
- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B**: Breakdown of influenza A and B percentages is not provided in this report.  
- **Novel influenza virus like COVID-19**: The report highlights the continued impact of COVID-19 on health metrics, with it being a primary contributor to PIC mortality.  
- **Vaccination trends**: No updates on influenza vaccination trends are included in this report.  
- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits**: 1.3% of outpatient visits were for ILI, below the national baseline of 2.6%. Only two age groups (5–24 years and 25–49 years) showed increased ILI activity compared to the previous week.  
- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC**: ILI activity remains below baseline, and influenza activity is expected to remain low.  
- **Other key factors**: The majority of jurisdictions report minimal influenza activity. Changes in healthcare access due to COVID-19 continue to influence data interpretation, and ILI surveillance includes conditions that may mimic influenza (e.g., COVID-19).
