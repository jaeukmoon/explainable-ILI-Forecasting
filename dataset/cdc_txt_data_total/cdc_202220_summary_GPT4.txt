Week20, 2022
- **Viruses, illness, and deaths**: Influenza activity is increasing in parts of the U.S., with 6.4% of clinical respiratory specimens testing positive. Most detected viruses are Influenza A (H3N2). One pediatric influenza-associated death was reported this week, bringing the season total to 25. Overall PIC (pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19) mortality is 8.0%, above the epidemic threshold of 6.4%. 

- **U.S. virologic surveillance**: Clinical labs report 99.6% of influenza-positive specimens as Influenza A and 0.4% as Influenza B. Public health labs report 100% Influenza A (98.4% H3N2, 1.6% H1N1pdm09). 4.5% of specimens tested for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 were positive for SARS-CoV-2.  

- **Cumulative hospitalization rate**: The cumulative rate is 15.5 per 100,000 population, driven primarily by adults aged 65+ (44.8 per 100,000). Hospitalizations included 96.7% Influenza A-associated cases (99.1% H3N2).

- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza**: Influenza alone accounted for 34 of 1,533 PIC deaths reported this week; PIC mortality primarily stems from COVID-19.

- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B**: Influenza A dominates at 99.6% in clinical settings and 100% in public health labs. Influenza B is rare (0.4% in clinical labs, 0% in public health labs).

- **Novel Influenza viruses (like COVID-19)**: No novel influenza viruses reported this week.

- **Vaccination trends**: CDC continues recommending influenza vaccination for everyone aged 6 months and older as flu activity persists.

- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits**: 2.4% of outpatient visits were due to respiratory illness, remaining stable from last week. Six jurisdictions experienced moderate activity whereas two reported high/very high activity.

- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC**: Influenza activity is expected to continue its increase given late-season trends.

- **Other key factors**: Long-term care facilities reported influenza-positive tests in 0.6% of facilities. Hospitalizations reflect co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 (2.3%). Late-season influenza surveillance is ongoing, and regional activity varies significantly.
