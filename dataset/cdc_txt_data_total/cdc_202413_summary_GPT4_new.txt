2. Clinical labs reported 49.0% Influenza A and 51.0% Influenza B, while public health labs reported 61.1% Influenza A and 38.9% Influenza B.
3. Of the 138 subtyped Influenza A specimens, 50% were H1N1pdm09 and 50% H3N2. All Influenza B viruses characterized were Victoria lineage.
4. One human case of avian Influenza A(H5N1) was reported in Texas with no further human-to-human transmission.

10. Antiviral resistance is low, with minimal reduced susceptibility detected across Influenza types.
11. Co-circulation of multiple viruses, including RSV and COVID-19, continues to impact ILI trends and surveillance.
12. Flu activity prediction remains linked to regional variability, vaccination uptake, and ongoing virologic monitoring.
