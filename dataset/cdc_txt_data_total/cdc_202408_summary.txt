In summary, the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence based on the CDC surveillance report are as follows:

1. Virologic surveillance: The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories was 14.2% during the reported week. Influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and Influenza B viruses were circulating.

2. Outpatient ILI surveillance: 4.4% of visits to a healthcare provider were due to ILI, indicating elevated respiratory illness activity.

3. Geographic spread: Moderate ILI activity was reported in 12 jurisdictions, while high or very high activity was reported in 27 jurisdictions.

4. Severe disease indicators: Hospitalization rates and mortality rates from pneumonia and influenza were not provided in the report.

5. Pediatric deaths: Two pediatric deaths associated with influenza were reported during the season, bringing the total to 93 deaths.

6. Virus characterization: Genetic and antigenic characterization of influenza viruses were conducted, but specific details regarding the similarity to reference viruses and antiviral susceptibility were not provided.

7. Recommendations: CDC recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone aged 6 months and older, as well as the use of antiviral drugs for treatment of flu illness.

Based on these facts, it can be inferred that influenza activity is currently elevated but varies geographically. Further monitoring of virologic surveillance, ILI activity, and severe disease indicators is necessary to predict future ILI occurrences accurately.
