Public health laboratories reported that 41.9% of positive specimens were Influenza A, with the H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 subtypes being the most common.

The ILI activity map shows that during the reported period, the majority of jurisdictions had minimal ILI activity, while two states (Alaska and Puerto Rico) experienced high ILI activity. 
The geographic spread of influenza, as assessed by state and territorial epidemiologists, shows that four states had local flu activity, while the rest reported sporadic activity or no flu activity.
