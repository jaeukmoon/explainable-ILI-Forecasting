First, influenza activity has decreased in recent weeks but sporadic activity continues across the country. The majority of influenza viruses detected are Influenza A(H3N2). The percentage of outpatient visits due to respiratory illness is below the national baseline, and the relative contribution of influenza to respiratory illness varies by location. Influenza-associated hospitalizations and pediatric deaths remain low or have not been reported for the current season. The surveillance system tracks virologic data, outpatient illness visits, geographical spread, severe disease indicators, and virus characterization to provide comprehensive information for predicting future ILI occurrence.
