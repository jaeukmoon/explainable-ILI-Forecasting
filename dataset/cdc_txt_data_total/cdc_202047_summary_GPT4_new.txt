Week47, 2020
1. Influenza activity remains unusually low for this time of year, with only 0.2% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical labs and 0.7% in public health labs.
2. Influenza-like illness (ILI) accounted for 1.6% of outpatient visits, remaining below the national baseline of 2.6% and consistent with the previous week.
3. Influenza A and B are detected at nearly equal proportions, with 45.0% of clinical lab-positive specimens identified as Influenza A and 55.0% as Influenza B.
4. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) are at 11.3%, above the epidemic threshold of 6.3%, driven primarily by COVID-19 rather than influenza.
5. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported so far during the 2020-2021 season.
6. COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact healthcare-seeking behavior and data collection, making ILI surveillance data less reliable for true influenza activity interpretation.
7. Hospitalization rates and influenza virus characterization updates will begin later in the season, as few influenza cases are currently reported.
8. Annual flu vaccination is strongly encouraged to prevent severe outcomes, but vaccination uptake trends are not explicitly detailed in the report.
9. Two regions saw increases in ILI activity, one region saw a decrease, and seven regions remained stable, with all below their regional thresholds.
10. Flu activity could increase in the coming months despite the current low levels, pointing toward the need for continued surveillance and preparedness.
