From the provided excerpts, we can gather the following key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence:

1. Virologic surveillance data from clinical and public health laboratories is essential for monitoring influenza activity and identifying the types and subtypes of circulating viruses.

2. Outpatient ILI surveillance provides insights into the percentage of healthcare visits for ILI, allowing for comparisons to national and regional baselines.

3. Geographical spread data indicates the level of flu activity in different jurisdictions, ranging from local to sporadic or no activity.

4. Severe disease indicators, such as hospitalization rates, mortality rates from pneumonia and influenza (P&I), and pediatric deaths, help assess the impact of the flu.

5. Virus characterization data, including genetic and antigenic properties, help monitor changes in circulating viruses and ensure vaccine and treatment effectiveness.

6. Historical data and seasonal trends provide context for understanding whether flu activity is increasing or decreasing.

7. Public health recommendations for widespread flu vaccination and use of antiviral drugs play a crucial role in preventing and mitigating the flu.

These factors combined contribute to predicting and managing future ILI occurrences.
