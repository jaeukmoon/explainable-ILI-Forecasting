Based on the weekly ILI surveillance report from CDC for Week 45, ending November 13, 2021, the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence are:

1. Influenza activity in the United States remains low, but the number of influenza virus detections reported by clinical and public health laboratories has increased in recent weeks.

2. The majority of the detected viruses are Influenza A (H3N2), with more than 90% of the infections occurring among children and young adults aged 5-24 years.

3. Despite the low overall influenza activity, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI has been slowly increasing in recent weeks.

4. An annual flu vaccine is recommended for everyone 6 months and older as the best way to protect against influenza and its potentially serious complications.

5. More than 162.5 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed in the US as of November 5, 2021.

6. Flu antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of flu illness.

7. The geographical spread of influenza varies, with some areas experiencing high ILI activity levels, while others have minimal or no activity.

8. Surveillance data from long-term care facilities shows 0.2% of facilities reported at least one influenza-positive test among residents.

9. Hospitalization rates for influenza will be updated starting later in the season.

10. 14.4% of deaths during Week 45 were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19, which is above the epidemic threshold.

11. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported during the 2021-2022 season.

These facts highlight the current trends and provide insights into the influenza activity in the US, informing public health measures such as vaccination campaigns and antiviral treatments.
