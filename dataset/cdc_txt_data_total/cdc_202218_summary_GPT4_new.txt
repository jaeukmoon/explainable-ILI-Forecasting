2. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness remain stable at 2.3%, but high or very high activity is observed in 4 jurisdictions.
3. The cumulative hospitalization rate is 13.4 per 100,000 with 3,071 hospital admissions this week, and older adults (65+ years) exhibit the highest rates.

7. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 4.7% of influenza-positive public health lab specimens this season, but co-infections remain uncommon in hospitalizations (2.5%).
8. Vaccination is still encouraged, though late-season antigenic differences in circulating H3N2 viruses suggest reduced vaccine match effectiveness.
9. Long-term care facilities reported influenza activity at 0.9%, with at least one positive test in 126 facilities.
10. Future flu activity remains unpredictable due to late-season trends, co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, and regional variability in influenza contributions to illness.
