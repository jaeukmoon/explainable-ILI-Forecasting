Week28, 2024
1. Influenza activity remains low nationally, with 0.8% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical labs this week.
2. Among positive clinical lab specimens, 87.3% were Influenza A and 12.7% were Influenza B.
3. Public health labs reported 117 positive specimens, with 96.6% being Influenza A (64.2% H3N2, 35.8% H1N1pdm09) and 3.4% Influenza B (100% Victoria lineage).
4. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness accounted for 1.4% of total visits, remaining under the national baseline with no activity classified as moderate, high, or very high.
5. Weekly influenza-associated hospitalization rates were 0.1 per 100,000 population, with a cumulative seasonal total of 25,274 hospitalizations.
6. There were 2 influenza-associated pediatric deaths reported this week; one from each of the past two flu seasons, bringing the 2023-24 total to 187.
7. Influenza-related deaths accounted for 0.1% of total deaths nationally, remaining stable from the prior week.
8. Five cases of human infection with novel Influenza A(H5) were reported from Colorado, all related to poultry exposure, marking an important development in avian influenza surveillance.
9. Influenza A (H1N1), A (H3N2), and B viruses all displayed high antigenic similarity to vaccine reference strains, with minimal resistance detected to recommended antiviral drugs.
10. Future flu activity is expected to remain low, but the co-circulation of seasonal flu, avian influenza, and other respiratory viruses requires continued surveillance.

11. Summary of key factors: Low seasonal flu activity persists, with widespread co-circulation of Influenza A and B types, minimal ILI or hospitalization rates, and isolated novel avian influenza cases raising vigilance.
