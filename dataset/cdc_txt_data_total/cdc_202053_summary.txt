During week 2 of the influenza season, overall activity remains lower than usual for this time of year. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza at clinical laboratories is 0.1%, and public health labs have reported a lower than normal number of positive influenza samples. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) continue to be below the national baseline, with ILI activity at 1.6%. ILI activity levels may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Six jurisdictions experienced low ILI activity, while the remaining jurisdictions reported minimal activity. The geographic spread of influenza is currently unknown due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILI surveillance. Hospitalization rates will be presented once case counts increase. Mortality surveillance data show that 14.5% of deaths during the week were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19, above the epidemic threshold. However, the majority of deaths were due to COVID-19 rather than influenza. No new influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported, and only one has been reported for the season so far. Vaccine effectiveness data will be available later in the season. CDC recommends getting vaccinated against influenza to prevent illness and its complications. Public health recommendations also include the use of antiviral drugs for treatment.
