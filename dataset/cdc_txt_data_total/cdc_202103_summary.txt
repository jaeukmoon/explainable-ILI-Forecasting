First, virologic surveillance shows that the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories is low, at 0.3% for the reported week. The number of positive specimens reported by public health labs remains unusually low, with one novel influenza A virus infection reported.

Outpatient illness surveillance indicates that 1.3% of patient visits to healthcare providers were for influenza-like illness (ILI), which is below the national baseline of 2.6%. The ILI activity map shows that most jurisdictions experienced minimal activity, with one jurisdiction experiencing low activity.

Hospitalization rates for influenza remain low, with a cumulative hospitalization rate of 0.5 per 100,000 population. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) is above the epidemic threshold, at 14.8% for the reported week. However, it is important to note that the majority of PIC deaths are due to COVID-19 rather than influenza.

No new influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported for the reported week. Overall, influenza activity remains lower than usual for this time of year.

The CDC emphasizes the importance of flu vaccination and antiviral drugs for prevention and treatment of flu. The virologic surveillance data and ILI activity levels will continue to be updated weekly throughout the season.
