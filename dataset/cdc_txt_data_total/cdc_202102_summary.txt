First, the virologic surveillance data shows that the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical labs is 0.1% for the reported week. The number of influenza positives reported by public health labs remains much lower than usual despite a higher number of tests performed.

In terms of illness, 1.4% of patient visits to healthcare providers were for influenza-like illness (ILI) during the reported week, which is below the national baseline of 2.6%. However, it should be noted that ILI surveillance may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.

The geographic spread of influenza, as assessed by state and territorial epidemiologists, indicates that one jurisdiction experienced low ILI activity, while the remaining jurisdictions experienced minimal activity. It is also important to consider that ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Severe disease indicators show that there have been 136 laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations so far in the current season, resulting in an overall cumulative hospitalization rate of 0.5 per 100,000 population. The majority of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) are currently due to COVID-19.

No new influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during the reported week, and only one influenza-associated pediatric death has been reported for the 2020-2021 season.

Overall, flu activity remains lower than usual for this time of year, but it may increase in the coming months. CDC continues to emphasize the importance of annual flu vaccination and the use of antiviral drugs for treating flu illness.
