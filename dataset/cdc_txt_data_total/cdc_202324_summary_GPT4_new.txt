Week24, 2023
1. Influenza activity is low, with 1.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive; Influenza A constitutes 57.9%, and Influenza B accounts for 42.1%.
2. Out of public health lab specimens, 61.9% were Influenza A, and 38.1% were Influenza B; all subtyped Influenza B viruses belonged to the Victoria lineage.
3. Hospitalizations for influenza reached 779 for the week, but cumulative hospitalization rates for the season are not explicitly detailed.
4. COVID-19, Influenza, and Pneumonia (PIC) accounted for 6.1% of deaths, slightly exceeding the epidemic threshold of 6.0%.
5. Outpatient respiratory visits for ILI were at 1.5%, with the highest percentage (5.2%) among children aged 0-4.
6. Virologic testing showed declining influenza circulation, with no detection of H3N2 viruses and minimal other subtype activity.
7. Two pediatric deaths were reported, adding to seasonal totals of 159 for 2022-23 and 47 for 2021-22, both linked to Influenza A.
8. Flu activity expectations are minimal, with most jurisdictions reporting "minimal" activity levels nationwide.
9. Multiple respiratory viruses co-circulate, complicating ILI surveillance interpretation alongside COVID-19 cases.
10. Vaccination trends were not discussed in the report.

11. Summary of insights: Influenza activity continues to decline seasonally, with limited new virus detections and reduced outpatient visits. Upcoming flu trends may depend on co-circulating respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2.
