Week44, 2021
1. Influenza activity remains low nationwide, with public health labs reporting an increasing number of detections.
2. Clinical labs reported 0.3% of specimens tested positive for influenza, with 77.2% Influenza A and 22.8% Influenza B.
3. Public health labs found 97.3% of positive specimens were Influenza A (100% H3N2 subtype), and 2.7% were Influenza B (Victoria lineage).
4. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) accounted for 2.1% of visits, below the national baseline, with Regions 7 above baseline and others below.
5. More than 90% of Influenza A(H3N2) cases involve those aged 5–24; a single outbreak in Michigan accounts for many cases.
6. Hospitalized influenza patients totaled 295 in Week 44, with hospitalization trends to be updated later in the season.
7. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) deaths accounted for 14.1% of total deaths, above the epidemic threshold, though primarily due to COVID-19.
8. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported for the season.
9. The CDC has distributed 158.7M influenza vaccine doses so far, promoting vaccination for everyone aged 6 months and older.
10. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, with variable effects on ILI trends; age-specific ILI visits showed increases in 0–4 and 5–24 age groups.

11. Summary of other key factors:
12. - Influenza A(H3N2) spread is concentrated in certain regions and linked to localized outbreaks.
13. - Healthcare behaviors altered by COVID-19 continue to impact traditional ILI data collection and reporting.
14. - Regional data discrepancies and delayed reporting affect comprehensive surveillance accuracy.
