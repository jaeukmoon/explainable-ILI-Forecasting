Based on the CDC FluView report for the week ending March 30, 2024, here are the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence:

1. Seasonal influenza activity remains elevated nationally but is decreasing.
2. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories decreased compared to the previous week.
3. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B viruses are all co-circulating.
4. The percentage of outpatient visits for respiratory illness (ILI) remained stable but above the national baseline.
5. Moderate to high ILI activity was reported in multiple jurisdictions.
6. The distribution of circulating viruses varies by region.
7. The number of weekly flu hospital admissions has been decreasing since January.
8. There have been 22,684 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations reported by FluSurv-NET sites.
9. 0.5% of deaths that occurred during the week ending March 30, 2024, were due to influenza.
10. Seven influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during Week 13, bringing the season total to 133 pediatric deaths.
11. The CDC estimates that there have been at least 32 million illnesses, 360,000 hospitalizations, and 22,000 deaths from flu so far this season.
12. CDC recommends annual flu vaccination and the use of antiviral drugs for treatment and prevention.
13. Surveillance activities for avian influenza (HPAI A(H5N1)) are ongoing.
14. Additional virologic surveillance information, flu activity maps, and influenza/subtype characterization data can be accessed through the provided links.
15. Syndromic surveillance data, including ILINet data, should be evaluated in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete picture of respiratory virus activity.

These facts highlight the current status of influenza activity, the circulating virus types, hospitalization rates, pediatric deaths, and the importance of vaccination and antiviral use in managing the flu season.
