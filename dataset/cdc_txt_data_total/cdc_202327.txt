Therefore, it is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that fromILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of in@uenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. Other respiratory virus surveillance data can be found on CDC’s COVID DataTracker (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home), NCIRD Surveillance Systems website(https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/surveillance/index.html) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS)website (https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/index.html).Outpatient Respiratory Illness VisitsNationwide during week 27, 1.3% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that includedfever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relativecontribution of in@uenza virus infection to ILI varies by location.
