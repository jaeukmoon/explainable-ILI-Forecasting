Clinical LabsThe percentage of respiratoryspecimens testing positive forinﬂuenza at clinical laboratoriesis 0.2% this week.(/ﬂu/weekly/#ClinicalLaboratories)
Public Health LabsInﬂuenza activity was low duringthe summer months and fewspecimens have tested positivein public health labs duringrecent weeks.(/ﬂu/weekly/#PublicHealthLaboratories)
Virus CharacterizationInﬂuenza virus characterizationinformation will be updatedweekly starting later this season.(/ﬂu/weekly/#ivc)Illness
Outpatient Illness: ILINetThe percentage of visits to a health care provider for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI) remained at 1.6% for a thirdconsecutive week. This is below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILI surveillance may be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map
This week, four jurisdictions experienced low ILI activity, and the remaining jurisdictions experienced minimal ILIactivity. ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsHospitalization rates will bepresented once case countsincrease to a level that producesstable rates; in the interim, casecounts will be reported eachweek.
NCHS Mortality14.3% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia, inﬂuenza, orCOVID-19 (PIC). This is above theepidemic threshold of 6.5%. Themajority of PIC deaths are due toCOVID-19.
Pediatric DeathsThe ﬁrst inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric death occurring duringthe 2020-21 season was reportedto CDC this week.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods (http://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm) page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/ﬂuviewinteractive.htm).Key PointsKey PointsFlu activity is unusually low at this time but may increase in the coming months.An annual ﬂu vaccine is the best way to protect against ﬂu and its potentially serious complications.If you haven’t gotten your ﬂu vaccine yet, get vaccinated now (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/season/protect-your-health.html).There are also ﬂu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat ﬂu illness.U.S. Virologic Surveillance:(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281228772)Clinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating inﬂuenzaviruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitorevolutionary changes that continually occur in inﬂuenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility ofinﬂuenza viruses to antiviral medications, including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir)and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated weekly starting later this season when a suﬃcient number of specimens havebeen tested.Outpatient Illness Surveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932)Please note, the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits forinﬂuenza-like illness (ILI), not laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza, and as such, will capture visits due to other respiratorypathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, that present with similar symptoms. In addition, healthcare-seeking behaviors havechanged dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are accessing the healthcare system in alternativesettings which may or may not be captured as a part of ILINet. Therefore, ILI data, including ILI activity levels, should beinterpreted with extreme caution. It is particularly important at this time to evaluate syndromic surveillance data,including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate pictureof both inﬂuenza and COVID-19 activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVIDView(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview.html).ILINetNationwide during week 49, 1.6% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. This percentage is below thenational baseline of 2.6%.(http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/ﬂuportaldashboard.html)View Chart Data (current season only) (/ﬂu/weekly/weeklyarchives2020-2021/data/senAllregt49.html) | View Full Screen (/ﬂu/weekly/weeklyarchives2020-2021/ILI49.html)During week 49 compared with week 48, one region (Region 2) had an increase in the percentage of visits for ILI, oneregion (Region 10) had a decrease in percentage of visits for ILI, and the remaining regions remained stable (change of ≤0.1%). All ten regions reported a percentage of outpatient visits for ILI below their region-speciﬁc baselines.ILI Activity MapData collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity*(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1571167821424) by state/jurisdiction and Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA).

Due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILIsurveillance, and the fact that the state and territorial epidemiologists report relies heavily on ILI activity, reporting forthis system will be suspended for the 2020-21 inﬂuenza season.

Hospitalization rates will be presented once case counts increase toa level that produces stable rates; in the interim, case counts will be reported each week.Additional hospitalization surveillance information for current and past seasons and additional age groups:Additional hospitalization surveillance information for current and past seasons and additional age groups:Surveillance Methods (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#Hospitalization) | FluView Interactive: Rates by Age(https://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/FluHospRates.html) or Patient Characteristics (https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/FluHospChars.html)National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) MortalitySurveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281356004)Based on NCHS mortality surveillance data available on December 10, 2020, 14.3% of the deaths occurring during theweek ending December 5, 2020 (week 49), were due to pneumonia, inﬂuenza, and COVID-19 (PIC). This percentage isabove the epidemic threshold of 6.5% for week 49. Among the 3,052 PIC deaths reported for week 49, 2,113 had COVID-19 listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death on the death certiﬁcate and ﬁve listed inﬂuenza, indicating thatthe current increase in PIC mortality is due primarily to COVID-19 and not inﬂuenza.Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually coded causes of deathcollected from death certiﬁcates. Percentages of deaths due to pneumonia, inﬂuenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) are higheramong manually coded records than more rapidly available machine coded records. Due to the additional time neededfor manual coding, the initially reported PIC percentages are likely to increase as more data are received and processed.
