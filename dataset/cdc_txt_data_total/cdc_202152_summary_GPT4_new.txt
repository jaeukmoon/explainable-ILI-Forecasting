1. Influenza activity is increasing nationally with a positivity rate of 3.8% among respiratory specimens tested in clinical labs.
2. 98.1% of positive specimens from clinical labs were Influenza A, primarily A(H3N2). Influenza B accounted for 1.9%.
3. Hospitalization rates for influenza are rising, with a cumulative rate of 2.6 per 100,000 population; 94% of hospitalizations were Influenza A (all subtyped A(H3N2)).
4. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 19.9% of total deaths, largely driven by COVID-19 rather than influenza.
5. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness (4.8%) remain above baseline, with 31 jurisdictions reporting high or very high activity.
6. Influenza vaccination uptake appears to be lower compared to last season, though the CDC emphasizes vaccination as the best preventive measure with vaccines widely available.
7. Most circulating A(H3N2) viruses are genetically related to vaccine strains but show antigenic differences, reflecting ongoing evolution.
8. Influenza activity varies regionally, with eastern and central U.S. seeing higher levels, and contributions from other respiratory viruses, especially SARS-CoV-2.
9. Pediatric deaths remain minimal, with no influenza-associated deaths reported this week and only two for the season so far.
10. Reporting delays due to holidays may underestimate current influenza trends, but data suggest co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens complicates predictions.
