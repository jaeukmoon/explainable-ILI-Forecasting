During the reported period, the virologic surveillance through clinical and public health laboratories showed that 3.1% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza viruses. Influenza A viruses, specifically H3N2 and H1N1pdm09, dominated, while Influenza B viruses were also circulating.

Outpatient illness surveillance indicated that 1.4% of visits to healthcare providers were for influenza-like illness (ILI), which is below the national baseline of 2.4%.

Geographically, the majority of jurisdictions reported minimal ILI activity, but Louisiana experienced moderate ILI activity.

The geographic spread of influenza varied, with four jurisdictions reporting local flu activity, while others reported sporadic or no flu activity.

Hospitalization rates and pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality rates were below the epidemic thresholds.

No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during the current season. However, 138 pediatric deaths were reported during the previous season.

CDC expects flu activity to remain low but increase in the coming weeks. They recommend annual flu vaccination as the best way to protect against influenza and its complications. Antiviral drugs are also available for treatment.

Overall, these surveillance reports help predict the future occurrence of ILI and provide information on circulating virus types, geographic spread, and severity of disease.
