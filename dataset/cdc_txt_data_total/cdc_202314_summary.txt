The key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence from the provided CDC surveillance report are as follows:

1. Virologic surveillance: Clinical laboratories tested 3.1% of respiratory specimens positive for influenza viruses, which remained stable compared to the previous week. Influenza A viruses, specifically H3N2 and H1N1pdm09, were predominant in public health labs.

2. Outpatient illness surveillance: 1.4% of visits to healthcare providers were for ILI, remaining below the national baseline of 2.4%. Most jurisdictions experienced minimal ILI activity, with moderate activity reported in Louisiana.

3. Geographic spread: 4 out of 53 jurisdictions reported local flu activity, while the majority reported sporadic or no flu activity.

4. Severe disease: Hospitalization rates and P&I mortality rates were not provided in the report but will be updated later in the season.

5. Pediatric deaths: No influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported during the 2019-20 season, but 138 pediatric deaths were reported during the previous season.

6. CDC predicts that flu activity will remain low but increase in the coming weeks. They also recommend flu vaccination and antiviral drugs for prevention and treatment.

These facts provide an overview of the current flu activity and surveillance data, but more detailed information will be needed for accurate prediction of future ILI occurrence.
