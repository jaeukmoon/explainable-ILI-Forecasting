Based on the weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Reports from the CDC, the following key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence can be summarized:

1. Virologic Surveillance: The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories remains low (0.1%) and public health labs report unusually low numbers of positive influenza specimens.

2. Outpatient Illness Surveillance: ILI activity remains below the national baseline (0.9% of patient visits) but increased slightly from the previous week. ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.

3. Geographic Spread: Minimal ILI activity was reported in all jurisdictions, with no reports of widespread or high activity. ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.

4. Severe Disease: Hospitalization rates for influenza remain low compared to previous seasons. Pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 12.1% of deaths, above the epidemic threshold. However, the majority of PIC deaths were due to COVID-19 rather than influenza.

5. Pediatric Deaths: No influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported during the current season.

6. Influenza Virus Characterization: Data on genetic and antigenic characterization of circulating influenza viruses will be reported later this season.

7. Key Messages from CDC: CDC expects flu activity to remain low but may increase in the coming months. Annual flu vaccination is the best way to protect against influenza.

It is important to note that the ILI activity and other surveillance data may be impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and caution should be exercised when interpreting the results.
