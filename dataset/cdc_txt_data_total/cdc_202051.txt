Key Updates for Week 52, ending December 26, 2020Seasonal inﬂuenza activity in the United States remains lower than usual for this time of year.Seasonal inﬂuenza activity in the United States remains lower than usual for this time of year.Viruses
Clinical LabsThe percentage of respiratoryspecimens testing positive forinﬂuenza at clinical laboratoriesis 0.3% this week.(/ﬂu/weekly/#ClinicalLaboratories)
Public Health LabsThe number of inﬂuenzapositives reported by publichealth labs remains much lowerthan normal despite a higherthan normal number of testsperformed.(/ﬂu/weekly/#PublicHealthLaboratories)
Virus CharacterizationInﬂuenza virus characterizationinformation will be updatedweekly starting later this season.(/ﬂu/weekly/#ivc)Illness
Outpatient Illness: ILINetThe percentage of visits to a health care provider for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI) is at 1.6% this week, similar to week 51(change ≤ 0.1%). This is below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILI surveillance may be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map
This week, one jurisdiction experienced moderate ILI activity, two jurisdictions experienced low activity, and theremaining jurisdictions experienced minimal activity. ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemicand should be interpreted with caution.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsHospitalization rates will bepresented once case countsincrease to a level that producesstable rates; in the interim, casecounts will be reported eachweek.
NCHS Mortality13.6% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia, inﬂuenza, orCOVID-19 (PIC). This is above theepidemic threshold of 6.8%. Themajority of PIC deaths are due toCOVID-19.
Pediatric DeathsNo new inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric deaths were reportedto CDC this week. The total forthe 2020-21 season is one.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods (http://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm) page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/ﬂuviewinteractive.htm).Key PointsKey PointsFlu activity is unusually low at this time but may increase in the coming months.An annual ﬂu vaccine is the best way to protect against ﬂu and its potentially serious complications.If you haven’t gotten your ﬂu vaccine yet, get vaccinated now (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/season/protect-your-health.html).There are also ﬂu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat ﬂu illness.U.S. Virologic Surveillance:(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281228772)Clinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating inﬂuenzaviruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitorevolutionary changes that continually occur in inﬂuenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility ofinﬂuenza viruses to antiviral medications, including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir)and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated weekly starting later this season when a suﬃcient number of specimens havebeen tested.Outpatient Illness Surveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932)Please note, the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits forinﬂuenza-like illness (ILI), not laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza, and as such, will capture visits due to other respiratorypathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, that present with similar symptoms. In addition, healthcare-seeking behaviors havechanged dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are accessing the healthcare system in alternativesettings which may or may not be captured as a part of ILINet. Therefore, ILI data, including ILI activity levels, should beinterpreted with extreme caution. It is particularly important at this time to evaluate syndromic surveillance data,including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate pictureof both inﬂuenza and COVID-19 activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVIDView(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview.html).ILINetNationwide during week 52, 1.6% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. This percentage is below thenational baseline of 2.6%.(http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/ﬂuportaldashboard.html)View Chart Data (current season only) (/ﬂu/weekly/weeklyarchives2020-2021/data/senAllregt52.html) | View Full Screen (/ﬂu/weekly/weeklyarchives2020-2021/ILI52.html)During week 52, compared with week 51, the percentage of visits for ILI decreased in one region (Region 2) and remainedstable (change of ≤ 0.1%) in nine regions. All 10 regions reported a percentage of outpatient visits for ILI below theirregion-speciﬁc baselines.ILI Activity MapData collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity*(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1571167821424) by state/jurisdiction and Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA).

Due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILIsurveillance, and the fact that the state and territorial epidemiologists report relies heavily on ILI activity, reporting forthis system will be suspended for the 2020-21 inﬂuenza season.

This number is lower than average for this point in the seasonand comparable to counts seen at this point during the 2011-12 season. Hospitalization rates will be presented once casecounts increase to a level that produces stable rates; in the interim, case counts will be reported each week.Additional hospitalization surveillance information for current and past seasons and additional age groups:Additional hospitalization surveillance information for current and past seasons and additional age groups:Surveillance Methods (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#Hospitalization) | FluView Interactive: Rates by Age(https://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/FluHospRates.html) or Patient Characteristics (https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/FluHospChars.html)National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) MortalitySurveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281356004)Based on NCHS mortality surveillance data available on December 30, 2020, 13.6% of the deaths occurring during theweek ending December 26, 2020 (week 52), were due to pneumonia, inﬂuenza, and COVID-19 (PIC). This percentage isabove the epidemic threshold of 6.8% for week 52. Among the 1,848 PIC deaths reported for week 52, 1,215 had COVID-19 listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death on the death certiﬁcate and three listed inﬂuenza, indicating thatthe current increase in PIC mortality is due primarily to COVID-19 and not inﬂuenza.Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually coded causes of deathcollected from death certiﬁcates. Percentages of deaths due to pneumonia, inﬂuenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) are higheramong manually coded records than more rapidly available machine coded records. Due to the additional time neededfor manual coding, the initially reported PIC percentages are likely to increase as more data are received and processed.Because of the large number of deaths reported in recent weeks and the holidays, the delay in availability of  manuallycoded records may be longer than usual.
