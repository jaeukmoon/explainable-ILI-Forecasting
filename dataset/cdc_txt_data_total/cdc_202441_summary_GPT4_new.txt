1. Influenza activity remains low nationwide, with 0.8% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical labs.
2. All 38 influenza viruses reported by public health labs were Influenza A; 48.3% were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 51.7% were A(H3N2).
3. Influenza B accounted for 10% of positive specimens in clinical labs, but none were identified by public health labs.
4. Seven human cases of Influenza A(H5) were reported in California, linked to exposure at commercial dairy farms during an ongoing avian influenza outbreak.
5. The weekly influenza-associated hospitalization rate was 0.1 per 100,000, and 46 confirmed hospitalizations were reported since October 1, 2024.
6. Mortality due to influenza accounted for 0.04% of deaths, which remained stable compared to the prior week.
7. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) were 2.1%, stable from the previous week and below the national baseline of 3.0%; regional increases occurred in three HHS regions.
8. CDC emphasizes vaccination for individuals 6 months and older by end of October to mitigate flu impact.
9. High levels of resistance to adamantane antivirals persist for A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses, but susceptibility to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and baloxavir remains high.
10. Ongoing monitoring of an avian influenza A(H5N1) outbreak and regional variations in virus circulation will be critical for assessing future ILI risk.
