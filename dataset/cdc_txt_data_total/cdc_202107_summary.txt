First, the virologic surveillance data indicates that seasonal influenza activity remains lower than usual for this time of year. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza at clinical laboratories is 0.1%, and the number of influenza positives reported by public health labs remains unusually low.

Outpatient illness surveillance shows that 1.0% of patient visits to healthcare providers were for influenza-like illness (ILI), which is below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.

In terms of severe disease indicators, the hospitalization rate for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations is currently 0.6 per 100,000 population, which is lower than previous seasons. The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) is 19.3%, above the epidemic threshold of 7.2%. It is important to note that the majority of PIC deaths are due to COVID-19 rather than influenza.

There have been no reported influenza-associated pediatric deaths during the current season. All data provided are preliminary and subject to change as more reports are received.

The CDC emphasizes the importance of the annual flu vaccine as the best way to protect against influenza and its potential complications. They also highlight the availability of flu antiviral drugs for treatment.

The virologic surveillance data, outpatient illness surveillance, and severe disease indicators all contribute to the prediction and monitoring of future ILI occurrences, along with public health recommendations and additional national and international influenza surveillance information from various organizations and agencies.
