Inﬂuenza (Flu)Weekly U.S. Inﬂuenza Surveillance Report
Key Updates for Week 41, ending October 12, 2019According to this week’s FluView report, seasonal inﬂuenza activity remains low in the United States.According to this week’s FluView report, seasonal inﬂuenza activity remains low in the United States.Viruses
Clinical Lab3.4% of respiratory specimenstested in clinical laboratorieswere positive for inﬂuenzaviruses. This is slightly higherthan the previous week.
Public Health LabInﬂuenza A(H3N2) virusespredominated this week and arethe predominant virus at thispoint in the season.
Virus CharacterizationData for this season will bereported when a suﬃcientnumber of viruses have beencharacterized. Viruscharacterization data throughSeptember 28 is available.Illness
Outpatient Illness ILINet1.5% of visits to a health care provider were for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI). ILI activity remains belowbelow the nationalbaseline of 2.4% and is at the same level as the previous week.Outpatient Illness ILI Activity Map
The majority of jurisdictions experienced minimal ILIactivity; however, Louisiana experienced high ILIactivity.   
Geographic Spread
The majority of jurisdictions reported sporadic or noﬂu activity; however, Louisiana reported regionalactivity and 3 out of 54 jurisdictions reported localactivity.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsData for this season will beprovided when a suﬃcientnumber of hospitalizations havebeen reported.
P&I Mortality4.7% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia and inﬂuenza(P&I). This is belowbelow the epidemicthreshold of 5.7%.
Pediatric DeathsNo inﬂuenza-associated pediatricdeaths were reported to CDC thisweek. No pediatric deathsoccurring during the 2019-20season have been reported.
All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.An overview of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent, is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm.Key Messages from CDCKey Messages from CDCCDC expects ﬂu activity to increase in the coming weeks.An annual ﬂu vaccine is the best way to protect against inﬂuenza and its potentially serious complications.CDC recommends everyone 6 months or older get a ﬂu vaccine by the end of October.Flu antiviral drugs are prescription medications that can be used to treat ﬂu illness, and they work best whenused early (within two days of getting sick).U.S. Virologic SurveillanceThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below. Data from clinical laboratories(the percent of specimens tested that are positive for inﬂuenza) are used to monitor whether inﬂuenza activity isincreasing or decreasing.Clinical LaboratoriesClinical LaboratoriesWeek 41Week 41Data Cumulative sinceData Cumulative sinceSeptember 29, 2019 (week 40)September 29, 2019 (week 40)No. of specimens testedNo. of specimens tested16,67234,990No. of positive specimens (%)No. of positive specimens (%)573 (3.4%)1,075 (3.1%)Positive specimens by typePositive specimens by type      Inﬂuenza A    Inﬂuenza A150 (26.2%)311 (28.9%)    Inﬂuenza B    Inﬂuenza B423 (73.8%)764 (71.1%)

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatinginﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionarychanges that continually occur in inﬂuenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of inﬂuenza virusesto antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PAendonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated starting later this season when suﬃcient numbers of specimens have beentested.Outpatient Illness SurveillanceNationwide during week 41, 1.5% of patient visits reported through the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-like Illness SurveillanceNetwork (ILINet) were due to inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI). This percentage is below the national baseline of 2.4%. 
View National and Regional Level Graphs and Data | View Chart Data | View Full Screen | View PowerPoint Presentation On a regional level, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 1.0% to 2.6% during week 41. All regionsreported a percentage of outpatient visits for ILI below their region-speciﬁc baselines.Data collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity* by state. During week 41, the following ILI activitylevels were experienced:High – 1 state (Louisiana)Low – U.S. Virgin IslandsMinimal – District of Columbia, New York City, Puerto Rico and 49 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas,California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, NewHampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington,West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming)A Weekly Inﬂuenza Surveillance Report Prepared by the Inﬂuenza DivisionInﬂuenza-Like Illness (ILI) Activity Level Indicator Determined by Data Reported to ILINetprev Play Pause next4041weeks2019-20 Inﬂuenza Season Week 41 ending Oct 12, 2019
