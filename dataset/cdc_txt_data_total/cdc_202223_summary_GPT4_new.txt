Week23, 2022
1. Seasonal influenza activity is decreasing, with 3.4% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza this week.
2. Influenza A(H3N2) was the most frequently detected virus nationally, accounting for 98.8% of positive specimens in clinical labs and 99.3% in public health labs.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness accounted for 2.1% of healthcare visits, below the baseline, with a downward trend over the past four weeks.
4. Cumulative hospitalization rate is 17.1 per 100,000 population, with 2,089 new influenza-associated hospitalizations this week; the majority (96.5%) are related to Influenza A.
5. One pediatric influenza-associated death was reported this week, totaling 29 for the season.

9. Respiratory illness activity varied geographically, with 3 jurisdictions reporting high activity and no regions reporting very high activity.
10. Key predictive factors include late-season influenza activity, co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, evolving antigenic variations in H3N2 strains, and reduced outpatient respiratory care-seeking behavior.
