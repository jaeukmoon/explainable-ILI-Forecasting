Week31, 2021
1. Influenza activity remains low nationwide, with most ILI increases attributed to other respiratory viruses rather than influenza.
2. Outpatient visits for ILI accounted for 2.0%, an increase from last week but below the baseline of 2.6%; all regions except Region 7 are below their baseline.
3. ILI visits showed an increasing trend in all age groups over the past four weeks, with notable increases for age groups 25–49 and 50–64 years in week 31.
4. Clinical labs reported minimal influenza activity, and public health lab data indicated low influenza virus circulation.
5. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported in week 31; there has been only one pediatric death reported for the 2020–21 season.
6. PIC (pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19) accounted for 11.9% of deaths, exceeding the epidemic threshold of 5.5%, primarily driven by COVID-19 rather than influenza.
7. Hospitalization surveillance is not updated after April 30, 2021.
8. Variability in healthcare-seeking behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to limit the accuracy of ILI surveillance data.
9. High and moderate ILI activity levels were recorded in certain regions and CBSAs, indicating localized increases.
10. CDC emphasized the importance of vaccination; no new trends in vaccination rates were noted.

11. Summary: Influenza circulation remains minimal with low hospitalization rates and no pediatric mortality reported. ILI increases are likely caused by non-influenza respiratory illnesses, and predictive data is limited by healthcare behavior changes during the pandemic.
