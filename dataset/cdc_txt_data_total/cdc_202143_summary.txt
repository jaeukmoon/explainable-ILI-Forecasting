Seasonal influenza activity in the United States remains low, but there has been an increase in the number of influenza virus detections reported by public health laboratories in recent weeks. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories is 0.2%, and 0.2% of long-term care facilities reported at least one influenza-positive test among residents. In terms of outpatient illness, 1.9% of visits to healthcare providers were for influenza-like illness (ILI), which is below the national baseline of 2.5%. The ILI activity map shows that two jurisdictions experienced moderate ILI activity, while no jurisdictions reported high or very high activity. There have been no influenza-associated pediatric deaths reported in the current season. Mortality surveillance data indicate that 15.6% of deaths during the reported period were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19, which is above the epidemic threshold. Vaccination and antiviral drugs are recommended for prevention and treatment of influenza. Virus characterization data will be available later in the season to assess the similarity of circulating influenza strains to those included in the vaccines. Overall, the data suggests a low but increasing level of influenza activity, highlighting the importance of vaccination and other preventive measures.
