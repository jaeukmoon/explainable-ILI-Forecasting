First, influenza activity is still highest in the central and south-central regions of the country but appears to be declining slightly in these regions. However, influenza activity is increasing in the northeast and northwest regions.

The majority of influenza viruses detected are influenza A(H3N2).

The percentage of outpatient visits due to respiratory illness, including fever plus cough or sore throat (ILI), was stable compared to the previous week and remains below baseline. However, multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza to respiratory illness varies by location.

Hospitalization rates for influenza-associated hospitalizations are higher than the rates observed during the 2020-2021 season, but lower than the rates in the four seasons preceding the COVID-19 pandemic.

8.3% of the deaths that occurred during the reporting week were due to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19, above the epidemic threshold.

One influenza-associated pediatric death was reported during the reporting week for a total of 14 pediatric deaths so far this season.

It is important to note that these facts are based on preliminary data and may change as more reports are received.
