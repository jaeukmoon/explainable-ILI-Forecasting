Based on the provided report from the CDC, here are some key facts regarding predicting future ILI (influenza-like illness) occurrence:

1. Virologic surveillance: The percentage of positive specimens for influenza in clinical laboratories remained the same as the previous week at 3.1%. Influenza A viruses, specifically H3N2 and H1N1pdm09, predominated during the reported period.

2. Outpatient illness surveillance: 1.4% of visits to healthcare providers were for ILI, which is below the national baseline of 2.4%. ILI activity increased slightly from the previous week.

3. Geographic spread: 4 out of 53 jurisdictions reported local flu activity, while the remainder reported sporadic or no flu activity. Louisiana experienced moderate ILI activity.

4. Severe disease: Hospitalizations and P&I (pneumonia and influenza) mortality rates will be updated weekly starting later this season. The current P&I mortality rate is 5.0%, below the epidemic threshold of 5.6%.

5. Pediatric deaths: No influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported in the current season, but there were 138 pediatric deaths reported during the 2018-2019 season.

6. Future prediction: CDC expects flu activity to remain low but increase in the coming weeks. Annual flu vaccination is recommended for everyone 6 months or older, and flu antiviral drugs can be used for treatment.

These facts provide an overview of the current flu activity and surveillance, and they can help in predicting and preparing for future ILI occurrences.
