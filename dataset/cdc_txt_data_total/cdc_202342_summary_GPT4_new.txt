Week42, 2023
1. Influenza activity remains low nationally, with 1.7% of clinical respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza.
2. Of the 134 specimens reported by public health labs, 71.6% were Influenza A (89.3% A(H1N1) and 10.7% A(H3N2)) and 28.4% were Influenza B (100% Victoria lineage).
3. Cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza was 0.5 per 100,000 population, with a weekly hospitalization rate of 0.2 per 100,000.
4. Deaths attributed to influenza accounted for 0.08% of reported deaths, remaining stable from the previous week.
5. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) were 2.5%, which increased slightly but remained below the national baseline of 2.9%.
6. No pediatric influenza-associated deaths were reported this week.
7. Vaccination is recommended for individuals 6 months and older by the end of October, but no current vaccination trends were reported.
8. Respiratory activity data included contributions from multiple viruses (influenza, SARS-CoV-2, RSV), complicating attribution of ILI by pathogen.
9. Moderate ILI activity was observed in 5 jurisdictions, with 1 jurisdiction reporting high activity and others reporting minimal or low activity.
10. Influenza A(H1N1) predominates, showing genetic compatibility with current vaccine strains, while antiviral susceptibility data will follow later in the season.

11. Summary of key trends indicates that influenza remains low but shows regional increases, with modest rises in ILI visits and hospitalizations.
