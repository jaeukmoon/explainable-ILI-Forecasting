First, virologic surveillance is conducted through clinical laboratories to monitor the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza. In week 34, 0.5% of specimens tested positive for influenza, with Influenza A accounting for 87.1% and Influenza B accounting for 12.9% of positive specimens.

Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance, specifically the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), tracks visits to healthcare providers for influenza-like illness (ILI). In week 34, 1.8% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness.

Geographic activity levels of ILI are monitored, with varying levels reported across different jurisdictions. In week 34, there were moderate ILI activity levels in 3 jurisdictions, high activity levels in 1 jurisdiction, low activity levels in 2 jurisdictions, and minimal activity levels in 47 jurisdictions.

The geographic spread of influenza is assessed by state and territorial epidemiologists. In week 34, there were local flu activity reported in 4 states, sporadic activity reported in 42 states, no activity reported in 6 states, and no report from Guam.

Severe disease indicators include hospitalization rates and mortality rates from pneumonia and influenza (P&I). In week 34, 9.2% of deaths were attributed to P&I, which is above the epidemic threshold of 5.5%.

There was one reported influenza-associated pediatric death during the 2021-2022 season in week 34.

Public health recommendations include monitoring and surveillance through various systems, vaccination against influenza, and the use of antiviral drugs to treat flu illness.

Data collected are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. More detailed information on each surveillance component can be found on the CDC website.
