First, virologic surveillance plays a critical role in monitoring the prevalence of influenza viruses in clinical and public health laboratories. During week 31 of the 2022-2023 influenza season, 1.0% of specimens tested positive for influenza in clinical laboratories. In public health laboratories, 32.0% of specimens tested positive for Influenza A and 36.0% tested positive for Influenza B.
Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) tracks the percentage of patient visits for respiratory illness that meet the ILI definition (fever plus cough or sore throat). During week 31, 1.1% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat.
The geographic spread of influenza activity varies across jurisdictions. During week 31, no jurisdiction reported very high or high ILI activity levels. Two jurisdictions had moderate ILI activity levels, while one jurisdiction had low ILI activity levels, and the majority of jurisdictions reported minimal ILI activity. Additionally, ILI activity varies by age group, with higher percentages of visits for respiratory illness among younger age groups.
The Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) monitors laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations. Data for the 2022-2023 season are preliminary and continue to be updated. Information on hospitalization rates by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and more can be found on FluView Interactive.
Mortality surveillance tracks the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC). During week 31, 5.9% of deaths were attributed to PIC, which is above the epidemic threshold. However, it's important to note that the data are preliminary and may change as more information is received.
No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during week 31 of the 2022-2023 season. A total of 166 influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported for the season.
Additional influenza surveillance information can be accessed through FluView Interactive, national and international sources, and state and local health departments. These sources provide data on influenza activity, hospitalizations, mortality, and more.
