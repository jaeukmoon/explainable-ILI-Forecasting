Seasonal influenza activity in the United States remains lower than usual for this time of year. During the reported period, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories was 0.1%, and the number of influenza positives reported by public health labs remained unusually low. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) accounted for 1.1% of patient visits, below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILI activity levels varied across regions, with all jurisdictions experiencing minimal activity. The hospitalization rate for influenza-related illnesses was lower than average for this time of year, and mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 was above the epidemic threshold. No new influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported. It is important to note that ILI surveillance may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution. The CDC recommends getting an annual flu vaccine, as it is the best way to protect against influenza and its complications. Antiviral drugs are also available for the treatment of flu illness.
