3. Public health labs reported 98.3% of positive specimens as Influenza A (30.0% H1N1 and 70.0% H3N2) and 1.7% as Influenza B (all Victoria lineage).
4. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) accounted for 1.5% of healthcare visits, below the national baseline, with stable trends across all age groups.

8. Seasonal influenza co-circulates with other respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, complicating ILI trends.
9. CDC reports ongoing low vaccine effectiveness against influenza viruses, though most circulating strains remain antigenically similar to vaccine strains.
10. The CDC anticipates continued low flu activity but emphasizes monitoring variant strains and co-circulating respiratory viruses for potential risks.
