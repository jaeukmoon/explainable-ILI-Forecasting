The virologic surveillance data collected from clinical and public health laboratories indicates that the percentage of positive influenza specimens remains low. In week 40, 3.1% of specimens tested in clinical laboratories were positive for influenza viruses, similar to the previous week. Influenza A viruses, including H3N2 and H1N1pdm09, were predominant during this week.

Outpatient illness surveillance showed that 1.4% of visits to healthcare providers were for influenza-like illness (ILI). ILI activity remains below the national baseline of 2.4% but increased slightly from the previous week. Louisiana experienced moderate ILI activity, while the majority of jurisdictions reported minimal ILI activity.

Geographically, 4 out of 53 jurisdictions reported local flu activity, while the rest reported sporadic or no flu activity.

Hospitalization rates and mortality rates from pneumonia and influenza (P&I) were below their respective epidemic thresholds. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported for the current season.

Virus characterization data, including genetic and antigenic properties of circulating viruses, will be updated weekly later in the season. This information helps monitor vaccine effectiveness and antiviral medication susceptibility.

The CDC expects flu activity to remain low but increase in the coming weeks. The best way to protect against influenza is through annual flu vaccination, recommended for everyone aged 6 months and older. Antiviral drugs are also available for treatment of flu illness.
