First, virologic surveillance plays a crucial role in monitoring the percentage of specimens tested positive for influenza in clinical laboratories and the distribution of influenza virus types and subtypes in public health laboratories. During week 25 of the 2021-2022 influenza season, 1.8% of specimens tested positive in clinical laboratories, with the majority being Influenza A viruses (98.0%) and a small percentage being Influenza B viruses (2.0%). In public health laboratories, 98.4% of positive specimens were Influenza A viruses, with H3N2 being the most common subtype (100.0%). 

Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance, specifically through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), monitors healthcare visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat. During week 25, ILI activity accounted for 1.8% of patient visits reported through ILINet, which varies by age group, with the highest percentage in children aged 0-4 years (8.0%). 

Geographically, ILI activity levels varied, with one state (New York City) experiencing very high ILI activity, one state (Alaska) and one territory (Puerto Rico) experiencing high ILI activity, and two states (Connecticut and Colorado) experiencing moderate ILI activity during week 25. The majority of jurisdictions reported either low or minimal ILI activity. 

The influenza-associated hospitalization surveillance, conducted through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), provides preliminary data on laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations. Additional hospitalization surveillance data are reported through the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) and the HHS Protect system. 

Mortality surveillance focuses on tracking pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 related deaths. During week 25, one influenza-associated pediatric death was reported, bringing the total number of pediatric deaths for the season to 31. National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) mortality surveillance data were temporarily paused and are expected to resume regular reporting during week 26. 

In addition to domestic surveillance, international partners such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and their collaborating centers provide complementary influenza surveillance information. Multiple interactive tools and applications are available to visualize and analyze influenza data collected by CDC.
