The virologic surveillance data shows that the percentage of positive specimens for influenza in clinical laboratories remained low at 0.5% for week 30. Influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of positive specimens, with Influenza B viruses making up a smaller percentage.

Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance indicated that 1.6% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness, including fever plus cough or sore throat. The relative contribution of influenza virus infection to respiratory illness varied by location.

There were no reported influenza-associated pediatric deaths during week 30 of the 2021-2022 season. However, a total of 33 influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported during the season.

The mortality surveillance data showed that 10.0% of deaths in week 30 were due to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC), exceeding the epidemic threshold of 5.6% for the week. Most of the PIC deaths were primarily attributed to COVID-19 rather than influenza.

Overall, these surveillance findings suggest that influenza activity remains low, with minimal ILI activity and a low percentage of positive specimens for influenza. COVID-19 continues to be a significant contributor to respiratory illness and mortality.

It is important to note that all data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.
