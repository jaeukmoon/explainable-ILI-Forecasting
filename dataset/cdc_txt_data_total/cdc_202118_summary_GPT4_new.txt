Week18, 2021
1. Influenza activity remains unusually low, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories.
2. Of the clinical lab positive specimens, 45.5% were Influenza A and 54.5% were Influenza B.
3. Public health laboratories reported extremely low positivity rates, with no Influenza A subtyped cases and one Influenza B case attributed to the Victoria lineage.
4. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) were at 1.2%, stable compared to week 17, and remained below the national baseline of 2.6%.
5. The cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rate was 0.8 per 100,000, significantly lower than even the low-severity 2011-12 season.
6. 10.9% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), with the majority linked to COVID-19 rather than influenza.
7. No pediatric influenza-associated deaths occurred this week, and the seasonal total remains at one.
8. CDC emphasizes the importance of annual flu vaccination, but no significant updates on vaccination trends were reported.
9. ILI surveillance may be skewed due to changes in healthcare access and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, complicating data interpretation.
10. Future influenza activity remains uncertain given the concurrent impacts of COVID-19 and unusual influenza patterns.

11. Summary of other key factors:
12. - Minimal ILI activity was observed across all U.S. jurisdictions, consistent with low flu activity.
13. - Age-specific ILI rates showed a slight increase in the 0–4 years age group while remaining stable for other groups.
14. - Reporting delays, small sample sizes, and the dominant presence of COVID-19 continue to hinder the ability to predict influenza trends effectively.
