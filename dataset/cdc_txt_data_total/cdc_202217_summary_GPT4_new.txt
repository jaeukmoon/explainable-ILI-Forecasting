Week17, 2022
1. Influenza activity continues to increase in parts of the U.S., with 8.1% of clinical lab specimens testing positive for influenza this week.
2. Influenza A(H3N2) remains the dominant virus, accounting for 99.2% of subtyped cases in public health labs, while Influenza B cases are minimal (0%-0.7%).
3. Influenza-associated pediatric deaths increased to 24 this season, with one reported this week.
4. The cumulative hospitalization rate at 12.2 per 100,000 is higher than recent seasons prior to the COVID-19 pandemic but lower than four pre-pandemic seasons.
5. Outpatient respiratory illness visits accounted for 2.2% of healthcare visits, stable and below baseline, with moderate or high activity in 4 jurisdictions.
6. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) reached 7.2%, exceeding the epidemic threshold, though primarily driven by COVID-19.
7. Influenza antiviral resistance remains low, and only one A(H3N2) virus showed slightly reduced susceptibility to baloxavir.
8. Flu vaccines match closely for B/Victoria but show some antigenic differences for A(H3N2); CDC continues urging vaccinations as long as flu activity persists.
9. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses and variations in regional flu contributions make prediction of future ILI trends complex.
10. Weekly hospital admissions for influenza (3,070) decreased for the first time since January; healthcare-seeking behaviors remain influenced by pandemic patterns.
