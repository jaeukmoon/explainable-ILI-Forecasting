Firstly, the virologic surveillance system tracks the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories and public health laboratories. During the reported period, 1.1% of specimens tested positive in clinical labs, with a majority of Influenza A cases. In public health labs, 61.9% of positive specimens were Influenza A and 38.1% were Influenza B.
Secondly, outpatient respiratory illness surveillance, conducted through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), monitors visits for respiratory illness that includes fever plus a cough or sore throat. During the reported period, 1.5% of patient visits were due to respiratory illness that included ILI symptoms.
Additionally, the surveillance system tracks the geographic spread of influenza, with activity levels categorized as very high, high, moderate, low, minimal, or insufficient data. During the reported period, there were no jurisdictions with very high activity, one jurisdiction with high activity, one jurisdiction with moderate activity, two jurisdictions with low activity, and 50 jurisdictions with minimal activity.
The hospitalization surveillance system, known as FluSurv-NET, provides population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in select counties in 13 states. However, no specific data or statistics are provided in the given report.
In terms of mortality surveillance, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) monitors deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19. During the reported week, 6.1% of deaths were attributed to these causes, which is above the epidemic threshold of 6.0%.
Finally, pediatric mortality surveillance reports on influenza-associated deaths in children. During the reported week, two influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported, bringing the total number of pediatric deaths for the current season to 159.
Overall, the surveillance systems provide ongoing data on virologic activity, outpatient illness, geographic spread, hospitalizations, mortality, and pediatric deaths to monitor and inform public health responses to influenza.
