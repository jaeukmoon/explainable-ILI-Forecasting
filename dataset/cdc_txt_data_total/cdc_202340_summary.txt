First, virologic surveillance plays a critical role by monitoring the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories. During the reported week, 1.1% of specimens tested positive for influenza, with a higher proportion of influenza A viruses compared to influenza B viruses.
Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance is another important component, which monitors the percentage of healthcare visits for respiratory illness (ILI). For the reported week, 2.2% of visits were due to respiratory illness, which is below the national baseline of 2.9%.
Hospitalization surveillance provides information on the number of patients admitted to hospitals with laboratory-confirmed influenza. The number of hospitalizations remains low.
Mortality surveillance tracks the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC). During the reported week, 0.05% of deaths were due to influenza, which remained stable compared to the previous week.
Lastly, it is recommended that everyone aged 6 months and older gets an annual influenza vaccine, as it is the best way to protect against influenza and its complications. Antiviral drugs can also be used to treat influenza illness.
These surveillance activities, along with other data and surveillance systems, help predict and track influenza activity and inform public health recommendations and interventions.
