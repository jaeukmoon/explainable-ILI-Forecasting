First, seasonal influenza activity in the United States remains lower than usual for this time of year. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical labs is 0.1% this week, which is very low. Public health labs have reported unusually low numbers of positive influenza specimens.

Outpatient illness surveillance shows that 1.3% of patient visits in week 20 were due to influenza-like illness (ILI), which is below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.

The geographic spread of influenza is reported as minimal in all jurisdictions. There have been no reported pediatric deaths associated with influenza during the 2020-2021 season.

The overall picture suggests that flu activity remains low, and the COVID-19 pandemic may be affecting ILI reporting.
