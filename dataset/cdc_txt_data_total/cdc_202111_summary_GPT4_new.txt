1. Seasonal influenza activity remains unusually low in the U.S., with clinical labs reporting only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza.
2. Of the 21 positive specimens from clinical labs this week, 61.9% were Influenza A and 38.1% were Influenza B.
3. Public health labs reported 12 positive specimens; all were Influenza A, with no subtype information available.
4. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) accounted for 0.9% of all visits, remaining stable and well below the national baseline of 2.6%.
5. The cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rate was 0.7 per 100,000, significantly lower than previous seasons, including the mild 2011-12 season.
6. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 12.1% of deaths, exceeding the epidemic threshold of 7.1%, with most deaths attributed to COVID-19.
7. No new pediatric influenza-associated deaths were reported this week; the cumulative pediatric death total for the season remains at one.
8. A case of human infection with a novel influenza A(H1N1)v virus, linked to swine exposure, was identified, with no evidence of human-to-human transmission.
9. Data interpretation for ILI trends remains challenging due to the impact of COVID-19, including changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and overlapping symptoms.
10. CDC notes that influenza activity, while low, may increase in coming months, urging continued influenza vaccinations and the use of antiviral treatments.

11. Summary of key trends: Continued low influenza activity combined with COVID-19 challenges traditional surveillance interpretations, while novel influenza virus monitoring and unusual PIC mortality patterns highlight areas of ongoing public health focus.
