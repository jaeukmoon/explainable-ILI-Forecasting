1. Influenza activity remains low, with 0.8% of clinical lab specimens testing positive nationwide.
2. Of 214 positive specimens in clinical labs, 52.3% were Influenza A and 47.7% were Influenza B.
3. Public health labs identified 34 positive specimens, with 58.8% being Influenza A and 41.2% Influenza B; all Influenza B specimens characterized were of the Victoria lineage.

6. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 6.1% of deaths, exceeding the epidemic threshold of 5.5%; only 6 deaths listed influenza as a cause.
7. There were four influenza-associated pediatric deaths reported, with two from prior seasons.
8. The CDC notes moderate ILI activity in certain areas, although most regions report minimal activity.
9. Influenza A accounted for 97.4% of cumulative positive specimens since October 2022, with H1N1pdm09 dominating over H3N2.
10. CDC recommends vaccination, though no significant vaccination trend updates are included this week.
