Based on the above information from the CDC's weekly influenza surveillance reports, here are the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence:

1. Virologic Surveillance: The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories remained stable at 0.8%. Influenza A viruses were more predominant than Influenza B viruses.

2. Outpatient Respiratory Illness: Nationwide, 1.9% of patient visits were due to respiratory illness (ILI), which is below the national baseline of 2.5%. ILI activity remained stable compared to the previous week.

3. Geographic Spread: Most jurisdictions reported minimal ILI activity, while one jurisdiction experienced moderate activity. Four out of 53 jurisdictions reported local flu activity.

4. Severe Disease: Hospitalization rates for influenza will be updated weekly, but the current rate remained low. Pneumonia and influenza mortality was below the epidemic threshold.

5. Pediatric Deaths: No pediatric deaths associated with influenza have been reported during the current season.

6. Recommendations: CDC expects flu activity to remain low but increase. Vaccination is still the best way to protect against influenza, and flu antiviral drugs can be used for treatment.

These facts and surveillance data provide important insights into the current and future flu activity, allowing for better preparedness and response.
