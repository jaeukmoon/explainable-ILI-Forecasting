Week19, 2021
1. Influenza activity remains unusually low, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza this week.
2. Of the 22 positive clinical lab specimens, 59.1% were Influenza A and 40.9% were Influenza B.
3. Public health labs reported no positive influenza specimens for week 19.
4. The cumulative hospitalization rate is 0.8 per 100,000 population, significantly lower than past seasons and one-tenth the rate of the 2011-12 season.
5. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 10.1% of deaths, which is above the epidemic threshold of 6.4%, with most due to COVID-19.
6. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported this week, with a cumulative total of one for the season.
7. Outpatient visits for ILI accounted for 1.2% of visits, stable compared to last week and below the national baseline of 2.6%.
8. All U.S. jurisdictions reported minimal ILI activity during week 19.
9. Flu vaccination remains encouraged by the CDC, but no new vaccination trend data is provided.
10. ILI data is impacted by alternative healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating cautious interpretation.

11. Summary of key factors for prediction: Sustained low influenza activity, continued impact of COVID-19 on ILI data, and minimal outpatient visits suggest low flu transmission this season. Low hospitalization rates and mortality data reflect the reduced severity of influenza during the pandemic period.
