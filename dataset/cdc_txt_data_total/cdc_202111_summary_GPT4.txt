- **Viruses, illness, and deaths:** Influenza activity remains unusually low, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories. Influenza A accounted for 61.9%, while Influenza B was 38.1%. One pediatric death has been reported this season. 12.1% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), predominantly due to COVID-19.

- **U.S. virologic surveillance:** Clinical lab specimens show Influenza A constituted 35.3% cumulatively, and Influenza B 64.7%. Public health labs reported Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and H3N2 with minimal activity. Cumulative data reveal Influenza A cases dominated at 60.5%, with 39.5% attributed to Influenza B.

- **Cumulative hospitalization rate:** The cumulative hospitalization rate is 0.7 per 100,000 population, five times lower than during the 2011-12 low-severity season.

- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza:** Among PIC deaths, none were associated with influenza this week, highlighting the dominant impact of COVID-19.

- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B:** Influenza A accounts for 61.9% of current clinical positives and 60.5% of public health lab positives. Influenza B makes up 38.1% and 39.5%, respectively.

- **Novel Influenza virus:** One human infection with a novel influenza A(H1N1)v virus was reported from North Carolina. The case was linked to swine exposure with no human-to-human transmission identified.

- **Vaccination trends:** CDC continues recommending annual flu vaccination to prevent potential influenza complications. Low flu activity suggests compliance may be impacted by pandemic factors.

- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits:** 0.9% of outpatient visits were for influenza-like illness (ILI), below the national baseline of 2.6%. All jurisdictions reported minimal ILI activity.

- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC:** Influenza activity remains low but may increase in the coming months.

- **Other key factors:** An increasing ILI trend was observed in children aged 0–4 years over the past 10 weeks, while other age groups showed stable or decreasing trends. ILI data may be impacted by COVID-19 and alternative healthcare access.
