Week16, 2021
1. Influenza activity remains unusually low for this time of year, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories.
2. Public health labs reported 2 positive specimens in Week 16, divided equally between Influenza A (50%) and Influenza B (50%).
3. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) held steady at 1.1%, well below the national baseline of 2.6%.
4. The cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rate is 0.8 per 100,000 population, significantly lower than in past seasons.
5. No pediatric deaths were reported this week, with the seasonal total at one.
6. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 11.8% of total deaths, surpassing the epidemic threshold of 6.7%; COVID-19 is the primary contributor.
7. Influenza A accounted for 55.6% of positive clinical lab specimens, while Influenza B made up 44.4%.
8. Vaccination reminders were issued, but no new trends in vaccination rates were highlighted.
9. Healthcare-seeking behaviors and ILI data remain impacted by COVID-19, requiring cautious interpretation of trends.
10. Flu activity is expected to remain low, but simultaneous surveillance of influenza and COVID-19 complicates long-term predictions.

11. Summary of insights: Influenza activity is exceptionally low, with minimal ILI activity across all jurisdictions, and COVID-19 remains the dominant driver of PIC deaths. Predictive trends are hindered by altered healthcare behaviors and concurrent COVID-19 monitoring.
