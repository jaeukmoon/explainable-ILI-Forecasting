During the reported week, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical labs was 0.3%, indicating low influenza activity. Public health labs also reported a lower number of influenza positives than usual. Outpatient illness surveillance showed that 1.6% of healthcare visits were for influenza-like illness (ILI), which is below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILI activity varied across jurisdictions, with one experiencing moderate activity and the rest reporting minimal activity. Hospitalization rates and pediatric deaths were not reported for the week. Mortality surveillance showed that 13.6% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), above the epidemic threshold. No new influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported. The CDC expects flu activity to remain low but may increase in the coming months. Vaccination and antiviral drug use are recommended for prevention and treatment. Virologic surveillance provides information on viral strains and their resistance to antiviral medications. All data are preliminary and may be subject to change.
