Week34, 2022
- **Viruses, illness, and deaths:** Influenza A accounted for 87.1% of clinical lab positives and 97.5% of public health lab positives. Influenza B remained minimal at 12.9% in clinical labs and 2.5% in public health labs. There were 9.2% of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC), with primary contributions from COVID-19. One influenza-associated pediatric death was reported for the 2021-2022 season in week 34, raising the season's total to 34.  
- **U.S. virologic surveillance:** Clinical labs reported 0.5% positive specimens for week 34, with a cumulative 3.9% positivity since October 2021. Public health labs identified 99.4% of cumulative positives as influenza A, predominantly H3N2 (82.1% for week 34, 99.8% cumulatively) and minimal H1N1 (17.9% for week 34, 0.2% cumulatively). Minimal detection of Influenza B (Victoria lineage only).  
- **Cumulative hospitalization rate:** FluSurv-NET ceased detailed data updates after June 11, 2022. However, HHS Protect reported 486 influenza-related hospitalizations during week 34.  
- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza:** PIC-related deaths exceeded the epidemic threshold (5.5%) at 9.2%, with the majority linked to COVID-19, not influenza.  
- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B:** Influenza A dominates, making up 87.1% of clinical lab positives (97.5% in public health labs for week 34). Cumulatively, influenza B accounts for 1.6% across clinical labs and 0.6% in public health labs.  
- **Novel influenza virus (like COVID-19):** No detection of novel influenza viruses such as H3N2v during this period. COVID-19 remains the significant contributor to respiratory illnesses and mortality rates.  
- **Vaccination trends:** No specific vaccination coverage data was provided. Ongoing emphasis on vaccination preparedness for flu is critical.  
- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits:** 1.8% of outpatient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness (fever plus cough or sore throat), with highest percentages among children 0-4 years (7.0%). Multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, were co-circulating.  
- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC:** No specific projections were mentioned; flu activity remains sporadic with low positivity rates overall.  
- **Other key factors:** Among 14,510 long-term care facilities, 28 (0.2%) reported influenza-positive tests among residents. ILI activity was minimal in 47 jurisdictions, with variability by region.  

Key insights: Influenza A H3N2 predominates in circulation with limited influenza B activity. COVID-19 is the major driver of PIC-associated mortality. Pediatric influenza-related deaths continue, though rates remain low. Monitoring co-circulating respiratory viruses will be crucial.
