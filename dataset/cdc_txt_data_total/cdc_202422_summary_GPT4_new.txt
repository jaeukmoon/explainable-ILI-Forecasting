Week22, 2024
1. Seasonal influenza activity remains low nationwide; 1.8% of clinical respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza this week.
2. Influenza A accounted for 73.6% of positive clinical lab specimens, while Influenza B made up 26.4%.
3. Public health labs reported 77 positive specimens, with 66.2% Influenza A (41.7% H1N1 and 58.3% H3N2) and 33.8% Influenza B (100% Victoria lineage).
4. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness were 1.9%, below baseline levels, with no jurisdictions reporting moderate or higher activity.
5. The weekly hospitalization rate for influenza was 0.2 per 100,000 population, far below the peak observed earlier in the season.
6. Deaths attributed to influenza accounted for 0.1% this week, with one pediatric influenza death reported, bringing the season total to 173.
7. CDC estimates this season has seen at least 35 million illnesses, 390,000 hospitalizations, and 24,000 deaths related to influenza.
8. No novel influenza viruses were detected, and no significant changes in antiviral resistance were reported for circulating influenza strains.
9. CDC continues to recommend annual flu vaccination, but current vaccination trends were not highlighted.
10. Co-circulating respiratory viruses (influenza, COVID-19, and RSV) contribute variably to ILI trends based on regional activity.

11. Other key predictive factors:
12. - Antiviral susceptibility remains stable, with rare instances of reduced inhibition to antiviral drugs.
13. - Genetic characterization indicates most circulating viruses match current vaccine components, suggesting effective vaccine coverage.
14. - Influenza activity variability by region suggests localized monitoring is critical for predicting future trends.
