Week2, 2023
1. Influenza activity continues to decline nationally, with 4.6% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza this week in clinical laboratories.
2. Of the clinical lab positive specimens, 97.3% were Influenza A, and 2.7% were Influenza B, with public health labs reporting 97.6% Influenza A (81.3% A(H3N2) and 18.7% A(H1N1)) and 2.4% Influenza B (Victoria lineage).
3. Outpatient visits due to influenza-like illness (ILI) accounted for 3.0% of visits, a decline from the previous week but still above the national baseline of 2.5%.
4. Hospitalization rates remain high, with a cumulative rate of 56.7 per 100,000 population, 1.6 times higher than historical averages, though admissions declined compared to the prior week.
5. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 13.1%, remaining above the epidemic threshold; influenza-related contributions to PIC deaths have been decreasing for four weeks.
6. Six pediatric deaths from influenza were reported this week, bringing the total for the season to 85; all were associated with Influenza A.
7. Genetic and antigenic characterization indicates most circulating viruses are antigenically similar to those in the current vaccine, with viruses showing susceptibility to all tested antivirals.
8. Vaccination continues to be recommended, with the flu vaccine matching circulating virus strains, though no new vaccination trends are noted.
9. SARS-CoV-2 continues co-circulating with influenza, with 3.2% of hospitalized influenza patients also testing positive for COVID-19.
10. Other significant factors include reduced outpatient respiratory illness activity at the regional level and high hospitalization rates among older adults and young children, signaling continued vulnerability in these groups.
