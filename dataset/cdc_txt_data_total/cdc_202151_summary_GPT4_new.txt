1. Influenza activity is increasing across the U.S., with influenza A(H3N2) predominantly detected and regional variation in virus circulation.
2. Clinical labs reported 6.2% positivity for influenza, with 98.7% of positive specimens being Influenza A and 1.3% Influenza B.
3. Public health labs found 99.7% of positive specimens were Influenza A, almost all subtype H3N2.
4. Outpatient respiratory illness visits increased, accounting for 3.8% of visits nationwide, above baseline, with multiple respiratory viruses co-circulating.
5. Hospitalization rates are rising, with a cumulative rate of 1.8 per 100,000 and 1,825 new influenza-related admissions reported this week.
6. Mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) reached 19.2%, exceeding the epidemic threshold, but influenza-specific deaths remain minimal (12 reported).
7. No pediatric influenza deaths were reported this week; two have been reported for the season.
8. Early signs suggest lower flu vaccination uptake compared to the previous season, but vaccination and antiviral treatments are strongly recommended as flu activity increases.
9. Flu activity is just beginning and is likely to grow; most detected H3N2 viruses are genetically similar to vaccine strains but show some antigenic differences due to ongoing virus evolution.
10. Young adults (ages 5-24) initially comprise the largest proportion of Influenza A(H3N2) cases, but cases among adults aged 25+ are increasing.
11. Data interpretation may be affected by changes in healthcare-seeking and reporting delays due to holidays.
12. Regional influenza activity shows varying levels, with moderate-to-high activity in central and eastern U.S. while the western region remains lower.
