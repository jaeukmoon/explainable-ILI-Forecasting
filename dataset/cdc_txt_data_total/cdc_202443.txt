Summary Viruses Illness All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. Directional arrows indicate changes between the current week and the previous week. Additional information on the arrows can be found at the bottom of this page. A description of the CDC influenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each data component is available on the surveillance methods page.1 Additional information on the current and previous influenza seasons for each surveillance component are available on FluView Interactive. Key Points‎ • Seasonal influenza activity remains low nationally.• Percent positivity for influenza and the percentage of emergency department visits for influenza are stable at low levels.• During Week 43, of the 98 viruses reported by public health laboratories, 93 were influenza A and 5 were influenza B. Of the 62 influenza A viruses subtyped during Week 43, 20 (32.3%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 35 (56.5%) were A(H3N2), and 7 (11.3%) were A(H5).• Eight human infections with influenza A(H5) virus were reported to CDC this week.• No influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2024-2025 season were reported this week. However, one pediatric death occurring during the 2023-2024 season was reported. This brings last season's total to 203 influenza associated pediatric deaths.• CDC recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older get an annual influenza (flu) vaccine, ideally by the end of October.1• There are prescription flu antiviral drugs that can treat flu illness; those should be started as early as possible and are especially important for higher risk patients.2• Influenza viruses are among several viruses contributing to respiratory disease activity. CDC is providing updated, integrated information about COVID-19, flu, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity on a weekly basis. COVID-19, flu, and RSV activity U.S. virologic surveillance Nationally and in all 10 HHS regions, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza virus in clinical laboratories remained low and stable (change of <0.5 percentage points) compared to the previous week. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses are co-circulating; however, the distribution of circulating viruses varies by region. For regional and state level data and age group distribution, FluView Interactive. Viruses known to be associated with recent receipt of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or found upon further testing to be a vaccine virus are not included, as they are not circulating influenza viruses. Clinical Laboratories The results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below. Data from clinical laboratories (the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for influenza virus) are used to monitor whether influenza activity is increasing or decreasing.

To date, human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H5) virus has not been identified in the United States. One confirmed case was reported by the California Department of Public Health. This case occurred in a worker at a commercial dairy cattle farm where highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses had been detected in cows. There have now been 16 total confirmed human cases in California. Seven confirmed cases were reported by the Washington State Department of Health. These cases occurred among workers performing depopulation activities at a commercial poultry facility where HPAI A (H5N1) viruses had been detected in birds. There have now been nine total confirmed human cases in Washington. All 8 individuals with confirmed influenza A(H5) virus infection reported to CDC this week are aged >18 years. These individuals had mild symptoms, which they reported to local health department officials. Specimens were collected from the individuals and were initially tested at state or local public health laboratories using the CDC influenza A(H5) assay before being sent to CDC for further testing. Specimens from the individuals were positive for influenza A(H5) virus using diagnostic rRT-PCR at CDC. Additional analysis including genetic sequencing is underway. In response to these detections, additional case investigations and surveillance activities are being conducted by public health officials in California and Washington. An up-to-date human case summary during the 2024 outbreak by state and exposure source is available at www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html Information about avian influenza is available at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/index.htm. Interim recommendations for Prevention, Monitoring, and Public Health Investigations are available at https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/prevention/hpai-interim-recommendations.html. The latest case reports on avian influenza outbreaks in wild birds, commercial poultry, backyard or hobbyist flocks, and mammals in the United States are available from the USDA at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai. Additional information regarding human infections with novel influenza A viruses:‎ Surveillance Methods | FluView Interactive Influenza Virus Characterization CDC performs genetic and antigenic characterization of U.S. viruses submitted from state and local public health laboratories according to the Right Size Roadmap submission guidance. These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating influenza viruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current influenza vaccines. The data are also used to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur in influenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir. The HA clade and subclades were assigned using Nextclade (https://clades.nextstrain.org). CDC has genetically characterized 746 influenza viruses collected since May 19, 2024. Virus Subtype or Lineage Genetic Characterization Total No. of Subtype/Lineage Tested HA Clade Number (% of subtype/lineage tested) HA Subclade Number (% of subtype/lineage tested) A/H1 239 5a.2a 133 (44.5%) C.1 1 (0.3%) C.1.9 132 (44.1%) 5a.2a.1 166 (55.5%) C.1.1 2 (0.7%) D 150 (50.2%) D.1 1 (0.3%) D.2 1 (0.3%) D.3 8 (2.7%) D.4 4 (1.3%) A/H3 344 2a.3a 1 (0.3%) G.1.3.1 1 (0.3%) 2a.3a.1 343 (99.7%) J.1 10 (2.7%) J.2 366 (97.1%) B/Victoria 66 3a.2 66 (100%) C.5 2 (2.9%) C.5.1 54 (77.1%) C.5.6 9 (12.9%) C.5.7 5 (7.1%) B/Yamagata 0 Y3 0 Y3 0 CDC antigenically characterizes influenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) (H1N1pdm09, H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses) or neutralization-based HINT (H3N2 viruses) using antisera that ferrets make after being infected with reference viruses representing the 2023-2024 Northern Hemisphere recommended cell or recombinant-based vaccine viruses. Antigenic differences between viruses are determined by comparing how well the antibodies made against the vaccine reference viruses recognize the circulating viruses that have been grown in cell culture. Ferret antisera are useful because antibodies raised against a particular virus can often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody titer differences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared to the reference (vaccine) virus. In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer differences of less than or equal to 8-fold. Viruses selected for antigenic characterization are a subset representing the genetic changes in the surface proteins and may not be proportional to the number of such viruses circulating in the United States. Influenza A Viruses A (H1N1)pdm09: 64 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized by HI, and 61 (95.3%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/67/2022-like reference viruses representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. A (H3N2): 166 A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by HI or HINT, and 127 (76.5%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer in HI or reacting at titers that were less than or equal to 8-fold of the homologous virus in HINT) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Massachusetts/18/2022-like reference viruses representing the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. Influenza B Viruses B/Victoria: 26 influenza B/Victoria-lineage virus were antigenically characterized by HI, and all were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown B/Austria/1359417/2021-like reference viruses representing the B/Victoria component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. B/Yamagata: No influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were available for antigenic characterization. Assessment of Virus Susceptibility to Antiviral Medications CDC assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to the antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using next generation sequence analysis supplemented by laboratory assays. Information about antiviral susceptibility test methods can be found at U.S. Influenza Surveillance: Purpose and Methods. Viruses collected in the U.S. since May 19, 2024, were tested for antiviral susceptibility as follows: Viruses collected in the U.S. tested for antiviral susceptibility Antiviral Medication Total Viruses A/H1 A/H3 B/Victoria Neuraminidase Inhibitors Oseltamivir Viruses Tested 736 296 374 66 Reduced Inhibition 0 0 0 0 Highly Reduced Inhibition 2 (0.3%) 2 (0.7%) 0 0 Peramivir Viruses Tested 736 296 374 66 Reduced Inhibition 0 0 0 0 Highly Reduced Inhibition 2 (0.3%) 2 (0.7%) 0 0 Zanamivir Viruses Tested 736 296 374 66 Reduced Inhibition 0 0 0 0 Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 0 0 0 PA Cap-Dependent Endonuclease Inhibitor Baloxavir Viruses Tested 690 254 366 70 Decreased Susceptibility 0 0 0 0 Two A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses had NA-H275Y amino acid substitution conferring highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir. High levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) viruses (the adamantanes are not effective against influenza B viruses). Therefore, use of these antivirals for treatment and prevention of influenza A virus infection is not recommended and data from adamantane resistance testing are not presented. Outpatient and Emergency Department Illness Surveillance Outpatient respiratory illness visits The U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness [ILI (fever plus cough or sore throat)], not laboratory-confirmed influenza, and will therefore capture respiratory illness visits due to infection with any pathogen that can present with similar symptoms, including influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. It is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. Nationally, during Week 43, 2.2% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. This week's percentage remained stable (change of ≤ 0.1 percentage points) compared to Week 42 but is trending upwards slightly since early October. Nationally and in all 10 HHS regions, the percentage of visits for ILI are below their respective baselines. The percentage of visits for ILI increased in regions 4, 6, and 9, and remained stable in all other regions (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10) in Week 43 compared to Week 42. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varies by location.
