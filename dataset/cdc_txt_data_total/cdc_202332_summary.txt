First, virologic surveillance is conducted through clinical laboratories and public health laboratories to monitor the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza and the distribution of influenza virus types and subtypes. During the reported period, 0.8% of specimens tested positive for influenza, with a mix of Influenza A and Influenza B viruses.

Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance, specifically the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), tracks visits for respiratory illnesses that include fever plus cough or sore throat. In week 32, 1.3% of patient visits were due to such illnesses. It should be noted that ILINet captures visits for all respiratory pathogens, including influenza and other viruses.

Geographic activity levels of influenza, determined by ILINet data, varied across jurisdictions. Some areas reported minimal activity, while others reported low levels of activity.

Hospitalization surveillance is conducted through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET). However, no data for hospitalization rates were provided in the report.

Mortality surveillance monitors deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19. During the reported week, 6.1% of reported deaths were attributed to these causes, which is above the epidemic threshold.

There were four influenza-associated pediatric deaths reported during week 32, bringing the total number of pediatric deaths for the season to 168. The report did not provide further details about the specific influenza strains associated with these deaths.

The report also provides information on additional national and international influenza surveillance resources, including FluView Interactive, state and local influenza surveillance websites, WHO Collaborating Centers for Influenza, and public health agencies in other countries.

Overall, the report provides data on various surveillance components that help monitor and track influenza activity. However, some information, such as hospitalization rates, was not available in the provided report.
