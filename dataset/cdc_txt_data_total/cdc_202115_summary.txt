First, the virologic surveillance indicates that in week 15, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories was 0.1%, and the number of influenza positive specimens reported by public health labs remained unusually low.

Outpatient illness surveillance shows that during week 15, 1.1% of patient visits to healthcare providers were for influenza-like illness (ILI), which is below the national baseline of 2.6%. All jurisdictions experienced minimal ILI activity during this week.

In terms of severe disease, the hospitalization rate for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations was 0.8 per 100,000 population, which is much lower than previous seasons. The mortality surveillance data shows that 12.4% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19, above the epidemic threshold for week 15. However, it is important to note that the majority of PIC deaths are due to COVID-19 and not influenza.

There were no influenza-associated pediatric deaths reported during week 15, and only one influenza-associated pediatric death has been reported for the 2020-2021 season.

Overall, seasonal influenza activity remains lower than usual for this time of year, likely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to continue monitoring surveillance data and take preventive measures such as receiving the annual flu vaccine and using antiviral drugs for treatment.
