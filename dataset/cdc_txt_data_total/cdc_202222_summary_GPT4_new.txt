1. Influenza activity increased in certain parts of the U.S., with 5.9% of clinical specimens testing positive for influenza, primarily Influenza A(H3N2).
2. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness (ILI) represented 2.3%, trending below the national baseline, with regions 4 and 10 above their thresholds.
3. Two jurisdictions reported very high activity, and two reported high activity for respiratory illness.
4. Cumulative hospitalization rate reached 16.7 per 100,000 population, with adults aged 65+ (highest at 48.4) and children 0-4 years (21.2) most impacted.
5. No national mortality data was available this week; three pediatric deaths were reported, adding up to 28 deaths this season.
6. Of circulating influenza viruses this season, 99% were Influenza A (majority H3N2) and 1% Influenza B.
7. Among Influenza positives tested, 4.3% showed coinfection with SARS-CoV-2.
8. Influenza vaccine remains recommended for all individuals aged 6 months and older as activity continues. Vaccine virus matches appear partial due to some antigenic differences in H3N2 strains.
9. Surveillance highlighted multiple co-circulating respiratory viruses, impacting varying regions and age groups.
10. Virus resistance remains low, with only one H3N2 virus showing reduced susceptibility to baloxavir.

11. Summary highlights variability across regions, age disparities in hospitalizations, vaccine significance, and mixed respiratory virus contributions affecting prediction of future ILI trends.
