The virologic surveillance for the inﬂuenza season indicates that the percentage of specimens testing positive for inﬂuenza in clinical labs is currently 1.1%. Inﬂuenza A and B viruses are both circulating, with Inﬂuenza A accounting for 49.4% of positive specimens and Inﬂuenza B accounting for 50.6%.
The outpatient respiratory illness surveillance shows that 1.9% of patient visits reported through the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat. This data provides insight into the level of ILI activity across different age groups.
The ILI activity map indicates that most jurisdictions and Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) experienced minimal ILI activity, while two states and two CBSAs had high ILI activity levels during the reported week.
The geographic spread of inﬂuenza, as assessed by state and territorial epidemiologists, shows that four states reported local inﬂuenza activity, while the remainder reported sporadic activity or no activity.
In terms of severe disease, the mortality surveillance data indicates that 6.2% of deaths during the reported week were due to pneumonia, inﬂuenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC), which is at the epidemic threshold. Two inﬂuenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported, one from the current season and one from the previous season.
The national and international inﬂuenza surveillance information provided links to various resources for additional inﬂuenza data from different countries and organizations.
Overall, these surveillance findings provide valuable information on virologic trends, ILI activity, geographic spread, and severe disease outcomes, which are instrumental in predicting and monitoring future ILI occurrences.
