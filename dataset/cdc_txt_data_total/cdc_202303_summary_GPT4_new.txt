Week3, 2023
1. Influenza activity is declining nationally, with 3.0% of respiratory specimens testing positive, primarily Influenza A (96%) over Influenza B (4%).
2. Among Influenza A viruses, 73% were A(H3N2) and 27% were A(H1N1).
3. Outpatient respiratory illness visits accounted for 2.6% of visits, slightly above the national baseline, with moderate-to-high activity in 10 jurisdictions.
4. The cumulative hospitalization rate was 58.1 per 100,000, 1.4 times higher than in-season hospitalization rates seen in past years at this point, with adults 65+ most affected.
5. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 12% of deaths, exceeding the epidemic threshold, with influenza-related mortality decreasing in recent weeks.
6. Six additional pediatric deaths were reported, all due to Influenza A, bringing the seasonal total to 91.
7. No cases of antiviral resistance were detected, and most circulating viruses were antigenically similar to the vaccine strain.
8. CDC estimates 25 million illnesses, 280,000 hospitalizations, and 17,000 deaths from influenza so far this season.
9. 1.7% of long-term care facilities reported outbreaks, a decrease from the previous week.
10. Flu activity is expected to continue to decline, though co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, impacts disease trends.

11. Summary: Influenza A(H3N2) remains dominant, severe outcomes like hospitalizations and deaths are elevated but declining, and vaccination remains effective.
