Inﬂuenza (Flu)Weekly U.S. Inﬂuenza Surveillance Report
NoteNote: The COVID-19 pandemic is aﬀecting healthcare seeking behavior. The number of persons and their reasonsfor seeking care in the outpatient and ED settings is changing. These changes impact data from ILINet in ways thatare diﬃcult to diﬀerentiate from changes in illness levels, therefore ILINet data should be interpreted with caution.CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVIDView.
Key Updates for Week 18, ending May 2, 2020Laboratory conﬁrmed ﬂu activity as reported by clinical laboratories remains low. Inﬂuenza-like illnessLaboratory conﬁrmed ﬂu activity as reported by clinical laboratories remains low. Inﬂuenza-like illnessactivity continues to decrease and is below the national baseline. The percent of deaths due toactivity continues to decrease and is below the national baseline. The percent of deaths due topneumonia or inﬂuenza (P&I) is decreasing but remains elevated, primarily due to COVID-19, notpneumonia or inﬂuenza (P&I) is decreasing but remains elevated, primarily due to COVID-19, notinﬂuenza.

Outpatient Illness: ILINetVisits to health care providers for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI) decreased from 1.8% last week to 1.5% this week. ILI isbelow baseline nationally and for all regions.
Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map
One jurisdiction experienced high ILI activity this weekcompared to three jurisdictions that experienced highactivity last week.
Geographic Spread
No jurisdictions reported regional or widespreadinﬂuenza activity this week.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsThe overall cumulativehospitalization rate for theseason increased to 69.2 per100,000.
P&I MortalityThe percentage of deathsattributed to pneumonia andinﬂuenza is 7.4%, down from12.3% last week, but above theepidemic threshold of 6.7%.
Pediatric DeathsFour inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric deaths occurring duringthe 2019-2020 season werereported this week. The total forthe season is 174.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive.U.S. Virologic SurveillanceClinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below. Data from clinical laboratories(the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for inﬂuenza) are used to monitor whether inﬂuenza activity isincreasing or decreasing.

This percentage is below the national baseline of 2.4%.View Chart Data (current season only) | View Full ScreenOn a regional level, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 0.9% to 2.8% during week 18. Compared to lastweek, the percent of outpatient visits for ILI increased slightly in region 7, but decreased in all other regions. All regionsreported a percentage of outpatient visits for ILI below their region-speciﬁc baselines.ILI Activity MapData collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity* by state.During week 18, the following ILI activity levels were experienced:High – one state (Maryland)Moderate – Puerto Rico and two states (New Jersey and Wisconsin)Low – three states (Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Vermont)Minimal - the District of Columbia, New York City, and 44 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California,Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana,Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, NorthCarolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota,Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming)Data were insuﬃcient to calculate an ILI activity level from the U.S. Virgin Islands.A Weekly Inﬂuenza Surveillance Report Prepared by the Inﬂuenza DivisionInﬂuenza-Like Illness (ILI) Activity Level Indicator Determined by Data Reported to ILINetprev Play Pause next40
