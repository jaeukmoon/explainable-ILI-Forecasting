Week14, 2024
1. Seasonal influenza activity is elevated but decreasing nationally, with 7.7% of clinical respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza this week.
2. Public health labs reported 272 positive specimens, with 58.8% Influenza A and 41.2% Influenza B; subtyped Influenza A included 43.3% A(H1N1)pdm09 and 56.7% A(H3N2).
3. Outpatient visits for ILI accounted for 2.8%, now below the national baseline, with moderate or high activity in only eight jurisdictions.
4. Hospitalization rates decreased, with a cumulative rate of 76.0 per 100,000 population—the second highest observed at this point in season since 2017–2018.
5. Influenza-associated deaths accounted for 0.4% of total deaths, stable from last week; five pediatric deaths were reported, totaling 138 deaths this season.
6. Of all reported hospitalizations, 85.1% were associated with Influenza A, with the highest hospitalization rates in those 65+ years, non-Hispanic Black persons, and children aged 0–4 years.
7. Vaccine viruses remain genetically and antigenically similar to circulating strains; CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination and antiviral treatment.
8. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 and RSV, contributes to respiratory illness trends and complicates attribution to influenza.
9. Regions 7, 5, and 1 have the highest positivity rates for Influenza, with notable variability in the distribution of Influenza subtypes across regions.
10. CDC expects further declines in flu activity but highlights continued spread, underscoring vaccination and early antiviral use, particularly for those at high risk.
