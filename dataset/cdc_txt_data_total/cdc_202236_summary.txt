Based on the data provided in the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance report, here are the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence:

1. Virologic Surveillance: The data from clinical laboratories shows that 3.1% of respiratory specimens tested positive for inﬂuenza viruses. Inﬂuenza A viruses (H3N2 and H1N1) and Inﬂuenza B viruses were circulating during the reported period.

2. Outpatient ILI Surveillance: 1.4% of visits to healthcare providers were for ILI, which is below the national baseline of 2.4%. ILI activity increased slightly from the previous week.

3. Geographic Spread: The majority of jurisdictions reported minimal ILI activity, but Louisiana experienced moderate ILI activity. Only 4 out of 53 jurisdictions reported local ﬂu activity, while the rest reported sporadic or no ﬂu activity.

4. Severe Disease: Hospitalization rates and P&I mortality data were not provided in the report.

5. Pediatric Deaths: No inﬂuenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported for the 2019-20 season.

From the key messages, it can be inferred that CDC expects ﬂu activity to remain low but increase in the coming weeks. They recommend everyone 6 months or older to get a ﬂu vaccine by the end of October and mention the availability of ﬂu antiviral drugs for treatment.

It is important to note that these facts are based on the specific report provided and may change as new data is received.
