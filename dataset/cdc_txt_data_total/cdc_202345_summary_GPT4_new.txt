1. Influenza activity is increasing nationally, especially in the South Central, Southeast, and West Coast regions, with 4.0% of clinical respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza this week.
2. Out of 310 viruses reported by public health labs this week, 75.8% were Influenza A, and 24.2% were Influenza B. Of subtyped Influenza A viruses, 87.2% were H1N1 and 12.8% were H3N2.
3. Outpatient respiratory illness visits accounted for 3.5% of visits, above the baseline (2.9%) and up slightly from last week, with increases in 9 of 10 HHS regions; 8 jurisdictions reported moderate activity, and 9 reported high or very high activity.
4. The cumulative flu-related hospitalization rate is 1.7 per 100,000 population, with weekly admissions continuing to rise; seniors (65+ years) have the highest rates.
5. Only 0.10% of deaths were attributed to influenza this week, remaining stable. No new pediatric influenza deaths were reported.
6. CDC estimates 780,000 illnesses, 8,000 hospitalizations, and 490 deaths from influenza so far this season.
7. Influenza A comprised 71.4% of clinical lab positives this week, with Influenza B accounting for 28.6%.
8. Genetic and antigenic analyses indicate circulating viruses are well-matched to current vaccine strains.
9. Vaccination is strongly encouraged for everyone aged 6 months and older; antiviral drugs are recommended for high-risk groups.
10. Other respiratory viruses, such as RSV and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), continue to circulate alongside influenza.

11. Summary of insights for predictions: Increasing activity, rising hospitalization rates, regional differences, and co-circulation of other respiratory viruses suggest continued influenza spread in high-activity regions.
