1. Influenza activity is low nationally, with 0.7% of clinical lab specimens testing positive, primarily Influenza A (94.3%) over Influenza B (5.7%).
2. Public health labs confirmed 38 positive specimens, all Influenza A, mainly H3N2 (85.2%), and no Influenza B reported.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI accounted for 1.9% of visits, with notable variation across age groups (7.8% in children under 4 and lower rates in older groups).
4. Two human infections with novel influenza A (H1N2v) were identified in Michigan and Wisconsin; no evidence of person-to-person transmission was found.
5. Mortality from pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 9.2% of deaths, surpassing the epidemic threshold, with most attributable to COVID-19.
6. One pediatric death associated with Influenza A (H3) was reported for the 2021-2022 season, bringing the total to 35 pediatric deaths.
7. Hospitalizations for influenza reached 577 cases in week 36, with cumulative hospitalization data for the season being updated.
8. 23 long-term care facilities reported at least one influenza-positive resident, representing 0.2% of reporting facilities.
9. Vaccination trends were not explicitly discussed, but annual influenza vaccination remains encouraged by CDC.
10. Respiratory illness surveillance shows co-circulation of multiple viruses (e.g., RSV, SARS-CoV-2), complicating attribution to influenza activity.
