Week40, 2020
- **Viruses, illness, and deaths:** Influenza activity remains low in the U.S., with 0.2% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza. Influenza A accounted for 52.9% of positive clinical lab specimens, and influenza B accounted for 47.1%. 7.0% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), above the epidemic threshold of 5.6%. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported this season.  
- **U.S. virologic surveillance:** Influenza positivity remains minimal, with only one influenza A case detected in public health labs in Week 40. No influenza B has been identified in public health labs.  
- **Cumulative hospitalization rate:** Hospitalization data is not yet available for the 2020-21 season.  
- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza:** PIC deaths (7.0%) are above the epidemic threshold; this includes COVID-19 influences in mortality trends.  
- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B:** Clinical labs report influenza A at 52.9% and influenza B at 47.1%. Public health labs detect only influenza A without any subtyping.  
- **Novel Influenza virus (like COVID-19):** No novel influenza viruses have been reported this season. COVID-19 remains a major focus in overlapping surveillance.  
- **Vaccination trends:** The CDC continues to recommend vaccination for everyone aged 6 months or older, emphasizing flu vaccines as the best protection.  
- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits:** 1.1% of outpatient visits were for influenza-like illness (ILI), which remains below the national baseline of 2.6%. Healthcare-seeking patterns have shifted due to COVID-19.  
- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC:** Flu activity is expected to remain low as of this week, but the CDC continues to monitor trends, particularly with the confounding impact of COVID-19.  
- **Other key factors:** COVID-19 is impacting healthcare behaviors and surveillance systems, making historical comparisons difficult and increasing reliance on broader surveillance integration. Geographic spread data have been paused this season.
