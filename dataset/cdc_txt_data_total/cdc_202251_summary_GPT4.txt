- **Viruses, illness, and deaths**: Influenza activity remains elevated nationwide. Of 875 viruses reported by public health labs, 85.5% were Influenza A and 14.5% were Influenza B. Among Influenza A subtypes, 79.0% were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 21.0% were A(H3N2). Seven pediatric deaths were reported this week, bringing the season's total to 20. CDC estimates 7.1 million illnesses, 73,000 hospitalizations, and 4,500 deaths this flu season.

- **U.S. virologic surveillance**: Clinical labs reported 16.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza this week (up from Week 50), with 81.4% being Influenza A and 18.6% Influenza B. Public health labs show 85.5% of cases as Influenza A and 14.5% as Influenza B, predominantly A(H1N1)pdm09.

- **Cumulative hospitalization rate**: The cumulative influenza hospitalization rate is 15.4 per 100,000, the second highest for Week 51 since 2010. Adults aged 65+ have the highest rate (38.8 per 100,000).

- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza**: 0.5% of deaths were attributed to influenza this week, increasing slightly from the previous week.

- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B**: Influenza A accounts for 85.5% of public health lab positives; Influenza B accounts for 14.5%. Subtyping shows 79.0% A(H1N1)pdm09 and 21.0% A(H3N2).

- **Novel influenza virus (like COVID-19)**: No novel influenza viruses or significant new variants were detected.

- **Vaccination trends**: CDC urges vaccination for those aged 6 months and older as influenza viruses continue to spread, noting ongoing benefits of vaccination this season.

- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits**: ILI visits were 6.1% nationwide, above the 2.9% baseline for the eighth consecutive week and higher than Week 50. High or very high activity was reported in 33 jurisdictions.

- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC**: Influenza activity is expected to remain elevated with continued increases in several areas.

- **Other key factors**: Regions 8, 6, 4, and 3 reported the highest positivity rates for respiratory specimens (20.2%-25.4%). Hospitalizations and ILI activity are increasing nationally, driven primarily by Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.
