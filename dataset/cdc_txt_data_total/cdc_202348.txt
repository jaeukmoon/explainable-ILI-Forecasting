Region 10 (Paci_c Northwest) is at its region-speci_c outpatient respiratory illness baseline, and regions 1-9 areabove their region-speci_c baselines.The number of weekly 4u hospital admissions continues to increase.Four in4uenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during Week 48, bringing the 2023-2024 season total to 12pediatric deaths.During Week 48, of the 547 viruses reported by public health laboratories, 437 (79.9%) were in4uenza A and 110 (20.1%)were in4uenza B. Of the 294 in4uenza A viruses subtyped during week 48, 218 (74.1%) were in4uenza A(H1N1) and 76(25.9%) were A(H3N2).CDC estimates that there have been at least 2.6 million illnesses, 26,000 hospitalizations, and 1,600 deaths from 4u sofar this season.CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual 4u vaccine, as there are still vaccines available.Nowis still a good time to get vaccinated if you haven’t already.There also are prescription 4u antiviral drugs that can be used to treat 4u illness; those should be started as early aspossible and are especially important for higher risk patients.Flu viruses are among several viruses that contribute to respiratory disease activity. CDC is providing updated,integrated information about COVID-19, 4u, and RSV activity on a weekly basis.1 
2  3U.S. Virologic SurveillanceNationally and in HHS Regions 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for in4uenza in clinicallaboratories increased (change of ≥0.5 percentage points) compared to the previous week. Regions 1 and 10 continue trendingupward while region 6 and 8 remained stable compared to the previous week. The regions with the highest percent positivitywere regions 8 (13.1%), 4 (10.9%), 6 (8.9%), and 9 (8.6%). Since Week 40, in4uenza A(H1N1)pdm09 has been the predominantvirus circulating in all regions. A larger combined proportion (37%) of the viruses detected by public health labs have beenin4uenza B in regions 4 and 6 compared to other regions (7-20%). For regional and state level data and age group distribution,please visit FluView Interactive. Viruses known to be associated with recent receipt of live attenuated in4uenza vaccine (LAIV) orfound upon further testing to be a vaccine virus are not included, as they are not circulating in4uenza viruses.Clinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

View Chart Data | View Full ScreenAdditional virologic surveillance information for current and past seasons:Additional virologic surveillance information for current and past seasons:Surveillance Methods | FluView Interactive: National, Regional, and State Data or Age DataIn2uenza Virus CharacterizationCDC performs genetic and antigenic characterization of viruses submitted by U.S. state and local public health laboratoriesaccording to the Right Size Roadmap submission guidance. These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatingin4uenza viruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in current in4uenza vaccines. The data are alsoused to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur in in4uenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also testssusceptibility of circulating in4uenza viruses to in4uenza antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors(oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.  CDC has genetically characterized 1,005 in4uenza viruses collected since May 1, 2023.  
CDC antigenically characterizes in4uenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) (H1N1pdm09, H3N2, B/Victoria, andB/Yamagata viruses) or neutralization-based HINT (H3N2 viruses) using antisera that ferrets make after being infected withreference viruses representing the 2023-2024 Northern Hemisphere recommended cell or recombinant-based vaccine viruses.Antigenic dilerences between viruses are determined by comparing how well the antibodies made against the vaccinereference viruses recognize the circulating viruses that have been grown in cell culture. Ferret antisera are useful becauseantibodies raised against a particular virus can often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HIassays, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody titer dilerences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared tothe reference (vaccine) virus. In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer dilerences ofless than or equal to 8-fold. Viruses selected for antigenic characterization are a subset representing the genetic changes in thesurface proteins seen in genetically characterized viruses.In4uenza A VirusesIn4uenza A VirusesA (H1N1)pdm09: A (H1N1)pdm09: One hundred and thirty-four A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized by HI, and all werewell-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grownA/Wisconsin/67/2022-like reference viruses representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based in4uenza vaccines.A (H3N2): A (H3N2): Fifty-one A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by HI or HINT, and all were well-recognized (reactingat titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer in HI or reacting at titers that were less than or equal to 8-foldof the homologous virus in HINT) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021-like reference viruses representing theA(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based in4uenza vaccines.In4uenza B VirusesIn4uenza B VirusesB/Victoria: B/Victoria: Eighty in4uenza B/Victoria-lineage virus were antigenically characterized by HI, and all were well-recognized(reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grownB/Austria/1359417/2021-like reference viruses representing the B/Victoria component for the cell- and recombinant-basedin4uenza vaccines.B/Yamagata: B/Yamagata: No in4uenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were available for antigenic characterization. Assessment of Virus Susceptibility to Antiviral MedicationsAssessment of Virus Susceptibility to Antiviral MedicationsCDC assesses susceptibility of in4uenza viruses to the antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir,zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using next generation sequence analysis supplementedby laboratory assays. Information about antiviral susceptibility test methods can be found at U.S. In4uenza Surveillance: Purposeand Methods | CDC.Viruses collected in the U.S. since October 01, 2023 were tested for antiviral susceptibility as follows:
High levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among in4uenza A(H1N1)pdm09 andin4uenza A(H3N2) viruses (the adamantanes are not elective against in4uenza B viruses). Therefore, use of these antivirals fortreatment and prevention of in4uenza A virus infection is not recommended and data from adamantane resistance testing arenot presented.Virus Subtype orVirus Subtype orLineageLineageGenetic CharacterizationGenetic CharacterizationTotal No. ofTotal No. ofSubtype/LineageSubtype/LineageTestedTestedHAHACladeCladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)HAHASubcladeSubcladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)A/H1A/H15416B.1A.5a541 (100%)2a170 (31.4%)2a.1371 (68.6%)A/H3A/H31133C.2a1b.2a113 (100%)2a.1b1 (0.9%)2a.3a5 (4.4%)2a.3a.1106 (93.8%)2b1 (0.9%)B/VictoriaB/Victoria351V1A351 (100%)3a.2351 (100%)B/YamagataB/Yamagata0Y30Y30 (0%)

It is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of othersources of surveillance data to obtain a more complete and accurate picture of in4uenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratoryvirus activity. CDC is providing integrated information about COVID-19, in4uenza and RSV activity on a website that is updatedweekly. Information about other respiratory virus activity can be found on CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric VirusSurveillance System (NREVSS) website.Outpatient Respiratory Illness VisitsNationwide during Week 48, 4.0% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included feverplus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. This has remained stable compared to Week 47 and is above the nationalbaseline of 2.9% for the _fth consecutive week. ILI activity increased in regions 1, 3, 5, and 9, decreased slightly in Region 6, andremained stable but trending upward in all other regions (regions 2, 4, 7, 8, and 10) during Week 48 compared to Week 47. Allregions are at or above their region-speci_c baselines this week. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relativecontribution of in4uenza virus infection to ILI varies by location.Season: Percentage of Outpatient Visits for Respiratory Illness Reported byThe U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet),Weekly National Summary, 2023-24 Season and Selected Previous Seasons

FluSurv-NET hospitalization data are preliminary. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates areupdated accordingly.A total of 1,696 laboratory-con_rmed in4uenza-associated hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites between October1, 2023, and December 2, 2023; 1,452 (85.6%) were associated with in4uenza A virus, 229 (13.5%) with in4uenza B virus, 4 (0.2%)with in4uenza A virus and in4uenza B virus co-infection, and 11 (0.6%) with in4uenza virus for which the type was notdetermined. Among those with in4uenza A subtype information, 273 (83.7%) were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 52 (16.0%) were A(H3N2).The weekly hospitalization rate observed in Week 48 was 1.4 per 100,000 population. The overall cumulative hospitalization ratefor the season was 5.5 per 100,000 population. This cumulative hospitalization rate is the second highest cumulative in-seasonhospitalization rate observed in Week 48, following the 2022-2023 season (26.0). Cumulative in-season hospitalization ratesobserved in Week 48 from 2010-2011 through 2021-2022 ranged from 0.2 to 2.7.When examining rates by age, the highest cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population was among adults aged 65years and older (13.6), followed by adults aged 50-64 years (7.1) and children aged 0-4 years (5.9). When examining unadjustedrates by race and ethnicity, the highest rate of hospitalization per 100,000 population was among non-Hispanic Black persons(9.9), followed by non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons (5.5), Hispanic persons (5.2), non-Hispanic Asian/Paci_cIslander persons (4.2), and non-Hispanic White persons (3.9).
