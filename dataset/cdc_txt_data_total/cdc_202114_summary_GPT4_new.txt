1. Seasonal influenza activity in the U.S. remains unusually low, with only 0.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical labs.
2. Of positive clinical lab specimens, 53.3% were Influenza A and 46.7% were Influenza B.
3. Public health labs reported no positive specimens this week.
4. A new human infection with novel Influenza A(H1N1)v was reported in Wisconsin, bringing the total novel cases for the season to three (two A(H1N1)v and one A(H3N2)v).
5. Nationwide, outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) accounted for 1.1% of visits, stable from last week and below the 2.6% baseline.
6. All jurisdictions reported minimal ILI activity, though data may be affected by COVID-19 trends and alternative healthcare-seeking behaviors.
7. The cumulative hospitalization rate is 0.8 per 100,000, significantly lower than previous seasons and one-eighth the rate of the 2011-12 season at this time.
8. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 11.2% of deaths, above the epidemic threshold of 6.9%, with the majority attributed to COVID-19.
9. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported this week; one has been reported this season.
10. CDC encourages annual flu vaccination but reported no significant updates on vaccination trends this week.

11. Key insights: The persistently low influenza activity during this period, likely impacted by COVID-19 preventive measures, along with minimal novel virus transmission, suggests a reduced likelihood of significant influenza spread in the short term. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and overlapping COVID-19 trends complicate ILI data interpretation for future predictions.
