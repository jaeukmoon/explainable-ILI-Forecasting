Week44, 2024
1. Influenza activity nationally remains low, with slight increases observed among pediatric cases.
2. Clinical labs reported 947 positive specimens (1.6% positivity); 92.7% were Influenza A and 7.3% Influenza B.
3. Public health labs reported 134 positive specimens, 94.8% Influenza A and 5.2% Influenza B, with A(H1N1)pdm09 (52.4%) and A(H3N2) (43.8%) dominating.
4. Eleven human cases of Influenza A(H5) were reported this week, with no evidence of human-to-human transmission.
5. The first pediatric death of the 2024-2025 season was reported, alongside a belatedly reported pediatric death from the prior season.
6. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) increased slightly to 2.5%, remaining below the national baseline.
7. Emergency department visits for influenza were stable at 0.3%; increases were seen in the 0-4 and 5-17 age groups.
8. Hospitalization rates remained low, with a cumulative rate of 0.7 per 100,000 population since the season’s start.
9. Mortality attributed to influenza was stable at 0.04%, showing no significant change from the previous week.
10. CDC recommends annual flu vaccination for individuals aged 6 months and older; no significant changes in vaccination trends were noted.
11. Co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, continues to impact ILI data and surveillance.
12. Regional variations highlight uneven distribution of circulating influenza subtypes A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2).
13. Two influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses showed highly reduced inhibition to antivirals oseltamivir and peramivir.
14. Future flu activity remains uncertain due to ongoing viral co-circulation and regional differences in strain distributions.
