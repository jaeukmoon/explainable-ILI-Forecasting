Based on the weekly influenza surveillance report from CDC for Week 34 of the 2020-2021 influenza season:

1. Virologic Surveillance:
   - Clinical laboratories testing respiratory specimens detected influenza activity.
   - Public health laboratories monitored the proportion of circulating influenza viruses, primarily Influenza A.

2. Outpatient Illness Surveillance:
   - ILINet reported that 2.2% of patient visits were due to influenza-like illness (ILI), which is below the national baseline of 2.6%.
   - ILI activity varied across different regions.

3. Geographic Spread:
   - ILI activity levels ranged from minimal to moderate in most jurisdictions.
   - Some jurisdictions reported low or insufficient data to determine ILI activity levels.

4. Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations:
   - The FluSurv-NET network monitored laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations.
   - Data on hospitalizations after April 30, 2021, were excluded from the surveillance.

5. Pneumonia and Influenza (P&I) Mortality:
   - 19.4% of deaths during the reporting week were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19, which was above the epidemic threshold.
   - Most deaths were primarily due to COVID-19 rather than influenza.

6. Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality:
   - No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during week 34 of the current season.
   - One pediatric death associated with influenza was reported for the entire season.

These facts provide an overview of the influenza surveillance data collected during the specified week, including virologic activity, outpatient illness, hospitalizations, mortality, and pediatric cases.
