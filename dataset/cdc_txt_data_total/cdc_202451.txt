Summary Viruses Illness All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. Directional arrows indicate changes between the current week and the previous week. Additional information on the arrows can be found at the bottom of this page. A description of the CDC influenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each data component is available on the surveillance methods page.1 Additional information on the current and previous influenza seasons for each surveillance component are available on FluView Interactive. Key Points • Seasonal influenza activity continues to increase across the country. • Nationally, percent positivity for influenza, the percentage of emergency department visits for influenza, percentage of outpatient visits for respiratory illness, and influenza-associated hospitalizations increased this week compared to last week. • During Week 51, of the 1,132 viruses reported by public health laboratories, 1,110 were influenza A and 22 were influenza B. Of the 818 influenza A viruses subtyped during Week 51, 356 (43.5%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 461 (56.4%) were A(H3N2), and 1 (0.1%) were A(H5). • Five confirmed influenza A(H5) cases were reported to CDC this week. To date, human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H5) virus has not been identified in the United States. • Five pediatric deaths associated with seasonal influenza virus infection were reported this week, bringing the 2024-2025 season total to nine pediatric deaths. • CDC estimates that there have been at least 3.1 million illnesses, 37,000 hospitalizations, and 1,500 deaths from flu so far this season. • CDC recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older get an annual influenza (flu) vaccine.1 • There are prescription flu antiviral drugs that can treat flu illness; those should be started as early as possible and are especially important for patients at higher risk for severe illness.2 • Influenza viruses are among several viruses contributing to respiratory disease activity. CDC is providing updated, integrated information about COVID-19, flu, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity on a weekly basis. COVID-19, flu, and RSV activity U.S. virologic surveillance Nationally, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza virus in clinical laboratories increased (change of ≥ 0.5 percentage points) compared to the previous week. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) were the predominant viruses reported this week. For regional and state level data and age group distribution, please visit FluView Interactive. Viruses known to be associated with recent receipt of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or found upon further testing to be a vaccine virus are not included, as they are not circulating influenza viruses. Clinical Laboratories The results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

The data do not reflect specimens tested only at CDC and could include more than one specimen tested per person. The guidance for influenza A(H5) virus testing recommends testing both a conjunctival and respiratory swab for people with conjunctivitis which has resulted in more specimens testing positive for influenza A(H5) virus than the number of human A(H5) cases. For more information on the number of people infected with A(H5) viruses, please visit the "How CDC is monitoring influenza data among people to better understand the current avian influenza A (H5N1) situation" †When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a "variant" influenza virus. Most human infections with variant influenza viruses occur following exposure to swine, but human-to-human transmission can occur. It is important to note that in most cases, variant influenza viruses have not shown the ability to spread easily and sustainably from human-to-human.

View Chart Data Additional virologic surveillance information for current and past seasons: Surveillance Methods | FluView Interactive: National, Regional, and State Data or Age Data Novel Influenza A Virus Five confirmed cases of influenza A(H5) were reported to CDC this week. To date, human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H5) virus has not been identified in the United States. Three of these cases were reported by the California Department of Public Health. The cases occurred in workers aged ≥18 years at commercial dairy cattle farms in an area where highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses had been detected in cows. The individuals had mild symptoms, which they reported to local health department officials. There have now been 37 total confirmed cases and one probable case in California during the 2024-2025 influenza season. One case was reported by the Wisconsin Department of Health. This case occurred in an individual aged ≥18 years who worked at a poultry facility where HPAI A(H5N1) virus had been identified in birds. This individual developed respiratory symptoms during Week 50. Specimens were collected from the individual and initially tested at the state public health laboratories using the CDC influenza A(H5) assay before being sent to CDC for further testing. Influenza A(H5) virus was confirmed at CDC. This is the first influenza A(H5) case in Wisconsin. One case was reported by the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services. This case occurred in an individual aged ≥18 years who worked at a poultry facility where HPAI A(H5N1) virus had been identified in birds. This individual developed conjunctivitis and respiratory symptoms during Week 50. Specimens were collected from the individual and initially tested at the State Hygienic Laboratory at the University of Iowa using the CDC influenza A(H5) assay before being sent to CDC for further testing. Influenza A(H5) virus was confirmed at CDC. This is the first influenza A(H5) case in Iowa. Notification to WHO of the cases reported by the Wisconsin and Iowa departments of health was initiated per International Health Regulations (IHR). More information regarding IHR can be found at http://www.who.int/topics/international_health_regulations/en/. No additional notification to WHO of the cases exposed to dairy cows in California is required per International Health Regulations (IHR).

Additional information regarding human infections with novel influenza A viruses: Surveillance Methods | FluView Interactive Influenza Virus Characterization CDC performs genetic and antigenic characterization of U.S. viruses submitted from state and local public health laboratories according to the Right Size Roadmap submission guidance. These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating influenza viruses are to the reference viruses representing the current influenza vaccines. The data are also used to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur in influenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the polymerase acidic protein (PA) endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir. The HA clade and subclades were assigned using Nextclade (https://clades.nextstrain.org). CDC has genetically characterized 577 influenza viruses collected since September 29, 2024. Influenza Virus Characterization from viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29, 2019 Virus Subtype or Lineage Genetic Characterization Total No. of Subtype/Lineage Tested HA Clade Number (% of subtype/lineage tested) HA Subclade Number (% of subtype/lineage tested) A/H1 229 5a.2a 116 (50.7%) C.1.9 116 (50.7%) 5a.2a.1 113 (49.3%) D 4 (1.7%) D.1 1 (0.4%) D.3 11 (4.8%) D.5 97 (42.4%) A/H3 310 2a.3a 4 (1.3%) G.1.3.1 4 (1.3%) 2a.3a.1 306 (98.7%) J.1.1 3 (1.0%) J.2 277 (89.4%) J.2.1 6 (1.9%) J.2.2 20 (6.5%) B/Victoria 38 3a.2 38 (100%) C.5 4 (10.5%) C.5.1 22 (57.9%) C.5.6 8 (21.1%) C.5.7 4 (10.5%) B/Yamagata 0 Y3 0 Y3 0 CDC antigenically characterizes influenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) (H1N1pdm09, H3N2, and B/Victoria viruses) or neutralization-based HINT (H3N2 viruses) using antisera that ferrets make after being infected with reference viruses representing the 2024-2025 Northern Hemisphere recommended cell or recombinant-based vaccine viruses. Antigenic differences between viruses are determined by comparing how well the antibodies made against the vaccine reference viruses recognize the circulating viruses that have been grown in cell culture. Ferret antisera are useful because antibodies raised against a particular virus can often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody titer differences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared to the reference (vaccine) virus. In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer differences of less than or equal to 8-fold. Viruses selected for antigenic characterization are a subset of the recent genetically characterized viruses and are chosen based on the genetic changes in their surface proteins and may not be proportional to the number of such viruses circulating in the United States. Influenza A Viruses A(H1N1)pdm09: 40 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized by HI, and all were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/67/2022-like reference viruses representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. A(H3N2): 34 A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by HI or HINT, and 19 (55.9%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer in HI or reacting at titers that were less than or equal to 8-fold of the homologous virus in HINT) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Massachusetts/18/2022-like reference viruses representing the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. Influenza B Viruses B/Victoria: 7 influenza B/Victoria-lineage virus were antigenically characterized by HI, and all were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown B/Austria/1359417/2021-like reference viruses representing the B/Victoria component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. B/Yamagata: No influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were available for antigenic characterization. Assessment of Virus Susceptibility to Antiviral Medications CDC assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to the antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using next generation sequence analysis supplemented by laboratory assays. Information about antiviral susceptibility test methods can be found at U.S. Influenza Surveillance: Purpose and Methods. Viruses collected in the U.S. since September 29, 2024, were tested for antiviral susceptibility as follows: Viruses collected in the U.S. tested for antiviral susceptibility Antiviral Medication Total Viruses A/H1 A/H3 B/Victoria Neuraminidase Inhibitors Oseltamivir Viruses Tested 572 226 308 38 Reduced Inhibition 1 (0.2%) 1 (0.4%) 0 0 Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 0 0 0 Peramivir Viruses Tested 572 226 308 38 Reduced Inhibition 0 0 0 0 Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 0 0 0 Zanamivir Viruses Tested 572 226 308 38 Reduced Inhibition 0 0 0 0 Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 0 0 0 PA Cap-Dependent Endonuclease Inhibitor Baloxavir Viruses Tested 581 212 332 37 Decreased Susceptibility 0 0 0 0 One A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-I223V and NA-S247N amino acid substitutions and showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. High levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) viruses (the adamantanes are not effective against influenza B viruses). Therefore, use of these antivirals for treatment and prevention of influenza A virus infection is not recommended and data from adamantane resistance testing are not presented. Outpatient and Emergency Department Illness Surveillance Outpatient respiratory illness visits The U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness [ILI (fever plus cough or sore throat)], not laboratory-confirmed influenza, and will therefore capture respiratory illness visits due to infection with any pathogen that can present with similar symptoms, including influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. It is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. Nationally, during Week 51, 4.9% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. This week's percentage increased (change of > 0.1 percentage points) compared to Week 50 and is above the national baseline of 3.0% for the fourth consecutive week. The percentage of visits for ILI increased (change of > 0.1 percentage points) in all HHS regions compared to Week 50. All HHS regions are above their respective baselines. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infections to ILI varies by location. View Larger View Chart Data Outpatient respiratory illness visits by age group About 70% of ILINet participants provide both the number of patient visits for respiratory illness and the total number of patient visits for the week broken out by age group. Based on these data, the percentage of visits for respiratory illness increased (change of > 0.1 percentage point) in all age groups in Week 51 compared to Week 50.
