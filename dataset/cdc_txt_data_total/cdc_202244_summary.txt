First, seasonal influenza activity is increasing in most parts of the country, particularly in the South Central, Southeast, and West Coast regions.

In terms of virologic surveillance, 3.0% of respiratory specimens tested in clinical laboratories were positive for influenza. Influenza A viruses, including H3N2 and H1N1pdm09, predominated during the reported week. 

Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance revealed that 2.9% of patient visits to healthcare providers were for respiratory illness, which is at the national baseline. However, ILI activity is trending upward in several regions, including the Southeast, South Central, and West Coast.

Regarding hospitalizations, the weekly hospitalization rate for laboratory-confirmed influenza was 0.3 per 100,000 population. The cumulative hospitalization rate for the season so far is 1.2 per 100,000 population, which is the second-highest rate observed in week 44 compared to previous seasons.

The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) was 0.09% during the reported week, which remained stable compared to the previous week.

No influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported during the current season. However, one pediatric death associated with influenza occurred during the previous season.

These data are preliminary and subject to change as more reports are received. It is important to note that influenza surveillance is part of a comprehensive approach to predicting and monitoring influenza activity. Other factors, such as vaccination rates and public health recommendations, also play a significant role in preventing and managing influenza outbreaks.
