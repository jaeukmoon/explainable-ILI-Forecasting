First, the virologic surveillance data shows that seasonal influenza activity remains lower than usual for this time of year. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories is only 0.1% and the number of influenza-positive specimens reported by public health labs remains unusually low.

In terms of illness surveillance, 1.1% of patient visits to healthcare providers were for influenza-like illness (ILI), which is below the national baseline of 2.6%. All jurisdictions experienced minimal ILI activity and ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In terms of severe disease, flu-associated hospitalization rates are low compared to previous seasons. The cumulative hospitalization rate is 0.8 per 100,000 population, which is much lower than the low-severity 2011-12 season. The majority of pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) deaths are attributed to COVID-19, while no influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during the current week and only one such death has been reported for the entire season.

It's important to note that all data presented are preliminary and subject to change as more reports are received. The CDC emphasizes the importance of annual flu vaccination and the use of antiviral drugs for treating flu illness.
