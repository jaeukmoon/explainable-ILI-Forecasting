Based on the given CDC inﬂuenza surveillance report, here are the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence:

1. Inﬂuenza activity is increasing in most of the country.
2. The majority of inﬂuenza viruses detected are Inﬂuenza A(H3N2).
3. Antigenic data show that the majority of the H3N2 viruses characterized are antigenically different from the vaccine reference viruses.
4. The percentage of outpatient visits due to respiratory illness increased slightly but remains below baseline.
5. Geographically, ILI activity varies, with some jurisdictions experiencing moderate or high activity while others have minimal activity.
6. Hospitalization rates are higher than the previous season but lower than previous seasons prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
7. There have been two inﬂuenza-associated pediatric deaths reported so far this season.
8. The majority of laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza-associated hospitalizations are due to Inﬂuenza A viruses.
9. Mortality surveillance shows that a larger proportion of deaths are attributed to pneumonia, inﬂuenza, or COVID-19 compared to the epidemic threshold.
10. The inﬂuenza vaccine for the 2022-2023 season includes updated virus components.
