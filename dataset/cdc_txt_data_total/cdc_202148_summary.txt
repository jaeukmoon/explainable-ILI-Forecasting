Based on the provided reports from the CDC on ILI surveillance, here are the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence:

1. Viroligic Surveillance: The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical labs remained relatively low but has shown an increasing trend. Influenza A(H3N2) has been the most frequently detected virus.

2. Outpatient ILI Surveillance: The percentage of outpatient visits for ILI has been trending upwards, reaching the national baseline. This could indicate a potential increase in influenza activity.

3. Geographic Spread: ILI activity varied across jurisdictions, with some experiencing moderate or high activity, while others had minimal or no activity.

4. Severe Disease: Flu hospitalization rates and pediatric deaths associated with influenza were not reported for the current season. Pneumonia and influenza mortality rates were below the epidemic threshold.

5. Virus Characterization: Genetic and antigenic characterization of influenza viruses is ongoing and will provide more insights into their similarity to reference viruses used in vaccines and antiviral resistance.

6. Public Health Recommendations: CDC emphasizes the importance of annual flu vaccination to protect against influenza and its complications. Antiviral drugs are also available for the treatment of flu illness.

Overall, the data suggest that while influenza activity remains low, there is a potential for an increase in the coming weeks. Continued surveillance and adherence to preventive measures such as vaccination and antiviral treatment are crucial.
