First, seasonal influenza activity is increasing in most parts of the country, especially in the South Central, Southeast, and West Coast regions. This indicates a potential future rise in ILI occurrence.

In terms of virologic surveillance, 4.0% of respiratory specimens tested in clinical laboratories were positive for influenza, with a predominance of influenza A viruses. This suggests a potential higher likelihood of future ILI cases.

Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance shows that 3.5% of patient visits were for respiratory illness, which is above the national baseline of 2.9%. This indicates an increase in ILI activity.

In terms of hospitalizations, there were 527 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations reported. This suggests a potential trend of more severe cases in the future.

The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) was 0.10%, below the epidemic threshold. This indicates a lower risk of severe outcomes for ILI cases.

No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during the current season. The absence of pediatric deaths suggests a lower risk of severe outcomes for children.

In conclusion, based on the surveillance data, seasonal influenza activity is increasing, with a higher prevalence of influenza A viruses. ILI activity and hospitalizations are also on the rise. However, the percentage of deaths attributed to P&I and the absence of pediatric deaths indicate a lower risk of severe outcomes. These findings can be useful in predicting future ILI occurrence and planning public health interventions.
