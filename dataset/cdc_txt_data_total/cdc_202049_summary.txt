First, virologic surveillance is tracking the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical labs and public health labs. For the reported period, clinical labs had a 0.2% positivity rate, while public health labs had low activity during the summer months.

Outpatient ILI surveillance monitors the percentage of healthcare visits for influenza-like illness (ILI). The current ILI activity level is 1.6%, below the national baseline of 2.6%. However, ILI surveillance may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.

Geographic spread of influenza, as reported by state and territorial epidemiologists, indicates low or minimal activity in most jurisdictions. Severe disease indicators such as hospitalization rates are not yet available, but mortality surveillance shows 14.3% of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), above the epidemic threshold of 6.5%.

One pediatric death associated with influenza B virus was reported during week 49 of the 2020-2021 season.

Virus characterization data will be updated weekly, and additional surveillance information from national and international sources is available for further analysis.

Public health recommendations include getting vaccinated against influenza, as well as using antiviral drugs for treatment. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may impact flu activity levels and surveillance accuracy.

These facts provide insights into the current status of influenza activity and its potential impact.
