Based on the latest surveillance report from CDC, the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence are as follows:

- Influenza activity remains low nationally.
- Clinical labs reported 1.0% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza.
- The most frequently reported viruses were influenza A(H3N2).
- Genetic and antigenic characterization of influenza viruses is ongoing.
- Outpatient respiratory illness visits accounted for 2.6% of healthcare visits, above the national baseline of 2.5%.
- Four jurisdictions experienced moderate ILI activity, while six were above their respective baselines.
- 0.6% of long-term care facilities reported influenza-positive tests among residents.
- FluSurv-NET reported a cumulative hospitalization rate of 59.7 per 100,000 population, with higher rates in adults aged 65 and older.
- 9.0% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19, above the epidemic threshold.
- Four influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported, bringing the total to 115 for the season.
- Influenza viruses tested remained susceptible to antiviral medications.

These facts help to assess the current influenza activity and inform predictions for future ILI occurrence.
