Week23, 2024
- **Viruses, illness, and deaths:** Seasonal influenza activity remains low nationally. 1.6% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza. Influenza A accounted for 78.7% (399) and Influenza B for 21.3% (108) of clinical lab positives. Influenza A subtypes H1N1 (26.9%) and H3N2 (73.1%) are co-circulating. Two pediatric deaths were reported this week, totaling 175 pediatric deaths for the season. 0.1% of deaths nationally were attributed to influenza, unchanged from the prior week.  
- **U.S. virologic surveillance:** Influenza A (76.1%) is predominant, with H3N2 (32.6%) more common than H1N1 (67.4%). 23.9% of public health lab positives were Influenza B (all Victoria lineage). No B/Yamagata or H3N2v viruses were detected.  
- **Cumulative hospitalization rate:** The hospitalization rate for this week is 0.1 per 100,000 population. Cumulatively, 24,970 influenza-related hospitalizations have occurred, 84.6% from Influenza A and 14.7% from Influenza B. Peak weekly hospitalization occurred during Week 52 at 9.0 per 100,000 population.  
- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza:** Deaths attributed to influenza remained stable at 0.1% this week, with no significant trend change.  
- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B:** Across clinical specimens, Influenza A is 78.7% and Influenza B is 21.3%. Public health lab specimens show 80.4% Influenza A and 19.6% Influenza B.  
- **Novel influenza viruses (like COVID-19):** No reports of novel influenza viruses, including H3N2v and SARS-CoV-2, co-circulating.  
- **Vaccination trends:** CDC continues to recommend annual flu vaccination for those 6 months and older as flu activity persists. Current vaccines effectively target prevalent strains.  
- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits:** 1.7% of outpatient visits were attributed to respiratory illness, below the national baseline. ILI activity remained minimal across 51 jurisdictions, with no regions experiencing moderate or high-level activity.  
- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC:** Flu activity is expected to remain low nationally; surveillance remains integrated with data on COVID-19 and RSV.  
- **Other key factors:** Integrated respiratory surveillance suggests co-circulation of multiple pathogens, including flu and RSV. Antiviral resistance remains low, but high levels of resistance to adamantanes persist.
