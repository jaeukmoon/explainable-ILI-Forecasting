Based on the weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report from CDC for Week 17, ending May 1, 2021, the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence are as follows:

1. Seasonal influenza activity remains lower than usual for this time of year in the United States.
2. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza at clinical laboratories is 0.1% for the week.
3. The number of influenza positive specimens reported by public health labs remains unusually low.
4. Influenza virus characterization information will be reported later this season.
5. For the fourth week in a row, 1.1% of patient visits to a healthcare provider were for influenza-like illness (ILI), which is below the national baseline of 2.6%.
6. All jurisdictions experienced minimal ILI activity during Week 17.
7. The cumulative hospitalization rate for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations is 0.8 per 100,000 population, which is lower than previous seasons.
8. Mortality surveillance data shows that 11.7% of deaths during Week 17 were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19, above the epidemic threshold of 6.6%.
9. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during Week 17, and only one influenza-associated pediatric death has been reported for the entire season.
10. The CDC recommends an annual flu vaccine as the best way to protect against influenza and its complications.

It is important to note that these facts are specific to the surveillance report for Week 17 and may change as more data is received. The COVID-19 pandemic and changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors may also impact ILI surveillance data.
