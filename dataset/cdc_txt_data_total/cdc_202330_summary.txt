During the reported period, 1.2% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness, which may include various respiratory pathogens, including influenza.
Geographically, the ILI activity levels varied, with 55 jurisdictions experiencing minimal activity and no jurisdictions experiencing high or very high activity.
Hospitalization surveillance is conducted through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET). However, there is no specific data provided in the report regarding hospitalization rates.
Mortality surveillance indicates that 5.7% of deaths occurring during the reported week were due to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19, which is above the epidemic threshold. It's important to note that specific influenza-associated pediatric deaths were not mentioned in the report.
