Based on the given weekly ILI surveillance report from the CDC, the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence are as follows:

1. Virologic surveillance: The report provides information on the percentage of respiratory specimens tested in clinical labs that are positive for influenza. It also analyzes the distribution of influenza virus types and subtypes in public health labs.

2. Outpatient ILI surveillance: The report tracks the percentage of healthcare visits for influenza-like illness (ILI), comparing it to the national baseline. It provides data on ILI activity levels by jurisdiction and geographic spread.

3. Severe disease indicators: Hospitalization rates, deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I), and pediatric deaths associated with influenza are monitored to understand the impact of the flu.

4. Virus characterization: Genetic and antigenic characterization of influenza viruses are performed to assess their similarity to reference viruses used in vaccines and to monitor evolutionary changes.

5. National and international surveillance: The CDC collaborates with WHO, national public health agencies, and other organizations to gather additional influenza surveillance data from participating countries.

6. Public health recommendations: The CDC emphasizes the importance of annual flu vaccination and antiviral drugs for treatment. They also provide information on where to get flu vaccines and additional resources for influenza surveillance.

By analyzing these key facts, researchers and public health officials can gain insights into current influenza activity, geographic trends, virus strains, and severity of the illness. This information can help predict future ILI occurrences and inform prevention and response strategies.
