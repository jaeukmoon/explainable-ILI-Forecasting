Based on the weekly US Influenza Surveillance Report for Week 43 (ending October 26, 2024), the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence are:

1. Seasonal influenza activity remains low nationally.
2. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories nationwide remained low and stable compared to the previous week.
3. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses are co-circulating, with variations in their distribution by region.
4. Eight human infections with influenza A(H5) viruses were reported, with no identified human-to-human transmission.
5. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurred during the current season, but one pediatric death from the previous season was reported.
6. CDC recommends annual influenza vaccination for everyone aged 6 months and older.
7. Antiviral medications are available for treating influenza, especially for higher-risk patients.
8. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness, including ILI, increased slightly since early October but remained below baselines nationally and in all 10 HHS regions.
9. There are multiple respiratory viruses co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus to ILI varies by location.
10. Emergency department visits for influenza remained stable compared to the previous week.
11. Laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported, with a low hospitalization rate.
12. The percentage of deaths due to influenza remained stable and low compared to the previous week.
13. CDC conducts genetic and antigenic characterization of U.S. viruses to monitor virus similarity to reference viruses used in vaccines and to assess antiviral susceptibility.
14. Additional national and international influenza surveillance information is available through various sources, including WHO and CDC collaborations.

These facts provide an overview of current influenza activity and surveillance data, which can help in predicting and responding to future ILI outbreaks.
