First, seasonal influenza viruses continue to circulate and activity is increasing in parts of the country. The majority of influenza viruses detected are influenza A(H3N2) subtype. However, the antigenic data show that most of the H3N2 viruses characterized are antigenically different from the vaccine reference viruses. The percentage of outpatient visits due to respiratory illness, including fever plus a cough or sore throat (ILI), remained stable compared to the previous week and remained below the baseline. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varies by location. In terms of hospitalization rates, 3,290 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza were admitted to hospitals. Among pediatric deaths reported during the season, influenza infection was not listed as a cause.CDC estimates that at least 6.4 million influenza illnesses, 65,000 hospitalizations, and 4,000 deaths have occurred during the season. Vaccination is recommended as the best way to protect against influenza, and antiviral drugs are available for treatment of flu illness.
