Week50, 2021
- **Viruses, illness, and deaths**: Influenza A(H3N2) predominates among viruses, with most cases detected in children and young adults (5-24 years), but cases among adults (25+ years) are increasing. Influenza activity is rising nationally, with variability by region. 18.8% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (above the epidemic threshold of 6.7%). Two influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported this season.

- **U.S. virologic surveillance**: Clinical labs report 5.6% positivity for influenza, with 99.2% Influenza A (H3N2) and 0.8% Influenza B. Public health labs report 100% of detections as Influenza A, primarily H3N2 (99.8%). 

- **Cumulative hospitalization rate**: The cumulative hospitalization rate is 1.4 per 100,000 population, higher than the previous season. A total of 405 lab-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations have been reported since October 2021.

- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza**: A significant portion of PIC (pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19) mortality is due to COVID-19, but flu activity is increasing. Current PIC mortality is 18.8%, influenced primarily by COVID-19.

- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B**: Influenza A accounts for 99.2% of clinical lab positives and 100% of public health lab positives. Influenza B remains at low levels (0.8% clinical, 0% public health).

- **Novel influenza virus (like COVID-19)**: No new novel influenza virus cases like SARS-CoV-2 were reported.  

- **Vaccination trends**: Flu vaccination uptake is observed to be lower than the previous season. The CDC emphasizes vaccination, noting flu activity is just starting and vaccines remain effective in reducing severity. Some antigenic differences between circulating H3N2 viruses and the vaccine virus have been identified.

- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits**: 3.1% of outpatient visits were due to respiratory illness (above baseline). Most regions exceeded their baselines. Multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza and others, are co-circulating.

- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC**: Influenza activity is expected to continue increasing. The eastern and central U.S. are seeing the largest increases, while the western U.S. reports lower flu circulation.

- **Other key factors**: 14 jurisdictions reported moderate outpatient illness activity, and 8 reported high or very high activity. Long-term care facilities reported 0.6% with at least one influenza-positive resident.
