P&I Mortality7.2% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia, inﬂuenza, orCOVID-19 (PIC). This is aboveabove theepidemic threshold of 5.7%.
Pediatric DeathsThree inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric deaths occurring duringthe 2019-20 season werereported to CDC bringing thetotal for that season to 192. Nodeaths occurring during the2020-21 season were reported.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods (http://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm) page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/ﬂuviewinteractive.htm).Key PointsKey PointsAn annual ﬂu vaccine is the best way to protect against ﬂu and its potentially serious complications.CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get a ﬂu vaccine by the end of October.There are also ﬂu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat ﬂu illness.U.S. Virologic Surveillance:(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281228772)Clinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating inﬂuenza viruses are to the referenceviruses representing viruses contained in the current inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionary changes thatcontinually occur in inﬂuenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of inﬂuenza viruses to antiviralmedications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonucleaseinhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated weekly starting later this season when a suﬃcient number of specimens havebeen tested.Outpatient Illness Surveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932)ILINetNationwide during week 41, 1.2% of patient visits reported through the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-like Illness SurveillanceNetwork (ILINet) were due to inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI). This percentage is below the national baseline of 2.6%.Healthcare seeking behaviors have changed dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. While outpatient ILI activityremains low, many people are accessing the healthcare system in alternative settings. Therefore, while traditionalhealthcare providers are not seeing increased numbers of cases of ILI, it is important to evaluate other sources ofsurveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of both COVID-19 and inﬂuenza activity.

*Data collected in ILINet may disproportionally represent certain populations within a jurisdiction or CBSA, and therefore, may not accurately depictthe full picture of inﬂuenza activity for the entire jurisdiction or CBSA. Diﬀerences in the data presented here by CDC and independently by somehealth departments likely represent diﬀering levels of data completeness with data presented by the health department likely being the morecomplete.Additional information about medically attended visits for ILI for current and past seasons:Additional information about medically attended visits for ILI for current and past seasons:Surveillance Methods (https://wcms-wp.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932) | FluView Interactive: National,Regional, and State Data (http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/ﬂuportaldashboard.html) or ILI Activity Map(https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/main.html)Geographic Spread of Inﬂuenza as Assessed by State andTerritorial Epidemiologists(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1568388833450)The geographic spread of inﬂuenza as reported by state and territorial epidemiologists indicates geographic spread ofinﬂuenza viruses but does not measure the severity of inﬂuenza activity. Due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILIsurveillance, and the fact that the state and territorial epidemiologists report relies heavily on ILI activity, reporting forthis system will be suspended for the 2020-21 inﬂuenza season.

This percentage is above theepidemic threshold of 5.7% for week 41.Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually coded causes of deathcollected from death certiﬁcates. Percentages of deaths due to pneumonia, inﬂuenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) are higheramong manually coded records than more rapidly available machine coded records. Due to the additional time neededfor manual coding, the initially reported PIC percentages are likely to increase as more data are received and processed.

All three deaths occurred during the2019-2020 inﬂuenza season bringing the total number of deaths occurring during that season to 192. One death wasassociated with an inﬂuenza A virus for which no subtyping was performed and occurred during week 11 (the weekending March 14, 2020). Two deaths were associated with inﬂuenza B virus infection and occurred during week 3 (theweek ending January 18, 2020) and week 49 (the week ending December 7, 2019).
