Week3, 2023
- **Viruses, Illness, and Deaths**: Nationwide flu activity is declining, with 3.0% of clinical lab specimens testing positive for influenza. Influenza A(H3N2) predominates. For the season so far, 25 million illnesses, 280,000 hospitalizations, and 17,000 deaths from influenza have been reported. Six pediatric deaths were reported this week, totaling 91 pediatric deaths for the season.  
- **U.S. Virologic Surveillance**: Clinical labs report 96.0% of positive specimens as Influenza A and 4.0% as Influenza B. Public health labs confirm 97.3% of positives as Influenza A (73.2% A(H3N2), 26.8% A(H1N1)), and 2.7% as Influenza B.  
- **Cumulative Hospitalization Rate**: The cumulative hospitalization rate is 58.1 per 100,000, 1.4 times higher than previous seasons at this week but lower than most pre-COVID end-of-season rates. Weekly hospitalizations for week 3 were 0.6 per 100,000 population.  
- **Trends of Deaths Attributed to Influenza**: 12.0% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), above the epidemic threshold of 7.1%. Among PIC deaths this week, 188 were due to influenza.  
- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B**: Influenza A accounts for 96.0% of clinical lab positives and 97.3% of public health lab positives; Influenza B accounts for 4.0% (clinical) and 2.7% (public health).  
- **Novel Influenza Virus like COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)**: No novel influenza viruses have been detected. 3.4% of hospitalized influenza patients also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.  
- **Vaccination Trends**: Vaccination remains the primary protective measure against flu, with CDC recommending yearly vaccination for everyone aged 6 months and older. Current vaccines are antigenically compatible with circulating strains.  
- **Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits**: Nationwide, 2.6% of healthcare visits were for ILI, down from the previous week but above the national baseline of 2.5%. Seven jurisdictions reported moderate activity, and three reported high activity.  
- **Expectation of Flu Activity from CDC**: Flu activity is expected to continue decreasing nationally.  
- **Other Key Factors**: The hospitalization rate for influenza A(H3N2) is notable among older adults (65+) and young children (<4 years). All tested influenza virus samples remain susceptible to antiviral medications. Rep decrease in flu-related long-term care facility outbreaks (>5%) suggests lowered transmission.
