Week24, 2023
- **Viruses, illness, and deaths**: Influenza activity remains very low, with 1.1% of respiratory specimens testing positive. Influenza A makes up 57.9% of positive specimens, while Influenza B accounts for 42.1%. 6.1% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC), slightly above the epidemic threshold of 6.0%. Two pediatric deaths related to influenza were reported, with one occurring in the current 2022-2023 season.

- **U.S. virologic surveillance**: Clinical labs reported 97.7% cumulative Influenza A cases and 2.3% Influenza B since October 2022. Public health labs found 96.5% cumulative Influenza A (27.8% H1N1pdm09, 72.2% H3N2) and 3.5% Influenza B (all Victoria lineage for week 24).

- **Cumulative hospitalization rate**: Hospitalization data for patients admitted after April 30, 2023, is not included. During week 24, 779 hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed influenza were reported.

- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza**: 6.1% PIC deaths exceeded the epidemic threshold for the week. Only 16 deaths explicitly listed influenza, correlating with low overall activity.

- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B**: Influenza A accounted for 57.9% of clinical lab positives and 61.9% of public health lab positives in week 24. Influenza B made up 42.1% and 38.1%, respectively.

- **Novel influenza virus (like COVID-19)**: No reports of novel influenza viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2-related variants, were noted.

- **Vaccination trends**: No updates on vaccination are provided for week 24.

- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits**: 1.5% of outpatient visits nationwide were due to influenza-like illness (ILI). By age group, the highest percentage (5.2%) was among children aged 0-4 years, followed by 2.4% (5-24 years) and lower rates in older age groups.

- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC**: Influenza activity is currently very low and not expected to rise substantially, reflecting seasonal trends.

- **Other key factors**: Almost all jurisdictions reported "minimal" or "low" respiratory illness levels. Multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza and COVID-19, are co-circulating, contributing to ILI indicators. Overall flu activity remains in a seasonal decline post-peak.
