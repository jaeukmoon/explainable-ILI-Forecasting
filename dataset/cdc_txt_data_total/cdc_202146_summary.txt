Based on the weekly ILI surveillance report from CDC for Week 46:

- Seasonal influenza activity in the United States remains low but has shown an increase in recent weeks.
- The number of laboratory-confirmed influenza virus detections and the percentage of patient visits for ILI have increased in recent weeks.
- The majority of influenza viruses detected are Influenza A (H3N2) viruses.
- The percentage of outpatient visits for ILI remains below the national baseline of 2.5%.
- There have been a small number of influenza-positive tests reported in long-term care facilities.
- Hospitalization rates for influenza will be updated later in the season.
- The percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 is above the epidemic threshold for the week, with COVID-19 being the primary cause.
- No influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported for the current season.
- Influenza virus characterization data will be updated later in the season.
- Influenza activity levels vary by state, with some reporting high or moderate activity levels.
- CDC recommends annual flu vaccination as the best way to protect against influenza and its complications. Flu vaccines are widely available.
- Other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, may contribute to ILI and should be considered in the context of flu data.

Overall, the data indicates an increase in influenza activity in recent weeks, with Influenza A (H3N2) viruses being the predominant strain. Despite the increase, influenza activity remains relatively low compared to previous seasons. Vaccination and antiviral medications are recommended for prevention and treatment of influenza.
