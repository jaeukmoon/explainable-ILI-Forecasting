Week38, 2021
- **Viruses, illness, and deaths**: Influenza activity remains low. 20.9% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC), above the epidemic threshold of 5.6%. COVID-19 was the primary cause of PIC mortality, with only four deaths attributed to influenza. No new influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported.

- **U.S. virologic surveillance**: Influenza virus circulation was low, with no significant uptick in influenza activity. 

- **Cumulative hospitalization rate**: No updated data provided for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in this reporting period.

- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza**: Deaths attributed to influenza remain minimal. COVID-19 is the leading contributor to PIC mortality.

- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B**: Data on the breakdown of Influenza A and B was not provided in this report.

- **Novel Influenza virus (like COVID-19)**: COVID-19 continues to dominate respiratory illness trends, but no novel influenza viruses were reported.

- **Vaccination trends**: No updates or recommendations for vaccination trends were provided.

- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits**: 1.9% of outpatient visits were due to ILI, which remains below the national baseline of 2.6%. Outpatient ILI visits decreased across all age groups, and increases in activity are likely due to other respiratory viruses rather than influenza.

- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC**: Influenza activity remains low, and no immediate uptick is expected based on current data.

- **Other key factors**: Most jurisdictions reported minimal ILI activity, with slight increases attributed to other respiratory pathogens, highlighting the need for careful differentiation between influenza and COVID-19 impacts.
