First, virologic surveillance plays a critical role by monitoring the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for influenza in both clinical and public health laboratories. For week 27, 0.7% of specimens tested in clinical labs and 0.3% of specimens tested in public health labs were positive for influenza.
Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance, conducted through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), monitors the percentage of patient visits for respiratory illness that includes fever plus a cough or sore throat. During week 27, 1.7% of visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness.
ILI activity varied by jurisdiction, with some reporting minimal ILI activity while others reported low, moderate, or high activity levels.
The geographic spread of influenza, as reported by state and territorial epidemiologists, indicated local activity in some states, sporadic activity in others, and no activity in a few states.
Hospitalization surveillance through FluSurv-NET and HHS Protect provides data on laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations, but specific weekly data was not provided in the report.
Mortality surveillance indicated that 8.8% of deaths during week 27 were due to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 (PIC). Among the PIC deaths, most were attributed to COVID-19 rather than influenza.
No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during week 27, but a total of 32 influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurred during the 2021-2022 season.
The report also provides links to additional national and international influenza surveillance information, including FluView Interactive, WHO FluNet, and surveillance data from various countries and regions.
Overall, the report provides a snapshot of influenza activity at a specific point in time and highlights the importance of surveillance systems in monitoring and tracking the spread of influenza.
