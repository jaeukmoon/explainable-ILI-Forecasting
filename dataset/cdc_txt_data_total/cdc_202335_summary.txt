The virologic surveillance data from clinical and public health laboratories show that the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza is low, at 0.6% in clinical labs and 0.2% in public health labs. Dominant influenza viruses include Influenza A (92.3%) and Influenza B (7.7%).
Outpatient ILI surveillance indicates that 1.9% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever and cough or sore throat. The percentage of visits for respiratory illness varied by age group, with higher percentages in younger children.
The ILI activity map shows that most jurisdictions experienced minimal ILI activity, while a few had moderate or high activity levels. For example, Alaska and Puerto Rico had high activity levels, while Hawaii and the Virgin Islands had minimal activity levels.
The geographic spread of influenza shows that four states had local flu activity, while the rest reported sporadic or no flu activity. Louisiana experienced moderate ILI activity, suggesting localized outbreaks.
Hospitalization rates for influenza were not available for the reported period. Pneumonia and influenza mortality rates were below the epidemic threshold, indicating that the proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza was not significantly high.
No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during the current season. However, in the previous season, 34 pediatric deaths were reported.
The CDC expects flu activity to remain low but increase in the coming weeks, emphasizing the importance of annual flu vaccination and the use of antiviral drugs for treatment.
