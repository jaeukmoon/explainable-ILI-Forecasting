Key Points Seasonal influenza activity remains low nationally. Nationally, outpatient respiratory illness is below baseline, and seven of 10 HHS regions are below their respective baselines. The number and weekly rate of flu hospital admissions has remained stable compared to week 10. Of the 27 influenza A viruses detected and subtyped during week 11, 37% were influenza A(H3N2) and 63% were influenza A(H1N1). Two influenza-associated pediatric deaths that occurred during the 2022-2023 season were reported this week, for a total of 134 pediatric flu deaths reported so far this season. CDC estimates that, so far this season, there have been at least 26 million illnesses, 290,000 hospitalizations, and 18,000 deaths from flu. The majority of influenza viruses tested are in the same genetic subclade as and antigenically similar to the influenza viruses included in this season’s influenza vaccine. All viruses collected and evaluated this season have been susceptible to the influenza antivirals peramivir, zanamivir, and baloxavir, and all viruses except for one (> 99.9%) have been susceptible to the influenza antiviral oseltamivir. CDC continues to recommend that everyone ages 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine as long as flu activity continues. There are also prescription flu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat flu illness; those need to be started as early as possible. U.S. Virologic Surveillance Nationally, the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories remained stable (change of <0.5 percentage points). For regional and state level data and age group distribution, please visit FluView Interactive. Viruses known to be associated with recent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) receipt or found upon further testing to be a vaccine virus are not included, as they are not circulating influenza viruses. Clinical Laboratories The results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below. Data from clinical laboratories (the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for influenza) are used to monitor whether influenza activity is increasing or decreasing. results of tests from Clinical Laboratories Week 11 Data Cumulative since October 2, 2022(Week 40) No. of specimens tested 64,650 2,780,463 No. of positive specimens (%) 535 (0.8%) 336,814 (12.1%) Positive specimens by type Influenza A 361 (67.5%) 332,572 (98.7%) Influenza B 174 (32.5%) 4,242 (1.3%) View Chart Data | View Full Screen Public Health Laboratories The results of tests performed by public health laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating influenza viruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current influenza vaccines. The data are also used to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur in influenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC genetically characterized 2,501 influenza viruses collected since October 2, 2022. To reflect the genetic diversity of the HA genes in recent A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses, new subclades have been designated. The vast majority of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses collected in the U.S. this season express HA genes belonging to 6B.1A.5a.2 but this clade has been split into the 2a and 2a.1 subclades. All A(H3N2) viruses collected thus far in the U.S. this season express HA genes belonging to clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2 and this clade has been split into multiple subclades. The new subclade designations improve the ability to track the evolution and co-circulation of multiple groups of influenza viruses.

Antigenic differences between viruses are determined by comparing how well the antibodies made against the vaccine reference viruses recognize the circulating viruses that have been grown in cell culture. Ferret antisera are useful because antibodies raised against a particular virus can often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody titer differences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared to the reference (vaccine) virus. In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer differences of less than 8-fold. Viruses selected for antigenic characterization are a subset representing the genetic changes in the surface proteins seen in genetically characterized viruses. Influenza A Viruses A (H1N1)pdm09: Ninety-eight A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized by HI, and 96 (98%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/588/2019-like reference viruses representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant- based influenza vaccines. A (H3N2): One hundred and eighty A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by HINT, and 168 (93%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 8-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021-like reference viruses representing the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. Influenza B Viruses B/Victoria: Thirteen influenza B/Victoria-lineage virus were antigenically characterized by HI, and all were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown B/Austria/1359417/2021-like reference viruses representing the B/Victoria component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. B/Yamagata: No influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were available for antigenic characterization. Assessment of Virus Susceptibility to Antiviral Medications CDC assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using next generation sequence analysis supplemented by laboratory assays. Information about antiviral susceptibility test methods can be found at U.S. Influenza Surveillance: Purpose and Methods | CDC. Viruses collected in the U.S. since October 2, 2022, were tested for antiviral susceptibility as follows: susceptibility of influenza viruses to the antiviral medications Antiviral Medication Total Viruses A/H1 A/H3 B/Victoria B/Yamagata Neuraminidase Inhibitors Oseltamivir Viruses Tested 2,503 905 1,517 81 0 Reduced Inhibition 1 (<0.1%) 1 (0.1%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Peramivir Viruses Tested 2,503 905 1,517 81 0 Reduced Inhibition 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Zanamivir Viruses Tested 2,503 905 1,517 81 0 Reduced Inhibition 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) PA Cap-Dependent Endonuclease Inhibitor Baloxavir Viruses Tested 2,407 853 1,475 79 0 Reduced Susceptibility 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) One A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-S247G amino acid substitution and showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. Outpatient Respiratory Illness Surveillance The U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness [ILI (fever plus cough or sore throat)], not laboratory-confirmed influenza, and will therefore capture respiratory illness visits due to infection with any pathogen that can present with similar symptoms, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health care-seeking behaviors have changed, and people may be accessing the health care system in alternative settings not captured as a part of ILINet or at a different point in their illness than they might have before the pandemic. Therefore, it is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVID Data Tracker Weekly Review. Information about other respiratory virus activity can be found on CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) website. Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits Nationwide during week 11, 2.4% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. This has remained stable compared to week 10 and is below the national baseline of 2.5%. Seven of the 10 HHS regions are below their respective baselines; regions 2, 3, and 9 are at or above their respective baselines. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varies by location. * Effective October 3, 2021 (week 40), the ILI definition (fever plus cough or sore throat) no longer includes “without a known cause other than influenza.” View Chart Data (current season only) | View Full Screen Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits by Age Group More than 70% of ILINet participants provide both the number of patient visits for respiratory illness and the total number of patient visits for the week broken out by age group. Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patient visits for respiratory illness by age group. The percentage of visits for respiratory illness reported in ILINet remained stable (change of ≤ 0.1 percentage points) for all age groups (0-4 years, 5-24 years, 25-49 years, 50-64 years, 65+ years) in week 11 compared to week 10.

During week 11, 62 (0.4%) of 14,376 reporting facilities reported at least one influenza positive test among their residents. This decreased by > 5% compared to week 10. View Chart Data | View Full Screen Additional information about long-term care facility surveillance: Surveillance Methods | Additional Data Hospitalization Surveillance FluSurv-NET The Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in select counties in 14 states and represents approximately 9% of the U.S. population. FluSurv-NET hospitalization data are preliminary. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly. A total of 17,741 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites between October 1, 2022, and March 18, 2023. The weekly hospitalization rate observed in week 11 was 0.2 per 100,000 population. The weekly rate observed during week 48 (week ending December 3, 2022) is the third highest peak weekly rate observed during all seasons going back to 2010-2011; this follows the 2017-2018 season which peaked during week 1 (week ending January 6, 2018) and the 2014-2015 season which peaked during week 52 (week ending December 27, 2014). The overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 60.6 per 100,000 population. This cumulative hospitalization rate is the second highest cumulative in-season hospitalization rate observed in week 11 during previous seasons going back to 2010-2011, following the 2017-2018 season. However, this in-season cumulative hospitalization rate is similar to the end-of-season hospitalization rates for 4 seasons (2014-2015, 2016-2017, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020 seasons) and lower than the end-of-season hospitalization rate for the 2017-2018 season, going back to 2010-2011. When examining rates by age, the highest rate of hospitalization per 100,000 population was among adults aged 65 and older (180.3). Among adults aged 65 and older, rates were highest among adults aged 85 and older (331.1). Among persons aged <65 years, hospitalization rates per 100,000 population were highest among children aged 0-4 years (79.4) followed by adults aged 50-64 years (65.4). When examining rates by race and ethnicity, the highest rate of hospitalization per 100,000 population was among non-Hispanic Black persons (85.4), followed by non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons (73.3), non-Hispanic White persons (51.0), Hispanic/Latino persons (47.2), and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander persons (26.4). Among 17,741 hospitalizations, 17,113 (96.5%) were associated with influenza A virus, 452 (2.5%) with influenza B virus, 29 (0.2%) with influenza A virus and influenza B virus co-infection, and 147 (0.8%) with influenza virus for which the type was not determined. Among 4,214 hospitalizations with influenza A subtype information, 3,167 (75.2%) were A(H3N2), and 1,047 (24.9%) were A(H1N1)pdm09. Based on preliminary data, of the 14,192 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations with more complete data, 3.7% (95% CI: 3.0%-4.4%) also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among 3,140 hospitalized adults with information on underlying medical conditions, 96.6% had at least one reported underlying medical condition, the most commonly reported were hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder, and obesity. Among 1,175 hospitalized women of childbearing age (15-49 years) with information on pregnancy status, 36.6% were pregnant. Among 1,142 hospitalized children with information on underlying medical conditions, 61.8% had at least one reported underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported was asthma, followed by neurologic disease, and obesity.

This percentage remained stable (< 0.3 percentage point change) compared to week 10 and is above the epidemic threshold of 7.2% for this week. Among the 1,684 PIC deaths reported for this week, 629 had COVID-19 listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death on the death certificate, and 18 listed influenza. While current PIC mortality is due primarily to COVID-19, the proportion due to influenza increased from October through mid-December, decreased for eight weeks, and has been stable at low levels for the past six weeks. The data presented are preliminary and may change as more data are received and processed.
