Week9, 2022
1. Influenza activity is increasing in most parts of the U.S., with central and south-central regions reporting the largest increases.
2. 5.8% of specimens tested by clinical labs this week were positive for influenza, with 99.7% Influenza A and 0.3% Influenza B.
3. Public health labs detected 99.4% Influenza A and only 0.6% Influenza B, with A(H3N2) dominating at 100% of A subtypes.
4. Outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses (1.6%) are below the national baseline, with moderate or high activity reported in only three jurisdictions.
5. H3N2 viruses remain genetically related to the vaccine strain but show antigenic differences, indicating potential vaccine mismatch.
6. Hospitalizations due to influenza increased to a cumulative rate of 5.5 per 100,000 population, higher than the 2020-21 season but lower than pre-pandemic seasons.
7. Pediatric deaths increased by two this week, bringing the season total to 10.
8. PIC deaths (pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19) accounted for 13.1% of deaths, above the epidemic threshold, but primarily driven by COVID-19.
9. 5.9% of influenza-positive specimens also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, showing co-circulation of viruses.
10. CDC emphasizes continued influenza vaccination as flu activity rises, with vaccines widely available at pharmacies and clinics.

11. Factors for prediction: Dominance of A(H3N2), geographic hotspots of activity, antigenic differences in H3N2 strains, increasing hospitalizations, and the impact of co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 suggest rising flu activity.
