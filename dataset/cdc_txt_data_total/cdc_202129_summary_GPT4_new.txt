Week29, 2021
1. Influenza activity remains minimal across most regions, with outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) at 1.7%, below the national baseline of 2.6%.
2. Nationwide, ILI visits have increased for three consecutive weeks across all age groups, particularly among ages 0–4, 5–24, and 25–49 years.
3. Public health labs and clinical labs data indicate extremely low activity: no significant findings on Influenza A or B subtype dominance were reported.
4. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported for week 29 of the 2020-2021 season; one pediatric death was previously recorded during this season.
5. Mortality due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) was 7.4%, exceeding the epidemic threshold of 5.5%; most PIC-related deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
6. Alternative healthcare-seeking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic continue to impact the accurate capture and interpretation of ILI and flu trends.
7. No clear vaccination trends were highlighted; the CDC encourages annual flu vaccinations as preparation for possible future increases in flu activity.
8. Regional ILI activity levels remain mostly minimal or low, with only one jurisdiction reporting moderate activity and no jurisdictions at high or very high levels.
9. Novel viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are influencing respiratory illness surveillance systems, complicating influenza trend predictability.
10. Limited data on virologic testing and hospitalizations indicate continued monitoring is needed; trends may shift with further infection reports or seasonal changes.
