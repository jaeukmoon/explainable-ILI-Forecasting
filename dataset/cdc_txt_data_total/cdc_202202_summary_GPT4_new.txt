Week2, 2022
1. Influenza activity remains elevated but declined slightly, with Influenza A(H3N2) being predominant, and flu activity is expected to continue for several weeks.
2. Among clinical lab specimens, 98.6% were Influenza A and 1.4% Influenza B; public health labs reported 99.8% Influenza A and 0.2% Influenza B.
3. The cumulative hospitalization rate is 3.9 per 100,000, higher than the previous season but lower than pre-COVID seasons.
4. Pediatric deaths this season reached 5, with 2 additional deaths reported this week.
5. Mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) is 25.5%, well above the epidemic threshold, but primarily driven by COVID-19.
6. Outpatient respiratory illness visits for ILI accounted for 3.5%, above baseline, with decreases in all age groups; 14 jurisdictions reported moderate ILI activity and 14 reported high or very high activity.
7. Early signs suggest lower flu vaccination coverage this season compared to last; flu vaccines are still recommended.
8. Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 co-infections were detected in 1.8% of hospitalized flu patients, but no antiviral resistance was reported.
9. The genetic match of circulating A(H3N2) viruses to the vaccine is close, but some antigenic differences were observed due to ongoing virus evolution.
10. Influenza activity and trends vary by region, co-circulation of other respiratory viruses continues, and healthcare-seeking behavior affected by COVID-19 complicates interpretation.
