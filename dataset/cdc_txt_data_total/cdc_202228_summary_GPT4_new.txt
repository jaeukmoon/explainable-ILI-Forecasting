Week28, 2022
1. Influenza activity remains very low; clinical labs reported 0.7% positive tests from 42,188 specimens, with 90.9% identified as Influenza A and 9.1% as Influenza B.
2. Public health labs detected 38 positive specimens, with 97.4% Influenza A and 2.6% Influenza B; all Influenza A (H3N2) subtypes accounted for 100% of subtyped cases.
3. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) made up 1.6% of patient visits nationwide, below the national baseline, with variations by age group (highest among children aged 0-4 years at 6.5%).
4. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) accounted for 9.5% of deaths, significantly above the epidemic threshold; the majority (51.1%) were attributed to COVID-19, while only 4 deaths involved influenza.
5. Week 28 saw 722 inpatient hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed influenza, with no updates for cumulative hospitalization rates past June 11, 2022.
6. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported this week, keeping the season's total at 32.
7. Nationwide, most jurisdictions reported "minimal" ILI activity, with only one jurisdiction experiencing "high" activity levels.
8. Co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and RSV, remains a confounding factor in assessing pure influenza trends.
9. Flu vaccinations and vaccination behavior are not detailed, with no significant updates noted.
10. Future influenza activity remains difficult to predict due to low activity, altered healthcare-seeking behavior, and continued pandemic-related disruptions.
