Some key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence from the CDC's weekly ILI surveillance report are as follows:

1. Virologic surveillance: Data from clinical laboratories and public health laboratories are used to monitor the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza and the distribution of influenza virus types and subtypes.

2. Outpatient Illness Surveillance: The U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) tracks the percentage of patient visits for ILI (fever, cough, and/or sore throat) and compares it to the national baseline.

3. Geographic Spread: State and territorial epidemiologists report on the geographic spread of influenza viruses, indicating whether activity is local, sporadic, or non-existent in different jurisdictions.

4. Severe Disease Indicators: Hospitalization rates, mortality rates from pneumonia and influenza (P&I), and pediatric deaths associated with influenza are monitored to assess the severity and impact of the flu.

5. Virus Characterization: Genetic and antigenic characterization of circulating influenza viruses helps inform vaccine development and monitor changes in virus strains. Antiviral medication susceptibility is also assessed.

6. Public Health Recommendations: The CDC emphasizes the importance of annual flu vaccination and the use of antiviral drugs to prevent and treat influenza.

These surveillance components provide valuable information for predicting future ILI occurrences, identifying trends, and informing public health measures to prevent and control the spread of influenza.
