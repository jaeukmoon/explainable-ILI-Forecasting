Based on the provided information from the CDC's Influenza Surveillance Reports, here are the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence:

1. Virologic Surveillance: Monitoring the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical labs and analyzing the distribution of influenza virus types and subtypes in public health labs.
2. Outpatient ILI Surveillance: Tracking the percentage of healthcare visits for ILI and comparing it to national baselines.
3. Geographic Spread: Monitoring the level of local, sporadic, or no influenza activity across different jurisdictions.
4. Severe Disease Indicators: Monitoring hospitalization rates, mortality rates from pneumonia and influenza (P&I), and pediatric deaths associated with influenza.
5. Virus Characterization: Studying the genetic and antigenic properties of circulating viruses and assessing their resistance to antiviral medications.
6. Seasonal Trends and Historical Baselines: Comparing current influenza activity to previous seasons and baselines to identify trends and predict future occurrences.
7. Public Health Recommendations: Promoting widespread flu vaccination and the use of antiviral drugs to prevent and treat flu illness.

These factors collectively contribute to predicting and mitigating future ILI occurrences.
