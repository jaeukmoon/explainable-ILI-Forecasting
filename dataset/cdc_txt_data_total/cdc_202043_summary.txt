Based on the CDC's weekly ILI surveillance report for Week 43 (ending October 24, 2020), the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence are as follows:

- Seasonal inﬂuenza activity in the United States remains low.
- Virologic surveillance in clinical laboratories shows that 0.2% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza.
- In public health labs, inﬂuenza activity has been low during the summer months, and few positive specimens have been reported recently.
- Outpatient ILI surveillance indicates that 1.2% of healthcare visits were for ILI, a slight increase from the previous week, but below the national baseline of 2.6%.
- The ILI activity map shows that most jurisdictions experienced minimal ILI activity, while one jurisdiction had low activity.
- Hospitalization rates and pediatric deaths related to influenza will be updated in future reports.
- Pneumonia, inﬂuenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) mortality rates were above the epidemic threshold, with 8.2% of deaths attributed to PIC.
- There have been no reported influenza-associated pediatric deaths during the 2020-2021 season.
- The CDC strongly recommends annual flu vaccination and the use of antiviral drugs to mitigate the effects of the flu.
- Detailed virologic surveillance information, including subtype/lineage data, is available on the CDC website.
- The geographic spread of influenza, as reported by state and territorial epidemiologists, is currently suspended due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILI surveillance.
- The CDC provides additional national and international influenza surveillance information through various sources such as FluView Interactive, WHO Collaborating Centers for Inﬂuenza, and public health agencies in different countries.

These facts provide insights into the current state of influenza activity in the United States and the surveillance measures in place to monitor and predict future occurrences.
