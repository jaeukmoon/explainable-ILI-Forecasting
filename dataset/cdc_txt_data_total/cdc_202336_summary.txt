First, virologic surveillance is conducted in clinical and public health laboratories to monitor the percentage of specimens that test positive for influenza and the distribution of influenza virus types and subtypes.
- In week 36, 0.7% of specimens tested in clinical laboratories were positive for influenza, with a majority being Influenza A.
- In public health laboratories, 69% of positive specimens were Influenza A, with 100% of those being H1N1pdm09 subtype.

Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance, conducted through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), tracks the percentage of healthcare visits for respiratory illness.
- In week 36, 2.0% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat.

Geographic activity is monitored to assess the spread of influenza across states and jurisdictions.
- During week 36, there were no states with very high or high ILI activity levels, and most areas reported minimal ILI activity.

Hospitalization surveillance is conducted through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) to monitor laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations.
- Data on hospitalizations for the current season are not available at this time.

Mortality surveillance tracks the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) and in pediatric populations.
- In week 36, 7.0% of deaths were attributed to PIC, which is above the epidemic threshold.

Additional national and international influenza surveillance information is available through various organizations and websites.

Overall, these surveillance systems provide data on influenza activity, including the percentage of positive specimens, outpatient illness rates, geographic spread, hospitalizations, and mortality, to predict and monitor future ILI occurrences.
