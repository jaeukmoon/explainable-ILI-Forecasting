Week9, 2024
1. Influenza activity remains elevated nationally, with 13.9% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza this week.
2. Clinical labs reported 56.9% Influenza A and 43.1% Influenza B; public health labs reported 71.1% Influenza A (predominantly A(H1N1)pdm09) and 28.9% Influenza B.
3. Outpatient visits for ILI accounted for 4.1%, slightly declining but still above the national baseline, with regional variations in activity.
4. The cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rate is 64.8 per 100,000, the second highest in Week 9 since the 2017-2018 season.
5. Weekly influenza-associated deaths attributed to influenza are stable at 0.7%, with 10 new pediatric deaths reported (totaling 103 this season).
6. Of positive influenza specimens this week, 57.3% were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 42.7% were A(H3N2) for subtyped specimens, while all Influenza B viruses subtyped belonged to the Victoria lineage.
7. There have been 28 million influenza illnesses, 310,000 hospitalizations, and 20,000 deaths so far this season.
8. CDC recommends annual flu vaccination while flu viruses remain active; vaccines are aligned with circulating strains, but uptake trends were not detailed.
9. Antiviral resistance remains low, but isolated cases of reduced or highly reduced inhibition were detected in A(H1N1)pdm09 with oseltamivir, peramivir, and A(H3N2) using baloxavir.
10. The CDC expects influenza activity to remain elevated in regions with high ILI activity and multiple co-circulating respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, COVID-19).

11. Summary of other key factors:
12. - Regional trends show variability: some regions report declines, while others remain stable or elevated in percent positivity and hospitalizations.
13. - Adults 65+, non-Hispanic Black individuals, and those with underlying conditions have higher hospitalization rates, highlighting high-risk populations.
14. - Flu hospitalizations are decreasing overall but are still trending slightly downward after sharp declines earlier this season.
