1. Influenza activity remains low nationwide, with respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza at 0.7% in both clinical and public health labs.

2. Of 97 viruses reported by public health labs, 96.9% were Influenza A, and 3.1% were Influenza B; Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 dominated at 58.7% of subtyped viruses, followed by A(H3N2) at 41.3%.

3. Six human infections with Influenza A(H5) were reported this week, all linked to occupational exposure in California and Washington, with mild symptoms and no sustained human-to-human transmission observed.

4. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza remains low at 0.3 per 100,000 population, with 93 total hospitalizations reported since October 1.

5. Mortality attributed to influenza accounted for 0.05% of deaths this week, remaining stable from the previous week.

6. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) accounted for 2.1% of reported visits, below the national baseline and showing no increase from the previous week.

7. Influenza A accounted for 88.2% of positive isolates from clinical labs, with Influenza B accounting for the remaining 11.8%.

8. No pediatric deaths have been reported for the current season, and there is no significant increase in severe outcomes.

9. CDC continues to recommend annual influenza vaccination by the end of October, supported by stable coverage data and no significant changes in vaccine effectiveness so far.

10. Future influenza activity remains challenging to predict due to co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, such as RSV and COVID-19, and regional variations in virus distribution.

11. Key additional insights for prediction:
12. - Influenza A(H5) infections linked to occupational exposure may indicate the need for increased surveillance in agricultural and farming sectors.
13. - Stability in ILI and positivity rates suggests limited community spread of flu, though regions with slight positivity increases could be early indicators.
14. - Continued monitoring of co-circulating respiratory pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 and RSV will be crucial for future trend assessment.
