The CDC tracks influenza activity through virologic surveillance, which monitors the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories. During the reported period, 1.1% of patient visits reported through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) were due to influenza-like illness (ILI). The geographic spread of influenza varied across jurisdictions and core-based statistical areas (CBSAs), with some areas experiencing high activity and others minimal or insufficient data for analysis. The CDC also monitors influenza-associated hospitalizations and mortality rates. Additionally, there have been reported cases of human infection with novel influenza A viruses, some of which were contracted from contact with swine. It is important to note that ILI data may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors. The CDC emphasizes the importance of flu vaccination and provides additional information and resources for influenza surveillance at national, state, and international levels.
