7. One influenza-associated pediatric death was reported during Week 1, bringing the total to three for the season.

These facts highlight the ongoing influenza activity, predominant virus strains, impact on healthcare visits, severe disease outcomes, and mortality rates associated with influenza. It showcases the need for continued surveillance and emphasizes the importance of influenza vaccination and antiviral treatment.
