This percentage is below the national baseline of 2.6%.Healthcare seeking behaviors have changed dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. While outpatient ILI activityremains low, many people are accessing the healthcare system in alternative settings. Therefore, while traditionalhealthcare providers are not seeing increased numbers of cases of ILI, it is important to evaluate other sources ofsurveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of both COVID-19 and in@uenza activity. CDC is tracking theCOVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVIDView (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview.html).

This percentage is above theepidemic threshold of 5.8% for week 42.Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually coded causes of deathcollected from death certilcates. Percentages of deaths due to pneumonia, in@uenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) are higheramong manually coded records than more rapidly available machine coded records. Due to the additional time neededfor manual coding, the initially reported PIC percentages are likely to increase as more data are received and processed.
