During Week 46, seasonal influenza activity in the United States remained lower than usual for this time of year. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories was 0.2%, and in public health laboratories, influenza activity was low.

Outpatient illness surveillance showed that 1.5% of visits to healthcare providers were for influenza-like illness (ILI), which is below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILI activity varied across jurisdictions, with some experiencing low activity and others experiencing minimal activity.

Geographic spread of influenza, as assessed by state and territorial epidemiologists, indicated local activity in four states and sporadic activity in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 40 states. Six states reported no activity.

Hospitalization rates and pediatric deaths associated with influenza were not reported for Week 46.

CDC expects flu activity to increase in the coming months, and it emphasizes the importance of annual flu vaccination and the use of antiviral drugs for treating flu illness.

Virologic surveillance, influenza virus characterization, and ILI surveillance are key components of the CDC's influenza surveillance system, providing crucial information for predicting and monitoring future ILI occurrences.
