Note: Due to federal offices being closed on January 9, FluView for Week 1 will be posted on January 13, 2025. Summary Viruses Illness All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. Directional arrows indicate changes between the current week and the previous week. Additional information on the arrows can be found at the bottom of this page. A description of the CDC influenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each data component is available on the surveillance methods page.1 Additional information on the current and previous influenza seasons for each surveillance component are available on FluView Interactive. Key Points • Seasonal influenza activity continues to increase and is elevated across most of the country. • Nationally, percent positivity for influenza, the percentage of emergency department visits for influenza, and influenza-associated hospitalizations increased this week compared to last week. • During Week 52, of the 1,254 viruses reported by public health laboratories, 1,234 were influenza A and 20 were influenza B. Of the 823 influenza A viruses subtyped during Week 52, 335 (40.7%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 488 (59.3%) were A(H3N2). • Outpatient respiratory illness is above baseline nationally for the fifth consecutive week and is above baseline in all 10 HHS regions. • No influenza A(H5) cases were reported to CDC this week. To date, human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H5) virus has not been identified in the United States. • Two pediatric deaths associated with seasonal influenza virus infection were reported this week, bringing the 2024-2025 season total to 11 pediatric deaths. • CDC estimates that there have been at least 5.3 million illnesses, 63,000 hospitalizations, and 2,700 deaths from flu so far this season. • CDC recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older get an annual influenza (flu) vaccine.1 • There are prescription flu antiviral drugs that can treat flu illness; those should be started as early as possible and are especially important for patients at higher risk for severe illness.2 • Influenza viruses are among several viruses contributing to respiratory disease activity. CDC is providing updated, integrated information about COVID-19, flu, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity on a weekly basis. COVID-19, flu, and RSV activity U.S. virologic surveillance Nationally, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza virus in clinical laboratories increased (change of ≥ 0.5 percentage points) compared to the previous week. The regions with the highest percent positivity were regions 8 (28.1), 9 (32.7), and 10 (26.0). Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) were the predominant viruses reported this week. For regional and state level data and age group distribution, please visit FluView Interactive. Viruses known to be associated with recent receipt of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or found upon further testing to be a vaccine virus are not included, as they are not circulating influenza viruses. Clinical Laboratories The results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below. Data from clinical laboratories (the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for influenza virus) are used to monitor whether influenza activity is increasing or decreasing.

It does not reflect specimens tested only at CDC and could include more than one specimen tested per person. The guidance for influenza A(H5) testing recommends testing both a conjunctival and respiratory swab for people with conjunctivitis which has resulted in more specimens testing positive for influenza A(H5) than the number of human H5 cases. For more information on the number of people infected with A(H5), please visit the "How CDC is monitoring influenza data among people to better understand the current avian influenza A (H5N1) situation" †When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a "variant" influenza virus. Most human infections with variant influenza viruses occur following exposure to swine, but human-to-human transmission can occur. It is important to note that in most cases, variant influenza viruses have not shown the ability to spread easily and sustainably from human-to-human.

Additional information regarding human infections with novel influenza A viruses: Surveillance Methods | FluView Interactive Influenza Virus Characterization CDC performs genetic and antigenic characterization of U.S. viruses submitted from state and local public health laboratories according to the Right Size Roadmap submission guidance. These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating influenza viruses are relative to the reference viruses representing the current influenza vaccines. The data are also used to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur in influenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the polymerase acidic protein (PA) endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir. The HA clade and subclades were assigned using Nextclade (https://clades.nextstrain.org). CDC has genetically characterized 698 influenza viruses collected since September 29, 2024. Influenza Virus Characterization from viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29, 2019 Virus Subtype or Lineage Genetic Characterization Total No. of Subtype/Lineage Tested HA Clade Number (% of subtype/lineage tested) HA Subclade Number (% of subtype/lineage tested) A/H1 270 5a.2a 149 (55.2%) C.1.9 149 (55.2%) 5a.2a.1 121 (44.8%) D 4 (1.5%) D.1 1 (0.4%) D.3 13 (4.8%) D.5 103 (38.1%) A/H3 375 2a.3a 5 (1.3%) G.1.3.1 5 (1.3%) 2a.3a.1 370 (98.7%) J.1 1 (0.3%) J.1.1 3 (0.8%) J.2 334 (89.1%) J.2.1 7 (1.9%) J.2.2 25 (6.7%) B/Victoria 53 3a.2 53 (100%) C.3 1 (1.9%) C.5 6 (11.3%) C.5.1 32 (60.4%) C.5.6 8 (15.1%) C.5.7 6 (11.3%) B/Yamagata 0 Y3 0 Y3 0 CDC antigenically characterizes influenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay (H1N1pdm09, H3N2, and B/Victoria viruses) or neutralization-based HINT (H3N2 viruses) using antisera that ferrets make after being infected with reference viruses representing the 2024-2025 Northern Hemisphere recommended cell or recombinant-based vaccine viruses. Antigenic differences between viruses are determined by comparing how well the antibodies made against the vaccine reference viruses recognize the circulating viruses that have been grown in cell culture. Ferret antisera are useful because antibodies raised against a particular virus can often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody titer differences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared to the reference (vaccine) virus. In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer differences of less than or equal to 8-fold. Viruses selected for antigenic characterization are a subset of the recent genetically characterized viruses and are chosen based on the genetic changes in their surface proteins and may not be proportional to the number of such viruses circulating in the United States. Influenza A Viruses A (H1N1)pdm09: 40 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized by HI, and 40 (100%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/67/2022-like reference viruses representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. A (H3N2): 34 A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by HI or HINT, and 19 (55.9%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer in HI or reacting at titers that were less than or equal to 8-fold of the homologous virus in HINT) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Massachusetts/18/2022-like reference viruses representing the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. Influenza B Viruses B/Victoria: 7 influenza B/Victoria-lineage virus were antigenically characterized by HI, and all were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown B/Austria/1359417/2021-like reference viruses representing the B/Victoria component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. B/Yamagata: No influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were available for antigenic characterization. Assessment of Virus Susceptibility to Antiviral Medications CDC assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to the antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using next generation sequence analysis supplemented by laboratory assays. Information about antiviral susceptibility test methods can be found at U.S. Influenza Surveillance: Purpose and Methods. Viruses collected in the U.S. since September 29, 2024, were tested for antiviral susceptibility as follows: Viruses collected in the U.S. tested for antiviral susceptibility Antiviral Medication Total Viruses A/H1 A/H3 B/Victoria Neuraminidase Inhibitors Oseltamivir Viruses Tested 638 249 345 44 Reduced Inhibition 1 (0.2%) 1 (0.4%) 0 0 Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 0 0 0 Peramivir Viruses Tested 638 249 345 44 Reduced Inhibition 0 0 0 0 Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 0 0 0 Zanamivir Viruses Tested 638 249 345 44 Reduced Inhibition 0 0 0 0 Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 0 0 0 PA Cap-Dependent Endonuclease Inhibitor Baloxavir Viruses Tested 635 229 360 46 Decreased Susceptibility 0 0 0 0 One A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-I223V and NA-S247N amino acid substitutions and showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. High levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) viruses (the adamantanes are not effective against influenza B viruses). Therefore, use of these antivirals for treatment and prevention of influenza A virus infection is not recommended and data from adamantane resistance testing are not presented. Outpatient and Emergency Department Illness Surveillance Outpatient respiratory illness visits The U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness [ILI (fever plus cough or sore throat)], not laboratory-confirmed influenza, and will therefore capture respiratory illness visits due to infection with any pathogen that can present with similar symptoms, including influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. It is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. Nationally, during Week 52, 6.8% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. This week's percentage increased (change of > 0.1 percentage points) compared to Week 51 and is above the national baseline of 3.0% for the fifth consecutive week. The percentage of visits for ILI increased (change of > 0.1 percentage points) in all HHS regions compared to Week 51. All HHS regions are above their respective baselines. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infections to ILI varies by location.
