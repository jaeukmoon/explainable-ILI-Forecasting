First, seasonal influenza activity in the United States remains lower than usual for this time of year according to the latest FluView report.
Virologic surveillance data indicates a low percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, both in clinical laboratories (0.1%) and public health laboratories.
Outpatient ILI surveillance shows that 0.9% of patient visits to healthcare providers were for influenza-like illness (ILI), which is below the national baseline of 2.6%.
Geographically, all jurisdictions experienced minimal ILI activity, but ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Hospitalization rates for influenza remain low, with a cumulative rate of 0.7 per 100,000 population, significantly lower than previous seasons.
Mortality surveillance data shows that 13.3% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), exceeding the epidemic threshold of 7.1%.
No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during the reported period, with a total of one reported for the current season.
Information on influenza virus characterization will be updated later this season.
Public health recommendations emphasize the importance of annual flu vaccination and the use of antiviral drugs to treat flu illness.
It's important to note that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on influenza surveillance and activity should be considered when interpreting the data.
