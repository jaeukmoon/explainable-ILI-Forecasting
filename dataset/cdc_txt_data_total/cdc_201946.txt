Virus CharacterizationGenetic and antigeniccharacterization and antiviralsusceptibility of viruses collectedin the U.S. this season is nowbeing reported.Illness
Outpatient Illness: ILINet2.5% of visits to health care providers were for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI). ILI was above the national baseline of 2.4%for the ﬁrst time. Four of 10 regions were at or above their baselines.Outpatient Illness: ILI Activity Map
The number of jurisdictions experiencing high ILIactivity increased from 1 last week to 8 this week;however 44 jurisdictions experienced minimal or lowILI activity.
Geographic Spread
The number of jurisdictions reporting regional orwidespread activity increased from 10 last week to 15this week.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsThe overall hospitalization ratefor the season is 1.4 per 100,000.This is similar to what has beenseen at this time during otherrecent seasons.
P&I Mortality5.2% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia and inﬂuenza(P&I). This is below the epidemicthreshold of 6.2%.
Pediatric DeathsOne new inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric death occurring duringthe 2019-2020 season wasreported to CDC this week. Thetotal for the season is 4.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponents is available on the surveillance methods page.

It’s not too late to get vaccinated. Flu vaccination is always the best way toprevent ﬂu and its potentially serious complications.

The predominant virusvaries by region and the proportion of inﬂuenza B/Victoria viruses is increasing in some regions. Regional and state leveldata about circulating inﬂuenza viruses can be found on FluView Interactive. The predominant virus also varies by agegroup. Nationally, inﬂuenza B/Victoria viruses are the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among children age 0-4years (48% of reported viruses) and 5-24 years (56% of reported viruses), while A(H3N2) viruses are the most commonlyreported inﬂuenza viruses among persons 65 years of age and older (70% of reported viruses). Among adults aged 25-64years, approximately equal proportions of inﬂuenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B/Victoria viruses (33%, 24% and 31%,respectively) have been reported. Additional age data can be found on FluView Interactive.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatinginﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionarychanges that continually occur in circulating inﬂuenza. CDC also tests susceptibility of inﬂuenza viruses to antiviralmedications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonucleaseinhibitor baloxavir.CDC genetically characterizedgenetically characterized 174 inﬂuenza viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29, 2019 to November 16,2019.VirusVirusSubtype orSubtype orLineageLineageGenetic CharacterizationGenetic CharacterizationTotal No. ofTotal No. ofSubtype/LineageSubtype/LineageTestedTested                CladeCladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)                SubcladeSubcladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)A/H1A/H1356B.1A35 (100%)A/H3A/H3773C.2a77 (100%)2a177 (100%)    2a20      2a302a403C.3a03a0B/VictoriaB/Victoria58V1A58 (100%)V1A0V1A.110 (17.2%)V1A.348 (82.8%)B/YamagataB/Yamagata4Y34 (100%)CDC antigenically characterizesantigenically characterizes a subset of inﬂuenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or neutralizationbased Focus Reduction assays (FRA).

The overall hospitalization rate was 1.4 per 100,000 population. The highestrate of hospitalization was among adults aged ≥65 (3.6 per 100,000 population), followed by children aged 0-4 (2.2 per100,000 population) and adults aged 50-64 (1.4 per 100,000 population). Rates are similar to what has been seen at thistime during other recent seasons. Among 393 hospitalizations, 246(62.6%) were associated with inﬂuenza A virus, 142(36.1%) with inﬂuenza B virus, 3 (0.8%) with inﬂuenza A virus and inﬂuenza B virus co-infection, and 2 (0.5%) withinﬂuenza virus for which the type was not determined. Among those with inﬂuenza A subtype information, 28 (50.0%)were A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and 28 (50.0%) were A(H3N2).
