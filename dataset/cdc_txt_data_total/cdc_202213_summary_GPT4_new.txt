1. Influenza activity increased nationally, with the central and south-central regions showing the highest activity and rising trends in the northeast.
2. 8.3% of respiratory specimens tested in clinical labs were positive for influenza, with 98.5% being Influenza A and 1.5% Influenza B.
3. Public health labs reported 99.8% of influenza-positive specimens as Influenza A, primarily subtype A(H3N2).
4. Outpatient visits for respiratory illness were 1.9%, below the national baseline, though activity increased in certain jurisdictions and among individuals aged 5–24 years.
5. Cumulative hospitalization rates for influenza were 8.0 per 100,000, higher than in 2020-21 but lower than pre-COVID seasonal averages.
6. Mortality attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) was 7.5%, exceeding the epidemic threshold, with most deaths linked to COVID-19 rather than influenza.
7. Two pediatric deaths from influenza-associated illnesses were reported, bringing the season’s total to 16.
8. Of influenza-associated hospitalizations, 95.1% involved Influenza A, with 98.8% of subtyped cases being A(H3N2). Additionally, 3.2% of hospitalizations tested positive for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2.
9. Vaccination remains strongly recommended; A(H3N2) strains are genetically similar to the vaccine strain but show antigenic differences.
10. Antiviral susceptibility testing indicated no significant resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors, though one A(H3N2) specimen showed reduced susceptibility to baloxavir.

11. Summary of other key factors:
12. - Long-term care facilities reported low influenza activity, with 0.7% of facilities logging at least one positive test.
13. - Multiple respiratory viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2, contributed to respiratory illness, complicating attribution to influenza.
14. - Regions with higher activity may experience localized intensification as epidemiologic trends suggest growing transmission potential in these areas.
