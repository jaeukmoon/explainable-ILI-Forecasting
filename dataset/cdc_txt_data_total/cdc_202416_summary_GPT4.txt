- **Novel Influenza virus (like COVID-19):** No notable novel influenza virus activity, but respiratory illness surveillance includes multiple pathogens, like COVID-19 and RSV.

- **Vaccination trends:** CDC continues to recommend flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older while flu activity persists. Vaccines are effective against circulating strains.

- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits:** 2.3% of outpatient visits were for respiratory illness, below the national baseline, with all regions below regional baselines except Region 1 (at baseline). Respiratory illness visits are decreasing nationally.

- **Other key factors:** Hospital admissions decreased compared to the previous week. Regions 7, 1, and 5 reported the highest positivity rates, though decreasing nationally. Population groups most affected by severe outcomes include older adults aged 65+ and children under 4. Most hospitalized patients had underlying health conditions.
