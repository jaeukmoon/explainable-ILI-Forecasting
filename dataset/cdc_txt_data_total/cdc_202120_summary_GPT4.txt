- **Viruses, illness, and deaths**: Seasonal influenza activity remains unusually low. 0.1% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza, with Influenza A accounting for 66.7% and Influenza B for 33.3%. Pediatric influenza-associated deaths for the 2020–21 season remain at one. 9.5% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), primarily due to COVID-19, and above the epidemic threshold of 6.3%.

- **U.S. virologic surveillance**: Positive specimens have been minimal, with public health labs reporting only one Influenza A specimen and no Influenza B. Genetic characterization shows circulating A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Victoria viruses align antigenically with current vaccine strains. One human case of a novel Influenza A(H1N2)v was reported in Ohio, linked to swine exposure, with no human-to-human transmission observed.

- **Cumulative hospitalization rate**: The cumulative hospitalization rate for the 2020-21 season is 0.8 per 100,000 population, the lowest in surveillance history and one-tenth of the 2011–12 rate.

- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza**: Influenza remains a minimal contributor to overall PIC deaths, which are driven by COVID-19.

- **Percentage of Influenza A and Influenza B**: Clinical labs report 66.7% Influenza A and 33.3% Influenza B. Public health labs report Influenza A at 100%, with no Influenza B detected.

- **Novel influenza viruses**: One case of Influenza A(H1N2)v was detected. No human-to-human transmission has been observed.

- **Vaccination trends**: An annual flu vaccine is recommended as the best protection against influenza and related complications.

- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits**: 1.3% of outpatient visits were for influenza-like illness (ILI), below the national baseline of 2.6%. All jurisdictions reported minimal ILI activity, with no significant increases.

- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC**: CDC indicates continued low flu activity.

- **Other key factors**: COVID-19 impacts on healthcare seeking and surveillance data must be considered when interpreting results. Increasing ILI visits are noted among young children (0–4 years).
