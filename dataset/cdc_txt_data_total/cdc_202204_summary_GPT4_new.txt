Week4, 2022
1. Influenza activity has decreased but remains sporadic across the U.S.; 1.7% of tested clinical specimens were positive for influenza.
2. Influenza A(H3N2) forms 97% of clinical lab positives and 99.2% of public health lab positives, with Influenza B forming a minor proportion.
3. Outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses accounted for 2.0%, below the national baseline, with downward trends in all age groups.
4. Pediatric deaths from influenza remain at zero for the week, with five reported this season.
5. Hospitalization rate for influenza (4.4 per 100,000) is higher than the 2020-21 season but lower than pre-COVID-19 seasons.
6. Influenza vaccination coverage is lower compared to the previous season. CDC recommends vaccination for all individuals aged 6 months and older.
7. Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) were at 28.6%, primarily driven by COVID-19, surpassing epidemic thresholds.
8. SARS-CoV-2 co-infections were identified in 5.7% of flu positives in public lab testing.
9. Antiviral resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors, peramivir, and baloxavir was not observed in tested samples.
10. Two jurisdictions reported moderate activity, while four saw high/very high activity; most areas report low or minimal ILI activity.

11. Summary for predictions: Sporadic influenza activity, concurrent circulation of other respiratory viruses, lower vaccination rates, and co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 underline the potential for uneven flu activity in coming weeks.
