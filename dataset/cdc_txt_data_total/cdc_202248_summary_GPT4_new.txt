Week48, 2022
1. Influenza activity is increasing nationally, with the southeast and south-central U.S. reporting the highest levels.
2. Clinical labs reported a 6.8% positivity rate for influenza, with 80.3% being Influenza A and 19.7% Influenza B.
3. Public health labs found 79.9% of viruses were Influenza A (74.1% A(H1N1) and 25.9% A(H3N2)) and 20.1% were Influenza B.
4. Outpatient respiratory illness visits were at 4.0%, above the national baseline of 2.9%, with increases in most regions.
5. Cumulative hospitalization rate for the season stands at 5.5 per 100,000, predominantly affecting adults aged 65+.
6. There have been 5,753 hospitalized cases and 12 total pediatric deaths this season, including four in Week 48.
7. Mortality due to influenza accounted for 0.2% of all deaths, showing an upward trend.
8. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 is the predominant circulating virus, with region-specific variances in Influenza B proportions.
9. CDC estimates at least 2.6 million illnesses, 26,000 hospitalizations, and 1,600 deaths from flu so far this season.
10. Vaccination continues to be emphasized, with availability still sufficient for individuals aged 6 months and older.
11. Influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 remain contributors to respiratory disease, emphasizing the need for multi-virus monitoring.
12. Prescription flu antivirals remain effective, with all tested viruses showing no resistance to current treatments.
13. High activity in regions signals increased risk of flu spread, especially in areas with co-circulating respiratory viruses.

14. Key insights indicate widespread influenza A dominance, rising outpatient visits, and hospitalizations with geographic hotspots, suggesting the potential for further increases in flu activity. Vaccination and use of antivirals are vital for mitigation.
