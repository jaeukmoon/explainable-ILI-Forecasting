First, virologic surveillance plays a critical role in monitoring the percentage of specimens tested positive for influenza in clinical labs and the distribution of influenza virus types and subtypes in public health labs. During the reported period, 0.6% of specimens tested positive in clinical labs, with the majority being Influenza A viruses.

Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance, specifically the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), tracks the percentage of patient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI). During the reported period, 1.9% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat.

Geographic activity of ILI is measured using ILINet data and is categorized as "very high," "high," "moderate," "low," or "minimal." The activity level varied across jurisdictions, with some experiencing higher ILI activity than others.

Hospitalization surveillance, conducted through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) and the HHS Protect system, provides data on the number of hospitalizations related to influenza. The data for the reported period were not provided in the given report.

Mortality surveillance tracks the proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19. During the reported period, 9.6% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19, which is above the epidemic threshold of 5.5%.

The report also mentions virologic surveillance information, including genetic and antigenic characterization of circulating viruses, in-depth data on pediatric mortality, and additional international influenza surveillance information.

Public health recommendations, such as getting a flu vaccine and using antiviral drugs, are emphasized as effective prevention and treatment measures against influenza.

Overall, the surveillance data collected provides insights into influenza activity, geographic spread, severity, and the effectiveness of preventive measures.
