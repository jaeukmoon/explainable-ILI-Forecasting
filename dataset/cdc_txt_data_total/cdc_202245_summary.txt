According to the CDC FluView report for Week 45 ending on November 12, 2022, the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence are:

- Seasonal influenza activity is elevated across the country.
- The majority of influenza viruses detected this season are influenza A(H3N2) viruses, but the proportion of subtyped influenza A viruses that are A(H1N1)pdm09 is increasing slightly.
- Two more influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during the week, bringing the total to seven pediatric deaths reported so far this season.
- CDC estimates that there have been at least 4.4 million illnesses, 38,000 hospitalizations, and 2,100 deaths from influenza so far this season.
- The cumulative hospitalization rate in the FluSurv-NET system is higher than the rate observed in week 45 during every previous season since 2010-2011.
- The majority of influenza viruses tested are genetically similar to the viruses included in this season's influenza vaccine.
- CDC recommends an annual flu vaccine as the best way to protect against influenza and its potentially serious complications.
- There are also prescription flu antiviral drugs available that can be used to treat flu illness.

These facts provide insights into the current influenza activity, severity, and the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, which can inform predictions about future ILI occurrence.
