First, the virologic surveillance data shows low levels of influenza activity, with only 0.2% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories. Influenza A and Influenza B viruses were detected, but overall activity was low.

Outpatient illness surveillance indicates that 1.6% of visits to healthcare providers were for influenza-like illness (ILI), which is below the national baseline of 2.6%. However, ILI activity should be interpreted with caution due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in healthcare-seeking behavior.

The geographic spread of influenza was minimal in most jurisdictions, with only one jurisdiction experiencing moderate ILI activity (Louisiana). Most areas reported sporadic or no influenza activity.

Severe disease indicators, such as hospitalizations and mortality, varied. There were no influenza-associated pediatric deaths reported during the current season. However, 11.3% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), which is above the epidemic threshold of 6.3%.

Virus characterization data will be updated later in the season, once sufficient specimens have been tested to assess the genetic and antigenic properties of circulating influenza viruses.

CDC emphasizes the importance of getting an annual flu vaccine to protect against influenza and its complications. Antiviral drugs are also available for the treatment of flu illness.

Overall, flu activity is low but may increase in the coming months. It is crucial to continue practicing preventive measures and seek vaccination to reduce the spread of influenza.
