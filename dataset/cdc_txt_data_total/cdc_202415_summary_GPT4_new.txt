Week15, 2024
1. Seasonal influenza activity declined nationally, with 5.9% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza this week.
2. Public health labs reported 210 positive cases, with 62.4% being Influenza A and 37.6% Influenza B; Influenza A subtypes included 47.3% (H1N1)pdm09 and 52.7% H3N2.
3. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) were 2.5%, below the national baseline, with decreases reported in most regions.
4. The cumulative hospitalization rate for influenza stands at 77.5 per 100,000, the second highest at this point in the season since 2010-2011, with hospital admissions notably decreasing since January.
5. Four pediatric influenza-associated deaths were reported, bringing the season total to 142.
6. Influenza vaccines continue to be recommended, with antiviral drugs advised for early treatment in high-risk groups.
7. Mortality data show 0.4% of deaths attributed to influenza, a slight increase from the previous week.
8. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), along with B viruses, are co-circulating and contribute to variable regional activity.
9. Genetic and antigenic characterizations show most viruses are well-matched to the current season's vaccine components.
10. Regional and population-specific variations, including higher hospitalization rates among older adults and certain racial/ethnic groups, remain critical for future ILI predictions.
