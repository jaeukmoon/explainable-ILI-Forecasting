Week20, 2022
1. Influenza activity is increasing in some parts of the U.S., with 6.4% of clinical lab specimens testing positive, predominantly for Influenza A(H3N2).
2. Influenza A accounted for 99.6% of clinical lab positive results and 100% of public health lab results this week; Influenza B remains rare at 0.4%.
3. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) are at 2.4%, stable compared to the previous week and below baseline, with moderate to high activity in 8 jurisdictions.
4. A cumulative hospitalization rate of 15.5 per 100,000 population was reported, with 3,039 new hospitalizations this week; older adults and very young children show the highest rates.
5. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) reached 8.0%, above the epidemic threshold, with influenza contributing minimally to deaths.
6. One pediatric death was reported this week, bringing the season's total to 25.
7. Vaccination is ongoing, and the CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination as most viruses are genetically similar to the vaccine strains, but antigenic differences are present.
8. Co-circulation of respiratory viruses is noted, with 4.5% of influenza-positive samples also testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.
9. Antiviral resistance remains negligible, with only one H3N2 virus showing reduced susceptibility to baloxavir.
10. Late-season activity extends surveillance; future influenza activity may vary regionally and needs continuous monitoring.
