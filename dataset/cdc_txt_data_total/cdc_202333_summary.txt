First, virologic surveillance plays a critical role by monitoring the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for influenza in both clinical and public health laboratories. For the reported period, 0.5% of specimens tested in clinical laboratories and 0.3% of specimens tested in public health laboratories were positive for influenza.

Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance, specifically the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), tracks the percentage of patient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI). For this season, 1.5% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat.

Geographic activity of ILI is also monitored, with an ILI activity map showing the activity level in different states/jurisdictions. During the reported period, ILI activity levels ranged from minimal to moderate across the country.

Hospitalization surveillance, including FluSurv-NET and HHS Protect, provides information on laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations. The data indicate the number of hospitalizations due to influenza during the reported period.

Mortality surveillance is conducted to monitor the number of deaths attributed to influenza, pneumonia, and COVID-19. During the reported period, 10.0% of deaths were due to pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19, which is above the epidemic threshold.

Pediatric mortality surveillance tracks influenza-associated deaths among children. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the current season have been reported to CDC.

These surveillance systems provide valuable information for predicting future ILI occurrence and understanding the impact of influenza on public health.
