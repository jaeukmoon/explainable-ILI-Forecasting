Week13, 2023
- **Viruses, illness, and deaths**: Seasonal influenza activity remains low nationally, with 0.9% of clinical specimens testing positive for influenza. Influenza A(H1N1) was the most frequently reported subtype. There have been 18,000 deaths, including 1 pediatric death this week, bringing the season total to 139 pediatric deaths. 7.9% of deaths this week were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19, exceeding the epidemic threshold of 7.1%.

- **U.S. virologic surveillance**: 59.1% of public health lab-confirmed cases were Influenza A, and 40.9% were Influenza B. Within Influenza A cases, 62.5% were A(H1N1), and 37.5% were A(H3N2). The majority of tested influenza viruses were antigenically similar to those included in the current vaccine.

- **Cumulative hospitalization rate**: The cumulative seasonal hospitalization rate reached 61.1 per 100,000 population, significantly affecting older adults (181.6 per 100,000, especially 85+ years). Weekly hospitalization rates remained low and stable.

- **Trends of deaths attributed to influenza**: Deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) remained stable but surpassed the epidemic threshold, with influenza-related deaths low.

- **Percentage of Influenza A and B**: Clinical labs reported 49.8% Influenza A and 50.2% Influenza B. Public health lab data showed 59.1% Influenza A and 40.9% Influenza B.

- **Novel influenza virus (like COVID-19)**: No reports of novel influenza viruses. Among hospitalized flu patients, 3.8% also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

- **Vaccination trends**: CDC continues to recommend vaccination for everyone aged 6 months and older as flu activity persists. Vaccine effectiveness data align with circulating virus strains.

- **Outpatient respiratory illness visits**: 2.3% of outpatient visits were for influenza-like illness (ILI), below the national baseline of 2.5%. Activity was moderate or high in 5 jurisdictions, with other regions predominantly minimal or low.

- **Expectation of flu activity from CDC**: Flu activity is expected to remain low as the season progresses.

- **Other key factors**: Flu has impacted long-term care facilities minimally (0.4% reported ≥1 influenza-positive case). Antiviral susceptibility remains high for all influenza viruses tested, apart from one A(H1N1)pdm09 strain with reduced oseltamivir inhibition. High rates of co-circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, contribute to overall respiratory illness levels.
