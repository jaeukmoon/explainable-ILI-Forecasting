Week3, 2022
1. Influenza activity remains stable with 1.9% of clinical specimens and 1.3% of public health specimens testing positive, primarily Influenza A(H3N2) (97.4% of clinical and 99.8% of public health positives).
2. Outpatient respiratory illness visits for ILI decreased slightly but are at 2.8%, above the national baseline; high or very high activity was reported in 12 jurisdictions.
3. Cumulative hospitalization rate increased to 4.3 per 100,000, with adults aged 65+ having the highest rate (11.3).
4. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) deaths accounted for 28.4%, largely from COVID-19; only 0.5% of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
5. Vaccination rates this season are lower than last year, but the CDC continues to urge annual flu vaccinations.
6. No pediatric influenza-associated deaths were reported this week, with a total of five deaths this season.
7. 0.8% of long-term care facilities reported at least one influenza-positive test among residents, indicating limited spread in these settings.
8. Antiviral susceptibility testing revealed no significant resistance to commonly used influenza antivirals like oseltamivir and zanamivir.
9. Flu activity is expected to persist for several weeks, and multiple respiratory viruses like RSV and COVID-19 are co-circulating, impacting local ILI trends.
10. Variability in influenza contributions across regions and evolving antigenic differences in H3N2 viruses may influence future activity predictions.
