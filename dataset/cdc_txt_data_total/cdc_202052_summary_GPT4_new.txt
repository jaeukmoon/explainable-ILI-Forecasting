Week52, 2020
1. Influenza activity remains unusually low this season, with respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza at 0.3%.
2. Clinical labs reported 74 positive specimens, 35.1% Influenza A and 64.9% Influenza B.
3. Public health labs detected only 2 positive specimens this week, both Influenza A and subtyped as (H1N1)pdm09.
4. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) accounted for 1.6%, below the national baseline of 2.6%, and showed stable trends compared to last week.
5. No new pediatric influenza deaths were reported; the season total remains at one.
6. Pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) caused 13.6% of deaths, above the epidemic threshold of 6.8%, with most PIC deaths due to COVID-19.
7. There were 101 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations this season, below normal levels for this point in the season.
8. Influenza vaccination remains recommended, but detailed trends on vaccination uptake are not reported.
9. Surveillance systems, including ILI and virologic data, may be impacted by alternative care-seeking behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
10. Flu activity is projected to remain low but could rise in the coming months, underscoring the need for continued monitoring.

11. Other key factors: Healthcare-seeking changes during the pandemic complicate traditional surveillance interpretation. A large proportion of respiratory illnesses may be linked to COVID-19 rather than influenza. The limited circulation of influenza strains suggests an atypical season with ongoing pandemic disruptions.
