Based on the provided information, the key facts regarding predicting future ILI occurrence are:

1. Virologic surveillance is conducted to monitor the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza. The predominant viruses during the reported period were Influenza A (H3N2 and H1N1) and Influenza B.

2. Outpatient ILI surveillance tracks the percentage of healthcare visits for ILI. During the reported period, 1.4% of visits were for ILI, which was below the national baseline of 2.4%.

3. Geographic activity varies, with some jurisdictions experiencing minimal ILI activity and others experiencing moderate activity, such as Louisiana.

4. The geographic spread of flu is reported by state and territorial epidemiologists, indicating whether activity is local, sporadic, or absent in different jurisdictions.

5. Severe disease indicators, such as hospitalization rates and mortality rates from pneumonia and influenza (P&I), provide insights into the impact of the flu. During the reported period, 5.0% of deaths were attributed to P&I, below the epidemic threshold of 5.6%.

6. No inﬂuenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported during the current season.

7. Virus characterization is conducted to identify the genetic and antigenic properties of circulating viruses and assess their resistance to antiviral medications. This information helps monitor evolutionary changes and ensure the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments.

8. Public health recommendations include widespread flu vaccination and the use of antiviral drugs to reduce illness severity.

9. Data are preliminary and subject to change as more reports are received.

These facts provide insight into the current ILI activity and can help inform predictions for future ILI occurrence.
