Week43, 2022
1. Influenza activity is increasing nationwide, with the Southeastern and South-Central regions reporting the highest levels, followed by the Mid-Atlantic and South-Central West Coast regions.
2. 9.0% of clinical lab specimens tested positive for influenza, with 98.9% being Influenza A and 1.1% Influenza B.
3. Public health labs reported that 99.8% of positive specimens were Influenza A, comprising 33.8% A(H1N1) and 66.3% A(H3N2).
4. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) accounted for 4.3% of visits, exceeding the national baseline of 2.5%, with increases seen in all age groups and most regions.
5. The cumulative hospitalization rate of 2.9 per 100,000 is the highest for week 43 since the 2010-2011 season, particularly high in adults aged ≥65 (6.3/100,000) and children aged 0-4 (5.5/100,000).
6. 9.1% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC), above the epidemic threshold of 6.0%, though primarily driven by COVID-19.
7. Two influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported so far this season, both linked to Influenza A(H3).
8. A novel influenza A(H3N2v) case with swine exposure was reported in New Mexico; no person-to-person transmission identified.
9. CDC estimates 1.6 million flu illnesses, 13,000 hospitalizations, and 730 deaths this season to date, emphasizing the value of annual vaccination.
10. Trends in vaccination uptake and antiviral efficacies were not detailed but remain critical in limiting severe outcomes and spread.

11. Summary insights suggest a highly active flu season, dominated by Influenza A(H3N2), increased ILI activity, and hospitalization rates signaling greater severity compared to previous seasons. Regional surges and concurrent COVID-19 trends could further influence flu outcomes.
