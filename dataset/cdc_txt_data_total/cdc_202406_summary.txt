- Genetic and antigenic characterization of influenza viruses will be provided in the report.

2. Outpatient Respiratory Illness:
- Nationally, 4.5% of patient visits reported through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) were due to respiratory illness (ILI), which is above the national baseline of 2.9%.
- Moderate to high ILI activity was experienced by 10 jurisdictions, while the remaining jurisdictions reported low to minimal activity.
