Week48, 2020
1. Seasonal flu activity remains unusually low for Week 48, possibly influenced by COVID-19 mitigation measures. Only 0.1% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza this week.
2. Outpatient respiratory illness visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) constituted 1.6% of healthcare provider visits, remaining below the national baseline of 2.6%. This level is stable compared to the previous week, with five jurisdictions reporting low ILI activity and all others at minimal levels.
3. Deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) were 12.8%, above the epidemic threshold of 6.4%, primarily driven by COVID-19, with only three influenza-related deaths reported.
4. Influenza A accounted for 58.8% of positive clinical lab specimens, with Influenza B at 41.2%. In public health labs, Influenza A also dominated (60%) over Influenza B (40%), with more detailed subtype information pending.
5. No pediatric influenza-associated deaths have been reported for the 2020-2021 season so far.
6. Cumulative hospitalization rates and influenza virus characterization updates will begin later this season, with currently insufficient data for predictive trends.
7. Vaccination is emphasized as the best preventative measure for flu, with recommendations for immediate vaccination if not yet received.
8. ILI surveillance data may be skewed due to changes in healthcare-seeking behavior and overlaps with COVID-19 symptoms, necessitating caution in interpretation of trends.
9. CDC expects flu activity may increase in upcoming months but is currently below typical seasonal levels, suggesting continued monitoring is critical.
10. Key influencing factors include low levels of influenza virus circulation, pervasive COVID-19 impact on healthcare and surveillance, and extensive public health measures like masking and distancing likely playing a role in limiting flu spread.
