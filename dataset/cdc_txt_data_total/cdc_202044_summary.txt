First, virologic surveillance indicates that seasonal influenza activity remains low in the United States. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories is 0.1% for the reported week. In public health laboratories, influenza activity has been low in recent weeks. 

Outpatient illness surveillance shows that 1.3% of visits to healthcare providers were for influenza-like illness (ILI), which is below the national baseline of 2.6%. The majority of jurisdictions experienced minimal ILI activity, while one jurisdiction had moderate activity, and one had low activity.

The geographic spread of influenza, as assessed by state and territorial epidemiologists, is not reported for the 2020-21 influenza season due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILI surveillance.

Severe disease indicators include hospitalization rates and mortality rates from pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC). The hospitalization rates are not reported for the current week. The PIC mortality rate for the previous week was 8.1%, which is above the epidemic threshold of 6.0%. One influenza-associated pediatric death occurred during the previous season, bringing the total for that season to 195. No deaths have been reported for the current season.

Virus characterization data, including genetic and antigenic information, will be updated weekly later in the season when sufficient specimens are tested.

Importantly, an annual flu vaccine is recommended as the best way to protect against influenza. Antiviral drugs are also available for treating flu illness.

These surveillance components provide critical information for predicting and monitoring future influenza occurrences and guiding public health interventions.
