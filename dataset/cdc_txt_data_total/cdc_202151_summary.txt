According to the weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report for Week 51 ending December 25, 2021, the key facts regarding predicting future ILI (influenza-like illness) occurrence are as follows:

1. Influenza activity is increasing in the United States, with the majority of viruses detected being influenza A(H3N2).
2. The percentage of outpatient visits for respiratory illness, including ILI, is trending upwards and is above the national baseline.
3. Moderate to high ILI activity has been reported in several jurisdictions.
4. Influenza hospitalization rates are increasing.
5. Pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 mortality rates are above the epidemic threshold for this week.
6. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during week 51.
7. Genetic characterization of influenza viruses is ongoing, with most H3N2 viruses closely related to the vaccine virus but some antigenic differences.
8. Outpatient ILI surveillance data should be interpreted in the context of other respiratory virus activity, including COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens.

Overall, the data suggests that influenza activity is increasing, and it is important for individuals to get vaccinated and take preventive measures to protect against influenza and its potential complications.
