P&I Mortality7.6% of deaths wereattributed to pneumonia,inﬂuenza, or COVID-19(PIC). This is aboveabove theepidemic threshold of5.8%.
Pediatric DeathsTwo inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric deaths occurringduring the 2019-20 seasonwere reported to CDCbringing the total for thatseason to 194. No deathsoccurring during the 2020-21 season were reported.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detaileddescriptions of each data component is available on the surveillance methods page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillancecomponent are available on FluView Interactive.Key PointsKey PointsAn annual ﬂu vaccine is the best way to protect against ﬂu and its potentially seriouscomplications.CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get a ﬂu vaccine by the end of October.There are also ﬂu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat ﬂu illness.U.S. Virologic Surveillance:Clinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

These data are used to comparehow similar the currently circulating inﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses representingviruses contained in the current inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionary changes thatcontinually occur in inﬂuenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of inﬂuenzaviruses to antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, andperamivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated weekly starting later this season when a suﬃcient numberof specimens have been tested.Outpatient Illness SurveillanceILINetNationwide during week 42, 1.2% of patient visits reported through the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-likeIllness Surveillance Network (ILINet) were due to inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI). This percentage is belowthe national baseline of 2.6%.Healthcare seeking behaviors have changed dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whileoutpatient ILI activity remains low, many people are accessing the healthcare system in alternativesettings. Therefore, while traditional healthcare providers are not seeing increased numbers of casesof ILI, it is important to evaluate other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accuratepicture of both COVID-19 and inﬂuenza activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weeklypublication called COVIDView.

Due tothe impact of COVID-19 on ILI surveillance, and the fact that the state and territorial epidemiologistsreport relies heavily on ILI activity, reporting for this system will be suspended for the 2020-21inﬂuenza season.

This percentage is above the epidemic threshold of 5.8% for week 42.Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually codedcauses of death collected from death certiﬁcates. Percentages of deaths due to pneumonia, inﬂuenza,or COVID-19 (PIC) are higher among manually coded records than more rapidly available machinecoded records. Due to the additional time needed for manual coding, the initially reported PICpercentages are likely to increase as more data are received and processed.
