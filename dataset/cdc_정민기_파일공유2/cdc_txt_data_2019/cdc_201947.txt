Outpatient Illness: ILINet2.9% of visits to health care providers were for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI). ILI has been at or above the nationalbaseline of 2.4% for three weeks. Four of 10 regions were at or above their baselines.Outpatient Illness: ILI Activity Map
The number of jurisdictions experiencing high ILIactivity remained at 8 this week. In addition, 7jurisdictions had moderate activity compared to 0 lastweek.
Geographic Spread
The number of jurisdictions reporting regional orwidespread activity increased from 15 last week to 24this week.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsThe overall hospitalization ratefor the season is 2.0 per 100,000.This is similar to what has beenseen at this time during otherrecent seasons.
P&I Mortality5.1% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia and inﬂuenza(P&I). This is below the epidemicthreshold of 6.3%.
Pediatric DeathsOne new inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric death occurring duringthe 2019-2020 season wasreported to CDC this week. Thetotal for the season is 5.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponents is available on the surveillance methods page. Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView InteractiveKey PointsKey PointsNationally, ILI activity has been at or above baseline for three weeks; however, the amount of inﬂuenza activityacross the country varies with the south and parts of the west seeing elevated activity while other parts of thecountry are still seeing low activity.There is signiﬁcant cocirculation of inﬂuenza B/Victoria, A(H1N1)pdm09, and A(H3N2) viruses with thepredominant virus varying by region and age group.The ﬂu season is just getting started. It’s not too late to get vaccinated. Flu vaccination is always the best way toprevent ﬂu and its potentially serious complications.U.S. Virologic SurveillanceClinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

The predominant virusvaries by region and the proportion of inﬂuenza B/Victoria viruses is increasing in some regions. Regional and state leveldata about circulating inﬂuenza viruses can be found on FluView Interactive. The predominant virus also varies by agegroup. Nationally, inﬂuenza B/Victoria viruses are the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among children age 0-4years (50% of reported viruses) and 5-24 years (59% of reported viruses), while A(H3N2) viruses are the most commonlyreported inﬂuenza viruses among persons 65 years of age and older (59% of reported viruses). Among adults aged 25-64years, approximately equal proportions of inﬂuenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria viruses (32% and 33%, respectively)have been reported. Additional age data can be found on FluView Interactive.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatinginﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionarychanges that continually occur in circulating inﬂuenza. CDC also tests susceptibility of inﬂuenza viruses to antiviralmedications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonucleaseinhibitor baloxavir.CDC genetically characterizedgenetically characterized 216 inﬂuenza viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29, 2019 to November 23,2019.VirusVirusSubtype orSubtype orLineageLineageGenetic CharacterizationGenetic CharacterizationTotal No. ofTotal No. ofSubtype/LineageSubtype/LineageTestedTested                CladeCladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)                SubcladeSubcladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)A/H1A/H1446B.1A44 (100%)A/H3A/H3923C.2a92 (100%)2a192 (100%)    2a20      2a302a403C.3a03a0B/VictoriaB/Victoria72V1A72 (100%)V1A0V1A.110 (17.2%)V1A.362 (82.8%)B/YamagataB/Yamagata8Y38 (100%)CDC antigenically characterizesantigenically characterizes a subset of inﬂuenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or neutralizationbased Focus Reduction assays (FRA).
