Key Updates for Week 49, ending December 7, 2019Seasonal inﬂuenza activity in the United States has been elevated for ﬁve weeks and continues toSeasonal inﬂuenza activity in the United States has been elevated for ﬁve weeks and continues toincrease.increase.Viruses
Clinical Lab11.3% of respiratory specimenstested by clinical laboratorieswere positive for inﬂuenzaviruses. This is higher than theprevious week.
Public Health LabNationally, B/Victoria viruses aremost common followed byA(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2)viruses. The predominant virusvaries by region and age group.

Geographic Spread
The number of jurisdictions reporting regional orwidespread activity increased to 38 this week from 30last week.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsThe overall hospitalization ratefor the season is 3.9 per 100,000.This is similar to what has beenseen at this time during otherrecent seasons.
P&I Mortality5.0% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia and inﬂuenza(P&I). This is below the epidemicthreshold of 6.5%.
Pediatric DeathsFour new inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric deaths occurring duringthe 2019-2020 season werereported to CDC this week. Thetotal for the season is 10.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive.U.S. Virologic SurveillanceClinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

A/H1N1viruses are the next most common and are increasing in proportion relative to other inﬂuenza viruses in someregions.CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 2.6 million ﬂu illnesses, 23,000 hospitalizations and1,300 deaths from ﬂu.It’s not too late to get vaccinated.  Flu vaccination is always the best way to prevent ﬂu and its potentially seriouscomplications.Antiviral medications are an important adjunct to ﬂu vaccine in the control of inﬂuenza.  Almost all (>99%) of theinﬂuenza viruses tested this season are susceptible to the 4 FDA-approved inﬂuenza antiviral medicationsrecommended for use in the U.S. this season.

The predominant virus varies by region and the proportions ofinﬂuenza B/Victoria and inﬂuenza A(H1N1)pmd09 viruses are increasing in some regions. Regional and state level dataabout circulating inﬂuenza viruses can be found on FluView Interactive. The predominant virus also varies by age group.Nationally, inﬂuenza B/Victoria viruses are the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among children age 0-4 years(46% of reported viruses) and 5-24 years (59% of reported viruses), while A(H3N2) viruses are the most commonlyreported inﬂuenza viruses among persons 65 years of age and older (47% of reported viruses). Among adults aged 25-64years, approximately equal proportions of inﬂuenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria viruses (38% and 34%, respectively)have been reported. Additional age data can be found on FluView Interactive.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatinginﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionarychanges that continually occur in circulating inﬂuenza. CDC also tests susceptibility of inﬂuenza viruses to antiviralmedications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonucleaseinhibitor baloxavir.CDC genetically characterizedgenetically characterized 369 inﬂuenza viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29, 2019 to December 7,2019.VirusVirusSubtype orSubtype orLineageLineageGenetic CharacterizationGenetic CharacterizationTotal No. ofTotal No. ofSubtype/LineageSubtype/LineageTestedTested                CladeCladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)                SubcladeSubcladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)A/H1A/H1816B.1A81 (100%)A/H3A/H31323C.2a132 (100%)2a1132 (100%)    2a20      2a302a403C.3a03a0B/VictoriaB/Victoria142V1A142 (100%)V1A0V1A.122 (15.5%)V1A.3120 (84.5%)B/YamagataB/Yamagata14Y314 (100%)CDC antigenically characterizesantigenically characterizes a subset of inﬂuenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or neutralizationbased Focus Reduction assays (FRA).

This percentage is above the national baseline of 2.4%. Thedecrease in the percentage of patient visits for ILI during week 49 compared to week 48 may be inﬂuenced in part by areduction in routine healthcare visits surrounding the Thanksgiving holiday (occurring during week 48) as has occurredduring previous seasons.

The overall hospitalization rate was 3.9 per 100,000 population. The highest rateof hospitalization was among adults aged ≥65 (9.4 per 100,000 population), followed by children aged 0-4 (7.5 per100,000 population) and adults aged 50-64 (4.1 per 100,000 population). Among 1,139 hospitalizations, 627 (55.0%) wereassociated with inﬂuenza A virus, 499 (43.8%) with inﬂuenza B virus, 6 (0.5%) with inﬂuenza A virus and inﬂuenza B virusco-infection, and 7 (0.6%) with inﬂuenza virus for which the type was not determined.
