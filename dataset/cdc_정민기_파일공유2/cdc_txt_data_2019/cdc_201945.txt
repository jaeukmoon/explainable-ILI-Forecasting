Inﬂuenza (Flu)Weekly U.S. Inﬂuenza Surveillance Report
Key Updates for Week 45, ending November 9, 2019According to this week’s FluView report, seasonal inﬂuenza activity in the United States is increasing.According to this week’s FluView report, seasonal inﬂuenza activity in the United States is increasing.Viruses
Clinical LabDue to technical issues, datafrom clinical laboratories are notavailable this week.
Public Health LabNationally, B/Victoria viruses arepredominant; however, A(H3N2)and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses arealso circulating widely. Thepredominant virus varies byregion and age.
Virus CharacterizationData for this season will bereported when a suﬃcientnumber of viruses have beencharacterized. Viruscharacterization data throughSeptember 28 is available.Illness
Outpatient Illness: ILINet2.3% of visits to a health care provider were for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI). Nationally, ILI was below the baseline(2.4%); however, 4 of 10 regions were at or above their baselines.Outpatient Illness: ILI Activity Map
The majority of jurisdictions experienced minimal ILIactivity; however, Louisiana experienced high ILIactivity and 14 jurisdictions experienced moderate orlow ILI activity.
Geographic Spread
The majority of jurisdictions reported sporadic or localactivity. Ten states reported regional or widespreadactivity, and one state reported no activity.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsData for this season will beprovided when a suﬃcientnumber of hospitalizations havebeen reported.
P&I Mortality4.9% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia and inﬂuenza(P&I). This is below the epidemicthreshold of 6.0%.
Pediatric DeathsOne new inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric death occurring duringthe 2019-2020 season wasreported to CDC this week. Thetotal for the season is 3.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. An overview of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent, is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm. Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView InteractiveU.S. Virologic SurveillanceClinical LaboratoriesDue to technical issues with the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) reporting platform,the clinical laboratory data are not available for week 45. An update to previous weeks is included in the table below andis available on FluView Interactive. Reporting of this data will resume once the technical issues have been resolved.

The predominant virus varies byregion. Regional and state level data about circulating inﬂuenza viruses can be found on FluView Interactive. Thepredominant virus also varies by age group. Nationally, inﬂuenza B/Victoria viruses are the most commonly reportedinﬂuenza viruses among children age 0-4 years (45% of reported viruses) and 5-24 years (53% of reported viruses), whileA(H3N2) viruses are the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among persons 65 years of age and older (72% ofreported viruses). Among adults aged 25-64 years, approximately equal proportions of inﬂuenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2)and B/Victoria viruses (31%, 30% and 26%, respectively) have been reported. Additional age data can be found on FluViewInteractive.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatinginﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionarychanges that continually occur in inﬂuenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of inﬂuenza virusesto antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PAendonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated starting later this season when suﬃcient numbers of specimens have beentested.Outpatient Illness SurveillanceILINetNationwide during week 45, 2.3% of patient visits reported through the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-like Illness SurveillanceNetwork (ILINet) were due to inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI). This percentage is below the national baseline of 2.4%.
View Chart Data | View Full ScreenOn a regional level, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 1.2% to 4.2% during week 45. Region 4(Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee), Region 6 (Arkansas,Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas), Region 7 (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska), and Region 9 (Arizona,California, Hawaii, and Nevada) reported a percentage of outpatient visits for ILI which is equal to or above their region-speciﬁc baselines. Regions 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 10 remained below their region-speciﬁc baselines.ILI Activity MapData collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity* by state.During week 45, the following ILI activity levels were experienced:High – one state (Louisiana)Moderate – Puerto Rico and ﬁve states (Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas)Low – nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee andVirginia)Minimal – the District of Columbia, New York City, and 35 states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida,Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon,Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming)Data were Insuﬃcient to calculate an ILI activity level from the U.S. Virgin Islands.A Weekly Inﬂuenza Surveillance Report Prepared by the Inﬂuenza DivisionInﬂuenza-Like Illness (ILI) Activity Level Indicator Determined by Data Reported to ILINetprev Play Pause next404142434445weeks2019-20 Inﬂuenza Season Week 45 ending Nov 09, 2019
