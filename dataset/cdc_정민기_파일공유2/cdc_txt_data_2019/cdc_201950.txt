HospitalizationsThe overall hospitalization ratefor the season increased to 5.5per 100,000. This is similar towhat has been seen at this timeduring recent seasons.
P&I MortalityThe percentage of deathsattributed to pneumonia andinﬂuenza increased to 5.5% butremains below the epidemicthreshold.
Pediatric DeathsNine new inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric deaths occurring duringthe 2019-2020 season werereported to CDC this week. Thetotal for the season is 19.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive.U.S. Virologic SurveillanceClinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

A(H1N1)viruses are the next most common and are increasing in proportion relative to other inﬂuenza viruses in someregions.CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 3.7 million ﬂu illnesses, 32,000 hospitalizations and1,800 deaths from ﬂu.It’s not too late to get vaccinated. Flu vaccination is always the best way to prevent ﬂu and its potentially seriouscomplications.Antiviral medications are an important adjunct to ﬂu vaccine in the control of inﬂuenza. Almost all (>99%) of theinﬂuenza viruses tested this season are susceptible to the four FDA-approved inﬂuenza antiviral medicationsrecommended for use in the U.S. this season.

The predominant virus varies by region. Regional and state level data about circulatinginﬂuenza viruses can be found on FluView Interactive. The predominant virus also varies by age group. Nationally,inﬂuenza B/Victoria viruses are the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among children age 0-4 years (49% ofreported viruses) and 5-24 years (59% of reported viruses), while A(H3N2) viruses are the most commonly reportedinﬂuenza viruses among persons 65 years of age and older (42% of reported viruses). Among adults aged 25-64 years,approximately equal proportions of inﬂuenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria viruses (39% and 35%, respectively) havebeen reported. Additional age data can be found on FluView Interactive.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatinginﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionarychanges that continually occur in circulating inﬂuenza. CDC also tests susceptibility of inﬂuenza viruses to antiviralmedications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonucleaseinhibitor baloxavir.CDC genetically characterizedgenetically characterized 501 inﬂuenza viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29, 2019 to December 14,2019.VirusVirusSubtype orSubtype orLineageLineageGenetic CharacterizationGenetic CharacterizationTotal No. ofTotal No. ofSubtype/LineageSubtype/LineageTestedTested                CladeCladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)                SubcladeSubcladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)A/H1A/H11236B.1A123 (100%)A/H3A/H31623C.2a162 (100%)2a1162 (100%)    2a20      2a302a403C.3a03a0B/VictoriaB/Victoria197V1A197 (100%)V1A0V1A.123 (11.7%)V1A.3174 (88.3%)B/YamagataB/Yamagata19Y319 (100%)CDC antigenically characterizesantigenically characterizes a subset of inﬂuenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or neutralizationbased Focus Reduction assays (FRA).
