Key Updates for Week 53, ending January 2, 2021Seasonal influenza activity in the United States remains lower than usual for this time of year. Viruses Clinical LabsThe percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza at clinical laboratories is 0.1% this week. Public Health LabsThe number of influenza positives reported by public health labs remains much lower than normal despite a higher than normal number of tests performed. Virus CharacterizationInfluenza virus characterization information will be updated weekly starting later this season. Illness Outpatient Illness: ILINetThe percentage of visits to a health care provider for influenza-like illness (ILI) in week 53 is at 1.6% for the second week in a row. This is below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILI surveillance may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution. Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map This week, six jurisdictions experienced low activity, and the remaining jurisdictions experienced minimal activity. ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution. Geographic SpreadBecause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this system will suspend data collection for the 2020-21 influenza season. Severe Disease HospitalizationsHospitalization rates will be presented once case counts increase to a level that produces stable rates. In the interim, case counts will be reported each week. NCHS Mortality14.5% of deaths were attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC). This is above the epidemic threshold of 6.9%. Currently the majority of PIC deaths are due to COVID-19. Pediatric DeathsNo new influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported to CDC this week. The total for the 2020-21 season is one. All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. A description of the CDC influenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each data component is available on the surveillance methods page. Additional information on the current and previous influenza seasons for each surveillance component are available on FluView Interactive. Key Points Flu activity is unusually low at this time but may increase in the coming months. An annual flu vaccine is the best way to protect against flu and its potentially serious complications. If you haven’t gotten your flu vaccine yet, get vaccinated now. There are also flu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat flu illness. U.S. Virologic Surveillance: Clinical Laboratories The results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below. Data from clinical laboratories (the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for influenza) are used to monitor whether influenza activity is increasing or decreasing. results of tests from Clinical Laboratories Week 53 Data Cumulative since September 27, 2020 (Week 40) No. of specimens tested 21,013 397,934 No. of positive specimens (%) 28 (0.1%) 925 (0.2%) Positive specimens by type Influenza A 12 (42.9%) 362 (39.1%) Influenza B 16 (57.1%) 563 (60.9%) View Chart Data | View Full Screen Public Health Laboratories The results of tests performed by public health laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

For the season, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are the predominant virus nationally. Regional and state level data about circulating influenza viruses can be found on FluView Interactive. The predominant virus also varies by age group. Nationally, for the season overall, influenza B viruses are the most commonly reported influenza viruses among persons 5-24 years, while influenza A viruses are the most commonly reported influenza viruses among persons 0-4 years and 25 years and older. In the most recent three weeks, influenza A viruses are the most commonly reported influenza viruses in all age groups. View Chart Data | View Full Screen Additional virologic surveillance information for current and past seasons: Surveillance Methods | FluView Interactive: National, Regional, and State Data or Age Data Influenza Virus Characterization CDC performs genetic and antigenic characterization of U.S. viruses submitted from state and local health laboratories using Right Size Roadmap submission guidance. These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating influenza viruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current influenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur in influenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of influenza viruses to antiviral medications, including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir. Virus characterization data will be updated weekly starting later this season when a sufficient number of specimens have been tested. CDC genetically characterized 2,463 influenza viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29, 2019, to April 4, 2020. Influenza Virus Characterization from viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29, 2019 Virus Subtype or Lineage Genetic Characterization Total No. of Subtype/Lineage Tested Clade Number (% of subtype/lineage tested) Subclade Number (% of subtype/lineage tested) A/H1 896 6B.1A 896 (100%) A/H3 510 3C.2a 480 (94.1%) 2a1 480 (94.1%) 2a2 0 2a3 0 2a4 0 3C.3a 31 (5.9%) 3a 31 (5.9%) B/Victoria 965 V1A 965 (100%) V1A 0 V1A.1 60 (6.2%) V1A.3 905 (93.8%) B/Yamagata 92 Y3 92 (100%) CDC antigenically characterizes a subset of influenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or neutralization based Focus Reduction assays (FRA). Antigenic drift is evaluated by comparing antigenic properties of cell-propagated reference viruses representing currently recommended vaccine components with those of cell-propagated circulating viruses. CDC antigenically characterized 547 influenza viruses collected in the United States from September 29, 2019, to April 4, 2020. These data are not used to make calculations about vaccine effectiveness (VE). CDC conducts VE studies each year to measure the benefits of flu vaccines in people. Influenza A Viruses A (H1N1)pdm09: 212 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized by HI with ferret antisera, and 175 (82.5%) were antigenically similar (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) to cell-propagated A/Brisbane/02/2018-like reference viruses representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the 2019-20 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. The decrease in the percent of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses similar to A/Brisbane/02/2018 is due to some of the recent viruses selected for testing having a single amino acid change that is antigenically distinguishable in antigenic assays using ferret sera. Similar viruses were observed last season as well and these represented a small proportion of virus circulating. We have observed an increase in the proportion of H1N1pdm09 viruses with this change late in the US season. A (H3N2): 86 A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by FRA with ferret antisera, and 40 (46.5%) were antigenically similar to cell-propagated A/Kansas/14/2017-like reference viruses representing the A(H3N2) component for the 2019-20 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. Influenza B Viruses B/Victoria: 201 B/Victoria lineage viruses, including viruses from both co-circulating sub-clades, were antigenically characterized by HI with ferret antisera, and 120 (59.7%) were antigenically similar to cell-propagated B/Colorado/06/2017-like reference viruses representing the B/Victoria component for the 2019-20 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. B/Yamagata: 48 B/Yamagata lineage viruses were antigenically characterized by HI with ferret antisera, and all 48 (100%) were antigenically similar to cell-propagated B/Phuket/3073/2013-like reference viruses representing the B/Yamagata component for the 2019-20 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. CDC also assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to the antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using next generation sequence analysis supplemented by laboratory assays. Viruses collected in the United States since September 29, 2019, were tested for antiviral susceptibility as follows: susceptibility of influenza viruses to the antiviral medications Antiviral Medication Total Viruses* A/H1 A/H3 B/Victoria B/Yamagata Neuraminidase Inhibitors Oseltamivir Viruses Tested 2,433 885 502 954 92 Reduced Inhibition 1 (0.04%) (0.0%) (0.0%) 1 (0.1%) (0.0%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 4 (0.2%) 4 (0.5%) (0.0%) (0.0%) (0.0%) Peramivir Viruses Tested 2,433 885 502 954 92 Reduced Inhibition (0.0%) (0.0%) (0.0%) (0.0%) (0.0%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 5 (0.2%) 4 (0.5%) (0.0%) 1 (0.1%) (0.0%) Zanamivir Viruses Tested 2,433 885 502 954 92 Reduced Inhibition 2 (0.1%) (0.0%) (0.0%) 2 (0.2%) (0.0%) Highly Reduced Inhibition (0.0%) (0.0%) (0.0%) (0.0%) (0.0%) PA Endonuclease Inhibitor Baloxavir Viruses Tested 2,541 884 584 978 95 Reduced Susceptibility (0.0%) (0.0%) (0.0%) (0.0%) (0.0%) * Six influenza viruses showed reduced or highly reduced inhibition by at least one neuraminidase inhibitor. Four A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses showed highly reduced inhibition to oseltamivir and peramivir while showing normal inhibition to zanamivir. In addition, one B/Victoria virus showed highly reduced inhibition to peramivir and reduced inhibition to oseltamivir and zanamivir, while another influenza B/Victoria virus showed reduced inhibition to zanamivir. A total of 556 additional viruses (211 A(H1N1)pdm09, 32 A(H3N2), and 313 B) collected in Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia and Wisconsin were analyzed for resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors by pyrosequencing assay. Three (1.4%) of the 211 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested had the H275Y amino acid substitution in the neuraminidase and showed highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir. No molecular markers associated with reduced or highly reduced inhibition by neuraminidase inhibitors were detected in A(H3N2) and type B viruses tested. Novel Influenza A Virus One human infection with a novel influenza A virus was reported by Hawaii. This person was infected with an influenza A(H3N2) variant (A(H3N2)v) virus. The patient is a child < 18 years of age, was not hospitalized, and has recovered from their illness. While no exposure to swine has been reported to date, an investigation is ongoing into the source of the patient’s infection. This is the first influenza A(H3N2)v virus infection detected in the United States since 2018. Influenza viruses that circulate in swine are called swine influenza viruses when isolated from swine, but are called variant viruses when isolated from humans. Seasonal influenza viruses that circulate worldwide in the human population have important antigenic and genetic differences from influenza viruses that circulate in swine. Early identification and investigation of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are critical so that the risk of infection can be more fully understood and appropriate public health measures can be taken. Additional information on influenza in swine, variant influenza infection in humans, and strategies to interact safely with swine can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/index.htm. Additional information regarding human infections with novel influenza A viruses can be found at http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/Novel_Influenza.html. Outpatient Illness Surveillance Please note, the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI), not laboratory-confirmed influenza, and as such, will capture visits due to other respiratory pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, that present with similar symptoms. In addition, healthcare-seeking behaviors have changed dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are accessing the healthcare system in alternative settings which may or may not be captured as a part of ILINet. Therefore, ILI data, including ILI activity levels, should be interpreted with extreme caution. It is particularly important at this time to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of both influenza and COVID-19 activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVIDView. ILINet Nationwide during week 53, 1.6% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. This percentage is below the national baseline of 2.6%. View Chart Data (current season only) | View Full Screen During week 53, compared with week 52, the percentage of visits for ILI increased in two regions (Regions 4 and 6) and remained stable (change of ≤ 0.1%) in the remaining regions. All 10 regions reported a percentage of outpatient visits for ILI below their region-specific baselines. ILI Activity Map Data collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity* by state/jurisdiction and Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA). ILI Activity by State/Jurisdiction and Core Based Statistical Area Activity Level Number of Jurisdictions Number of CBSAs Week 53 (Week ending Jan. 2, 2021) Week 52 (Week ending Dec. 26, 2020) Week 53 (Week ending Jan. 2, 2021) Week 52 (Week ending Dec. 26, 2020) Very High 0 0 0 0 High 0 0 4 3 Moderate 0 0 14 11 Low 6 2 52 49 Minimal 48 51 531 561 Insufficient Data 1 2 328 305 *Data collected in ILINet may disproportionally represent certain populations within a jurisdiction or CBSA, and therefore, may not accurately depict the full picture of influenza activity for the entire jurisdiction or CBSA. Differences in the data presented here by CDC and independently by some health departments likely represent differing levels of data completeness with data presented by the health department likely being the more complete. Additional information about medically attended visits for ILI for current and past seasons: Surveillance Methods | FluView Interactive: National, Regional, and State Data or ILI Activity Map Geographic Spread of Influenza as Assessed by State and Territorial Epidemiologists The geographic spread of influenza as reported by state and territorial epidemiologists indicates geographic spread of influenza viruses but does not measure the severity of influenza activity. Due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILI surveillance, and the fact that the state and territorial epidemiologists report relies heavily on ILI activity, reporting for this system will be suspended for the 2020-21 influenza season. Data from previous seasons is available on FluView Interactive. Additional geographic spread surveillance information for current and past seasons: Surveillance Methods | FluView Interactive Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations: The Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in select counties in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) states and Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP) states. A total of 118 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations occurring between October 1, 2020, and January 2, 2021, were reported by FluSurv-NET sites. This number is lower than average for this point in the season and comparable to counts seen at this point during the 2011-12 season. Hospitalization rates will be presented once case counts increase to a level that produces stable rates. In the interim, case counts will be reported each week. View Full Screen The highest rate of hospitalization is among adults aged ≥ 65, followed by children aged 0-4 years and adults aged 50-64 years. Hospitalization rates by age group Age Group 2019-2020 Season Cumulative Rate per 100,000 Population Overall 68.2 0-4 years 94.1 5-17 years 24.6 18-49 years 35.6 50-64 years 90.2 65+ years 179.7 Among 3,433 hospitalized adults with information on underlying medical conditions, 92.3% had at least one reported underlying medical condition, the most commonly reported were cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder, obesity, and chronic lung disease. Among 569 hospitalized children with information on underlying medical conditions, 48.5% had at least one underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported was asthma. Among 600 hospitalized women of childbearing age (15-44 years) with information on pregnancy status, 27.2% were pregnant. View Full Screen Additional hospitalization surveillance information for current and past seasons and additional age groups: Surveillance Methods | FluView Interactive: Rates by Age or Patient Characteristics National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Surveillance Based on NCHS mortality surveillance data available on January 7, 2021, 14.5% of the deaths occurring during the week ending January 2, 2021 (week 53), were due to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC). This percentage is above the epidemic threshold of 6.9% for week 53. Among the 2,150 PIC deaths reported for week 53, 1,496 had COVID-19 listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death on the death certificate and two listed influenza, indicating that the current increase in PIC mortality is due primarily to COVID-19 and not influenza. Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually coded causes of death collected from death certificates. Percentages of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) are higher among manually coded records than more rapidly available machine coded records. Because of additional time needed for manual coding, the initially reported PIC percentages are likely to increase as more data are received and processed. Additionally, due to the large number of deaths reported in recent weeks and the holidays, the delay in availability of manually coded records may be longer than usual; therefore, data from recent weeks should be interpreted with caution. View Chart Data | View Full Screen While the percent of all deaths due to P&I has increased during weeks 9-13 (7.4-10.0%), the percent of all deaths with Influenza listed as a cause have decreased (from 1.0% to 0.7%) over this same time period. The increase in pneumonia deaths during this time period are likely associated with COVID-19 rather than influenza.
