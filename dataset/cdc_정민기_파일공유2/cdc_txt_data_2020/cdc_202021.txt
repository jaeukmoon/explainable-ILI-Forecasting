This percentage is belowthe national baseline of 2.4%. All regions remain below region speciﬁc baseline levels.Note: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, new data sources will be incorporated into ILINet as wemove into summer weeks when lower levels of inﬂuenza and other respiratory virus circulation aretypical. Starting in week 21, increases in the number of patient visits will be seen as new sites areenrolled and the percentage of visits for ILI may change in comparison to previous weeks. Duringweek 21, new sites were added in Regions 1, 4, and 6. While these regions remain below baselinelevels for ILI, these system changes should be kept in mind when drawing conclusions from thesedata. Any changes in ILI due to changes in respiratory virus circulation will be highlighted here.

Percentages of deaths due to pneumonia andinﬂuenza (P&I) are higher among manually coded records than more rapidly available machine codedrecords. Due to the additional time needed for manual coding, the initially reported P&I percentagesmay increase as more data are received and processed.

Two were associated with A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and occurred during week 6(the week ending February 8, 2020) and week 11 (the week ending March 14, 2020). One wasassociated with an inﬂuenza B virus with no lineage determined and occurred during week 17 (theweek ending April 25, 2020).A total of 179 inﬂuenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2019-2020 season have beenreported to CDC.
