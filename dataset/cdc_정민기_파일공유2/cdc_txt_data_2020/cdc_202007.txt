Pediatric Deaths13 inﬂuenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2019-2020 season were reported this week. The totalfor the season is 105.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive.
U.S. Virologic SurveillanceClinical LaboratoriesOutpatient ILI and clinical laboratory data remain elevated but decreased slightly this week. The overall decreasein the percentage of specimens testing positive for inﬂuenza was due to a decrease in the percentage ofspecimens testing positive for inﬂuenza B.  The percentage of specimens testing positive for inﬂuenza Acontinued to increase.Overall, hospitalization rates remain similar to this time during recent seasons, but rates among children andyoung adults are higher at this time than in recent seasons.Pneumonia and inﬂuenza mortality has been low, but 105 inﬂuenza-associated deaths in children have beenreported so far this season.CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 29 million ﬂu illnesses, 280,000 hospitalizationsand 16,000 deaths from ﬂu.Interim estimates of 2019-2020 ﬂu vaccine eﬀectiveness were released this week. So far this season, ﬂu vaccinesare reducing doctor’s visits for ﬂu illness by 45% overall and 55% in children.Antiviral medications are an important adjunct to ﬂu vaccine in the control of inﬂuenza. Almost all (>99%) of theinﬂuenza viruses tested this season are susceptible to the four FDA-approved inﬂuenza antiviral medicationsrecommended for use in the U.S. this season.The results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below. Data from clinical laboratories(the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for inﬂuenza) are used to monitor whether inﬂuenza activity isincreasing or decreasing.Week 7Week 7Data Cumulative since Data Cumulative since September 29, 2019September 29, 2019(week 40)(week 40)No. of specimens testedNo. of specimens tested49,510888,399No. of positive specimens (%)No. of positive specimens (%)14,657 (29.6%)174,037 (19.6%)Positive specimens by typePositive specimens by type      Inﬂuenza A    Inﬂuenza A9,305 (63.5%)79,269 (45.5%)    Inﬂuenza B    Inﬂuenza B5,352 (36.5%)94,768 (54.5%)

For the season, the number of B/Victoria andA(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are approximately equal. The predominant virus varies by region. Regional and state level dataabout circulating inﬂuenza viruses can be found on FluView Interactive.The predominant virus also varies by age group. Nationally, for the season overall, inﬂuenza B viruses are the mostcommonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among children and young adults age 0-4 years (53% of reported viruses) and 5-24years (68% of reported viruses), while A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses amongpersons 25-64 years (57% of reported viruses) and 65 years of age and older (64% of reported viruses). For this season,51% of inﬂuenza positive specimens reported by public health laboratories were among persons less than 25 years of ageand less than 13% were from persons age 65 and older.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatinginﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionarychanges that continually occur in circulating inﬂuenza viruses. Antigenic characterization data are based on an animalmodel (inﬂuenza-naive ferrets), and do not reﬂect pre-existing protection provided by past inﬂuenza infections andvaccinations. Additional antigenic characterization studies involving people vaccinated with current inﬂuenza vaccines areconducted later in the season; these data account for pre-existing protection in diﬀerent populations against circulatinginﬂuenza viruses. Genetic and antigenic characterization data are not used to make calculations about vaccineeﬀectiveness (VE). CDC conducts VE studies each year to measure the beneﬁts of ﬂu vaccines in people. Interim estimatesof 2019-2020 ﬂu vaccine eﬀectiveness were released this week.CDC genetically characterizedgenetically characterized 1,667 inﬂuenza viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29, 2019, to February 15,2020.VirusVirusSubtype orSubtype orLineageLineageGenetic CharacterizationGenetic CharacterizationTotal No. ofTotal No. ofSubtype/LineageSubtype/LineageTestedTested                CladeCladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)                SubcladeSubcladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)A/H1A/H15636B.1A563 (100%)A/H3A/H33813C.2a365 (95.8%)2a1365 (95.8%)    2a20      2a302a403C.3a16 (4.2%)3a16 (4.2%)B/VictoriaB/Victoria655V1A655 (100%)V1A0V1A.150 (7.6%)V1A.3605 (92.4%)B/YamagataB/Yamagata68Y368 (100%)CDC antigenically characterizesantigenically characterizes a subset of inﬂuenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or neutralizationbased Focus Reduction assays (FRA).
