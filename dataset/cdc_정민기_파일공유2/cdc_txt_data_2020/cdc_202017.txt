Inﬂuenza (Flu)Weekly U.S. Inﬂuenza Surveillance Report
NoteNote: The COVID-19 pandemic is aﬀecting healthcare seeking behavior. The number of persons and their reasonsfor seeking care in the outpatient and ED settings is changing. These changes impact data from ILINet in ways thatare diﬃcult to diﬀerentiate from changes in illness levels, therefore ILINet data should be interpreted with caution.CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVIDView.
Key Updates for Week 17, ending April 25, 2020Laboratory conﬁrmed ﬂu activity as reported by clinical laboratories remains low. Inﬂuenza-like illnessLaboratory conﬁrmed ﬂu activity as reported by clinical laboratories remains low. Inﬂuenza-like illnessactivity continues to decrease and is below the national baseline. The percent of deaths due toactivity continues to decrease and is below the national baseline. The percent of deaths due topneumonia or inﬂuenza (P&I) is high but the increase is due primarily to COVID-19, not inﬂuenza.pneumonia or inﬂuenza (P&I) is high but the increase is due primarily to COVID-19, not inﬂuenza.Reported pediatric ﬂu deaths for the season are high at 170.Reported pediatric ﬂu deaths for the season are high at 170.Viruses
Clinical LabsThe percentage of respiratoryspecimens testing positive forinﬂuenza at clinical laboratoriesis 0.2%. This is down from 0.4%the previous week.
Public Health LabsNationally, inﬂuenzaA(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are nowthe most commonly reportedinﬂuenza viruses this season.
Virus CharacterizationReporting of genetic andantigenic characterization andantiviral susceptibility ofinﬂuenza viruses has beenstopped and will resume with the2020-2021 season.Illness
Outpatient Illness: ILINetVisits to health care providers for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI) decreased from 2.2% last week to 1.8% this week.Nationally, ILI is below baseline, but 4 of 10 regions are above their baselines.
Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map
Three jurisdictions experienced high ILI activity thisweek compared to 8 jurisdictions that experiencedhigh or very high last week.
Geographic Spread
The number of jurisdictions reporting regionalinﬂuenza activity decreased from 10 last week to 5this week. No jurisdictions reported widespreadinﬂuenza activity.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsThe overall cumulativehospitalization rate for theseason increased to 69.0 per100,000.
P&I MortalityThe percentage of deathsattributed to pneumonia andinﬂuenza is 9.3%, down from13.6% last week, but above theepidemic threshold of 6.8%.
Pediatric DeathsOne inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric death occurring duringthe 2019-2020 season wasreported this week. The total forthe season is 170.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive.U.S. Virologic SurveillanceClinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below. Data from clinical laboratories(the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for inﬂuenza) are used to monitor whether inﬂuenza activity isincreasing or decreasing.

This percentage is below the national baseline of 2.4%.View Chart Data (current season only) | View Full ScreenOn a regional level, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 0.9% to 3.7% during week 17. Compared to lastweek, the percent of outpatient visits for ILI increased in region 5, but decreased in all other regions. Regions 1, 2, 3, and10 reported a percentage of outpatient visits for ILI above their region-speciﬁc baselines. All other regions are below theirregion-speciﬁc baselines.ILI Activity MapData collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity* by state.During week 17, the following ILI activity levels were experienced:High – the District of Columbia and two states (Maryland and New Jersey)Moderate – New York City, Puerto Rico, and six states (Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, andWisconsin)Low - two states (New York and Virginia)Minimal - 40 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii,Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska,Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming)Data were insuﬃcient to calculate an ILI activity level from the U.S. Virgin Islands.A Weekly Inﬂuenza Surveillance Report Prepared by the Inﬂuenza DivisionInﬂuenza-Like Illness (ILI) Activity Level Indicator Determined by Data Reported to ILINetprev Play Pause next40
