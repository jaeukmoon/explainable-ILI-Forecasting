Virus CharacterizationInﬂuenza virus characterizationinformation will be updatedweekly starting later this season.(/ﬂu/weekly/#ivc)Illness
Outpatient Illness: ILINet1.5% of visits to a health care provider were for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI), which was a slight increase from theprevious week (1.3%). ILI activity remains below the national baseline of 2.6%; however, one of ten surveillanceregions is above their region-speciﬁc baseline.Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map
This week, one jurisdiction experienced very high ILI activity, four experienced low activity, and the remainingjurisdictions experienced minimal activity.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsHospitalization rates will beupdated weekly starting later thisseason.
P&I Mortality8.9% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia, inﬂuenza, orCOVID-19 (PIC). This is above theepidemic threshold of 6.1%.
Pediatric DeathsNo inﬂuenza-associated pediatricdeaths occurring during the2020-21 season have beenreported.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods (http://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm) page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/ﬂuviewinteractive.htm).Key PointsKey PointsAn annual ﬂu vaccine is the best way to protect against ﬂu and its potentially serious complications.If you haven’t gotten your ﬂu vaccine yet, get vaccinated now (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/season/protect-your-health.html).There are also ﬂu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat ﬂu illness.U.S. Virologic Surveillance:U.S. Virologic Surveillance:(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281228772)Clinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating inﬂuenzaviruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitorevolutionary changes that continually occur in inﬂuenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility ofinﬂuenza viruses to antiviral medications, including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir)and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated weekly starting later this season when a suﬃcient number of specimens havebeen tested.Outpatient Illness Surveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932)ILINetNationwide during week 45, 1.5% of patient visits reported through the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-like Illness SurveillanceNetwork (ILINet) were due to inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI). This percentage is below the national baseline of 2.6%.Healthcare seeking behaviors have changed dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. While outpatient ILI activityremains low, many people are accessing the healthcare system in alternative settings. Therefore, while traditionalhealthcare providers are not seeing increased numbers of cases of ILI, it is important to evaluate other sources ofsurveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of both COVID-19 and inﬂuenza activity. CDC is tracking theCOVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVIDView (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview.html).(http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/ﬂuportaldashboard.html)View Chart Data (current season only) (/ﬂu/weekly/weeklyarchives2020-2021/data/senAllregt45.html) | View Full Screen (/ﬂu/weekly/weeklyarchives2020-2021/ILI45.html)One region, Region 7 (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska), reported a percentage of outpatient visits for ILI (2.4%)above their region-speciﬁc baseline (1.7%). The remaining nine regions reported a percentage of outpatient visits for ILIbelow their region-speciﬁc baselines.ILI Activity MapData collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity*(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1571167821424) by state/jurisdiction and Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA).

Due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILIsurveillance, and the fact that the state and territorial epidemiologists report relies heavily on ILI activity, reporting forthis system will be suspended for the 2020-21 inﬂuenza season.

This percentage isabove the epidemic threshold of 6.1% for week 45.Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually coded causes of deathcollected from death certiﬁcates. Percentages of deaths due to pneumonia, inﬂuenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) are higheramong manually coded records than more rapidly available machine coded records. Due to the additional time neededfor manual coding, the initially reported PIC percentages are likely to increase as more data are received and processed.
