Note:Note: The COVID-19 pandemic is aﬀecting healthcare seeking behavior. The number of personsand their reasons for seeking care in the outpatient and ED settings is changing. These changesimpact data from ILINet in ways that are diﬃcult to diﬀerentiate from changes in illness levels,therefore ILINet data should be interpreted with caution.

For the season, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are the predominant virus nationally.Regional and state level data about circulating inﬂuenza viruses can be found on FluView Interactive.The predominant virus also varies by age group. Nationally, for the season overall, inﬂuenza B virusesare the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among persons 5-24 years, while inﬂuenza Aviruses are the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among persons 0-4 years and 25 yearsand older. In the most recent three weeks, inﬂuenza A viruses are the most commonly reportedinﬂuenza viruses in all age groups.

These data are used to comparehow similar the currently circulating inﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used fordeveloping new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur incirculating inﬂuenza viruses. Antigenic characterization data are based on an animal model(inﬂuenza-naive ferrets), and do not reﬂect pre-existing protection provided by past inﬂuenzainfections and vaccinations. Additional antigenic characterization studies involving people vaccinatedwith current inﬂuenza vaccines are conducted later in the season; these data account for pre-existingprotection in diﬀerent populations against circulating inﬂuenza viruses. Genetic and antigeniccharacterization data are not used to make calculations about vaccine eﬀectiveness (VE). CDCconducts VE studies each year to measure the beneﬁts of ﬂu vaccines in people. Interim estimates of2019-2020 ﬂu vaccine eﬀectiveness have been released.CDC genetically characterizedgenetically characterized 2,350 inﬂuenza viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29,2019, to March 28, 2020.VirusVirusSubtype orSubtype orLineageLineageGenetic CharacterizationGenetic CharacterizationTotal No. ofTotal No. ofSubtype/LineageSubtype/LineageTestedTested                CladeCladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)                SubcladeSubcladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)A/H1A/H18526B.1A852 (100%)A/H3A/H34983C.2a468 (94.0%)2a1468 (94.0%)    2a20      2a302a403C.3a30 (6.0%)3a30 (6.0%)B/VictoriaB/Victoria910V1A910 (100%)V1A0V1A.160 (6.6%)V1A.3850 (93.4%)B/YamagataB/Yamagata90Y390 (100%)CDC antigenically characterizesantigenically characterizes a subset of inﬂuenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) orneutralization based Focus Reduction assays (FRA).

The decrease in the percent of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses similar to A/Brisbane/02/2018 isdue to some of the recent viruses selected for testing having a single amino acid change that isantigenically distinguishable in antigenic assays using ferret sera. Similar viruses were observedlast season as well and these represented a small proportion of virus circulating. We haveobserved an increase in the proportion of H1N1pdm09 viruses with this change late in the USseason.A (H3N2):A (H3N2): 86 A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by FRA with ferret antisera, and40 (46.5%) were antigenically similar to cell-propagated A/Kansas/14/2017-like reference virusesrepresenting the A(H3N2) component for the 2019-20 Northern Hemisphere inﬂuenza vaccines.Inﬂuenza B VirusesInﬂuenza B VirusesB/Victoria:B/Victoria: 180 B/Victoria lineage viruses, including viruses from both co-circulating sub-clades,were antigenically characterized by HI with ferret antisera, and 112 (62.2%) were antigenicallysimilar to cell-propagated B/Colorado/06/2017-like reference viruses representing the B/Victoriacomponent for the 2019-20 Northern Hemisphere inﬂuenza vaccines.B/Yamagata:B/Yamagata: 48 B/Yamagata lineage viruses were antigenically characterized by HI with ferretantisera, and all 48 (100%) were antigenically similar to cell-propagated B/Phuket/3073/2013-likereference viruses representing the B/Yamagata component for the 2019-20 NorthernHemisphere inﬂuenza vaccines.CDC also assesses susceptibility of inﬂuenza viruses to the antiviral medicationssusceptibility of inﬂuenza viruses to the antiviral medications including theneuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitorbaloxavir using next generation sequence analysis supplemented by laboratory assays.

Four A(H1N1)pdm09viruses showed highly reduced inhibition to oseltamivir and peramivir while showing normal inhibition to zanamivir. In addition, oneB/Victoria virus showed highly reduced inhibition to peramivir and reduced inhibition to oseltamivir and zanamivir, while anotherinﬂuenza B/Victoria virus showed reduced inhibition to zanamivir.A total of 556 additional viruses (211 A(H1N1)pdm09, 32 A(H3N2), and 313 B) collected in Alabama,Alaska, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New York, North Carolina,Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia and Wisconsin were analyzed for resistance to neuraminidaseinhibitors by pyrosequencing assay. Three (1.4%) of the 211 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested had theH275Y amino acid substitution in the neuraminidase and showed highly reduced inhibition byoseltamivir and peramivir. No molecular markers associated with reduced or highly reducedinhibition by neuraminidase inhibitors were detected in A(H3N2) and type B viruses tested.Outpatient Illness SurveillanceILINetNationwide during week 13, 5.4% of patient visits reported through the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-likeIllness Surveillance Network (ILINet) were due to inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI).

Amongthose with inﬂuenza A subtype information, 3,771 (94.4%) were A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and 221 (5.5%)were A(H3N2).The overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 67.9 per 100,000 population, which is higher than allrecent seasons at this time of year except for the 2017-18 season. Rates in children 0-4 years old andadults 18-49 years old are now the highest CDC has on record for these age groups, surpassing therate reported during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Hospitalization rates for school-aged children arehigher than any recent regular season but lower than rates during the pandemic.
Key PointsKey PointsNationally, the percent of laboratory specimens testing positive for inﬂuenza at clinicallaboratories continued to decrease and is now low.ILI activity decreased nationally but remains elevated.Recent changes in healthcare seeking behavior, including increasing use of telemedicine andrecommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illness, as well asincreasing levels of social distancing, are aﬀecting the number of persons with ILI and theirreasons for seeking care in outpatient and ED settings.Laboratory conﬁrmed inﬂuenza-associated hospitalization rates for the U.S. populationoverall are higher than most recent seasons and rates for children 0-4 years and adults 18-49years are the highest CDC has on record for these age groups, surpassing rates reportedduring the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Hospitalization rates for school-aged children (5-17 years)are higher than any recent regular season but remain lower than rates experienced by thisage group during the pandemic.The percent of deaths associated with pneumonia and inﬂuenza is above the epidemicthreshold. The increase is due to an increase in pneumonia deaths rather than inﬂuenzadeaths and may be associated with COVID-19.162 inﬂuenza-associated deaths in children have been reported so far this season. Thisnumber is higher than recorded at the same time in every season since reporting began in2004-05, except for the 2009 pandemic.CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 39 million ﬂu illnesses, 400,000hospitalizations and 24,000 deaths from ﬂu.Antiviral medications are an important adjunct to ﬂu vaccine in the control of inﬂuenza.Almost all (>99%) of the inﬂuenza viruses tested this season are susceptible to the four FDA-approved inﬂuenza antiviral medications recommended for use in the U.S. this season.Seasonal Inﬂuenza (Flu)About FluWho is at High Risk for FluComplicationsFlu SeasonPrevent FluFlu Vaccines WorkSymptoms & DiagnosisTreatmentSchools, Businesses &Travelers
