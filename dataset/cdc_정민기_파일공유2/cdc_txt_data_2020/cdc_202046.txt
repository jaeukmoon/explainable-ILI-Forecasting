Clinical LabsThe percentage ofrespiratory specimenstesting positive forinﬂuenza at clinicallaboratories is 0.2% thisweek.
Public Health LabsInﬂuenza activity was lowduring the summermonths and fewspecimens have testedpositive in public healthlabs during recent weeks.
VirusCharacterizationInﬂuenza viruscharacterizationinformation will beupdated weekly startinglater this season.Illness
Outpatient Illness: ILINet1.5% of visits to a health care provider were for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI), the same as theprevious week (1.5%). ILI activity remains below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILI surveillancemay be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.
Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map
This week, two jurisdictions experienced low ILI activity while the remaining jurisdictionsexperienced minimal activity. ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic andshould be interpreted with caution.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsHospitalization rates willbe updated weeklystarting later this season.
P&I Mortality10.7% of deaths wereattributed to pneumonia,inﬂuenza, or COVID-19(PIC). This is above theepidemic threshold of6.2%. The majority of PICdeaths are due to COVID-19.
Pediatric DeathsNo inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric deaths occurringduring the 2020-21 seasonhave been reported.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detaileddescriptions of each data component is available on the surveillance methods page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillancecomponent are available on FluView Interactive.Key PointsKey PointsFlu activity is unusually low at this time but may increase in the coming months.An annual ﬂu vaccine is the best way to protect against ﬂu and its potentially seriouscomplications.If you haven’t gotten your ﬂu vaccine yet, get vaccinated now.There are also ﬂu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat ﬂu illness.U.S. Virologic Surveillance:Clinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

These data are used to comparehow similar the currently circulating inﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses representingviruses contained in the current inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionary changes thatcontinually occur in inﬂuenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of inﬂuenzaviruses to antiviral medications, including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, andperamivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated weekly starting later this season when a suﬃcient numberof specimens have been tested.Outpatient Illness SurveillancePlease note, the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitorsoutpatient visits for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI), not laboratory conﬁrmed inﬂuenza, and as such, willcapture visits due to other respiratory pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, that present with similarsymptoms. In addition, healthcare seeking behaviors have changed dramatically during the COVID-19pandemic. Many people are accessing the healthcare system in alternative settings which may or maynot be captured as a part of ILINet. Therefore, ILI data, including ILI activity levels, should beinterpreted with extreme caution. It is particularly important at this time to evaluate syndromicsurveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data toobtain a complete and accurate picture of both inﬂuenza and COVID-19 activity. CDC is tracking theCOVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVIDView.ILINetNationwide during week 46, 1.5% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. Thispercentage is below the national baseline of 2.6%.
View Chart Data (current season only) | View Full ScreenFour regions (Region 2, Region 3, Region 9, Region 10) had increases in ILI activity, three regions haddecreases in ILI activity (Region 1, Region 6, Region 7), and three regions (Region 4, Region 5, Region 8)remained stable (change of < 0.1%). All ten regions reported a percentage of outpatient visits for ILIbelow their region-speciﬁc baselines.ILI Activity MapData collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity* by state/jurisdiction and CoreBased Statistical Areas (CBSA).

This percentage is above the epidemic threshold of 6.2% for week 46. Among theof the 2,187 PIC deaths reported for week 46, 1,260 had COVID-19 listed as an underlying orcontributing cause of death on the death certiﬁcate and 2 listed inﬂuenza, indicating that the currentincrease in PIC mortality is due primarily to COVID-19 and not inﬂuenza.Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually codedcauses of death collected from death certiﬁcates. Percentages of deaths due to pneumonia, inﬂuenza,or COVID-19 (PIC) are higher among manually coded records than more rapidly available machinecoded records. Due to the additional time needed for manual coding, the initially reported PICpercentages are likely to increase as more data are received and processed.
