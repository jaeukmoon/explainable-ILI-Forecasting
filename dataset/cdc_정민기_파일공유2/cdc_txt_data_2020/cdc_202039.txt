2019-2020 Inﬂuenza Season Week 39, ending September26, 2020All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. An overview of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodologyand detailed descriptions of each data component, is available athttp://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm. Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for eachsurveillance component are available on FluView Interactive.U.S. Virologic Surveillance:Clinical LaboratoriesData from clinical laboratories (the percentage of specimens tested that are positivefor inﬂuenza) are used to monitor whether inﬂuenza activity is increasing ordecreasing.

This percentage is below the national baseline of 2.4%.Note: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, new data sources will be incorporatedinto ILINet throughout the summer weeks when lower levels of inﬂuenza and otherrespiratory virus circulation are typical. Starting in week 21, increases in the numberof patient visits will be seen as new sites are enrolled and the percentage of visits forILI may change in comparison to previous weeks. While all regions remain belowbaseline levels for ILI, these system changes should be kept in mind when drawingconclusions from these data. Any changes in ILI due to changes in respiratory viruscirculation will be highlighted here.

This percentage is below theepidemic threshold of 5.6% for week 39.Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded andmanually coded causes of death collected from death certiﬁcates. Percentages ofdeaths due to pneumonia and inﬂuenza (P&I) are higher among manually codedrecords than more rapidly available machine coded records. Due to the additionaltime needed for manual coding, the initially reported P&I percentages are likely toincrease as more data are received and processed.
