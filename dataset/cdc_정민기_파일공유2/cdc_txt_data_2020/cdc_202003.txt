Clinical LabsThe percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for inﬂuenza at clinical laboratories increased from 23.4%last week to 25.6% this week.
Public Health LabsNationally, B/Victoria viruses are the predominant viruses this season; however, during recent weeks, approximatelyequal numbers of B/Victoria and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been reported.
Virus CharacterizationGenetic and antigenic characterization and antiviral susceptibility of inﬂuenza viruses collected in the U.S. aresummarized in this report.Illness
Outpatient Illness: ILINetVisits to health care providers for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI) increased from 4.7% last week to 5.0% this week. Allregions remain above their baselines.
Outpatient Illness: ILI Activity Map
The number of jurisdictions experiencing high ILI activity increased from 34 last week to 37 this week.
Geographic Spread
The number of jurisdictions reporting regional or widespread inﬂuenza activity remained at 50 this week.Severe DiseaseHospitalizationsThe overall hospitalization rate for the season increased to 24.1 per 100,000. This is similar to what has been seen atthis time during recent seasons.
P&I MortalityThe percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and inﬂuenza decreased from 7.1% to 6.7% and is below theepidemic threshold.
Pediatric DeathsFifteen new inﬂuenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2019-2020 season were reported this week.The total for the season is 54.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive.U.S. Virologic SurveillanceClinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

Some regions are seeingincreases in the proportion of inﬂuenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses compared to inﬂuenza B viruses.Levels of outpatient ILI remain elevated; however, hospitalization rates remain similar to what has been seen atthis time during recent seasons and mortality, while low overall, has exceeded the epidemic threshold for oneweek this season.Over 50% of inﬂuenza positive test results from public health laboratories this season are in children and youngadults (<25 years), while only 12% are in adults aged 65 and older. This has resulted in high levels of outpatientillness, but lower levels of hospitalization and death due to inﬂuenza. However, inﬂuenza can still cause severedisease in children.15 additional pediatric deaths were reported this week, bringing the total for the season to 54. Inﬂuenza B virusesaccount for 37 of the 54 reported ﬂu-related pediatric deaths this season.CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 15 million ﬂu illnesses, 140,000 hospitalizationsand 8,200 deaths from ﬂu.Flu vaccine eﬀectiveness estimates are not available yet this season, but vaccination is always the best way toprevent ﬂu and its potentially serious complications.Antiviral medications are an important adjunct to ﬂu vaccine in the control of inﬂuenza. Almost all (>99%) of theinﬂuenza viruses tested this season are susceptible to the four FDA-approved inﬂuenza antiviral medicationsrecommended for use in the U.S. this season.

The predominant virus varies by region. Regional and state level data about circulatinginﬂuenza viruses can be found on FluView Interactive.The predominant virus also varies by age group. Nationally, inﬂuenza B viruses are the most commonly reportedinﬂuenza viruses among children age 0-4 years (60% of reported viruses) and 5-24 years (75% of reported viruses), whileA(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among persons 25-64 years (47% of reportedviruses) and 65 years of age and older (53% of reported viruses). For this season, 53% of inﬂuenza positive specimensreported by public health laboratories were among persons less than 25 years of age and only 12% were from personsage 65 and older.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatinginﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionarychanges that continually occur in circulating inﬂuenza. Antigenic characterization data are based on an animal model(inﬂuenza-naive ferrets), and do not reﬂect pre-existing protection provided by past inﬂuenza infections and vaccinations.Additional antigenic characterization studies involving people vaccinated with current inﬂuenza vaccines are conductedlater in the season; these data account for pre-existing protection in diﬀerent populations against circulating inﬂuenzaviruses.
