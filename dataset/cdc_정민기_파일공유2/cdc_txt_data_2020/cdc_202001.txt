Inﬂuenza (Flu)Weekly U.S. Inﬂuenza Surveillance Report
Key Updates for Week 1, ending January 4, 2020Key indicators that track ﬂu activity remain high, but indicators that track severity (hospitalizations andKey indicators that track ﬂu activity remain high, but indicators that track severity (hospitalizations anddeaths) are not high at this point in the season.deaths) are not high at this point in the season.Viruses
Clinical LabsThe percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for inﬂuenza at clinical laboratories decreased from 26.4%last week to 23.3% this week.
Public Health LabsNationally, B/Victoria viruses are most common followed by A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. The predominant virus varies byregion and age group. There is low circulation of A(H3N2) and B/Yamagata viruses.
Virus CharacterizationGenetic and antigenic characterization and antiviral susceptibility of inﬂuenza viruses collected in the U.S. this seasonis summarized in this report.Illness
Outpatient Illness: ILINetVisits to health care providers for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI) decreased from 7.0% last week to 5.8% this week. Allregions remain above their baselines.
Outpatient Illness: ILI Activity Map
The number of jurisdictions experiencing high ILI activity decreased from 37 last week to 36 this week.
Geographic Spread
The number of jurisdictions reporting regional or widespread inﬂuenza activity increased to 50 this week comparedto 48 last week.Severe DiseaseHospitalizationsThe overall hospitalization rate for the season increased to 14.6 per 100,000. This is similar to what has been seen atthis time during recent seasons.
P&I MortalityThe percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and inﬂuenza is 5.8% which is below the epidemic threshold.
Pediatric DeathsFive new inﬂuenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2019-2020 season were reported this week. Thetotal for the season is 32.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive.
U.S. Virologic SurveillanceKey PointsKey PointsLevels of outpatient ILI remain elevated; however hospitalization rates and percent of deaths due to pneumoniaand inﬂuenza remain low. This is likely due to the predominance of inﬂuenza B/Victoria and inﬂuenzaA(H1N1)pdm09 viruses which are more likely to aﬀect children and younger adults than the elderly.  Because themajority of hospitalizations and deaths occur among people age 65 and older, with fewer illnesses among thatgroup, we expect, on a population level, to see less impact in ﬂu-related hospitalizations and deaths.The decline in outpatient ILI and laboratory data this week may in part be inﬂuenced by changes in healthcareseeking behavior and inﬂuenza virus transmission that can occur during the holidays. It is too early to knowwhether the season has peaked or if ﬂu activity will increase into January.CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 9.7 million ﬂu illnesses, 87,000 hospitalizations and4,800 deaths from ﬂu.It’s not too late to get vaccinated. Flu vaccination is always the best way to prevent ﬂu and its potentially seriouscomplications.Antiviral medications are an important adjunct to ﬂu vaccine in the control of inﬂuenza. Almost all (>99%) of theinﬂuenza viruses tested this season are susceptible to the four FDA-approved inﬂuenza antiviral medicationsrecommended for use in the U.S. this season.Clinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

Nationally,inﬂuenza B/Victoria viruses are the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among children age 0-4 years (46% ofreported viruses) and 5-24 years (58% of reported viruses), while A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are the most commonlyreported inﬂuenza viruses among persons 25-64 years (45% of reported viruses) and 65 years of age and older (48% ofreported viruses).

This percentage is above the national baseline of 2.4%. Thedecrease in the percentage of patient visits for ILI may be inﬂuenced in part by changes in healthcare seeking behaviorand inﬂuenza virus transmission that can occur during the holidays.
