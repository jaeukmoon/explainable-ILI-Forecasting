Page 7 of 19https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/Novel Inﬂuenza A VirusTwo human infections with novel in!uenza A viruses were reported. One infection with an in!uenza A(H1N1) variant(A(H1N1)v) virus was reported by North Dakota that occurred during the 2020-21 in!uenza season and one infection withan in!uenza (A(H3N2)v) virus was reported by Ohio that occurred during the 2021-22 in!uenza season. Both patients are<18 years of age, were not hospitalized, and have recovered or are recovering from their illness. One of the patients hadclose contact with swine prior to illness onset. The other patient had no known swine contact or attendance atagricultural exhibits where swine were present; it is possible that limited human-to-human transmission occurred. Noongoing human-to-human transmission has been identi"ed associated with either patient.When an in!uenza virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a “variantin!uenza virus”. Most human infections with variant in!uenza viruses occur following close proximity to swine, buthuman-to-human transmission can occur. It is important to note that in most cases, variant in!uenza viruses have notshown the ability to spread easily and sustainably from person to person.During the 2021-22 in!uenza season, one human infection with novel in!uenza A virus has been reported in the UnitedStates: H3N2v (OH). During the 2020-21 in!uenza season, 11 human infections with a novel in!uenza A virus werereported in the United States, including two H3N2v (IA, WI), three H1N2v (IA, OH (2)), and six H1N1v (IA, NC, ND, WI (3))virus infections.Early identi"cation and investigation of human infections with novel in!uenza A viruses are critical so that the risk ofinfection can be more fully understood and appropriate public health measures can be taken. Additional information onin!uenza in swine, variant in!uenza virus infection in humans, and strategies to interact safely with swine can be found atwww.cdc.gov/!u/swine!u/index.htm. Additional information regarding human infections with novel in!uenza A virusescan be found at http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/!uview/Novel_In!uenza.html.

These data are used to compare how similar thecurrently circulating in!uenza viruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current in!uenzavaccines and to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur in in!uenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC alsotests susceptibility of in!uenza viruses to antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir,zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated later this season when a su#cient number of specimens have been tested.Outpatient Illness Surveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932)10/24/21, 12:54 PMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC
Page 8 of 19https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/The U.S. Outpatient In!uenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for in!uenza-like illness[(ILI) fever plus cough or sore throat], not laboratory-con"rmed in!uenza, and will capture visits due to other respiratorypathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, that present with similar symptoms. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health care-seekingbehaviors have changed and people may be accessing the health care system in alternative settings not captured as apart of ILINet or at a di$erent point in their illness than they might have before the pandemic. Therefore, it is importantto evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data toobtain a complete and accurate picture of in!uenza, COVID-19, and other respiratory virus activity. CDC is tracking theCOVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVID Data Tracker Weekly Review (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html). Information about other respiratory virus activity can be found on CDC’s NationalRespiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) website (https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/index.html).E$ective October 3, 2021, the ILI de"nition (fever plus cough or sore throat) no longer includes “without a known causeother than in!uenza.” This change was made to improve the consistency with which the de"nition is applied acrossreporting sitesILINetNationwide during week 41, 1.8% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. This percentage is below thenational baseline of 2.5%. One region (Region 7) is at their region-speci"c baseline while the remaining regions are belowtheir baselines. Overall, in!uenza virus circulation remains low; therefore, increases in ILI activity are likely due toincreased circulation of other respiratory viruses.10/24/21, 12:54 PMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC
