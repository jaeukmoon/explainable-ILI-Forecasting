Outpatient Illness: ILINetWeek 12 is the third week in a row during which 0.9% of patient visits to a health care provider were for in!uenza-likeillness (ILI). Nationally, ILI remains below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILI surveillance may be impacted by theCOVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.4/3/21, 11:06 AMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC

Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map
During week 12, all jurisdictions experienced minimal ILI activity. ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsFluSurv-NET sites reported acurrent cumulativehospitalization rate of 0.7 per100,000 population, which isabout one-seventh the ratereported at this time during thelow-severity 2011-12 season.
NCHS Mortality11.4% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia, in!uenza, orCOVID-19 (PIC). This is above theepidemic threshold of 7.0%.Currently, the majority of PICdeaths are due to COVID-19.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating in!uenzaviruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current in!uenza vaccines and to monitorevolutionary changes that continually occur in in!uenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility ofin!uenza viruses to antiviral medications, including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir)and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated later this season when a su"cient number of specimens have been tested.Outpatient Illness Surveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932)Please note, the U.S. Outpatient In!uenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits forin!uenza-like illness (ILI), not laboratory-con#rmed in!uenza, and will capture visits due to other respiratory pathogens,such as SARS-CoV-2, that present with similar symptoms. In addition, healthcare-seeking behaviors have changeddramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are accessing the healthcare system in alternative settings,which may or may not be captured as a part of ILINet. Therefore, ILI data, including ILI activity levels, should beinterpreted with extreme caution. It is particularly important at this time to evaluate syndromic surveillance data,including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate pictureof both in!uenza and COVID-19 activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVIDData Tracker Weekly Review (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html).ILINetNationwide during week 12, 0.9% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. This percentage is below thenational baseline of 2.6%.4/3/21, 11:06 AMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC

Page 9 of 16https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/ILI Visits by Age GroupAbout 65% of ILINet providers provide both the number of patient visits for ILI and the total number of patient visits forthe week broken out by age group. Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patientvisits for ILI by age group. The percentages of visits for ILI reported in ILINet in week 12 increased for one age group (0–4years) and remained stable (change of ≤0.1%) for the remaining age groups (5–24 years, 25–49 years, 50–64 years, and 65years and older) compared with week 11. There has been an increasing trend among persons aged 0-4 years, while theremaining age groups (5–24 years, 25–49 years, 50–64 years, and 65 years and older) have experienced a stable ordecreasing trend.
