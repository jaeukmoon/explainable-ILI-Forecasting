Outpatient Illness: ILINetThis week, 1.3% of patient visits to a health care provider were for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI), remaining stable (≤0.1%change) compared to week 2. National ILI remains below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILI surveillance may beimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map
This week, one jurisdiction experienced low activity, and the remaining jurisdictions experienced minimal activity. ILIactivity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsFluSurv-NET sites have reported142 laboratory-conﬁrmedinﬂuenza hospitalizations so farthis season for an overallcumulative hospitalization rate of0.5 per 100,000 population.
NCHS Mortality14.8% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia, inﬂuenza, orCOVID-19 (PIC). This is above theepidemic threshold of 7.1%.Currently, the majority of PICdeaths are due to COVID-19.
Pediatric DeathsNo new inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric deaths were reportedto CDC this week. The total forthe 2020-21 season is one.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods (http://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm) page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/ﬂuviewinteractive.htm).Key PointsKey PointsFlu activity is unusually low at this time but may increase in the coming months.An annual ﬂu vaccine is the best way to protect against ﬂu and its potentially serious complications.If you haven’t gotten your ﬂu vaccine yet, get vaccinated now (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/season/protect-your-health.html).There are also ﬂu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat ﬂu illness.U.S. Virologic Surveillance:(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281228772)Clinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

This person was infected with aninﬂuenza A(H3N2) variant (A(H3N2)v) virus. The patient is a child < 18 years of age, was not hospitalized, and hascompletely recovered from their illness. Investigation into the source of the infection revealed that the child lives on afarm with swine present. This is the ﬁrst inﬂuenza A(H3N2)v virus infection detected in the United States in 2021.Early identiﬁcation and investigation of human infections with novel inﬂuenza A viruses are critical so that the risk ofinfection can be more fully understood and appropriate public health measures can be taken. Additional information oninﬂuenza in swine, variant inﬂuenza infection in humans, and strategies to interact safely with swine can be found athttp://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/swineﬂu/index.htm (http://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/swineﬂu/index.htm)Additional information regarding human infections with novel inﬂuenza A viruses can be found athttp://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/Novel_Inﬂuenza.html (http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/Novel_Inﬂuenza.html).Inﬂuenza Virus Characterization(/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1571167630754)CDC performs genetic (/ﬂu/about/professionals/genetic-characterization.htm) and antigenic(/ﬂu/about/professionals/antigenic.htm) characterization of U.S. viruses submitted from state and local health laboratories usingRight Size Roadmap submission guidance. These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating inﬂuenzaviruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitorevolutionary changes that continually occur in inﬂuenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility ofinﬂuenza viruses to antiviral medications, including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir)and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated weekly starting later this season when a suﬃcient number of specimens havebeen tested.Outpatient Illness Surveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932)Please note, the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits forinﬂuenza-like illness (ILI), not laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza, and will capture visits due to other respiratory pathogens,such as SARS-CoV-2, that present with similar symptoms. In addition, healthcare-seeking behaviors have changeddramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are accessing the healthcare system in alternative settings,which may or may not be captured as a part of ILINet. Therefore, ILI data, including ILI activity levels, should beinterpreted with extreme caution. It is particularly important at this time to evaluate syndromic surveillance data,including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate pictureof both inﬂuenza and COVID-19 activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVIDView(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview.html).ILINetNationwide during week 3, 1.3% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. This percentage is below thenational baseline of 2.6%.

Due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILIsurveillance, and the fact that the state and territorial epidemiologists report relies heavily on ILI activity, reporting forthis system will be suspended for the 2020-21 inﬂuenza season. Data from previous seasons is available on FluViewInteractive.Additional geographic spread surveillance information for current and past seasons:Additional geographic spread surveillance information for current and past seasons:Surveillance Methods (https://wcms-wp.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1568388833450) | FluView Interactive(https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/FluView8.html)Inﬂuenza-Associated Hospitalizations:(http://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#Hospitalization)The Inﬂuenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza-related hospitalizations in select counties in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) states andInﬂuenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP) states.A total of 142 laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza-associated hospitalizations occurring between October 1, 2020, and January23, 2021, were reported by FluSurv-NET sites for an overall cumulative hospitalization rate of 0.5 per 100,000 population.This is lower than average for this point in the season and comparable to the overall rate seen at this point during the2011-12 season. Hospitalization rates stratiﬁed by age will be presented once case counts increase to a level thatproduces stable rates by age.Additional hospitalization surveillance information for current and past seasons and additional age groups:Additional hospitalization surveillance information for current and past seasons and additional age groups:Surveillance Methods (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#Hospitalization) | FluView Interactive: Rates by Age(https://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/FluHospRates.html) or Patient Characteristics (https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/FluHospChars.html)National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) MortalitySurveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281356004)Based on NCHS mortality surveillance data available on January 28, 2021, 14.8% of the deaths that occurred during theweek ending January 23, 2021 (week 3), were due to pneumonia, inﬂuenza, and COVID-19 (PIC). This percentage is abovethe epidemic threshold of 7.1% for week 3. Among the 3,043 PIC deaths reported for this week (week 3), 2,102 hadCOVID-19 listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death on the death certiﬁcate and seven listed inﬂuenza,indicating that the current increase in PIC mortality is due primarily to COVID-19 and not inﬂuenza.Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually coded causes of deathcollected from death certiﬁcates. Percentages of deaths due to pneumonia, inﬂuenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) are higheramong manually coded records than more rapidly available machine coded records. Because of additional time neededfor manual coding, the initially reported PIC percentages are likely to increase as more data are received and processed.The lag in availability of manually coded data increased during the holiday weeks at the end of 2020, and because of thelarge numbers of deaths reported during recent weeks, the delay in availability of manually coded data continues toincrease. Weeks for which the largest changes in the percentage of deaths due to PIC are expected are highlighted in grayin the ﬁgure below and should be interpreted with caution.
