(/ﬂu/weekly/#ivc)Illness
Outpatient Illness: ILINetThis week, 1.1% of patient visits to a health care provider were for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI), which was a decreasecompared to week 3 (1.3%). National ILI remains below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILI surveillance may beimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map
This week, all jurisdictions experienced minimal activity. ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsFluSurv-NET sites have reported155 laboratory-conﬁrmedinﬂuenza hospitalizations so farthis season for an overallcumulative hospitalization rate of0.5 per 100,000 population.
NCHS Mortality28.4% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia, inﬂuenza, orCOVID-19 (PIC). This is above theepidemic threshold of 7.1%.Currently, the majority of PICdeaths are due to COVID-19.
Pediatric DeathsNo new inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric deaths were reportedto CDC this week. The total forthe 2020-21 season is one.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods (http://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm) page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/ﬂuviewinteractive.htm).Key PointsKey PointsFlu activity is unusually low at this time but may increase in the coming months.An annual ﬂu vaccine is the best way to protect against ﬂu and its potentially serious complications.If you haven’t gotten your ﬂu vaccine yet, get vaccinated now (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/season/protect-your-health.html).There are also ﬂu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat ﬂu illness.U.S. Virologic Surveillance:(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281228772)Clinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating inﬂuenzaviruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitorevolutionary changes that continually occur in inﬂuenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility ofinﬂuenza viruses to antiviral medications, including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir)and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated weekly starting later this season when a suﬃcient number of specimens havebeen tested.Outpatient Illness Surveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932)Please note, the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits forinﬂuenza-like illness (ILI), not laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza, and will capture visits due to other respiratory pathogens,such as SARS-CoV-2, that present with similar symptoms. In addition, healthcare-seeking behaviors have changeddramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are accessing the healthcare system in alternative settings,which may or may not be captured as a part of ILINet. Therefore, ILI data, including ILI activity levels, should beinterpreted with extreme caution. It is particularly important at this time to evaluate syndromic surveillance data,including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate pictureof both inﬂuenza and COVID-19 activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVIDView(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview.html).ILINetNationwide during week 4, 1.1% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. This percentage is below thenational baseline of 2.6%.(http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/ﬂuportaldashboard.html)View Chart Data (current season only) (/ﬂu/weekly/weeklyarchives2020-2021/data/senAllregt04.html) | View Full Screen (/ﬂu/weekly/weeklyarchives2020-2021/ILI04.html)During week 4, compared with week 3, the percentage of visits for ILI decreased for two regions (Regions 2 and 6) andremained stable (change of ≤ 0.1%) in the remaining eight regions. All regions reported percentages of outpatient visitsfor ILI below their region-speciﬁc baselines.ILI Activity MapData collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity*(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1571167821424) by state/jurisdiction and Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA).

Due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILIsurveillance, and the fact that the state and territorial epidemiologists report relies heavily on ILI activity, reporting forthis system will be suspended for the 2020-21 inﬂuenza season.

Hospitalization rates stratiﬁed by age will be presented once case counts increase to a level thatproduces stable rates by age.Additional hospitalization surveillance information for current and past seasons and additional age groups:Additional hospitalization surveillance information for current and past seasons and additional age groups:Surveillance Methods (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#Hospitalization) | FluView Interactive: Rates by Age(https://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/FluHospRates.html) or Patient Characteristics (https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/ﬂuview/FluHospChars.html)National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) MortalitySurveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281356004)(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281356004)Based on NCHS mortality surveillance data available on February 4, 2021, 28.4% of the deaths that occurred during theweek ending January 30, 2021 (week 4), were due to pneumonia, inﬂuenza, and COVID-19 (PIC). This percentage is abovethe epidemic threshold of 7.1% for week 4. Among the 6,424 PIC deaths reported for this week (week 4), 5,648 hadCOVID-19 listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death on the death certiﬁcate and four listed inﬂuenza,indicating that the current increase in PIC mortality is due primarily to COVID-19 and not inﬂuenza.Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually coded causes of deathcollected from death certiﬁcates. Prior to week 4 (the week ending January 30, 2021), the percentages of deaths due toPIC were higher among manually coded records than more rapidly available machine coded records. Improvements havebeen made to the machine coding process that allow for more COVID-19 related deaths to be machine coded, and goingforward, the percentage of PIC deaths among machine coded and manually coded data are expected to be more similar.The data presented are preliminary and expected to change as more data are received and processed, but the amount ofchange in the percentage of deaths due to PIC should be lower going forward. Weeks for which the largest changes in thepercentage of deaths due to PIC may occur are highlighted in gray in the ﬁgure below and should be interpreted withcaution.
