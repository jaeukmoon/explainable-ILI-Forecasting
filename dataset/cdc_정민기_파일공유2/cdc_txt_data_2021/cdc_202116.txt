Outpatient Illness: ILINetFor the third week in a row, 1.1% of patient visits to a health care provider were for in!uenza-like illness (ILI).Nationally, ILI remains below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILI surveillance may be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.4/30/21, 12:35 PMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC

Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map
During week 16, all jurisdictions experienced minimal ILI activity. ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsFluSurv-NET sites reported acurrent cumulativehospitalization rate of 0.8 per100,000 population, which isabout one-tenth the ratereported at this time during thelow-severity 2011-12 season.
NCHS Mortality11.8% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia, in!uenza, orCOVID-19 (PIC). This is above theepidemic threshold of 6.7%.Currently, the majority of PICdeaths are due to COVID-19.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating in!uenza viruses are to the referenceviruses representing viruses contained in the current in!uenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionary changes thatcontinually occur in in!uenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of in!uenza viruses to antiviralmedications, including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonucleaseinhibitor baloxavir. Virus characterization data will be updated later this season when a su"cient number of specimens have been tested.Outpatient Illness Surveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932)Please note, the U.S. Outpatient In!uenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits forin!uenza-like illness (ILI), not laboratory-con#rmed in!uenza, and will capture visits due to other respiratory pathogens,such as SARS-CoV-2, that present with similar symptoms. In addition, health care-seeking behaviors have changeddramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are accessing the health care system in alternative settings,which may or may not be captured as a part of ILINet. Therefore, ILI data, including ILI activity levels, should beinterpreted with caution. It is particularly important at this time to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including thatfrom ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of bothin!uenza and COVID-19 activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVID DataTracker Weekly Review (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html).ILINetNationwide during week 16, 1.1% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. This percentage is below thenational baseline of 2.6%.4/30/21, 12:35 PMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC

All regions reported percentages of outpatient visitsfor ILI below their region-speci#c baselines.4/30/21, 12:35 PMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC
Page 9 of 16https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm#ILIMapILI Visits by Age GroupAbout 65% of ILINet providers provide both the number of patient visits for ILI and the total number of patient visits forthe week broken out by age group. Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patientvisits for ILI by age group. The percentages of visits for ILI reported in ILINet in week 16 increased for one age group (0–4years) and remained stable (change of ≤0.1%) for the remaining age groups (5–24 years, 25–49 years, 50–64 years, and 65years and older) compared with week 15. There has been an increasing trend among persons aged 0-4 years, while theremaining age groups have experienced a stable or slightly increasing trend.
