Page 4 of 12https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932)Please note, the U.S. Outpatient In!uenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits forin!uenza-like illness (ILI), not laboratory-con"rmed in!uenza, and will capture visits due to other respiratory pathogens,such as SARS-CoV-2, that present with similar symptoms. In addition, health care-seeking behaviors have changeddramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are accessing the health care system in alternative settings,which may or may not be captured as a part of ILINet. Therefore, ILI data, including ILI activity levels, should beinterpreted with caution. It is particularly important at this time to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including thatfrom ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of bothin!uenza and COVID-19 activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVID DataTracker Weekly Review (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview.html).ILINetNationwide during week 23, 1.2% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. This percentage is below thenational baseline of 2.6%.

Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patientvisits for ILI by age group. The percentages of visits for ILI reported in ILINet in week 23 decreased for one age group (0–4years) and remained stable (change of ≤0.1%) for the remaining age groups (5–24 years, 25–49 years, 50–64 years, and 65years and older) compared with week 22.

This percentage is above theepidemic threshold of 6.0% for week 23. Among the 1,360 PIC deaths reported for this week (week 23), 601 had COVID-19listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death on the death certi"cate, and zero listed in!uenza, indicating thatcurrent PIC mortality is due primarily to COVID-19 and not in!uenza.
