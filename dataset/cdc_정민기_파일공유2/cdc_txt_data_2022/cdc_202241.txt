Page 6 of 18https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2022-2023/week41.htmA human infection with a novel in@uenza A virus was reported by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. The patient wasinfected with an in@uenza A(H3N2) variant (A(H3N2)v) virus. The illness occurred during week 36 of 2022. The patient is <18 years of age, wasnot hospitalized, and has recovered from their illness. An investigation by local public health olcials found that the patient had indirect swineexposure at an agricultural fair prior to their illness onset. Additional investigation did not identify respiratory illness in any of the patient’shousehold contacts. No person-to-person transmission of A(H3N2)v virus associated with this patient has been identined.A total of nine human infections with variant novel in@uenza A viruses have been reported in the United States in 2022, including four H3N2v(Michigan (1) West Virginia (3)) and nve H1N2v (Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, Wisconsin) viruses. When an in@uenza virus that normallycirculates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a “variant” in@uenza virus. Most human infections with variant in@uenzaviruses occur following exposure to swine, but human-to-human transmission can occur. It is important to note that in most cases, variantin@uenza viruses have not shown the ability to spread easily and sustainably from person to person.Early identincation and investigation of human infections with novel in@uenza A viruses are critical so that the risk of infection can beunderstood, and appropriate public health measures can be taken.Additional information on in@uenza in swine, variant in@uenza virus infection in humans (/@u/swine@u/index.htm), and guidance to interact safelywith swine is available.Additional information regarding human infections with novel in@uenza A viruses:Additional information regarding human infections with novel in@uenza A viruses:Additional information regarding human infections with novel in@uenza A viruses:Additional information regarding human infections with novel in@uenza A viruses:Surveillance Methods (/@u/weekly/overview.htm#NovelASurveillance) | FluView Interactive (http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/@uview/Novel_In@uenza.html)In3uenza Virus Characterization (/3u/weekly/overview.htm#VirusCharacterization)CDC performs genetic (https://www.cdc.gov/@u/about/professionals/genetic-characterization.htm) and antigenic(https://www.cdc.gov/@u/about/professionals/antigenic.htm) characterization of U.S. viruses submitted from state and local public health laboratoriesaccording to the Right Size Roadmap submission guidance. These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating in@uenzaviruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current in@uenza vaccines. The data are also used to monitorevolutionary changes that continually occur in in@uenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of circulating in@uenzaviruses to antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonucleaseinhibitor baloxavir.CDC genetically characterized 446 in@uenza viruses collected since May 1, 2022.Virus Subtype or LineageVirus Subtype or LineageVirus Subtype or LineageVirus Subtype or LineageGenetic CharacterizationGenetic CharacterizationGenetic CharacterizationGenetic CharacterizationTotal No. ofTotal No. ofTotal No. ofTotal No. ofSubtype/LineageSubtype/LineageSubtype/LineageSubtype/LineageTestedTestedTestedTestedHAHAHAHACladeCladeCladeCladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)tested)tested)HAHAHAHASubcladeSubcladeSubcladeSubcladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)tested)tested)A/H1A/H1A/H1A/H1366B.1A36 (100%)5a.15 (13.9%)5a.231 (86.1%)A/H3A/H3A/H3A/H34083C.2a1b408 (100%)1a01b02a02/22/24, 9:16 AMFluView Summary ending on October 15, 2022 | CDC

Antigenic diserences between viruses are determined by comparing how well the antibodies madeagainst the vaccine reference viruses recognize the circulating viruses that have been grown in cell culture. Ferret antisera are useful becauseantibodies raised against a particular virus can often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruseswith similar antigenic properties have antibody titer diserences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared to the reference (vaccine)virus. In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer diserences of less than 8-fold. Viruses selected forantigenic characterization are a subset representing the genetic changes in the surface proteins seen in genetically characterized viruses.In@uenza A VirusesIn@uenza A VirusesIn@uenza A VirusesIn@uenza A VirusesA (H1N1)pdm09: A (H1N1)pdm09: A (H1N1)pdm09: A (H1N1)pdm09: Eleven A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized by HI, and 9 (82%) were well recognized (reacting attiters that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/588/2019-like reference virusesrepresenting the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based in@uenza vaccines and 9 (82%) were well recognized byferret antisera to egg-grown A/Victoria/2570/2019-like reference viruses representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the egg-basedin@uenza vaccines.A (H3N2): A (H3N2): A (H3N2): A (H3N2): Thirty-two A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by HINT; all were well-recognized (reacting at titers that werewithin 8-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021-like reference viruses representing theA(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based in@uenza vaccines and 30 (94%) were well-recognized by ferret antisera to egg-grown A/Darwin/9/2021-like reference viruses representing the A(H3N2) component for egg-based in@uenza vaccines.In@uenza B VirusesIn@uenza B VirusesIn@uenza B VirusesIn@uenza B VirusesB/Victoria: B/Victoria: B/Victoria: B/Victoria: One in@uenza B/Victoria-lineage virus was antigenically characterized by HI; it was well recognized (reacting at titers thatwere within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown B/Austria/1359417/2021-like reference virusesrepresenting the B/Victoria component for the cell- and recombinant-based in@uenza vaccines and by ferret antisera to egg-grown2/22/24, 9:16 AMFluView Summary ending on October 15, 2022 | CDC

Due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, health care-seeking behaviors have changed, and people may be accessing the health care system in alternative settingsnot captured as a part of ILINet or at a diserent point in their illness than they might have before the pandemic. Therefore, it is important toevaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete andaccurate picture of in@uenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publicationcalled COVID Data Tracker Weekly Review (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html). Information about otherrespiratory virus activity can be found on CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) website(https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/index.html).Outpatient Respiratory Illness VisitsNationwide during week 41, 3.0% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough orsore throat, also referred to as ILI. This increased compared to week 40 and is above the national baseline of 2.5%. Regions 2, 3, 4, and 6 areabove their region-specinc baselines, and regions 7 and 9 are at their respective baselines. The remaining four regions are below their region-specinc baselines. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of in@uenza virus infection to ILI varies bylocation.2/22/24, 9:16 AMFluView Summary ending on October 15, 2022 | CDC
