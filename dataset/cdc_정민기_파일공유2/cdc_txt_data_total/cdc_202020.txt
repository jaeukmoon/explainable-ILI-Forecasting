NoteNote: The COVID-19 pandemic is aﬀecting healthcare seeking behavior. The number of personsand their reasons for seeking care in the outpatient and ED settings is changing. These changesimpact data from ILINet in ways that are diﬃcult to diﬀerentiate from changes in illness levels,therefore ILINet data should be interpreted with caution. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemicin a weekly publication called COVIDView.

This percentage is belowthe national baseline of 2.4%.
View Chart Data (current season only) | View Full ScreenOn a regional level, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 0.6% to 1.8% during week20. Compared to last week, the percent of outpatient visits for ILI increased slightly in region 5,remained constant in regions 4, 7, and 10, and decreased in all other regions. All regions reported apercentage of outpatient visits for ILI below their region-speciﬁc baselines.ILI Activity MapData collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity* by state.During week 20, the following ILI activity levels were experienced:High – one state (Wisconsin)Moderate – Puerto Rico and one state (Idaho)Low – District of Columbia and one state (Maryland)Minimal - New York City, and 47 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado,Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana,Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, NorthDakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota,Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming)Data were insuﬃcient to calculate an ILI activity level from the U.S. Virgin Islands.A Weekly Inﬂuenza Surveillance Report Prepared by the Inﬂuenza DivisionInﬂuenza-Like Illness (ILI) Activity Level Indicator Determined by Data Reported to ILINetprev Play Pause next

Percentages of deaths due to pneumonia andinﬂuenza (P&I) are higher among manually coded records than more rapidly available machine codedrecords. Due to the additional time needed for manual coding, the initially reported P&I percentagesmay increase as more data are received and processed.
