Geographic Spread
The number of jurisdictions reporting regional or widespread inﬂuenza activity remained at 51 this week.Severe DiseaseHospitalizationsThe overall hospitalization rate for the season increased to 35.5 per 100,000. This is similar to what has been seen atthis time during recent seasons.
P&I MortalityThe percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and inﬂuenza is 7.1%, below the epidemic threshold of 7.2%.
Pediatric Deaths10 inﬂuenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2019-2020 season were reported this week. The totalfor the season is 78.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive.
U.S. Virologic SurveillanceClinical LaboratoriesKey PointsKey PointsOutpatient ILI and laboratory data remain elevated and increased again this week. Nationally, and in someregions, the proportion of inﬂuenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses compared to inﬂuenza B viruses is increasing.Overall, hospitalization rates remain similar to this time during recent seasons, but rates among children andyoung adults are higher at this time than in recent seasons.Pneumonia and inﬂuenza mortality has been low, but 78 inﬂuenza-associated deaths in children have beenreported so far this season.CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 22 million ﬂu illnesses, 210,000 hospitalizationsand 12,000 deaths from ﬂu.Flu vaccine eﬀectiveness estimates will be available later this month, but vaccination is always the best way toprevent ﬂu and its potentially serious complications.Antiviral medications are an important adjunct to ﬂu vaccine in the control of inﬂuenza. Almost all (>99%) of theinﬂuenza viruses tested this season are susceptible to the four FDA-approved inﬂuenza antiviral medicationsrecommended for use in the U.S. this season.The results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below. Data from clinical laboratories(the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for inﬂuenza) are used to monitor whether inﬂuenza activity isincreasing or decreasing.Week 5Week 5Data Cumulative since Data Cumulative since September 29, 2019September 29, 2019(week 40)(week 40)No. of specimens testedNo. of specimens tested53,247738,331No. of positive specimens (%)No. of positive specimens (%)15,875 (29.8%)129,997 (17.6%)Positive specimens by typePositive specimens by type      Inﬂuenza A    Inﬂuenza A8,637 (54.4%)52,928 (40.7%)    Inﬂuenza B    Inﬂuenza B7,238 (45.6%)77,069 (59.3%)The predominant virus also varies by age group. Nationally, for the season overall, inﬂuenza B viruses are the mostcommonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among children and young adults age 0-4 years (56% of reported viruses) and 5-24years (73% of reported viruses), while A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses amongpersons 25-64 years (53% of reported viruses) and 65 years of age and older (60% of reported viruses). For this season,52% of inﬂuenza positive specimens reported by public health laboratories were among persons less than 25 years of ageand less than 13% were from persons age 65 and older.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatinginﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionarychanges that continually occur in circulating inﬂuenza. Antigenic characterization data are based on an animal model(inﬂuenza-naive ferrets), and do not reﬂect pre-existing protection provided by past inﬂuenza infections and vaccinations.Additional antigenic characterization studies involving people vaccinated with current inﬂuenza vaccines are conductedlater in the season; these data account for pre-existing protection in diﬀerent populations against circulating inﬂuenzaviruses.
