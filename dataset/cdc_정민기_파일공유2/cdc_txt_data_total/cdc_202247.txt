Region 7 (Central) is at its region-specibc outpatient respiratory illness baseline and regions 1,2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 (New England, New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands, Midwest, Southeast, SouthCentral, Mountain, and West Coast) are above their region-specibc baselines.The number of weekly @u hospital admissions continues to increase.In week 47, 5 pediatric deaths associated with in@uenza were reported. This brings the 2023-2024 season total to8 pediatric deaths.During week 47, of the 379 viruses reported by public health laboratories, 311 (82.1%) were in@uenza A and 68(17.9%) were in@uenza B. Of the 202 in@uenza A viruses subtyped during week 47, 166 (82.2%) were in@uenzaA(H1N1) and 32 (17.8%) were A(H3N2).CDC estimates that there have been at least 1.8 million illnesses, 17,000 hospitalizations, and 1,100 deaths from@u so far this season.CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual @u vaccine, as there are still vaccinesavailable.Now is still a good time to get a vaccine, if you haven’t already.There also are prescription @u antiviral drugs that can be used to treat @u illness; those should be started as earlyas possible and are especially important for higher risk patients.In@uenza viruses are among several viruses that contribute to respiratory disease activity. CDC is providingupdated, integrated information (https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/index.html) about COVID-19, in@uenza, and RSVactivity on a weekly basis.1

Ferret antisera are useful because antibodies raised against a particular viruscan often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruses with similar antigenicproperties have antibody titer dinerences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared to the reference (vaccine) virus.In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer dinerences of less than or equal to 8-fold.

It is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including thatfrom ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a more complete and accurate picture ofin@uenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. CDC is providing integrated information about COVID-19,in@uenza and RSV activity on a website (https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/index.html) that is updated weekly. Informationabout other respiratory virus activity can be found on CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System(NREVSS) website (https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/index.html).Outpatient Respiratory Illness VisitsNationwide during Week 47, 3.9% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that includedfever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. This has increased compared to week 47 and is above thenational baseline of 2.9% for the fourth consecutive week. ILI activity increased in 7 of the 10 HHS Regions (regions 1, 5, 6,7, 8, 9, and 10) during week 47 compared to week 48 and, while stable compared to last week, is trending upward inRegion 4. Percent of visits for ILI decreased in Region 3, but that may be attributed to low reporting during week 47. Eightregions are at or above their region-specibc baselines (regions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) this week. Multiple respiratoryviruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of in@uenza virus infection to ILI varies by location.12/3/23, 11:07 AMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC

Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits by Age GroupAbout 70% of ILINet participants provide both the number of patient visits for respiratory illness and the total number ofpatient visits for the week broken out by age group. Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate thepercentages of patient visits for respiratory illness by age group.The percentage of visits for respiratory illness reported in ILINet has increased (change of > 0.1 percentage points) in twoage groups (5-24 years and 50-64 years) in Week 47 compared to week 46 and is trending upward in all other age groups(0-4 years, 25-49 years, 65+ years).12/3/23, 11:07 AMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC

As data are received each week, prior case counts and ratesare updated accordingly.A total of 1,131 laboratory-conbrmed in@uenza-associated hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites betweenOctober 1, 2023, and November 25, 2023; 923 (81.6%) were associated with in@uenza A virus, 162 (14.3%) with in@uenza Bvirus, 4 (0.4%) with in@uenza A virus and in@uenza B virus co-infection, and 42 (3.7%) with in@uenza virus for which thetype was not determined. Among those with in@uenza A subtype information, 185 (83.3%) were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 36(16.2%) were A(H3N2).The weekly hospitalization rate observed in week 47 was 0.9 per 100,000 population. The overall cumulativehospitalization rate was 3.7 per 100,000 population. This cumulative hospitalization rate is the second highest cumulativein-season hospitalization rate observed in week 47, following the 2022-2023 season (16.6). Cumulative in-seasonhospitalization rates observed in week 46 from 2010-2011 through 2021-2022 ranged from 0.1 to 2.0.When examining rates by age, the highest cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population was among adults aged65 years and older (8.9), followed by adults aged 50-64 years (4.9), and children aged 0-4 years (4.0). When examiningunadjusted rates by race and ethnicity, the highest rate of hospitalization per 100,000 population was among non-Hispanic Black persons (6.4), followed by non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons (4.4), Hispanic persons(3.7), non-Hispanic Asian persons (2.7), and non-Hispanic White persons (2.6).12/3/23, 11:07 AMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC

This percentage remained stable (≤ 0.1 percentagepoint change) compared to Week 46, but is trending upwards slightly since early October.
