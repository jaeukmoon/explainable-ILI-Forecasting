A description of the CDC influenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each data component is available on the surveillance methods page. Additional information on the current and previous influenza seasons for each surveillance component are available on FluView Interactive. Key Points Seasonal influenza activity remains elevated in most parts of the country. Key flu indicators have decreased or remained stable nationally for three weeks. CDC will continue to monitor for a second period of increased influenza activity that often occurs after the winter holidays. Outpatient respiratory illness has been above baseline1 nationally since November and is above baseline in all 10 HHS regions. The number of weekly flu hospital admissions has decreased for three consecutive weeks. During Week 3, of the 699 viruses reported by public health laboratories, 581 (83.1%) were influenza A and 118 (16.9%) were influenza B. Of the 370 influenza A viruses subtyped during Week 3, 264 (71.4%) were influenza A(H1N1) and 106 (28.6%) were A(H3N2). Ten influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during Week 3, bringing the 2023-2024 season total to 57 pediatric deaths. CDC estimates that there have been at least 18 million illnesses, 210,000 hospitalizations, and 13,000 deaths from flu so far this season. CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine as long as influenza viruses are spreading.2 Vaccination now can still provide benefit this season. There also are prescription flu antiviral drugs that can treat flu illness; those should be started as early as possible and are especially important for higher risk patients.3 Flu viruses are among several viruses contributing to respiratory disease activity. CDC is providing updated, integrated information about COVID-19, flu, and RSV activity on a weekly basis. U.S. Virologic Surveillance Nationally, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories remained stable (change of <0.5 percentage points) compared to the previous week, but trends varied by region. Regions 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10 reported an increase in percent positivity while regions 2, 4, 7, and 8 reported a decrease. The regions with the highest percent positivity were regions 6 (25.1%), 8 (20.0%), 5 (15.7%), and 3 (14.5%). Since Week 40, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 has been the predominant virus circulating in all regions. However, the distribution of circulating viruses varies by region. For regional and state level data and age group distribution, please visit FluView Interactive. Viruses known to be associated with recent receipt of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or found upon further testing to be a vaccine virus are not included, as they are not circulating influenza viruses. Clinical Laboratories The results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below. Data from clinical laboratories (the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for influenza virus) are used to monitor whether influenza activity is increasing or decreasing. results of tests from Clinical Laboratories Week 3 Data Cumulative since October 1, 2023 (Week 40) No. of specimens tested 85,664 1,649,919 No. of positive specimens (%) 12,194 (14.2%) 156,919 (9.5%) Positive specimens by type Influenza A 9,509 (78.0%) 125,365 (79.9%) Influenza B 2,685 (22.0%) 31,554 (20.1%) View Chart Data | View Full Screen Public Health Laboratories The results of tests performed by public health laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating influenza viruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current influenza vaccines. The data are also used to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur in influenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir. CDC has genetically characterized 1,144 influenza viruses collected since October 1, 2023. Influenza Virus Characterization from viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29, 2019 Virus Subtype or Lineage Genetic Characterization Total No. of Subtype/Lineage Tested HA Clade Number (% of subtype/lineage tested) HA Subclade Number (% of subtype/lineage tested) A/H1 815 6B.1A.5a 815 (100%) 2a 225 (27.6%) 2a.1 590 (72.4%) A/H3 458 3C.2a1b.2a 458 (100%) 2a.1b 1 (0.2%) 2a.3a 1 (0.2%) 2a.3a.1 455 (99.3%) 2b 1 (0.2%) B/Victoria 452 V1A 452 (100%) 3a.2 452 (100%) B/Yamagata 0 Y3 0 Y3 0 (0%) CDC antigenically characterizes influenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) (H1N1pdm09, H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses) or neutralization-based HINT (H3N2 viruses) using antisera that ferrets make after being infected with reference viruses representing the 2023-2024 Northern Hemisphere recommended cell or recombinant-based vaccine viruses. Antigenic differences between viruses are determined by comparing how well the antibodies made against the vaccine reference viruses recognize the circulating viruses that have been grown in cell culture. Ferret antisera are useful because antibodies raised against a particular virus can often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody titer differences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared to the reference (vaccine) virus. In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer differences of less than or equal to 8-fold. Viruses selected for antigenic characterization are a subset representing the genetic changes in the surface proteins seen in genetically characterized viruses. Influenza A Viruses A (H1N1)pdm09: 107 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized by HI, and all were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/67/2022-like reference viruses representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. A (H3N2): Ninety-one A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by HI or HINT, and all were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer in HI or reacting at titers that were less than or equal to 8-fold of the homologous virus in HINT) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021-like reference viruses representing the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. Influenza B Viruses B/Victoria: Sixty-one influenza B/Victoria-lineage virus were antigenically characterized by HI, and all were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown B/Austria/1359417/2021-like reference viruses representing the B/Victoria component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. B/Yamagata: No influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were available for antigenic characterization. Assessment of Virus Susceptibility to Antiviral Medications CDC assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to the antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using next generation sequence analysis supplemented by laboratory assays. Information about antiviral susceptibility test methods can be found at U.S. Influenza Surveillance: Purpose and Methods | CDC. Viruses collected in the U.S. since October 01, 2023, were tested for antiviral susceptibility as follows: Viruses collected in the U.S. tested for antiviral susceptibility Antiviral Medication Total Viruses A/H1 A/H3 B/Victoria Neuraminidase Inhibitors Oseltamivir Viruses Tested 1723 816 460 447 Reduced Inhibition 1 (0.1%) 1 (0.1%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 1 (0.1%) 1 (0.1%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) Peramivir Viruses Tested 1723 816 460 447 Reduced Inhibition 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 1 (0.1%) 1 (0.1%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) Zanamivir Viruses Tested 1723 816 460 447 Reduced Inhibition 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) PA Cap-Dependent Endonuclease Inhibitor Baloxavir Viruses Tested 1682 793 450 439 Decreased Susceptibility 1 (0.1%) 0 (0.0%) 1 (0.2%) 0 (0.0%) One A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-H275Y amino acid substitution and showed highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir. One (H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-S247N and NA-I223V amino acid substitutions and showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. One A(H3N2) virus had PA-I38T amino acid substitution and showed reduced susceptibility to baloxavir. High levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) viruses (the adamantanes are not effective against influenza B viruses). Therefore, use of these antivirals for treatment and prevention of influenza A virus infection is not recommended and data from adamantane resistance testing are not presented. Outpatient Respiratory Illness Surveillance The U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness [ILI (fever plus cough or sore throat)], not laboratory-confirmed influenza and will therefore capture respiratory illness visits due to infection with pathogens that can present with similar symptoms, including influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. It is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a more complete and accurate picture of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. CDC is providing integrated information about COVID-19, influenza, and RSV activity on a website that is updated weekly. Information about other respiratory virus activity can be found on CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) website. Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits Nationwide, during Week 3, 4.3% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. This is a decrease compared to Week 2, but remains above the national baseline of 2.9%. All regions, with the exception of Region 6, have decreased compared to Week 2; Region 6 has remained stable. All regions remain above their region-specific baselines this week. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varies by location. * Effective October 3, 2021 (week 40), the ILI definition (fever plus cough or sore throat) no longer includes “without a known cause other than influenza.” View Chart Data (current season only) | View Full Screen Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits by Age Group About 70% of ILINet participants provide both the number of patient visits for respiratory illness and the total number of patient visits for the week broken out by age group. Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patient visits for respiratory illness by age group. The percentage of visits for respiratory illness reported in ILINet decreased (change of > 0.1 percentage points) in all age groups during Week 3 compared to Week 2.

Additional information about medically attended visits for ILI for current and past seasons: Surveillance Methods | FluView Interactive: National, Regional, and State Data or ILI Activity Map Hospitalization Surveillance FluSurv-NET The Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in select counties in 14 states and represents approximately 9% of the U.S. population. FluSurv-NET hospitalization data are preliminary. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly. A total of 13,224 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites between October 1, 2023, and January 20, 2024. The weekly hospitalization rate observed in Week 3 was 2.9 per 100,000 population. The weekly hospitalization rate observed during Week 52 is the fourth highest weekly rate peak observed during all seasons going back to 2010-2011 following the 2014-2015, 2017-2018, and 2022-2023 seasons. The overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 43.3 per 100,000 population. This cumulative hospitalization rate is the fourth highest cumulative hospitalization rate when compared against previous end-of-season rates for Week 3, while it is the second highest cumulative in-season hospitalization rate observed in Week 3, following the 2022-2023 season (58.1). Cumulative in-season hospitalization rates observed in Week 3 from 2010-2011 through 2021-2022 ranged from 0.5 to 41.9. When examining rates by age, the highest cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population was among adults aged 65 years and older (115.9), followed by adults aged 50-64 years (54.0) and children aged 0-4 years (46.5). When examining age-adjusted rates by race and ethnicity, the highest rate of hospitalization per 100,000 population was among non-Hispanic Black persons (83.6), followed by Hispanic persons (39.5), non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons (39.0), non-Hispanic White persons (30.1), and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander persons (25.6). Among 13,224 hospitalizations, 11,691 (88.4%) were associated with influenza A virus, 1,416 (10.7%) with influenza B virus, 29 (0.2%) with influenza A virus and influenza B virus co-infection, and 88 (0.7%) with influenza virus for which the type was not determined. Among those with influenza A subtype information, 1,882 (77.8%) were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 536 (22.2%) were A(H3N2). Based on preliminary data, of the 765 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations with more complete data, 3.8% (95% CI: 2.2%-5.5%) also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among 590 hospitalized adults with information on underlying medical conditions, 94.5% had at least one reported underlying medical condition, the most commonly reported were hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder, and obesity. Among 734 hospitalized women of childbearing age (15-49 years) with information on pregnancy status, 22.2% were pregnant. Among 301 hospitalized children with information on underlying medical conditions, 68.7% had at least one reported underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported was asthma, followed by neurologic disease and obesity.
