Outpatient Illness: ILINetDuring week 10, 0.9% of patient visits to a health care provider were for in!uenza-like illness (ILI), remaining stable(change of ≤0.1%) compared to week 9 (0.8%). Nationally, ILI remains below the national baseline of 2.6%.

Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map
During week 10, all jurisdictions experienced minimal ILI activity. ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsFluSurv-NET sites reported acurrent cumulativehospitalization rate of 0.7 per100,000 population, which isabout one-fourth the rate at thistime during the low-severity2011-12 season.
NCHS Mortality13.3% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia, in!uenza, orCOVID-19 (PIC). This is above theepidemic threshold of 7.1%.Currently, the majority of PICdeaths are due to COVID-19.

Page 7 of 16https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/Inﬂuenza Virus Characterization(/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1571167630754)CDC performs genetic (/!u/about/professionals/genetic-characterization.htm) and antigenic(/!u/about/professionals/antigenic.htm) characterization of U.S. viruses submitted from state and local health laboratories usingRight Size Roadmap submission guidance. These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating in!uenzaviruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current in!uenza vaccines and to monitorevolutionary changes that continually occur in in!uenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility ofin!uenza viruses to antiviral medications, including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir)and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated later this season when a su"cient number of specimens have been tested.Outpatient Illness Surveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932)Please note, the U.S. Outpatient In!uenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits forin!uenza-like illness (ILI), not laboratory-con#rmed in!uenza, and will capture visits due to other respiratory pathogens,such as SARS-CoV-2, that present with similar symptoms. In addition, healthcare-seeking behaviors have changeddramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are accessing the healthcare system in alternative settings,which may or may not be captured as a part of ILINet. Therefore, ILI data, including ILI activity levels, should beinterpreted with extreme caution. It is particularly important at this time to evaluate syndromic surveillance data,including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate pictureof both in!uenza and COVID-19 activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVIDData Tracker Weekly Review (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html).ILINetNationwide during week 10, 0.9% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. This percentage is below thenational baseline of 2.6%.3/20/21, 10:54 AMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC

All regions reported percentages of outpatient visitsfor ILI below their region-speci#c baselines.3/20/21, 10:54 AMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC
Page 9 of 16https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/ILI Visits by Age GroupAbout 65% of ILINet providers provide both the number of patient visits for ILI and the total number of patient visits forthe week broken out by age group. Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patientvisits for ILI by age group. The percentages of visits for ILI reported in ILINet in week 10 increased for one age group (0–4years) and remained stable (change of ≤0.1%) for the remaining age groups (5–24 years, 25–49 years, 50–64 years, and 65years and older) compared with week 9. Over the past nine weeks there has been an increasing trend among personsaged 0-4 years while the remaining age groups (5–24 years, 25–49 years, 50–64 years, and 65 years and older) haveexperienced a decreasing trend.

Due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILIsurveillance, and the fact that the state and territorial epidemiologists report relies heavily on ILI activity, reporting forthis system will be suspended for the 2020-21 in!uenza season.

This is much lowerthan average for this point in the season and lower than rates for any season since routine data collection began in 2005,including the low severity 2011-12 season. The current rate is about one-fourth the rate seen at this time during the 2011-12 season.

This percentage isabove the epidemic threshold of 7.1% for week 10. Among the 2,623 PIC deaths reported for this week (week 10), 1,8823/20/21, 10:54 AMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC
Page 13 of 16https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/had COVID-19 listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death on the death certi#cate and three listed in!uenza,indicating that the current increase in PIC mortality above the epidemic threshold is due primarily to COVID-19 and notin!uenza.Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually coded causes of deathcollected from death certi#cates. Prior to week 4 (the week ending January 30, 2021), the percentages of deaths due toPIC were higher among manually coded records than more rapidly available machine coded records. Improvements havebeen made to the machine coding process that allow for more COVID-19 related deaths to be machine coded, and goingforward, the percentage of PIC deaths among machine coded and manually coded data are expected to be more similar.The data presented are preliminary and expected to change as more data are received and processed, but the amount ofchange in the percentage of deaths due to PIC should be lower going forward. Weeks for which the largest changes in thepercentage of deaths due to PIC may occur are highlighted in gray in the #gure below and should be interpreted withcaution.
