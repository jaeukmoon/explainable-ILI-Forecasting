In addition, health care-seeking behaviors have changeddramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are accessing the health care system in alternative settings,which may or may not be captured as a part of ILINet. Therefore, ILI data, including ILI activity levels, should beinterpreted with caution. It is particularly important at this time to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including thatfrom ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of in#uenza,COVID-19, and other respiratory virus activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication calledCOVID Data Tracker Weekly Review (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html). Information aboutother respiratory virus activity can be found on CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System(NREVSS) website (https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/index.html).ILINetNationwide during week 36, 2.3% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. The percentage of patient visitsfor ILI remains below the baseline of 2.6% nationally. Three regions (Regions 3, 7, and 9) are above their region-speci_cbaselines, and the remaining regions are below their region-speci_c baselines. In#uenza virus circulation remains low;therefore, increases in ILI activity are likely due to increased circulation of other respiratory viruses.2/9/24, 8:40 AMFluView Summary ending on September 11, 2021 | CDC

Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patientvisits for ILI by age group.The percentages of visits for ILI reported in ILINet are stable or decreasing among all age groups (0-4 years, 5-24 years,25-49 years, 50-64 years, and 65+ years).
