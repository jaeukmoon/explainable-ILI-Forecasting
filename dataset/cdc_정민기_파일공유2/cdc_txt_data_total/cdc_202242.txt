Regions 4 (southeast) and 6 (south-central) are reporting the highestlevels of @u activity.The crst in@uenza-associated pediatric death of the 2022-2023 season was reported this week.CDC estimates that, so far this season, there have been at least 880,000 @u illnesses, 6,900 hospitalizations, and360 deaths from @u.The cumulative hospitalization rate in the FluSurv-NET system is higher than the rate observed in week 42 duringprevious seasons going back to 2010-2011.An annual @u vaccine is the best way to protect against @u. Vaccination helps prevent infection and can alsoprevent serious outcomes in people who get vaccinated but still get sick with @u.CDC recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older get a @u vaccine annually.There are also prescription @u antiviral drugs that can be used to treat @u illness; those need to be started asearly as possible.U.S. Virologic Surveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/:u/weekly/overview.htm#LabSurveillance)Nationally, the percentage of specimens testing positive for in@uenza in clinical laboratories is increasing; however,activity varies by region. Percent positivity increased ≥ 0.5% this week in regions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, and wassimilar to the previous week but trending upward in region 1.

Antigenic dinerencesbetween viruses are determined by comparing how well the antibodies made against the vaccine reference virusesrecognize the circulating viruses that have been grown in cell culture. Ferret antisera are useful because antibodies raisedagainst a particular virus can often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruseswith similar antigenic properties have antibody titer dinerences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared to thereference (vaccine) virus. In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer dinerencesof less than 8-fold.

Page 9 of 21https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2022-2023/week42.htmOutpatient Respiratory Illness Surveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/:u/weekly/overview.htm#ILINet)The U.S. Outpatient In@uenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for respiratory illnessreferred to as in@uenza-like illness [ILI (fever plus cough or sore throat)], not laboratory-concrmed in@uenza, and willtherefore capture respiratory illness visits due to infection with any pathogen that can present with similar symptoms,including in@uenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health care-seeking behaviors have changed,and people may be accessing the health care system in alternative settings not captured as a part of ILINet or at adinerent point in their illness than they might have before the pandemic. Therefore, it is important to evaluate syndromicsurveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete andaccurate picture of in@uenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in aweekly publication called COVID Data Tracker Weekly Review (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html). Information about other respiratory virus activity can be found on CDC’s National Respiratory andEnteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) website (https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/index.html).Outpatient Respiratory Illness VisitsNationwide during week 42, 3.3% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that includedfever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. This increased compared to week 41 and is above the nationalbaseline of 2.5%. Regions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 are at or above their region-specicc baselines. The remaining three regionsare below their region-specicc baselines. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution ofin@uenza virus infection to ILI varies by location.2/22/24, 9:20 AMFluView Summary ending on October 22, 2022 | CDC
