U.S. Virologic SurveillanceKey Points:Key Points:Outpatient ILI and clinical laboratory data remain elevated but decreased for the second week in a row. Thepercentage of specimens testing positive for both inﬂuenza A and inﬂuenza B viruses decreased.Overall, hospitalization rates remain similar to this time during recent seasons, but rates among school agedchildren and young adults are higher at this time than in recent seasons and rates among children 0-4 years oldare now the highest CDC has on record at this point in the season, surpassing rates reported during the secondwave of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Pneumonia and inﬂuenza mortality has been low, but 125 inﬂuenza-associated deaths in children have beenreported so far this season. This number is higher for the same time period than in every season since reportingbegan in 2004-05, except for the 2009 pandemic.CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 32 million ﬂu illnesses, 310,000 hospitalizationsand 18,000 deaths from ﬂu.Interim estimates of 2019-2020 ﬂu vaccine eﬀectiveness were released last week. So far this season, ﬂu vaccinesare reducing doctor’s visits for ﬂu illness by 45% overall and 55% in children.Antiviral medications are an important adjunct to ﬂu vaccine in the control of inﬂuenza. Almost all (>99%) of theinﬂuenza viruses tested this season are susceptible to the four FDA-approved inﬂuenza antiviral medicationsrecommended for use in the U.S. this season.Clinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

For the season, the number of B/Victoria andA(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are approximately equal. The predominant virus varies by region. Regional and state level dataabout circulating inﬂuenza viruses can be found on FluView Interactive.The predominant virus also varies by age group. Nationally, for the season overall, inﬂuenza B viruses are the mostcommonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among children and young adults less than 25 years, while A viruses are the mostcommonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among persons 25 years and older. In the most recent weeks, inﬂuenza A virusesare the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses in all but the school aged children and young adults (5-24 years old).

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatinginﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionarychanges that continually occur in circulating inﬂuenza viruses. Antigenic characterization data are based on an animalmodel (inﬂuenza-naive ferrets), and do not reﬂect pre-existing protection provided by past inﬂuenza infections andvaccinations. Additional antigenic characterization studies involving people vaccinated with current inﬂuenza vaccines areconducted later in the season; these data account for pre-existing protection in diﬀerent populations against circulatinginﬂuenza viruses. Genetic and antigenic characterization data are not used to make calculations about vaccineeﬀectiveness (VE). CDC conducts VE studies each year to measure the beneﬁts of ﬂu vaccines in people. Interim estimatesof 2019-2020 ﬂu vaccine eﬀectiveness have been released.CDC genetically characterizedgenetically characterized 1,787 inﬂuenza viruses collected in the U.S. from September 29, 2019, to February 22,2020.VirusVirusSubtype orSubtype orLineageLineageGenetic CharacterizationGenetic CharacterizationTotal No. ofTotal No. ofSubtype/LineageSubtype/LineageTestedTested                CladeCladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)                SubcladeSubcladeNumber (% ofNumber (% ofsubtype/lineagesubtype/lineagetested)tested)A/H1A/H16066B.1A606 (100%)A/H3A/H34063C.2a386 (95.1%)2a1386 (95.1%)    2a20      2a302a403C.3a20 (4.9%)3a20 (4.9%)B/VictoriaB/Victoria699V1A699 (100%)V1A0V1A.151 (7.3%)V1A.3648 (92.7%)B/YamagataB/Yamagata76Y376 (100%)CDC antigenically characterizesantigenically characterizes a subset of inﬂuenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or neutralizationbased Focus Reduction assays (FRA).
