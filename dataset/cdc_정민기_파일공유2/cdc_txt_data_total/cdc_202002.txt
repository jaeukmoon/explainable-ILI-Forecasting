Inﬂuenza (Flu)Weekly U.S. Inﬂuenza Surveillance Report
Key Updates for Week 2, ending January 11, 2020Key indicators that track ﬂu activity declined slightly but remain high. Indicators that track severityKey indicators that track ﬂu activity declined slightly but remain high. Indicators that track severity(hospitalizations and deaths) are not high at this point in the season.(hospitalizations and deaths) are not high at this point in the season.Viruses
Clinical LabsThe percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for inﬂuenza at clinical laboratories decreased from 23.6%last week to 22.9% this week.
Public Health LabsNationally, B/Victoria viruses are the predominant viruses this season; however, during recent weeks, approximatelyequal numbers of B/Victoria and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been reported.
Virus CharacterizationGenetic and antigenic characterization and antiviral susceptibility of inﬂuenza viruses collected in the U.S. aresummarized in this report.Illness
Outpatient Illness: ILINetVisits to health care providers for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI) decreased from 5.7% last week to 4.7% this week. Allregions remain above their baselines.
Outpatient Illness: ILI Activity Map
The number of jurisdictions experiencing high ILI activity decreased from 36 last week to 34 this week.
Geographic Spread
The number of jurisdictions reporting regional or widespread inﬂuenza activity remained at 50 this week.Severe DiseaseHospitalizationsThe overall hospitalization rate for the season increased to 19.9 per 100,000. This is similar to what has been seen atthis time during recent seasons.
P&I MortalityThe percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and inﬂuenza increased from 6.0% to 6.9% but remains belowthe epidemic threshold.
Pediatric DeathsSeven new inﬂuenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2019-2020 season were reported this week.The total for the season is 39.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive.
U.S. Virologic SurveillanceKey PointsKey PointsOutpatient ILI and laboratory data remain elevated but declined slightly this week.  While the overall percent ofspecimens positive for inﬂuenza declined nationally, the percent positive for inﬂuenza A viruses increased andsome regions are seeing increases in the proportion of inﬂuenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses compared to otherinﬂuenza viruses. It is too early to know whether the season has peaked or if ﬂu activity will increase again.Levels of outpatient ILI remain elevated; however, hospitalization rates remain similar to what has been seen atthis time during recent seasons and mortality, while increasing, has not yet exceeded the epidemic threshold.CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 13 million ﬂu illnesses, 120,000 hospitalizationsand 6,600 deaths from ﬂu.Flu vaccine eﬀectiveness estimates are not available yet this season, but vaccination is always the best way toprevent ﬂu and its potentially serious complications.Antiviral medications are an important adjunct to ﬂu vaccine in the control of inﬂuenza. Almost all (>99%) of theinﬂuenza viruses tested this season are susceptible to the four FDA-approved inﬂuenza antiviral medicationsrecommended for use in the U.S. this season.Clinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

The predominant virus varies by region. Regional and state level data about circulatinginﬂuenza viruses can be found on FluView Interactive. The predominant virus also varies by age group. Nationally,inﬂuenza B/Victoria viruses are the most commonly reported inﬂuenza viruses among children age 0-4 years (47% ofreported viruses) and 5-24 years (57% of reported viruses), while A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are the most commonlyreported inﬂuenza viruses among persons 25-64 years (46% of reported viruses) and 65 years of age and older (53% ofreported viruses). Additional age data can be found on FluView Interactive.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatinginﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionarychanges that continually occur in circulating inﬂuenza. Antigenic characterization data are based on an animal model(inﬂuenza-naive ferrets), and do not reﬂect pre-existing protection provided by past inﬂuenza infections and vaccinations.Additional antigenic characterization studies involving people vaccinated with current inﬂuenza vaccines are conductedlater in the season; these data account for pre-existing protection in diﬀerent populations against circulating inﬂuenzaviruses.
