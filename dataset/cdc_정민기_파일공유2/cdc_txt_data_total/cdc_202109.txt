Outpatient Illness: ILINetDuring week 9, 0.8% of patient visits to a health care provider were for in!uenza-like illness (ILI), remaining stable(change of ≤0.1%) compared to week 8 (0.9%). Nationally, ILI remains below the national baseline of 2.6%. ILIsurveillance may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.
Outpatient Illness: ILINet Activity Map
During week 9, all jurisdictions experienced minimal activity. ILI activity levels may be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic and should be interpreted with caution.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsFluSurv-NET sites reported acurrent cumulativehospitalization rate of 0.7 per100,000 population, which isabout one-third the rate at thistime during the low-severity2011-12 season.
NCHS Mortality14.6% of deaths were attributedto pneumonia, in!uenza, orCOVID-19 (PIC). This is above theepidemic threshold of 7.2%.Currently, the majority of PICdeaths are due to COVID-19.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating in!uenzaviruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current in!uenza vaccines and to monitorevolutionary changes that continually occur in in!uenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility ofin!uenza viruses to antiviral medications, including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir)and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated later this season when a su"cient number of specimens have been tested.2021–2022 In!uenza Season – U.S. In!uenza Vaccine Composition2021–2022 In!uenza Season – U.S. In!uenza Vaccine CompositionThe World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the Northern Hemisphere 2021–2022 in!uenza vaccinecomposition, and the Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee(VRBPAC) subsequently made the in!uenza vaccine composition recommendation for the United States. The compositionof the 2021–2022 U.S. in!uenza vaccines includes updates to the in!uenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and in!uenza A(H3N2)components. These vaccine recommendations were based on several factors, including global in!uenza virologic andepidemiologic surveillance, genetic characterization, antigenic characterization and the candidate vaccine viruses that areavailable for production.U.S. egg-based in!uenza vaccines are recommended to contain the following:A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virusA/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virusB/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virusB/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus (for quadrivalent vaccines)U.S. cell- or recombinant vaccines are recommended to contain the following:A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virusA/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virusB/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virusB/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata)-like virus (for quadrivalent vaccines)Outpatient Illness Surveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932)Please note, the U.S. Outpatient In!uenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits forin!uenza-like illness (ILI), not laboratory-con#rmed in!uenza, and will capture visits due to other respiratory pathogens,such as SARS-CoV-2, that present with similar symptoms. In addition, healthcare-seeking behaviors have changeddramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are accessing the healthcare system in alternative settings,3/14/21, 7:37 AMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC
Page 8 of 16https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/which may or may not be captured as a part of ILINet. Therefore, ILI data, including ILI activity levels, should beinterpreted with extreme caution. It is particularly important at this time to evaluate syndromic surveillance data,including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate pictureof both in!uenza and COVID-19 activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVIDData Tracker Weekly Review (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html).ILINetNationwide during week 9, 0.8% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. This percentage is below thenational baseline of 2.6%.

All regions reported percentages of outpatient visits for ILI belowtheir region-speci#c baselines.3/14/21, 7:37 AMWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report | CDC
Page 9 of 16https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/ILI Visits by Age GroupAbout 65% of ILINet providers provide both the number of patient visits for ILI and the total number of patient visits forthe week broken out by age group. Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patientvisits for ILI by age group. The percentages of visits for ILI reported in ILINet in week 9 remained stable (change of ≤0.1%)for all age groups (0–4 years, 5–24 years, 25–49 years, 50–64 years, and 65 years and older) compared with week 8.However, during the past eight weeks there has been a slightly increasing trend among persons aged 0-4 years while theremaining age groups (5–24 years, 25–49 years, 50–64 years, and 65 years and older) have experienced a decreasingtrend.

This is much lower thanaverage for this point in the season and lower than rates for any season since routine data collection began in 2005,including the low severity 2011-12 season. The current rate is about one-third the rate seen at this time during the 2011-12 season.

Prior to week 4 (the week ending January 30, 2021), the percentages of deaths due toPIC were higher among manually coded records than more rapidly available machine coded records. Improvements havebeen made to the machine coding process that allow for more COVID-19 related deaths to be machine coded, and goingforward, the percentage of PIC deaths among machine coded and manually coded data are expected to be more similar.The data presented are preliminary and expected to change as more data are received and processed, but the amount ofchange in the percentage of deaths due to PIC should be lower going forward. Weeks for which the largest changes in thepercentage of deaths due to PIC may occur are highlighted in gray in the #gure below and should be interpreted withcaution.
