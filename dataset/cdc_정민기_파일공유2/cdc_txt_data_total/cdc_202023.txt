2019-2020 Inﬂuenza Season Week 23, ending June 6, 2020All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detaileddescriptions of each data component is available on the surveillance methods page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillancecomponent are available on FluView Interactive.U.S. Virologic Surveillance:Clinical LaboratoriesData from clinical laboratories (the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for inﬂuenza) areused to monitor whether inﬂuenza activity is increasing or decreasing.

This percentage is belowthe national baseline of 2.4%.Note: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, new data sources will be incorporated into ILINet as wemove into summer weeks when lower levels of inﬂuenza and other respiratory virus circulation aretypical. Starting in week 21, increases in the number of patient visits will be seen as new sites areenrolled and the percentage of visits for ILI may change in comparison to previous weeks. While allregions remain below baseline levels for ILI, these system changes should be kept in mind whendrawing conclusions from these data. Any changes in ILI due to changes in respiratory viruscirculation will be highlighted here.

Percentages of deaths due to pneumonia andinﬂuenza (P&I) are higher among manually coded records than more rapidly available machine codedrecords. Due to the additional time needed for manual coding, the initially reported P&I percentagesmay increase as more data are received and processed and for week 23 this may push thepercentage of P&I deaths above the epidemic threshold.
