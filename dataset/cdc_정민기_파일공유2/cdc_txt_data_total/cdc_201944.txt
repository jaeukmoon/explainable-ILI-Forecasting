Inﬂuenza (Flu)Weekly U.S. Inﬂuenza Surveillance Report
Key Updates for Week 44, ending November 2, 2019According to this week’s FluView report, seasonal inﬂuenza activity in the United States remains low butAccording to this week’s FluView report, seasonal inﬂuenza activity in the United States remains low butis increasing.is increasing.Viruses
Clinical Lab3.2% of respiratory specimenstested by clinical laboratorieswere positive for inﬂuenzaviruses. This is higher than theprevious week.
Public Health LabNationally, A(H3N2) andB/Victoria viruses have beenmost common; however,A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses alsocirculated. The predominantvirus varies by region.
Virus CharacterizationData for this season will bereported when a suﬃcientnumber of viruses have beencharacterized. Viruscharacterization data throughSeptember 28 is available.Illness
Outpatient Illness: ILINet2.1% of visits to a health care provider were for inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI). ILI activity is higher than the previous weekbut remains below the national baseline of 2.4%.Outpatient Illness: ILI Activity Map
The majority of jurisdictions experienced minimal ILIactivity; however, Louisiana and Puerto Ricoexperienced high ILI activity and 9 states experiencedlow ILI activity.
Geographic Spread
The majority of jurisdictions reported sporadic or localactivity. Three states reported regional or widespreadactivity, and one state reported no activity.Severe Disease
HospitalizationsData for this season will beprovided when a suﬃcientnumber of hospitalizations havebeen reported.
P&I MortalityDue to technical issues, datafrom the NCHS mortalitysurveillance system are notavailable  this week.
Pediatric DeathsNo new inﬂuenza-associatedpediatric deaths occurring duringthe 2019-2020 season werereported to CDC this week. Thetotal for the season is 2.All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. An overview of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent, is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm. Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView InteractiveU.S. Virologic SurveillanceClinical LaboratoriesThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

Most ﬂu vaccinesprotect against 4 diﬀerent ﬂu viruses. Get vaccinated now.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulatinginﬂuenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new inﬂuenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionarychanges that continually occur in inﬂuenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of inﬂuenza virusesto antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PAendonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.Virus characterization data will be updated starting later this season when suﬃcient numbers of specimens have beentested.Outpatient Illness SurveillanceILINetNationwide during week 44, 2.1% of patient visits reported through the U.S. Outpatient Inﬂuenza-like Illness SurveillanceNetwork (ILINet) were due to inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI). This percentage is below the national baseline of 2.4%.
View Chart Data | View Full ScreenOn a regional level, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 1.2% to 3.8% during week 44. Region 6(Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas) and Region 7 (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska) reported apercentage of outpatient visits for ILI which is equal to their region-speciﬁc baselines. All other regions remained belowtheir region-speciﬁc baselines.ILI Activity MapData collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity* by state.During week 44, the following ILI activity levels were experienced:High – Puerto Rico and one state (Louisiana) (Louisiana)Low – nine states (Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Missouri, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia)Minimal – the U.S. Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, New York City, and 40 states (Alaska, Arizona, California,Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York,North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee,Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming)A Weekly Inﬂuenza Surveillance Report Prepared by the Inﬂuenza DivisionInﬂuenza-Like Illness (ILI) Activity Level Indicator Determined by Data Reported to ILINetprev Play Pause next4041424344weeks2019-20 Inﬂuenza Season Week 44 ending Nov 02, 2019
