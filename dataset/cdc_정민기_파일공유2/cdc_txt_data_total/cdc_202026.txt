Inﬂuenza (Flu) (/ﬂu/index.htm)Weekly U.S. Inﬂuenza Surveillance Report
Note:Note: CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVIDView(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview.html).
2019-2020 Inﬂuenza Season Week 26, ending June 27, 2020All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.A description of the CDC inﬂuenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each datacomponent is available on the surveillance methods (http://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm) page.Additional information on the current and previous inﬂuenza seasons for each surveillance component are available onFluView Interactive (https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/ﬂuviewinteractive.htm).U.S. Virologic Surveillance:(https://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281228772)Clinical LaboratoriesData from clinical laboratories (the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for inﬂuenza) are used to monitorwhether inﬂuenza activity is increasing or decreasing.

This percentage is below the national baseline of 2.4%.Note: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, new data sources will be incorporated into ILINet as we move into summerweeks when lower levels of inﬂuenza and other respiratory virus circulation are typical. Starting in week 21, increases in thenumber of patient visits will be seen as new sites are enrolled and the percentage of visits for ILI may change in comparisonto previous weeks. While all regions remain below baseline levels for ILI, these system changes should be kept in mind whendrawing conclusions from these data. Any changes in ILI due to changes in respiratory virus circulation will be highlightedhere.

This percentage is below the epidemic thresholdof 5.9% for week 26.Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually coded causes of death collectedfrom death certiﬁcates. Percentages of deaths due to pneumonia and inﬂuenza (P&I) are higher among manually codedrecords than more rapidly available machine coded records. Due to the additional time needed for manual coding, theinitially reported P&I percentages may increase as more data are received and processed and for week 26 this may push thepercentage of P&I deaths above the epidemic threshold.
