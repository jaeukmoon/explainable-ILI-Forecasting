Vaccination helps prevent infection and can alsoprevent serious outcomes in people who get vaccinated but still get sick with @u.CDC recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older get a @u vaccine annually. Now is a good time to getvaccinated.There are also prescription @u antiviral drugs that can be used to treat @u illness; those need to be started asearly as possible.U.S. Virologic Surveillance(https://www.cdc.gov/:u/weekly/overview.htm#LabSurveillance)Nationally, the percentage of specimens testing positive for in@uenza in clinical laboratories is increasing. Percentpositivity increased ≥ 0.5 percentage points this week in regions 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10. The majority of viruses detected sofar this season have been in@uenza A(H3N2), however during the past three week, approximately 26% of the subtypedin@uenza A viruses have been in@uenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.

Antigenic dioerencesbetween viruses are determined by comparing how well the antibodies made against the vaccine reference virusesrecognize the circulating viruses that have been grown in cell culture. Ferret antisera are useful because antibodies raisedagainst a particular virus can often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruseswith similar antigenic properties have antibody titer dioerences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared to thereference (vaccine) virus. In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer dioerencesof less than 8-fold.

Page 10 of 22https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2022-2023/week45.htm(https://www.cdc.gov/:u/weekly/overview.htm#ILINet)The U.S. Outpatient In@uenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for respiratory illnessreferred to as in@uenza-like illness [ILI (fever plus cough or sore throat)], not laboratory-consrmed in@uenza, and willtherefore capture respiratory illness visits due to infection with any pathogen that can present with similar symptoms,including in@uenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health care-seeking behaviors have changed,and people may be accessing the health care system in alternative settings not captured as a part of ILINet or at adioerent point in their illness than they might have before the pandemic. Therefore, it is important to evaluate syndromicsurveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete andaccurate picture of in@uenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in aweekly publication called COVID Data Tracker Weekly Review (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html). Information about other respiratory virus activity can be found on CDC’s National Respiratory andEnteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) website (https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/index.html).Outpatient Respiratory Illness VisitsNationwide during week 45, 5.8% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that includedfever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. This is above the national baseline of 2.5%. All 10 HHS regionsare above their respective baselines.
