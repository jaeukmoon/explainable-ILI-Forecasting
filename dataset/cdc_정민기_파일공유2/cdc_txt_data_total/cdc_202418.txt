Key Points Seasonal influenza activity continues to decline nationally and in most areas of the country. Nationally, outpatient respiratory illness remained stable and is below baseline for the fifth week in a row.1 All 10 HHS regions are below their region-specific baselines. During Week 18, of the 109 viruses reported by public health laboratories, 77 (70.6%) were influenza A and 32 (29.4%) were influenza B. Of the 54 influenza A viruses subtyped during Week 18, 25 (46.3%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 29 (53.7%) were A(H3N2). Six influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2023-2024 season were reported to CDC during Week 18, bringing the season total to 164 pediatric deaths. CDC estimates that there have been at least 34 million illnesses, 380,000 hospitalizations, and 24,000 deaths from flu so far this season. CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine as long as flu activity continues.2 There also are prescription flu antiviral drugs that can treat flu illness; those should be started as early as possible and are especially important for higher risk patients.3 Flu viruses are among several viruses contributing to respiratory disease activity. CDC is providing updated, integrated information about COVID-19, flu, and RSV activity on a weekly basis. U.S. Virologic Surveillance Nationally, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories decreased (change of >0.5 percentage points) compared to the previous week. Regions 3, 5, 7, and 10 decreased in percent positivity while regions 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 remained stable during Week 18 compared to Week 17. The regions with the highest percent positivity were regions 1 (4.9%), 7 (4.4%), and 9 (3.9%). Nationally, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Victoria viruses are all co-circulating. However, the distribution of circulating viruses varies by region. For regional and state level data and age group distribution, please visit FluView Interactive. Viruses known to be associated with recent receipt of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or found upon further testing to be a vaccine virus are not included, as they are not circulating influenza viruses. Clinical Laboratories The results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below. Data from clinical laboratories (the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for influenza virus) are used to monitor whether influenza activity is increasing or decreasing. results of tests from Clinical Laboratories Week 18 Data Cumulative since October 1, 2023 (Week 40) No. of specimens tested 46,245 3,117,205 No. of positive specimens (%) 1,426 (3.1%) 340,899 (10.9%) Positive specimens by type Influenza A 839 (58.8%) 235,659 (69.1%) Influenza B 587 (41.2%) 105,229 (30.9%) View Chart Data | View Full Screen Public Health Laboratories The results of tests performed by public health laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating influenza viruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current influenza vaccines. The data are also used to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur in influenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir. CDC has genetically characterized 4,257 influenza viruses collected since October 1, 2023.

Antigenic differences between viruses are determined by comparing how well the antibodies made against the vaccine reference viruses recognize the circulating viruses that have been grown in cell culture. Ferret antisera are useful because antibodies raised against a particular virus can often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody titer differences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared to the reference (vaccine) virus. In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer differences of less than or equal to 8-fold. Viruses selected for antigenic characterization are a subset representing the genetic changes in the surface proteins seen in genetically characterized viruses. Influenza A Viruses A (H1N1)pdm09: 364 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized by HI, and all were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/67/2022-like reference viruses representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. A (H3N2): 349 A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by HI or HINT, and 342 (98.0%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer in HI or reacting at titers that were less than or equal to 8-fold of the homologous virus in HINT) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021-like reference viruses representing the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. Influenza B Viruses B/Victoria: 264 influenza B/Victoria-lineage virus were antigenically characterized by HI, and all were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown B/Austria/1359417/2021-like reference viruses representing the B/Victoria component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. B/Yamagata: No influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were available for antigenic characterization. Assessment of Virus Susceptibility to Antiviral Medications CDC assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to the antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using next generation sequence analysis supplemented by laboratory assays. Information about antiviral susceptibility test methods can be found at U.S. Influenza Surveillance: Purpose and Methods | CDC. Viruses collected in the U.S. since October 1, 2023, were tested for antiviral susceptibility as follows: Viruses collected in the U.S. tested for antiviral susceptibility Antiviral Medication Total Viruses A/H1 A/H3 B/Victoria Neuraminidase Inhibitors Oseltamivir Viruses Tested 4,261 1,642 1,432 1,187 Reduced Inhibition 1 (0.02%) 1 (0.1%) 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 2 (0.05%) 2 (0.1%) 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) Peramivir Viruses Tested 4,261 1,642 1,432 1,187 Reduced Inhibition 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 2 (0.05%) 2 (0.1%) 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) Zanamivir Viruses Tested 4,261 1,642 1,432 1,187 Reduced Inhibition 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) 0 (0.00%) PA Cap-Dependent Endonuclease Inhibitor Baloxavir Viruses Tested 4,139 1,589 1,394 1,156 Decreased Susceptibility 1 (0.02%) 0 (0.0%) 1 (0.1%) 0 (0.0%) Two A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses had NA-H275Y amino acid substitution conferring highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir. One (H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-I223V and NA-S247N amino acid substitutions and showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. One A(H3N2) virus had PA-I38T amino acid substitution and showed reduced susceptibility to baloxavir. High levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) viruses (the adamantanes are not effective against influenza B viruses). Therefore, use of these antivirals for treatment and prevention of influenza A virus infection is not recommended and data from adamantane resistance testing are not presented. Outpatient Respiratory Illness Surveillance The U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness [ILI (fever plus cough or sore throat)], not laboratory-confirmed influenza and will therefore capture respiratory illness visits due to infection with pathogens that can present with similar symptoms, including influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. It is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a more complete and accurate picture of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. CDC is providing integrated information about COVID-19, influenza, and RSV activity on a website that is updated weekly. Information about other respiratory virus activity can be found on CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) website. Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits Nationally, during Week 18, 2.1% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. This has remained stable (change of ≤ 0.1 percentage points) since Week 17 and is below the national baseline. The percentage of visits for ILI decreased in regions 5 and 7 and remained stable in all other regions in Week 18 compared to Week 17. All 10 regions are below their respective baselines. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varies by location. * Effective October 3, 2021 (week 40), the ILI definition (fever plus cough or sore throat) no longer includes “without a known cause other than influenza.” View Chart Data (current season only) | View Full Screen Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits by Age Group About 70% of ILINet participants provide both the number of patient visits for respiratory illness and the total number of patient visits for the week broken out by age group. Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patient visits for respiratory illness by age group. The percentage of visits for respiratory illness reported in ILINet remained stable in all age groups in Week 18 compared to Week 17.

Additional information about medically attended visits for ILI for current and past seasons: Surveillance Methods | FluView Interactive: National, Regional, and State Data or ILI Activity Map Hospitalization Surveillance FluSurv-NET The Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in select counties in 14 states and represents approximately 9% of the U.S. population. FluSurv-NET hospitalization data are preliminary. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly. A total of 24,547 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites between October 1, 2023, and May 4, 2024. The weekly hospitalization rate observed in Week 18 was 0.3 per 100,000 population The weekly hospitalization rate observed during Week 52 is tied with the 2014-2015 season for the second highest peak weekly rate observed during all seasons going back to 2010-2011, and only lower than the 2017-2018 season. The overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 80.3 per 100,000 population. This cumulative hospitalization rate is the second highest cumulative hospitalization rate when compared against previous end-of-season rates for Week 18, and it is the second highest cumulative in-season hospitalization rate observed in Week 18, following the 2017-2018 season (106.7). Cumulative in-season hospitalization rates observed in Week 18, from 2010-2011 through 2022-2023 (excluding the 2017-2018 season) ranged from 0.8 to 69.4. When examining rates by age, the highest cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population was among adults aged 65 years and older (219.8) followed by adults aged 50-64 years (95.2) and children aged 0-4 years (82.6). When examining age-adjusted rates by race and ethnicity, the highest rate of hospitalization per 100,000 population was among non-Hispanic Black persons (146.1), followed by non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons (110.9), Hispanic persons (76.0), non-Hispanic White persons (62.1), and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander persons (43.3). Among 24,547 hospitalizations, 20,782 (84.7%) were associated with influenza A virus, 3,588 (14.6%) with influenza B virus, 48 (0.2%) with influenza A virus and influenza B virus co-infection, and 125 (0.5%) with influenza virus for which the type was not determined. Among those with influenza A subtype information, 3,551 (69.4%) were A(H1N1) pdm09 and 1,566 (30.6%) were A(H3N2). Among 3,689 hospitalized adults with information on underlying medical conditions, 95.4% had at least one reported underlying medical condition, the most commonly reported were hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and metabolic disease. Among 1,553 hospitalized women of childbearing age (15-49 years) with information on pregnancy status, 22.7% were pregnant. Among 1,049 hospitalized children with information on underlying medical conditions, 67.9% had at least one reported underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported was asthma, followed by obesity and neurologic disease.
