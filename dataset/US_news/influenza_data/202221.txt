For instance, influenza A virus subtypes oscillate and peak during winter seasons of the world’s temperate climate zones. Alternation of dominant strains in successive influenza seasons makes epidemic forecasting a major challenge. From the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic we enrolled influenza A virus infected patients (n = 2980) in a global prospective clinical study. Complete hemagglutinin sequences were obtained from 1078 A/H1N1 and 1033 A/H3N2 viruses. We used phylodynamics to construct high resolution spatio-temporal phylogenetic hemagglutinin trees and estimated global influenza A effective reproductive numbers (R) over time (2009–2013). We demonstrate that R oscillates around R = 1 with a clear opposed alternation pattern between phases of the A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 subtypes. Moreover, we find a similar alternation pattern for the number of global viral spread between the sampled geographical locations. Both observations suggest a between-strain competition for susceptible hosts on a global level. Extrinsic factors that affect person-to-person transmission are a major driver of influenza seasonality. The data presented here indicate that cross-reactive host immunity is also a key intrinsic driver of influenza seasonality, which determines the influenza A virus strain at the onset of each epidemic season.

For influenza virus such patterns have been studied extensively3,4,5. In the world’s temperate climate zones influenza activity oscillates and synchronizes with winter periods, while in tropical regions activity appears to be year-around or split into different seasons4. They have been attributed largely to ‘extrinsic’ factors driving efficient virus spread6, like air humidity variations7, seasonal influences on host susceptibility8, and societal structure and behavioural patterns9. However, several other mechanisms focussed on host and population immunity have been proposed that explain the seasonality of viruses. Firstly, during an epidemic or pandemic season the viral spread of a specific viral subtype will increase up to a point when herd immunity will prevent further transmission. The loss of specific immunity within a population can lead to a large peak of infections, as was seen for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children after an almost absent RSV-season due to the restrictions of the COVID19-pandemic10,11. Apart from subtype specific immunity, Susceptible–Infection–Recovery epidemiological modelling predicted that also cross-reactive immunity plays a role in seasonality of viruses. These models postulate that the presence of a short-term cross-reactive host immune-phenomenon could explain a temporary reduction in host susceptibility to other viruses and cause seasonal infection patterns at a population level12,13. Thirdly, in recent years mathematical simulations that mimic virus dynamics suggest the existence of virus-virus interactions. These interactions show that the rise in incidence of infections caused by one virus directly influences the amount of other virus infections at both population as well as individual host level. This phenomenon was also found in clinical cohort where they found that the presence of rhinovirus interfered with the presence of Influenza A virus in patients14,15. This direct interaction between viruses caused one virus to block the other and thereby affect the seasonality of viruses.All of these ‘intrinsic’ factors may also be attributed to other aspects of influenza epidemiology, like the replacement of a seasonal strain by a pandemic virus. This occurred for the last time during the 2009 influenza pandemic when the seasonal A/H1N1 was replaced by the pandemic A/H1N1 virus. Interestingly, like the other known pandemics this virus did not spread in winter, but during the 2009 northern hemisphere summer16.To date, the newly introduced pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 virus continues to co-circulate with the A/H3N2 subtype causing seasonal epidemics in humans. Both influenza A viruses are under intense selective pressure by the host immune system and they continuously evolve to persist in humans. Viruses escape from pre-existing immunity through mutation at antigenic sites at the globular head of the hemagglutinin (HA). This is a major virus surface glycoprotein and primary target of host neutralizing antibodies. Continual viral presence in the population on the other hand results in a ‘landscape of immunity’12, which new ‘antigenic drift’ viruses need to overcome to fuel new epidemics. A typical phylogenetic tree of HA is shaped, as a result of this cat-and-mouse game, into a single trunk tree with short-lived branches17 (Fig. 1).Figure 1Spatio-temporal resolved phylogenies reveal intrinsic evolutionary influenza dynamics. Influenza hemagglutinin tree inferred by birth–death skyline phylodynamic modelling using 1078 (A/H1N1) (A) and 1033 (A/H3N2) (B) complete gene sequences. Distribution of average trunk-to-tips branch lengths of A/H1N1 (C) and A/H3N2 (D) phylogenetic trees.Full size imageVirus strains that are antigenically similar cluster along the trunk of the tree with only a limited number of amino acid positions involved in the jump from an existing into a new antigenic cluster18. These positions were previously identified with data obtained from the hemagglutination inhibition assay, a serological test to assess neutralizing antibody responses to HA.Besides these long-lived and predominantly strain-specific antibody-mediated immune responses, a shorter-lived, non-specific component has been proposed in particular to explain the limited virus genealogical diversity (single trunk) and lifespan (short-lived branches) of the vast majority of circulating dead-end virus lineages12. Evidence for such component has first come from in vitro and animal studies showing that pre-infection with one subtype induces partial cross-protection from infection with another subtype19. Observational studies addressing the potential role of cross-reactive immunity in global influenza seasonality has so far failed to show a clear pattern20,21. However, recent and marked observations to support a major role of cross-immunity were related to the fast disappearance of the A/H1N1 subtype from 1977, shortly after the introduction of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus in 2009, while the A/H3N2 subtype managed to continue its circulation13. Another example was seen in the winter of 2018–2019 where in a matter of weeks A/H1N1 dominance was almost completely replaced by A/H3N2 dominance22.ResultsIn search for the existence of such component we first followed a phylodynamic approach to jointly resolve spatio-temporal phylogenetic HA trees of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 subtypes and to infer underlying host population dynamics23,24 (Fig. 1; Tables S1 and S2). The dataset used here had been collected globally during the first 5 years after the onset of the 2009 influenza pandemic. It enrolled patients year-around (> 1 year of age), the vast majority (> 97%) with uncomplicated and PCR-confirmed influenza, who had been admitted—within 48 h after symptom onset—to primary care centres and hospitals in Asia (Hong Kong; n = 6), Europe (n = 37), the US (n = 36) and the Pacific (Australia; n = 8) (Fig. S1). From these samples 2111 influenza A viruses were isolated, which allowed us to obtain complete HA sequences from 1078 A/H1N1 and 1033 A/H3N2 viruses. The extent of sampling, directly after the pandemic outbreak, in combination with an unprecedented resolution regarding quality-controlled Sanger sequencing, resulted in a high-resolution dataset. This offered us an unique window of opportunity to study the dynamics of the estimated effective reproductive number R over time (R-skylines). R is a parameter of host immunity25, and is computed here as the rate at which an infected individual gives rise to a new infection in a defined period of time.We observed that R-skylines estimated from the A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 trees showed alternate phases of increasing and declining R, with R < 1 and R > 1 respectively (Fig. 3). There was a significant negative correlation between phases (Pearson’s ρ = − 0.511, P = 3.0e−07; D = 0.202, P = 0.052) with an average endogenous oscillation period estimated to be approximately 1.67 ± 0.01 years for A/H1N1 and 1.13 ± 0.02 years for A/H3N26 as computer by periodograms (Fig. S4). Of note, these periods were similar to the average lifespan of the dead-end virus lineages on the HA trees (1.7 ± 0.4 for A/H1N1 and 2.2 ± 0.5 for A/H3N2) (Fig. 1).Given the finite nature of susceptible hosts, virus persistence relies on the availability of new susceptible ones, which forces viruses to migrate between geographical locations26. The interplay between antigenic drift and pre-existing immunity may then determine the outcome of the competition between these viruses at the onset of each influenza season27. As the observed pattern of R-skylines indicates that a relatively short-lived cross-reactive immunity component drives subtype competition at the host scale, we wondered whether this competition also could determine the dynamics of global viral spread.To build on existing global viral spread data and to study its patterns for the A/H1N1 virus after 2009 we expanded our dataset with complete HA sequences deposited in the IRD from viruses isolated prior to (2008–2009) and after (2013–2015) our study period (Dataset S1). We then inferred the number of geographical location changes at each internal node of these trees to identify all virus movements from one geographical location (source) to another location (sink). Again, and similar to the R-skylines, influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viral spread alternated globally within our study period (Fig. 4). Global influenza A/H1N1 viral spread dominated in the first half of the study period, while A/H3N2 viral spread were more prevalent between 2012 and 2013. The observation of oscillation between influenza A/H1N1 and influenza A/H3N2 throughout the study period supports the evidence that inter-subtype competition presented here exists on both the population and individual host level, contributes to influenza seasonality and may determine the virus subtype that will dominate in a given influenza season.Finally, previous work on global circulation had shown that East and South-East Asia (E-SEA) played a pivotal role in global dissemination of A/H3N2 viruses. Here, A/H3N2 virus activity was found year-round (between 2000 and 2012), from where new antigenic drift variants fuelled in the temperate climate zone epidemics9. In contrast, E-SEA did not seem to have a major role in the dissemination of pre-pandemic A/H1N1 viruses9. To study global virus spread after 2009 we constructed the networks of viral spread trajectories between the sampled geographical locations using measures of connectivity (Fig. S2) in a one-year time window (Figs. 2 and 4) and found that, in contrast to the pre-pandemic period9, E-SEA was equally important for the dissemination of both influenza A viruses. Within our dataset we examined the distribution of migration events between different locations and counted the amount of location switches on the tree. We counted 56 A/H1N1 and 58 A/H3N2 dissemination events from E-SEA to the other sampled regions in the world (Fig. S3). In addition, global viral spread patterns showed a similar degree of global network complexity (Fig. S2, max. graph density/diameter of 1.08/12.09 for A/H1N1 and 1.16/10.64 for A/H3N2) and similar patterns of virus circulation across the sampled geographic regions (Fig. S2, max. number of islands and graph reciprocity of 2 and 0.75 for A/H1N1 and 2 and 0.86 for A/H3N2).Figure 2Network reconstruction of viral spread between the sampled geographic locations show increased spread of influenza A/H1N1 (bottom row) compared with influenza A/H3N2 (top row) between 2009–2011, followed by an opposite trajectory between 2011–2013. Inferred viral spread networks between geographic locations are depicted between centers located in Asia (red), Europe (orange), North America (blue) and Pacific (purple). Viral spread events during a 1-year time window were pooled and numbers were shown on the arrows. The diameter of the nodes is proportional to the number of sink viral spread events, while the arrow width is proportional to the number of source spread events. The Quade test and correspondent post-hoc procedures were applied to test significant differences between spread trends and preferred viral spread trajectories are presented at the top. Significance level was set to 0.05.Full size imageDiscussionExtrinsic factors probably play a role in forcing influenza epidemics into the winter seasons in the global temperate climate zones3,4,5,7. The oscillating and alternating pattern of the global skylines of R we present here are consistent with the notion that cross-reactive host immunity is an important intrinsic driver of influenza seasonal patterns (Fig. 3).Figure 3Oscillation of reproductive number R-skylines estimated from influenza A virus phylogenies with opposed alternation of phases between subtypes. Time-series (2009–2013) for influenza A/H1N1 (blue, n = 1078) and A/H3N2 (red, n = 1033) viruses. Pre-pandemic period is indicated with dashed lines. Shaded regions represent 95% Highest Posterior Density interval.Full size imageGlobal influenza dissemination dynamics also reveals alternation of global virus spread and complexity of viral spread trajectories between subtypes with two phases (Figs. 2 and 4). In the first phase (2009–2011) we observe that these parameters are high for the A/H1N1 and low for the A/H3N2 subtype (Figs. 2 and 4). This pattern is reversed during the second phase (2011–2013). These parameters are indicators of virus persistence and depend, therefore, on the availability of susceptible hosts within a defined geographical location26. This implies that an intrinsic correlation exists between change of cross-reactive host immunity landscapes and global viral spread. In the Netherlands patterns and duration for influenza epidemic periods similar to our results were previously found by were previously found. Additionally, statistical regression techniques showed that depletion of susceptible hosts was the most important factor in determining transmission of influenza virus during these epidemic28 as well as in seasonal corona outbreaks29. Seasonal patterns are also described between influenza virus and other respiratory viruses. In mathematical models that studied the co-circulation of seasonal influenza A virus and non-influenza respiratory viruses, a short-term protection of one virus on the other induced seasonal patterns15,21. Furthermore, in a clinical study, the presence of rhinovirus protected patients against infection with influenza A virus14. Taking into account the strong cross-reactive immune responses previously observed between the seasonal and pandemic A/H1N1 virus subtypes, cross-reactive immunity may well have forced the 2009 pandemic into the northern hemisphere summer and mitigated the disease burden associated with this virus16,30,31.Figure 4Opposed alternation of influenza A virus viral spread events. Total number of viral spread events between different geographical locations of influenza A/H1N1 (blue, n = 190) and A/H3N2 (red, n = 146) viruses were pooled by 1-year intervals from the start of the 2009 pandemic. Viral spread counts were performed by traversing the fully-spatiotemporal-resolved phylogenetic trees in post-order.Full size imageA great deal of the current understandings about influenza antigenic drift is based on data generated by the hemagglutination inhibition serological test. This assay is largely dependent on serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) content32, but it does not account for other immunity components of the immune system. The observed short endogenous oscillation periods observed (1.7 years for A/H1N and 1.1 years for A/H3N2) suggest that this is most likely the result of short-lived inter-subtypic immune responses rather than systemic antibody-mediated immunity from which major antigenic drift variants arise every few years (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4)9,12,18. T-cells have been suggested as key players in mediating inter-subtypic immunity through several mechanisms, including direct cytolytic activity and interactions with B cells30,31. Inter-subtypic short-lasting immune responses likely also exist for other viruses. Seasonal coronaviruses induce a short-lasting immunity of 12 months in individuals29,33. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD4+ T cells were found in healthy SARS-CoV-2 seronegative individuals, most likely due to cross-reactive T cells that stemmed from previous infections with endemic seasonal coronaviruses34.Finally, secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA), the most abundant antibody isotype, is an interesting candidate meeting all criteria: IgA mediated-immunity is relatively short-lived35, is (partially) cross-reactive36, and thought to be the main driver of upper respiratory tract mucosal immunity against influenza37. Moreover, intramuscular administration of IgA, and not IgG, prevented airborne virus transmission in the ferret and guinea pig model32, indicating that cross-reactive IgA levels may directly impact person-to-person spread of the virus38. Cross-reactive immunity to different influenza subtypes can be the result of antibodies that are able to bind to the highly conserved stalk of the HA protein. These antibodies get produced most upon sequential exposition to diverse HA subtypes39 and in this, IgA has a more potent neutralizing effect against influenza than IgG40. Further studies elucidating the contribution of host immunity to seasonality of influenza and other multi-strain viruses, such as the coronavirus, paramyxoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus are warranted41. This would further support the establishment and exploitation of global virus and bio-banks42, which will lead to a better understanding of the contribution of host immunity landscapes to the dynamic epidemiological circulation patterns of (multi-strain) pathogens.Methods and materialsStudy conductIRIS (NCT00884117) is a prospective, multicentre, global observational study offering unprecedented resolution with regard to quality-controlled Sanger sequencing43,44. This report summarizes the results from 87 centers in, Australia (n = 8), China (Hong Kong, n = 6), Europe (n = 37; France, Germany, Norway) and the United States (n = 36) from December 2008 to March 2013, comprising five Northern and four Southern Hemisphere seasons, and including the 2009–2010 pandemic. Centers were selected to achieve the widest geographic coverage possible within each country (Fig. S1).Patient selectionAdults and children aged ≥ 1 year were included year-round (n = 2980; excluding 21 patients (1%) with mixed influenza A and B virus infections) in the study if they were influenza-positive by rapid test (QuickVue Influenza A + B Test; Quidel Corp) at presentation and/or had predefined clinical signs and symptoms of influenza for ≤ 48 h for hospitalized patients (no time limit for hospitalized children). The vast majority (> 97%) had uncomplicated influenza.Ethics approvalThe study was performed in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, and in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. Independent ethics committees and institutional review boards at each centre approved the study protocol and amendments. All patients or legal guardians provided written informed consent at the time of enrollment.Virus identificationThroat and posterior nasal swab specimens were obtained on day 1, 3, 6 and 10 and shipped on dry ice to a central laboratory for analysis (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). Influenza A subtypes were identified using semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)45. Day 1 samples with cycle threshold (Ct) values of < 32 were cultured on Madin–Darby canine kidney cells. Virus-containing supernatants were cleared from cell debris by centrifugation (10 min at 1000×g) and stored at − 80 °C until further processing. For this study, A/H1N1 (n = 1078) and A/H3N2 (n = 1033) virus isolates were included, which were obtained upon patient admission (day 1).Datasets and nucleotide sequence accession numbersSanger sequencing of hemagglutinin (HA) genes was done for all isolated viruses. Complete HA sequences were obtained from influenza A/H3N2 (n = 1033) and A/H1N1 (n = 1078) subtypes. These sequences and metafile data are provided in the Supplementary Information. To build on existing data on global influenza viral spread we expanded the IRIS dataset with all available complete HA and Neuraminidase sequences from the NIAID Influenza Research Database (IRD) collected between 2008–2009 and 2013–2015 in countries included in the IRIS study46. Numbers of additional HA sequences were 443 for A/H1N1 and 462 for A/H3N2 respectively. The complete list of IRD sequences is provided (Dataset S1).Data pre-processing and alignmentsEach expanded dataset was aligned using ProGraphMSA using default parameters47. Sequences were renamed to include sampled geographical locations, sampling dates (continuous values) and corresponding influenza season (when available).Phylodynamics inferenceThe birth death serial skyline (BDSKY) phylodynamics model implemented in BEAST v.2.3.1 was applied to the IRIS and expanded datasets to infer spatio-temporal resolved phylogenies and epidemiological parameters23,26,48. Phylogenetic trees were estimated under the general-time-reversible model (GTR+) with Γ-distribution to model among-site rate variation49 (Fig. 1). A molecular clock rate prior was set to follow an uncorrelated log-normal distribution50. Internal node calibration was performed using tip sampling dates51. The BDSKY-model was set with the following parameter: the sampling rate prior for the influenza infected populationhe real sampled population followed a Beta (1, 999) distribution; the prior probability of sampling an individual upon becoming non-infectious followed a LogNorm (4.5, 1.0) distribution. In addition, tree dating was performed using tip dates while an uncorrelated log-normal clock rate prior was applied to handle uncertainties in the sample collection dates. Finally, the analysis was run long enough to obtain a sufficient effective sample size ESS > 200 for all parameters. The converged parameters of the BDSKY-model are listed in Supporting Information Tables S1 and S2. To assess global model robustness, we performed two independent runs of each analysis (for a total of 20 runs). Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parameter convergences were diagnosed with Tracer 1.6. Thinning of BEAST2 output files (tree files and parameter files) was done using in-house bash scripts. After accurate MCMC trace monitoring, the first 10% of MCMC steps were discarded as burn-in resulting in around 6000 trees per each dataset. TreeAnnotator v2.3.1 was used to produce Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) trees23.Statistical analyses effective reproductive numberWe estimated the effective reproductive number R using phylodynamics modelling as described above. The estimates of R allowed us to study the dynamics of virus spread within the population52. Values R < 1 indicate a decline of infections, while R > 1 indicates that the infection has increased its spreading in a more susceptible population. The skyline of R is used here to picture the underlying dynamics ‘shaping’ a phylogenetic tree23,24,26. The univariate distributions of R values, estimated with independent sampling frequency from each dataset, were grouped and smoothed via interpolation to compensate for intermediate missing values. First, Wald–Wolfowiz, and Bartel Rank non-randomness tests were applied on each R median time-series as well as its permuted version53. The same test was then applied on the pairwise intersection of R median time-series, and the statistical support was evaluated by re-computing the test on permuted R median time-series. Secondly, the pairwise maximum difference between R median time-series was computed applying the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (KS-test). The two-sample KS-test was used to compare the cumulative distributions of two data sets54. The KS-test reports the maximum difference between two cumulative distributions (D) and it returns a P computing the KS statistics from all the possible permutation of the original data. The significance level was set at 0.001, so that two distinct R median time-series were considered to be drawn from different distributions when D ≥ 0.45. Next, the pairwise-correlation between R median estimates was evaluated by the Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient (\(\rho\)). Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient (\(\rho\)) was tested using the Fisher’s Z transform with 95% confidence interval and significance level set at 0.00555. Exploratory analyses on the R median time-series were applied to qualitatively identify oscillation periods and amplitude. The oscillation period of each R median time-series was then computed from the highest frequency value shown by the smoothed periodogram using the IRIS dataset. Statistical uncertainty on the inferred period was assessed from cumulative periodograms computed on 100 permutations of the original R median time-series. Finally, the overlap of HPD intervals of the pairwise R was computed for each R median time-series. The obtained value was then compared with the overlap of the HPD interval of R obtained with 100 permutations of the true HPD intervals.Viral spread routes and evolutionary ratesDatasets were partitioned according to the geographical sampling locations pooled by continent (North America, Europe, Asia, Pacific area). Viral spread rates were estimated using a discrete phylogeographic trait model with the Γ-distribution as substitution rate prior between geographical demes56. The influenza virus dissemination process was fitted to a discrete trait model using the Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection method, by inferring the most parsimonious description of the phylogeographic diffusion process57,58,59,60. Counts of viral spread events were quantified by traversing the fully spatio-temporal resolved phylogenetic trees in post-order and by counting the number of most probable Markov chain jumps along the branches of the posterior set of trees61,62.Branch geographical persistenceGeographical persistence was quantified by summing the phylogenetic branch lengths (measured in expected substitutions per site) grouped by their inferred geographical location on the phylogenetic tree trunk (inferred traversing the phylogenetic tree from ‘leaf-to-root’ and summing the number of branch traversals. The tree trunk was defined as the path on the phylogenetic tree that has been traversed more than 10 times. Number of seeding events was defined as the number of switches on the phylogenetic tree trunk per season.Viral spread graphsTrajectory networks were reconstructed per each strain variant, pooling viral spread events occurred within a one-year time window (Fig. 2). Trajectory complexity was computed estimating graph density, number of islands (nodes), diameter, and reciprocity63,64. In addition, geographical location connections were estimated by computing the graph centrality measures (specifically: degree centrality and betweenness centrality) (Figs. S2 and S3)65,66,67. The Quade and correspondent post-hoc procedures were applied to test whether viral spread trends were significantly different between strains and whether preferred viral spread trajectories were selected68. The significance level was set at 5%. Data availability Full-length HA sequences obtained as part of the IRIS study have been deposited in Genbank with the primary accession codes mentioned above.

By Katie Cadiao, County of San Diego Communications OfficeMay 25, 2022 | 11:42 AM Reading Time: 2 minutesAn 89-year-old North County woman is the seventh influenza death reported in the region this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today. The woman, who died May 9, had underlying medical conditions, had received a flu vaccination, and did not have COVID-19 when she died. Her death is the second influenza death recorded in the County during the month of May. Health officials note that deaths are uncommon this late in the season. “We are seeing a late spike of influenza cases in our region this season and it is not too late to get vaccinated against it,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “The same precautions we use for COVID-19 also help protect anyone who is at higher risk of complications from the flu.” The County also reported an additional 196 lab-confirmed influenza cases in the region last week, a slight increase compared to the prior week, when 176 cases were recorded. Although the flu vaccine is recommended for nearly everyone six months and older, it is especially recommended for people at higher risk of developing complications from the flu. They include: People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control Pregnant women People aged 65 years and older People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk The latest Influenza Watch Report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending May 21, 2022: Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 4% of all visits (compared with 4% the previous week). Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 196 (compared to 176 the previous week). Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 3,274 (compared to 823 at the same time last season and a 11,686 prior 5-year average during the same week). Influenza-related deaths reported to date: seven (compared to two last season). Tips to Prevent the Flu The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa. The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego. In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick: Wash hands thoroughly and often; Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands; Stay away from sick people; Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; Clean commonly touched surfaces; and If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others. During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

Its immunosuppressive action is closely linked to its binding of cyclophilin A (CypA), which widely distributed in different cell types. CsA also regulates the functions of innate immune cells, but the mechanism remains elusive. Here, we investigate the role of CsA in regulating macrophages polarization in influenza A virus-infected mice and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. CsA downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and upregulates anti-inflammatory cytokines expression. Mechanically, CsA decreases the polarization of macrophages into pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and increases the polarization of macrophages into anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Further studies show that CsA regulates macrophages polarization-associated IFN-γ/STAT1 and IL-4/STAT6 signaling pathways. Meanwhile, all these roles of CsA are eliminated when CypA is absent, suggesting that CsA regulates macrophages polarization and inflammatory responses depend on its binding to CypA. Collectively, these results reveal a crucial mechanism of CsA in attenuating IAV-induced inflammatory responses by a switch in macrophages polarization.IntroductionHistorically, influenza A virus is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection that can result in acute pneumonia, which has a high mortality rate during epidemics and especially during pandemics (1, 2). At the early stage of virus infection, IAV triggers the innate immune responses, recruits immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells) to lungs (3), and excess inflammatory cytokines are secreted from these activated cells, such as TNF-α, IL6, and IL1β, thereby leading to acute pneumonia (4, 5). Hence, maintaining inflammatory responses homeostasis is effective for the treatment of influenza virus-induced pneumonia.Cyclosproine A (CsA) is a cyclic 11-amino-acid peptide, which produced by the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum (6). It binds to cyclophilin A (CypA, encoded by PPIA) firstly, which is the major intracellular receptor for CsA, and then forms a ternary complex with calcineurin, leading to the inhibition of calcineurin and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), which negatively regulates the expression of T cell related cytokines, and thereby suppresses the activation of T cells (7). Additionally, as the prototypical inhibitor of CypA, CsA blocks the isomerase activity of CypA with relatively high affinity (8). CsA was firstly marketed in the mid-1980s. Based on its immunosuppressive activity, CsA was widely used in transplantation for organ transplant patients to reduce the risk of organ rejection and effective in alleviating autoimmune diseases, such as spontaneous urticarial (9), rheumatism (10) and systemic lupus erythematosus (11). In addition, substantial evidence shows that CsA is helpful to relieve acute inflammatory diseases, such as sepsis (12–14) and endotoxemia (15), due to its important role in regulating the functions of innate immune cells (such as monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils), vascular activity, the release of cytokines, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis (16). Additionally, CsA relieves IAV-induced immunopathological damage (17). However, how CsA regulate inflammatory responses remains less understood.Macrophages play vital roles in virus-triggered inflammatory responses. Upon IAV infection, activated macrophages polarize into M1 macrophages (classical activated macrophage) or M2 macrophages (alternatively activated macrophage) (18). M1 and M2 macrophages have distinct functions in the regulation of the inflammatory responses (19). M1 macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and play a role in virus clearance, but excess inflammation is harmful to the host (20). On the contrary, M2 macrophages inhibit excess inflammatory responses and promote tissue repair (20, 21). Although it has been reported that mesenchymal stem cells applied in combination with CsA may regulate the polarization of macrophages, thereby inhibiting the inflammatory responses in allogeneic skin transplantation model (22), the roles of CsA in influenza virus-induced macrophages polarization is still unknown.In the present study, we discover that CsA regulates IAV-induced macrophages polarization by targeting CypA and inhibits the inflammatory responses, indicating that CsA could be a potential drug for the therapy of virus-induced acute inflammatory responses and tissue damage.ResultsCsA Suppresses IAV-Triggered Inflammatory ResponsesIt has been documented that CsA reduces the immunopathological damage and facilitates the survival of IAV-infected mice (17). We further investigated the role of CsA in IAV-induced inflammatory responses in mouse lungs. An influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1)-infected mouse model was established (Figure 1A). Mice were injected intraperitoneally with CsA for 4 hours (h) before infected intranasally with IAV. The solution with 2% DMSO was as a negative control. The same treatment of CsA was administered at day 2 post infection. The mRNA and protein levels of pro-inflammation cytokines were determined firstly. CsA reduced the mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in mouse lungs (Figure 1B). Meanwhile, similar results were observed in the levels of these cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (Figure 1C). Then the effects of CsA on the pathogenicity of IAV-infected mice were investigated. After IAV infection, the lung indices (100× lung/body weight) of CsA-pretreated mice were lower than those of control mice (Figure 1D). Consistently, a slower weight loss of CsA-pretreated mice was observed compared with that of control mice (Figure 1E). In addition, CsA alleviated lung consolidation with less infiltrated inflammatory cells (Figure 1F). These results indicate that CsA inhibits IAV-induced inflammatory cytokines production and lung injury in vivo.FIGURE 1 Figure 1 Cyclosproine A (CsA) suppresses IAV-triggered inflammatory responses both in vivo and in vitro. (A) Mice were injected intraperitoneally with CsA (20 mg/kg/48 h) or DMSO for 4 hours (h) before infected intranasally with 5000 PFU of influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) (n = 5). The same treatment of CsA was administered at day 2 post infection. (B) Real-time PCR analysis of Tnfa, Il6, and Il1b mRNA in mouse lungs at various time points.

(G) Real-time PCR analysis of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines mRNA in BMDMs pretreated with CsA (5 μM) or DMSO for 2 h, followed by infection with IAV (multiplicity of infection [MOI] = 1) for various times. (H) Real-time PCR analysis of anti-inflammatory cytokines mRNA in BMDMs treated as described in (G). Data shown are representative of three independent experiments. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. ns, not significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 (unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test).Next, the role of CsA in IAV-induced inflammatory responses was examined in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from mice. The results of real-time PCR revealed that CsA inhibited the mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL6, IL1β, CCL2, and CXCL10 in IAV-infected BMDMs (Figure 1G). In contrast, the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL4 and TGF-β) was up-regulated in CsA-treated BMDMs upon IAV infection compared with that in DMSO-treated BMDMs (Figure 1H). Taken together, these results indicate that CsA suppresses IAV-triggered inflammatory responses both in vivo and in vitro.CsA Regulates Macrophages PolarizationUpon encountering different stimuli, macrophages polarize into M1 macrophages or M2 macrophages, which release a vastly different array of cytokines and chemokines that can either promote or inhibit inflammation (19, 23). We hypothesized that CsA might suppress IAV-triggered inflammatory responses by regulating macrophages polarization. Real-time PCR and western blotting assays were performed to investigate the expression of iNOS (a marker of M1 macrophages) and Arg1 (a marker of M2 macrophages) in IAV-infected BMDMs. As expected, CsA significantly reduced the production of iNOS and enhanced the production of Arg1 (Figures 2A, B). Similar effect of CsA on the mRNA and protein expression levels of iNOS and Arg1, as well as the mRNA expression levels of Tnfa and Tgfb1 were observed in IFN-γ-stimulated BMDMs (Figures 2C, D) and IL4-stimulated BMDMs (Figures 2E, F). These results indicate that CsA is able to regulate macrophages polarization. The flow cytometry was performed to further define the phonotype of BMDMs during IAV infection. As shown in Figure 2G, CsA downregulated the proportion of M1 macrophages and upregulated the proportion of M2 macrophages in IAV-infected BMDMs. Moreover, CsA inhibited IFN-γ-induced M1 polarization (Figure 2H) and promoted IL-4-induced M2 polarization in BMDMs (Figure 2I). These results suggest that CsA inhibits M1 polarization and promotes M2 polarization in BMDMs.FIGURE 2 Figure 2 CsA regulates macrophages polarization.

Data are representative of at least three independent experiments. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. ns, not significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 (unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test).To determine whether CsA regulated macrophages polarization in mice, the expression levels of iNOS and Arg-1 were further examined in lungs from IAV-infected mice. During IAV infection, the mRNA levels of iNOS (Figure 3A) were decreased while those of Arg-1 (Figure 3B) were upregulated in CsA-treated mice. In addition, the immunostaining assays were performed. After IAV infection, the F4/80+ and iNOS+ cells were significantly decreased in lungs of CsA-pretreated mice (Figure 3C). In contrast, the F4/80+ and Arg1+ cells were increased in lungs of CsA-pretreated mice (Figure 3D). Collectively, CsA regulates macrophages polarization in both cell and mouse models.FIGURE 3 Figure 3 CsA regulates macrophages polarization upon IAV infection in mice.

Data are presented as the mean ± SD. ns, not significant; *p < 0.05 (unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test).CsA Regulates Macrophages Polarization-Associated IFN-γ/STAT1 and IL4/STAT6 Signaling PathwaysIt is well established that the IFN-γ/STAT1 pathway is critical for M1 polarization and the IL4/STAT6 pathway is necessary for M2 polarization (24). Thus, we examined the effects of CsA on STAT1 and STAT6 phosphorylation upon IAV, IFN-γ, or IL4 stimulation. The immunoblotting results showed that CsA inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation and promoted STAT6 phosphorylation in IAV-infected BMDMs (Figure 4A). Furthermore, after stimulation with IFN-γ or IL4, the lower level of pSTAT1 and higher level of pSTAT6 were found in CsA-treated BMDMs (Figures 4B, C). Taken together, these results indicate that CsA regulates IFN-γ/STAT1 and IL4/STAT6 signaling pathways to influence macrophages polarization.FIGURE 4 Figure 4 CsA regulates IFN-γ/STAT1 and IL-4/STAT6 signaling pathways. (A) Western blotting analysis of the indicated proteins in BMDMs pretreated with CsA (5 μM) or DMSO for 2 h before infection with IAV (MOI = 1) for various times (left).

Data shown are the mean ± SD. ns, not significant; *p < 0.05; **p <0.01; ***p < 0.001 (unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test).CsA Regulates BMDMs Polarization by Targeting CypAIt is well known that CypA is the main intracellular receptor of CsA, and many biological roles of CypA can be suppressed by CsA (25, 26). Therefore, we further investigated whether CsA involvement on macrophages polarization requires CypA. When CypA is knocked out, iNOS expression was decreased and Arg-1 expression was increased in IAV-infected (Figures 5A, B) or cytokines-stimulated (Figures 5C, D) BMDMs. Similar results were also found when WT BMDMs were pretreated with CsA. At the same time, the effect of CsA was diminished in Ppia-knockout (Ppia-/-) BMDMs. Moreover, the results of flow cytometry showed that CypA deficiency or CsA treatment led to the decreased proportion of M1 and the increased proportion of M2 in IAV-infected (Figure 5E) or cytokines-stimulated (Figures 5F, G) BMDMs, and CsA had no influence on macrophages polarization in CypA-deficient BMDMs. We also investigated the effect of CypA on the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT6. The lower phosphorylation levels of STAT1 and higher phosphorylation levels of STAT6 were observed in Ppia-/- BMDMs and CsA-treated WT BMDMs compared with those in WT BMDMs after IAV infection. Meanwhile, CsA had no effect on the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT6 in CypA-deficient BMDMs (Supplementary Figure 1A). Similar results were observed in IFN-γ-stimulated BMDMs (Supplementary Figure 1B) and IL4-stimulated BMDMs (Supplementary Figure 1C). Collectively, CypA deficiency decreases the polarization of macrophages into pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and increases the polarization of macrophages into anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype just as CsA does and CsA regulates BMDMs polarization by targeting CypA to block its isomerase activity.FIGURE 5 Figure 5 CsA regulates the polarization of BMDMs by targeting CypA.

We used the influenza A/WSN/33 model described on Figure 1A (Figure 6A). The results of real-time PCR and ELISA assays revealed that the mRNA and protein levels of inflammatory cytokines in lungs of Ppia-/- mice or CsA-treated WT mice were lower than those in lungs of WT mice, and the effect of CsA was diminished in Ppia-/- mice (Figures 6B, C). The pathological indices also indicated that the effect of CypA deficiency was similar with that of CsA treatment, and CsA no longer attenuated the pathological injury in Ppia-/- mice (Figures 6D–F). Moreover, the effect of CypA deficiency on Nos2 and Arg1 transcriptional levels in mouse lungs were similar with that of CsA treatment, and CsA no longer had effect on Nos2 and Arg1 expression in Ppia-/- mice (Figure 6G), suggesting that CypA played an important role in regulating macrophages polarization. Taken together, these results indicate that CsA suppresses IAV-induced inflammatory responses by targeting CypA.FIGURE 6 Figure 6 CsA targeted CypA and inhibited IAV-induced inflammatory cytokines production and lung injury in mice.

Respiratory epithelial cells are the primary target cells for IAV infection, IAV also spreads to neighboring macrophages after replication in the lungs (30, 31). The IAV-infected macrophages rapidly activate and produce inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines recruit more immune cells into pulmonary tissues and cause tissue injury (32). Therefore, macrophages play a central role in the inflammatory responses during the early stage of IAV infection (33). It has been reported that the immunosuppressive drug CsA is helpful to relieve acute inflammatory diseases (16). In the present study, we discover that CsA targets CypA and inhibits STAT1-mediated M1 macrophages polarization and promotes STAT6-mediated M2 macrophages polarization (Figure 7), providing a mechanism of CsA in suppressing inflammatory responses and tissue injury.FIGURE 7 Figure 7 Model: CsA attenuates IAV-induced macrophages polarization and inflammatory responses by targeting CypA. CsA targets CypA to regulate IAV-triggered macrophages M1/M2 polarization by inhibiting STAT1 phosphorylation and promoting STAT6 phosphorylation, thereby suppressing inflammatory cytokines production and tissue injury.Based on the immunosuppressive effects on T lymphocytes, the early studies focus on solid organ transplantation and some autoimmune diseases (11, 34). However, the increasing evidence supports the role of CsA in regulating innate immune cells. CsA inhibits the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated macrophages (35), and suppresses the inflammatory responses of neutrophils upon phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), ionomycin, or IL-8 stimulation (36, 37). In some models, CsA inhibits the release of damage-associated molecular patterns and acts on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in acute inflammation (38). Here we show that CsA attenuates IAV-induced inflammatory responses by suppressing M1 macrophages polarization and promoting M2 macrophages polarization. This supports previously published data that the inhibition of M1 macrophages polarization results in reduced lung injury and mortality of mice (18, 39), which is one of the strategies for the treatment of inflammation-induced lung injury.A complex network of cytokines, signaling molecules, transcription factors, and epigenetic mechanisms underlies the macrophage polarization (40). The STAT signaling pathways are activated by IFNs or TLR4 to skew macrophage toward M1 phenotype (via STAT1), or by IL-4 or IL-13 to skew toward M2 phenotype (via STAT6) (41). We demonstrate that CsA is able to regulate the polarization of macrophages by IFN-γ/STAT1 and IL4/STAT6 signaling pathways. In addition, canonical NF-κB activation promotes M1 macrophages polarization (42) However, induction of p50 NF-κB homodimers inhibits STAT1 activity and promotes M2 macrophages polarization in vivo (43). Many host factors have been demonstrated to play variety of roles in macrophages polarization, such as the members of SOCS family. IL-4 and IFN-γ facilitate the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3, which in turn suppress the phosphorylation of STATs (44). We discover that CypA also takes part in regulating macrophages polarization. Whether other factors are involved in CsA-regulated macrophages polarization are unknown, which remains to be further studied.In this study, we observe that CypA deficiency and CsA treatment have similar effects on macrophages polarization and inflammatory responses, and CsA no longer has these effects when CypA is absent, suggesting that CsA plays these roles by targeting CypA. CypA plays important roles in pathogen infection and host immunity. CypA is an IAV inducible host factor that promotes the coinfection of IAV and group A Streptococcus (GAS) by positively regulating the expression of integrin α5 and actin rearrangement via the FAK/Akt signaling pathway. In contrast, CsA treatment significantly inhibited IAV-GAS coinfection by negatively regulating the FAK/Akt signaling pathway (26). In addition, CypA regulates the ubiquitination of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling (MAVS), promoting the production of type I interferon, thereby facilitating RIG-I-mediated antiviral, innate immune responses (45). How CypA regulate macrophages polarization and inflammatory responses is interesting and worthy of further study.In conclusion, this study reveals a previously unpublished mechanism of CsA in regulating IAV-induced acute inflammatory responses. CsA inhibits the polarization of M1 and facilitates M2 polarization upon IAV infection by targeting CypA, and thereby suppressing the production of inflammatory cytokines and tissue injury. These data expand the knowledge on the biological functions of CsA in the field of acute inflammatory responses and provide a mechanism of the phenomenon that the use of CsA alleviates inflammatory responses.Materials And MethodsMiceFemale C57BL/6 mice (6-8 weeks old, 18-22 g) were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal Center (Beijing, China). Ppia-knockout (Ppia-/-) 129 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and backcrossed for at least six generations to C57BL/6 mice. All of the animals were maintained in a barrier facility with free access to food and water.Cells and VirusesThe Madin–Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CRL-3216) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). MDCK cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Switzerland) and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37°C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. BMCs (bone marrow cells) were isolated from aseptically dissected and flushed tibias and femurs of 6-8 weeks old C57BL/6 mice. BMCs were differentiated into bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) for 5-7 days in 1640 medium (Gibco) with 10% (v/v) FBS, 20 ng/ml macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37°C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) was rescued from cDNA (46). Viruses were propagated in 9-day-old specific pathogen-free embryonic eggs or MDCK cells for 36–72 h at 37°C, then the allantoic fluid and supernatant was harvested, centrifuged, and stored at -80°C.Antibodies and CsAFor flow cytometry, F4/80-PE, CD80-Pacific Blue and CD206-APC antibodies were obtained from Thermo Fisher. For western blotting assays, the following antibodies were used: anti-pSTAT1 (1:1000, 9167S, CST), anti-STAT1 (1:500, sc-464, Santa Cruz), anti-pSTAT6 (1:1000, 56554S, CST), anti-STAT6 (1:1000, 5397S, CST), anti-GAPDH (1:2000, ab8245, Abcam). For immunostaining assays, the following antibodies were used: anti-F4/80 (1:100, 30325S, CST), anti-iNOS (1:100, 32027S, CST), anti-Arg1 (1:100, 93668S, CST). The CsA powder (S2286) was purchased from Selleck. For assays in vitro, the powder was dissolved with DMSO and 0.1% DMSO was the final concentration for cell culture. For assays in vivo, the powder was dissolved in a solution of 2% DMSO, 30% PEG300, and 5% Tween 80 in sterile ddH2O.Virus TitrationMDCK were inoculated with 10-fold serially diluted IAV and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 2 h. The supernatant was removed; cells were washed with PBS, and then overlaid with DMEM containing 0.6% low-melting-point agarose and 1 μg/mL L-(tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin. After incubation for 48-72 hour, the virus titers were determined by visible plaques.IAV Infection In VitroBMDMs were infected with IAV (MOI = 1) in DMEM containing 0.5 μg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin for 2 h. Subsequently, the supernatant was removed; cells were washed with PBS and overlaid with infection media (DMEM with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin). Cells were collected at indicated time for the subsequent real-time PCR, flow cytometry and western blotting.The Polarization of BMDMsBMDMs were polarized in 1640 medium containing IFN-γ (20 ng/mL) or IL4 (20 ng/mL), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin for indicated time, followed by collected and used for real-time PCR, flow cytometry and western blotting.IAV Infection In Vivo6–8 weeks old C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized and inoculated intranasally with IAV (5000 PFU) in 30 μL of PBS. After 1 or 3 day, the mice were sacrificed and the lungs were used in subsequent real-time PCR, lung index analysis, Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining and immunostaining assays. Mouse body weights were monitored.RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, and Real-Time PCRTotal RNA was extracted from BMDMs and lung tissue homogenate with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA was synthesized from 1-2 μg of total RNA using an oligo (dT) primer and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The expression of target genes was normalized to Gapdh.Western BlottingCells were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, 1% TritonX-100, 10% glycerin and protease or phosphatase inhibitors cocktail). The total protein was quantified by BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher) and the same mass of protein samples with 5×Loading buffer were loaded on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel, and then electroblotted onto a 0.45 μm PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked by TBST (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.0) with 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk and 1% (w/v) BSA for 1.5 h, followed by incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h and washed by TBST. Subsequently, the HRP conjugated specific secondary antibodies was used to bind target primary antibodies for 1 h. After washing by TBST, the target bands were visible by using the ECL western blotting substrate. The expression of target protein was normalized to GAPDH.Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent AssayBronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained from the lungs of mice by washing with 1 mL PBS and collected after centrifugation.

Vaccination of residents and professionals working in NH is the main prevention strategy. Despite recommendations, vaccination coverage among professionals is generally low.MethodsWe performed a nationwide cross-sectional survey of NH using a single-stage stratified random sampling design to estimate influenza vaccination coverage in NH healthcare workers (HCW) and non-medical professionals in France during the 2018–2019 season, and to identify measures likely to increase it. For each NH, a questionnaire was completed with aggregated data by one member of the management team. A multivariate analysis was performed using a negative binomial regression.ResultsFive-hundred and eighty nine NH filled in the study questionnaire (response rate: 49.5%). When considering all professionals (i.e., HCW and non-medical professionals), overall vaccination coverage was 30.6% (95%CI [28.2–33.0], range: 1.6–96.2). Overall influenza vaccination coverage in HCW was 31.9% [29.7–34.1]. It varied according to occupational category: 75.5% [69.3–81.7] for physicians, 42.9% [39.4–46.4] for nurses, 26.7% [24.5–29.0] for nursing assistants, and 34.0% [30.1–38.0] for other paramedical personnel. Vaccination coverage was higher i) in private nursing homes (RRa: 1.3, [1.1–1.5]), ii) in small nursing homes (0.9 [0.8–0.9]), iii) when vaccination was offered free of charge (1.4, [1.1–1.8]), iv) when vaccination promotion for professionals included individual (1.6 [1.1–2.1]) or collective (1.3 [1.1–1.5]) information sessions, videos or games (1.4 [1.2–1.6], v) when information on influenza vaccines was provided (1.2 [1.0–1.3], and finally, vi) when a vaccination point of contact—defined as an HCW who could provide reliable information on vaccination—was nominated within the nursing home (1.7 [1.3–2.2]).ConclusionsUrgent and innovative actions are required to increase coverage in HCW. Vaccination programmes should include free on-site vaccination and education campaigns, and particularly target nursing assistants. The results of this nationwide study provide keys for improving influenza vaccination coverage in HCW. Programmes should ensure that information on influenza vaccines is provided by a vaccination point of contact in NH using attractive media. Combining the different prevention measures proposed could increase coverage in NH nationwide by over 50%. Peer Review reports BackgroundHigh rates of morbidity and mortality continue to make influenza virus infection a major public health problem [1, 2]. Influenza is particularly dangerous for at-risk patients (persons aged over 64 years, and patients with chronic disease), especially in nursing homes (NH) [3, 4]. Despite high coverage among residents in NH, outbreaks still occur in particular due to the vaccination’s limited effectiveness in elderly people [4,5,6]. Insufficient coverage of healthcare workers (HCW) and other professionals in contact with NH residents can introduce the virus into NH and contribute to its dissemination among residents. Studies on the effectiveness of HCW vaccination in protecting residents are difficult to implement as several biases are involved and few of the studies conducted to date have demonstrated its effectiveness. While most results suggest a protective effect, the evidence is not very strong [7,8,9]. Annual seasonal influenza vaccination in France is recommended for all persons over 64 years old, NH residents, HCW and professionals in contact with NH residents. The objective for vaccine coverage of HCW and professionals in contact with patients at risk is 75% [10]. National estimates of vaccination uptake by HCW working in NH were low (33.6% (95% CI: 31.9–35.4) as assessed in a survey conducted in 2009 [11], reflecting findings in other industrialized countries despite recommendations [7].MethodsWe conducted a nationwide study during the 2018–2019 influenza season to provide updated data on NH HCW vaccination coverage in France, to identify determinants of vaccination status, and to indicate measures which appear to increase vaccination coverage in these settings.Study PopulationThe study population is HCW (physicians, nurses, nursing assistants, and other paramedical personnel) and non-medical professionals (administrative staff, cleaning staff and recreational staff) working in NH in France. All professionals are considered to be in contact with residents.Professionals (i.e., HCW and non-medical professionals) employed for less than three months and students (medical or nursing students) were not included in the study.The types of NH studied were medico-social institutions. Short-stay care facilities and retirement homes (i.e., with individual apartments) were not studied, as living conditions in these structures reflect those in the general community, where residents are less dependent and have fewer shared activities with other elderly persons.The study covered all 13 regions in metropolitan France and four overseas territories (the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean Sea, French Guiana in South America, and Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean). Mayotte Island, located in the Indian Ocean, was not included due to the absence of NH in the territory.Sample size and randomisationWe performed a cross-sectional survey of NH using a single-stage stratified random sampling design. The sampling frame was the list of NH recorded in France’s national medico-social and healthcare institution database (FINESS) as of January 2019. FINESS is managed by the Ministry of Health. A total of 7 819 NH were recorded.The required study sample size was calculated to ensure that estimates of influenza vaccination coverage could be made according to HCW occupation category (physicians, nurses and nursing assistants) at the national and regional levels with a precision of 5%. Considering an overall influenza vaccination coverage level of 36% (specifically 60% for physicians, 45% for nurses, 34% for nursing assistants, a design effect of 2 for nurses and nursing assistants and 1 for physicians, NH participation rate between 50 and 60%, and an α risk of 5%), we calculated that at least 80 NH needed to be solicited in each region. All NH in Corsica and in the four overseas territories were solicited, as the total number of NH in each of these areas was lower than the minimum 80.NH were stratified by size (< 80 beds vs. ≥ 80 beds) and geographical location (17 regions). Due to a small number of nursing homes in some strata, four strata were collapsed into two to ensure a minimum number of NH for analysis. A total of 34 strata were created.Overall, 1 189 NH were solicited to participate in the study (1 120 in metropolitan France, and 69 in the four overseas territories).Data collectionData collection was conducted from May to July 2019 using a questionnaire sent by e-mail or by letter (when e-mail not available). For each NH, only aggregated data were collected. The questionnaire was completed by a member of the management team: the coordinating doctor, the director, or the nursing coordinator. Data on NH administrative and structural characteristics were collected: status (public, private), location, size (number of beds), affiliation to a hospital, presence of a care coordinator (physician), presence of a nursing coordinator presence of an expert in NH hygiene, number of professionals (medical, paramedical and non-medical) according to occupational category during the study period. The number of professionals vaccinated against influenza during the 2018–2019 season, according to occupational category, were also collected.The following data on measures implemented to promote influenza vaccination for professionals during the 2018–2019 season within the NH were also collected: free on-site vaccination for professionals working in the NH, influenza vaccination promotion for professionals (use of posters, use of videos or games, organization of individual or collective information sessions, contents and type of information disseminated (e.g., influenza, flu vaccines, collective benefit of vaccination, individual benefit of vaccination), nomination of a point of contact for vaccination in the NH (defined as a HCW who could provide reliable information about vaccination, including for influenza), in-house analysis of structural barriers to vaccination and implementation of a vaccination action plan, existence of an in-house multidisciplinary group on vaccination, and finally, involvement of the NH director, the coordinating doctor or the nursing coordinator in the influenza vaccination campaign (if present). The questionnaire is available on line: https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/content/download/118881/1758582.Data were entered in a dedicated online questionnaire or were sent by regular mail or fax. Two reminders were sent to all non-respondents.Data analysisThe analysis was performed according to occupation category, classified into HCW (physicians, nurses, nursing assistants, and other paramedical personnel) and non-medical professionals (administrative staff, cleaning staff, educational and recreational staff). In order to assess the determinants of influenza vaccination coverage, and because of data aggregation and overdispersion, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses using a negative binomial regression. Considering the data, we dichotomized NH size into 1- 99 beds and ≥ 100 beds.All determinants with a p-value < 0.2 in the univariate analysis were introduced in the multivariate model. Risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals were used as measures of association. A p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Data analysis were performed using Stata 14.2® (StataCorp, Texas, USA). Specific sampling weights were calculated for each of the 34 strata created. All estimates were made using the “svy” command, which takes into account the sampling design and weights in all calculations (descriptive, confidence intervals, negative binomial regressions). The nursing home level effect was taken into account in analysis. Outcomes were given in percentages with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).ResultsParticipationOf the 1 189 NH invited to participate, 589 filled in the study questionnaire (response rate 49.5%) for the 2018–2019 influenza vaccination season. Thirty-one questionnaires were not included in the analysis, either because of insufficient quality of the reported data (n = 29) or because the NH or the region could not be identified (n = 2). The remaining 558 questionnaires (representing 524 NH in metropolitan France and 34 NH in the included overseas territories) constituted our study sample, reflecting 20 420 HCW (645 physicians, 3 506 nurses, 13 948 nursing assistants, 2 321 other paramedical personnel) and 10 938 non-medical professionals.Influenza vaccination coverage in HCW and non-medical professionalsWhen considering all professionals (i.e., HCW and non-medical professionals), overall influenza vaccination coverage was 30.6% (95%CI: [28.2–33.0], range: 1.6–96.2). Overall coverage in HCW was 31.9% [29.7–34.1] (Table 1). Specifically, coverage was 75.5% [69.3–81.7] for physicians, 42.9% [39.4–46.4] for nurses, 26.7% [24.5–29.0] for nursing assistants, and 34.0% [30.1–38.0] for other paramedical personnel. Overall coverage in non-medical professionals was 28.7% [25.1–32.3].Table 1 Influenza vaccination coverage in healthcare workers (HCW) and non-medical professionals in nursing homes, by occupation categoryFull size tableCoverage in HCW was 32.1% [29.9–34.3] and 13.8% [6.8–20.8] in NH located in metropolitan France and overseas territories, respectively. Figures were particularly low in French Caribbean territories (Guadeloupe: 11.8% [1.9–21.6], Martinique: 7.8% [3.4–12.2]), and French Guiana: 17.5% [2.8–32.2]). In metropolitan France, coverage was 75.8% [69.5–82.1], 43.1% [39.6–46.7], 26.9% [24.6–29.2] and 34.2% [30.2–38.2] for physicians, nurses, nursing assistants and other paramedical personnel, respectively. Among non-medical professionals, influenza vaccination coverage was 28.8% [25.2–32.3].Measures organized for influenza vaccination of NH professionalsFor the 2018–2019 influenza season, 97.9% [96.2–98.8] of NH in France proposed free on-site vaccination to their professionals (Table 2). Vaccination was organized in-house mainly by the NH care coordinator (physician) or nursing coordinator (71.2% [66.5–75.5]). Vaccination was promoted in almost all NH (99.2% [98.1–99.7]) and included posters (91.0% [88.0–93.3], collective (67.5% [63.4–71.4]) or individual (19.3% [15.8–23.2]) information sessions, and videos or games (7.8% [5.5–11.0]). Vaccination points of contact were nominated in 32.8% [28.5–37.4] of NH.Table 2 Measures organized by nursing homes for influenza vaccination, 2018–2019 winter season (N: 558 nursing homes)Full size tablePromotional messages included information on influenza (83.2% [79.5–86.4], the individual benefits (avoid getting influenza, avoid infecting your family) (72.5% [68.0–76.6]), the collective benefit (cocooning, organization of care) (68.6% [64.2–72.8]), and the influenza vaccine itself (63.9% [59.1–68.4]).Just under a third of NH (30.4% [26.1–35.0]) performed an in-house analysis of structural barriers to vaccination, and implemented a vaccination action programme.Determinants of influenza vaccination coverage in nursing homes HCWIn the multivariate analysis, private NH (RRa: 1.3 [1.1–1.5], p < 0.001), those not affiliated to a hospital (0.8 [0.7–0.9], p = 0.001, reference: not affiliated) those with fewer than 100 beds (0.9 [0.8–0.9], p < 0.001, reference: less than 100 beds), and those located in metropolitan France (0.4 [0.3–0.6], p < 0.001, reference: metropolitan France) were all associated with higher HCW vaccination coverage (Table 3). Higher coverage was also observed when a care coordinator (physician) was present (1.4 [1.1–1.7], p = 0.002), when vaccination was provided free of charge to all professionals (i.e., HCW and non-medical professionals) (1.4 [1.1–1.8], p = 0.004), when collective (1.3 [1.1–1.5], p = 0.002) and individual (1.6 [1.1–2.1], p = 0,006) information sessions were organized, when promotion of influenza vaccination was organized for in-house professionals with the use of video or games (1.4 [1.2–1.6], p < 0.001), when there was a point of contact for vaccination (1.7 [1.3–2.2], p < 0.001), when information was given on influenza vaccines (1.2 [1.0–1.3], p < 0.03), and finally, when the director, care coordinator (physician) or nursing coordinator was involved and supported the vaccination campaign (1.3 [1.0–1.5], p = 0.02).Table 3 Influenza vaccination coverage of Healthcare workers (HCW). RR and RR adjusted (RRa) for potential determinantsFull size tableThe following variables were significantly associated with vaccination in the univariate analysis, but no longer significant in the multivariate analysis: in-house individual or collective information sessions, information on flu, analysis of structural barriers to vaccination, and implementation of a vaccination action plan.A dose response relationship can be observed. For instance, the average vaccination coverage of HCW and non-medical professionals in NH which did not provide free influenza vaccination, had no point of contact and did not provide information on vaccines was 11.1% [5.1–17.2] (n = 9). In NH which provided free vaccination, had a point of contact, provided information on influenza vaccines and an action program, the average vaccination coverage was 35.2 [27.9–42.5] (n = 548). In NH which provided free vaccination, had a point of contact, promoted influenza vaccination, used videos or games, and provided information on influenza vaccines average vaccination coverage was 53.6% [38.9–68.4] (n = 16).DiscussionWe found low influenza vaccination coverage during the 2018–2019 season in HCW (physicians, nurses, nursing assistants and other paramedical personnel) and non-medical professionals working in NH in France. Uptake varied according to occupational category. Consistent with results from other French and European studies, coverage was highest in physicians (75%) [11,12,13], followed by nurses, other paramedical personnel, non-medical professionals, and nursing assistants. These results showed that professionals in close contact with NH residents, and in particular nursing assistants, are insufficiently vaccinated. The 75% coverage objective is only achieved for physicians.Coverage data for the 2018–2019 season in metropolitan France were compared with those for the 2008–2009 season (overseas data for the latter period were not available) [11]. Over the 10-year intervening period, coverage in physicians increased (2008–2009: 60.4% [CI95%: 54.9–65.8] vs. 2018–2019: 75.5% [69.3–81.7]), remained stable in nurses (45.2% [42.8–47.5] vs. 43.1% [39.6–46.7]), decreased in nursing assistants (33.7 [31.8–35.6] vs. 26.9 [24.6–29.2]), and tended to decrease in non-medical professionals (34.2 [32.0–36.3] vs. 28.8 [25.2–32.3]). Data were not collected for other paramedical personnel in 2008–2009. Accordingly, like-for-like comparison of HCW coverage cannot be made. Taking this missing data into consideration, coverage for all HCW combined remained relatively stable and low (33.6% [31.9–35.4] vs. 31.9% [29.7–34.1]. Differences in coverage according to profession became more pronounced over time. This is a particularly worrying finding, especially for nursing assistants, as they provide direct, close contact care to residents. Moreover, this finding highlights the difficulty of reaching these populations, and underlines the importance of creating tailored prevention messages for professionals working in NH.This trend could also be explained by the controversy in France surrounding influenza vaccination in the context of the H1N1 pandemic in 2010, whereby a huge number of vaccine doses were purchased in contrast to low final uptake. This contributed to a growing reticence among the French population about vaccines in general, leading to a plurennial decrease in coverage and possibly a decrease in uptake among certain categories of professionals in NH [14]. Other perceived or real health scandals in the last decades may also have contributed to undermining the population’s confidence in vaccination.Our study highlighted several key findings useful for policymakers to improve influenza vaccination uptake in HCW working in NH. We discuss these findings below.Vaccine accessibilityProviding free on-site influenza vaccination for professionals working in NH significantly improved vaccine coverage. In our study, almost 98% of NH already implemented this measure.In-house information sessionsThe organisation of information sessions for staff in NH was associated with higher vaccine coverage whether these sessions were collective or individual.While providing information about influenza vaccines was associated with higher HCW coverage, this was not the case for providing information about influenza, or information about the individual or collective benefits of vaccination. This result suggests that professionals wait for reliable information about influenza vaccines before deciding whether to get vaccinated or not. Studies elsewhere have shown that believing that the vaccine is effective and unlikely to cause side effects is correlated with higher uptake [15, 16].Information sessions and providing information about influenza vaccines on vaccine uptake would very likely lead to significant improvements, since we found that less than 70% of NH in France organised such sessions for staff in the 2018–2019 influenza season or gave information about influenza vaccines.Media to transmit informationAlthough over 90% of the NH included had hung up posters to promote influenza vaccination in HCW, this medium had no influence on vaccination in this population. In contrast, using videos or games was associated with higher uptake in HCW (more than 40%). The success of these media could certainly be linked to the fact that they are better at attracting the attention of professionals because of their originality and because they foster interactive exchanges. It is important to highlight that these tools were only used in 10% of NH.Human contactHaving a point of contact in the NH who provided accurate vaccination information was associated with higher uptake in HCW (70%). Nevertheless, only 33% of all the NH included declared having such a person.The points discussed above highlight that any information disseminated during a vaccination campaign must take into account the following elements: i) provide information on influenza vaccines, ii) use attractive media, and iii) be conveyed by a vaccination point of contact who can provide reliable information on vaccination. Previous studies have shown that HCW can be reluctant to search for information published by national public health institutes due to time constraints [17]. Furthermore, innovative and original information tools that can be accessed and used directly in NH, as well as train-the-trainer programmes for vaccination points of contact need to be explored. Combining these measures should make it possible to increase vaccine coverage.In our study, coverage was also higher in NH where a care coordinator was present, and when the director, care coordinator or nurse coordinator supported and was involved in the vaccination campaign.Higher vaccination rates were observed in private NH (vs. public NH). This finding was already observed for the 2007–2008 season in France [11]. Private nursing homes may encourage vaccination of their staff more than public ones. Furthermore, coverage was higher in small (i.e., fewer than 100 beds) NH, which reflects previous findings in France [11]. One possible reason for this is management teams in small NH are more committed to their staff’s health: falling ill may lead to HCW absenteeism; compensating for an absent colleague may be more difficult in smaller structures.Studies on vaccine hesitancy concluded that while knowledge about efficacy and safety are key elements, societal endorsement, support from colleagues and believing that most colleagues had been vaccinated are also important [17, 18].Finally, vaccine coverage against influenza was much lower in the four overseas territories included than in metropolitan France. Although influenza also circulates in South America and the Caribbean islands, it is possible that HCW in these territories may have felt less at risk or were more reluctant to get vaccinated for this disease. Specific studies are needed to characterise influenza vaccination hesitancy and to set up tailored vaccination campaigns in overseas territories. It is possible that uptake was underestimated for Reunion Island due to the study period, as this territory is located in the southern hemisphere.Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for HCW worldwide, but uptake remains low in the majority of countries [19, 20]. Compulsory influenza vaccination programmes for HCW have led to uptake levels of over 95% [21,22,23]. Currently no country has made influenza vaccination compulsory for HCW at the national level.Our study has limitations. First, we only collected aggregated data; individual data such as demographic characteristics, vaccine hesitancy, and knowledge about the influenza vaccine were not collected. Despite a high response rate (certainly in part thanks to the short, easy-to-fill questionnaire used), NH that did not respond to the survey may have been those where HCW vaccination initiatives were the least developed and therefore had potentially lower coverage rates. Second, the questionnaire was self-administered by NH directors, medical or nursing coordinators, and data quality cannot be verified. Finally, recall bias cannot be excluded, although we can assume that is was limited, given the relatively short time interval between the period of vaccination and the study. Estimates of influenza vaccination coverage obtained through this study were close to those observed in the surveillance of acute respiratory clusters that occurred in nursing homes during the 2018–2019 season (influenza vaccination coverage of HCW: 33%) [3]. Lastly, because of the low number of NH in overseas territories (heterogeneous islands) these data should interpreted with caution.Influenza vaccination uptake in NH residents was not investigated in this study because it has been reported as high for many years in France [11], and was confirmed by surveillance data for the 2018–2019 season (87% uptake in NH reporting acute respiratory infection clusters) [3].ConclusionsThis nationwide study assessed influenza vaccination coverage during the 2018–2019 season in HCW working in French NH. All types of HCW combined, coverage was low and relatively stable with respect to 2007–2008 data, with nursing assistants having the lowest coverage. Urgent and innovative actions are required to increase coverage in HCW. Vaccination programmes should include free vaccination and education campaigns, and particularly target nursing assistants. Programmes should ensure that information on influenza vaccines is provided by a vaccination point of contact in NH using attractive media. It would be interesting to conduct a similar study after the COVID crisis ends to assess whether the pandemic has modified influenza vaccine coverage in HCW.

Read the original article. In the last two years, as the world has wrestled with the COVID-19 pandemic, another deadly disease has been gaining momentum among birds – avian influenza. The scale of current avian influenza outbreaks is unprecedented and accelerating. Since the start of October 2021, there have been more than 4000 separate outbreaks of avian influenza viruses reported in Africa, North America, Asia and Europe. That’s more than three times the annual average between 2005 and 2019. Digitally-colorised transmission electron microscopic image of Avian Influenza A H5N1 virus particles (in gold).Picture: Centres for Disease Control and Prevention/Public Health Image Library Some wild bird populations have been hit by mass death events, while millions of poultry have been culled in an effort to control outbreaks and protect chicken stocks. For example, 37.55 million poultry have been culled in the US since January this year. Culls of this scale have severe socioeconomic repercussions, not only for the poultry sector itself, but in higher prices for poultry and eggs in many countries.The rising number of outbreaks is also a concern for humans. There have been more than 2000 human cases of avian influenza since 2005, although the vast majority of those were due to the H7N9 virus subtype, rather than the H5 subtypes characterising the current outbreaks. The continued spread of H5 subtypes, and the re-emergence of H5N1 in particular, is concerning because of the potential for the virus to jump from birds to humans. Between 2003 and 2021 there have been 863 human cases of the H5N1 subtype, resulting in 456 deaths – although there have been very few since 2008. However, the rate of infection in humans is very low given the billions of poultry and hundreds of thousands of poultry workers and farmers involved. There has also been no human-to-human transmission. But the situation needs to be closely monitored. In China last year, there were 33 cases of the H5N6 strain with 11 reported deaths, and as of March this year, there had been 17 cases in China and at least five deaths. Again, there has been no human-human transmission. Currently only countries including China and Vietnam routinely vaccinate poultry for H5 avian influenza. However, the scale of outbreaks, coinciding with the return of the H5N1 subtype combination, means authorities should be considering mass vaccinating poultry. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza represent a serious threat to poultry stocks. Picture: Getty Images As a case in point, in 2017, mass vaccination was used against the H7N9 strain and successfully lowered viral burdens in chickens, dramatically reducing human infections to effectively zero.The current outbreak highlights the need for ongoing monitoring in Australia given the risk of transmission from migratory wild birds to domestic poultry. The current outbreaks are taking a terrible toll on particular wild bird populations. For example, up to 10,000 Common Cranes (Grus grus) were found dead in Israel in December, while since November 8000-10,000 Barnacle Geese (Branta leucopsis) are estimated to have died in the United Kingdom. Recently, hundreds of Dalmatian Pelicans (Pelecanus crispusin) were found dead in Northern Greece. Since 1976, there have been eight outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Australian poultry. A highly pathogenic avian influenza is one that is more deadly to poultry – most strains of avian influenza are low pathogenic in that they cause few signs of disease. The most recent outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Australia occurred in 2020 in Victoria, and resulted in the culling of approximately 500,000 poultry. To date, all previous outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Australia were the result local/domestic strains that evolved in Australia, rather than introductions of overseas strains. The classification of avian influenza viruses. Graphic: Supplied Importantly, the highly pathogenic viruses that have caused outbreaks in Australia previously, which have all been H7 viruses, are different from the highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza viruses that are wreaking havoc overseas. So, despite the intensity of the ongoing outbreaks overseas, the risk of an incursion and subsequent outbreaks due to highly pathogenic H5 in Australia remains low. Australia monitors avian influenza through the National Avian Influenza Wild Bird Program that, since 2005, has collected more than 100,000 samples from wild birds.In a recent study we published in the journal PLoS Pathogens, we analysed more than 300 genomes of these low pathogenic avian influenza viruses in wild birds to understand how these viruses move between Australia and the rest of the world. Overall, what we found is that avian influenza viruses move from wild birds in Asia to Australia, circulate here and go extinct here. That is, in the entire dataset, there was only one instance of a virus moving from Australia back to Asia. Based on the pattern of introductions, we believe that this process is facilitated by shorebirds (also called waders), which are incredible avian athletes, migrating from Siberia to Australia and back each year. Avian influenza is brought to Australia by shorebirds (or waders) migrating from the Northern Hemisphere. Picture: Getty Images While ducks are important for the spread of avian influenza in Australia, they aren’t likely to be responsible for introducing viruses to Australia – as there are no duck species that migrate between Asia and the Australian-Papuan region.However, in our analysis, we found that the way the viruses moved within Australia was consistent with the movement of ducks as they use inter-state water basins and disperse widely across the continent in search for water. But while the risk of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus directly reaching Australia is low, it’s important that we continually monitor the situation.Our study marks the first time a genomic study of this scale has been undertaken in Australia, and the very first time that all state and territory laboratories have cooperated in providing avian influenza genome data.Cooperation between States and Territories is so in important as it enables us to get a holistic picture of which avian influenza variants are circulating in the country, and how they’re being introduced.As I have explained, avian influenza outbreaks, particularly outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza, affect poultry, wild birds and have consequences for humans.Ongoing collaboration between laboratories will be essential for us to establish a clear picture, and protect against any future, devastating outbreaks.

Oviedo-Rondon Dr. Rocio Crespo AVINEWS INTERNATIONAL| aviNews International June 2022 | Pathology Avian influenza (AI) is a broad term used to describe infection or disease in birds caused by Type A influenza virus of the genus Alphainfluenzavirus and family Orthomyxoviridaevirus. The virus is distributed worldwide and can infect many avian species. It can also cause a range of disease symptoms, from subclinical infections to highly virulent disease with close to 100% mortality, and even has a zoonotic risk, a major concern for a potential pandemic. >>The influenza virus was first isolated in the early half of the twentieth century. Since 1959, 44 genetically distinct epizootics associated with high mortality in poultry have been described. The largest outbreak spread intercontinentally began in 1996 in domestic geese in China. Influenza viruses are classified by examining the nuclear and matrix proteins. There are three types of flu viruses: A, B, and C. All avian influenza viruses are type A. Traditionally, type A influenza viruses are classified into subtypes based on antigenic differences of the two surface proteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). These two proteins on the virus surface make it capable of entering and exiting host cells. At least 16 hemagglutinins and nine neuraminidase subtypes are recognized from avian origin. Consequently, the subtype is labeled with the N and H numbers. >>The LPAI viruses can be of many different hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes. Continue after advertising. >>Although most of the viruses that belong to the H5 and H7 subtypes are generally low pathogenic, they have the potential to mutate to HPAI. Photo 1. Influenza virus structure In 1996, an HPAI H5N1 emerged in Hong Kong and Guangdong. This virus is known as H5NI A/goose/ Guangdong/1/1996 (Gs/GD). Between 2008 and 2010, this virus generated novel reassortments by introducing other neuraminidase subtypes (i.e., H5N2, H5N3, H5N5, H5N6, and H5N8). The H5Nx HPAI Gs/GD continues to circulate and evolve in wild birds and TO CONTINUE READING REGISTER IT IS COMPLETELY FREE Access to articles in PDF Keep up to date with our newsletters Receive the magazine for free in digital version REGISTRATION ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT LOGIN Lost your password?

In the United States alone, some form of influenza-like illness, or ILI, infects nearly 50 million people every year. Now, new work from Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of New Mexico shows that more detailed modeling of the specific viruses can be vital for early identification and treatment of infection, while also facilitating better pandemic preparedness. âInfluenza-like illness is an inherently confusing term, because during the past 20 years in the U.S., influenza viruses have been only 23% to 43% of total ILI,â said Julie Spencer, the first author on the paper. âAn infant with flu symptoms could have a relatively harmless rhinovirus or the more dangerous RSV, but how do we know? One of our goals with our new paper is to motivate increased diagnostic testing at the point of care for increased national health security.â The research was recently published in the Journal of Theoretical Biology. ILI is defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a group of symptoms that include a fever of at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a cough and/or a sore throat. But while tracking ILI as a single clinical syndrome is informative in many respects, the underlying viruses differ in parameters and outbreak properties. Indeed, the recent COVID-19 pandemic also falls into this category. âModeling multiple respiratory infections allows us to be prepared for emerging threats and previously unknown pathogens. As COVID-19 has shown us, this is required for pandemic preparedness,â said Harshini Mukundan, one of the senior authors on the paper. Most existing models explore either a single respiratory virus or ILI as a whole. However, the researchers determined a clear need for models capable of comparing several individual viruses that cause respiratory illness, as the subtleties of each virus can mean different treatment and mitigation protocols. In addition, with bacterial and viral infections sometimes being difficult to differentiate, millions of unnecessary prescriptions are written for antibiotics each year. In the paper, the researchers present a flexible model and simulations of epidemics for a range of viruses that can present as ILI, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, seasonal coronavirus, adenovirus and SARS/MERS, accompanied by a global sensitivity analysis. All the viruses modeled present clinically with similar symptoms, but their severity, transmission dynamics and therapeutic strategies varied considerably. Thus, there is a vast potential not only for misdiagnosis, but for missing early signals of future novel emerging diseases. Models such as the one presented in the new manuscript can help delineate the differences among these classes of viruses, potentially allowing for streamlined responses. The authors also found a clear need for comprehensive viral testing at the point of care, in order to facilitate suitable therapeutic intervention or control strategies for prevention of further transmission.

The BD SARS-CoV-2/Flu assay for the BD COR™ System is an automated multiplexed real-time RT-PCR test to detect and differentiate SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A, and/or influenza B from a single nasal sample from patients who are showing signs of respiratory viral infection, as well as those who are asymptomatic. “As long as the COVID-19 pandemic persists or evolves to an endemic situation, testing for the virus will remain an important public health tool,” said Celine Roger-Dalbert, vice president diagnostic assays R&D at BD. “And while last year’s flu season was relatively tame, with many areas loosening guidelines and mask guidance, this season could see a resurgence in seasonal illnesses. It is important to quickly diagnose if a patient has COVID-19 or flu, and type of flu, to inform patient management and to treat appropriately and early in the course of the disease.” The BD COR™ MX/PX System allows 1,700 specimens to be loaded, with onboard capacity for reagents and samples that provide more than six hours of unimpeded system processing and up to 1,000 sample results in 24 hours, eliminating multiple technologist interactions currently required per shift. The BD COR™ MX instrument launched in 2021 with the BD CTGCTV2 molecular assay, a single test that detects the three most prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted infections (STIs) — Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). “The BD SARS-CoV-2/Flu assay is the first delivery on our promise to continue to expand assays that can be performed in high-throughput central testing labs,” said Brooke Story, president of Integrated Diagnostic Solutions for BD. “We will continue to broaden our available tests for the BD COR™ System, including assays for other common STIs, overall women’s health and gastrointestinal infections.” The BD COR™ System integrates and automates the complete molecular laboratory workflow from sample processing to diagnostic test result. The BD COR™ PX instrument focuses on sample workflow for diagnostic specimens and assays, preparing the samples by performing the appropriate pre-analytical processing steps and automatically delivering the samples to the BD COR™ MX instrument for molecular analysis. The BD COR™ MX instrument will perform the analytical steps of the BD SARS-CoV-2/Flu molecular assay, including extraction, amplification and detection. The system is modular and scalable, and designed to address multiple needs within laboratories for expanding molecular testing and increasing test volumes. The BD COR™ System is particularly well-suited to laboratories requiring high throughput for sample results, minimizing staff interactions and automating labor-intensive and error-prone manual processes.

Search Inicio » News » Implementing stronger biosecurity to avoid disease spread to new areas News Implementing stronger biosecurity to avoid disease spread to new areas Published on 23 May 2022 Share: The page link has been copied to your clipboard View more The World Organisation for Animal Health has analysed the current global situation, with the information shared by countries this past year through the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS). The aggregated data show that African swine fever (ASF) and avian influenza, also known as bird flu, have spread more widely than in previous years, affecting a higher number of animals and reaching new areas across the globe. This noticeably led to devastating animal health and socioeconomic consequences. Livestock production, livelihoods, food security and even food prices have been heavily impacted. Protecting livestock and wildlife from infectious diseases Domestic and wild animals can mutually interact, whether directly or indirectly, through feed, waste or faeces, for instance. This interplay of populations can allow diseases to cross the species barriers and jump from one another. To prevent their dissemination, Veterinary Services have been promoting the importance of strict biosecurity measures. These are indeed essential to limit interactions between wildlife and livestock. Looking at avian influenza, this year’s situation is unprecedented. “Over the past months, the avian influenza epidemic has continued to threaten animal health with a high number of cases reported and millions of poultry affected throughout the world”, highlights Dr Paula Caceres, Head of the World Animal Health Information and Analysis Department. Since October 2021, the beginning of the season for avian influenza, 47 countries reported close to 3,000 outbreaks in poultry. Measures to mitigate the spread have led to the culling of more than 80 million domestic birds. Migratory wild birds, especially waterfowl, are natural hosts and reservoirs of avian influenza viruses, and can easily pass them onto other wild or domestic birds through direct or indirect contact such as through their feed. This year, important fatalities have been observed in wild birds, threatening biodiversity worldwide. For instance, in Israel, over 8,000 common cranes have died from avian influenza and hundreds of wild birds were found dead in the United Kingdom. Since not much can be done to contain the disease in wild animals, the implementation of biosecurity measures in farms is crucial to avoiding the introduction of pathogens into poultry flocks. These measures do not only protect poultry, but also wildlife and its conservation. Relevant precautions notably include keeping domestic birds away from contact with wild birds, ensuring good hygiene in poultry housing and equipment, and being cautious when introducing new animals into the flock. African swine fever has also much impacted the pig sector this year, affecting new areas. While it was historically first found in Africa and then spread to Asia and Europe, this pig disease has reached the Americas last summer, for the first time in almost 40 years. A few months later in December, North Macedonia reported the first occurrence of the disease in backyard pigs which most likely originated from the contact between domestic pigs and infected wild boar. The transmission of African swine fever at the livestock-wildlife interface seems to depend on the wild boar population and their interaction with low-biosecurity pig production systems. Yet, because there is no vaccine available for now, biosecurity remains the first line of defense against the disease. Encouraging responsible human behaviours Human activities can also be responsible for disseminating diseases. Travellers, hunters and even farmers can carry pathogens and introduce them into domestic and wild animal populations. When travelling, people sometimes unknowingly visit affected farms, or buy animal commodities that they will take back to their country of origin. When hunting in affected areas, it is possible to encounter wild species carrying infectious diseases. Thes activities can lead to people acquiring the pathogens on their boots, clothing or vehicles, and spreading diseases with their movements, from farm to farm, or into new countries. Implementing relevant precautions and adopting good hygiene practices is crucial, when in contact with animals. Cleaning clothing after visiting a farm and avoiding bringing back animal products from travels are all key measures to keep in mind. The recent global trends of diseases, highlighted in the latest global animal health situation report, truly show the role of human activities in spreading African swine fever and avian influenza, amongst other diseases. To raise awareness on ways to address at-risk situations, the World Organisation for Animal Health provides a wide range of communication materials, on both African swine fever and avian influenza. While other factors such as climate change and international trade can be considered, the spread of animal diseases can be contained by implementing strict biosecurity measures, along the entire livestock supply chain. Nevertheless, biosecurity must always be coupled with other measures: sensitisation amongst key stakeholders, increased surveillance efforts, and timely reporting of cases to Veterinary Authorities. Transparent sharing of animal health data is the cornerstone to enabling effective prevention and control of infectious animal diseases. In this regard, the efforts made by Members to maintain their level of disease monitoring and notification over the past year, despite the challenges linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, also need to be acknowledged.

Consumers may be next.A rare butterfly makes last stand in Michigan. Feds have $57M plan to save itWash your hands: Highly contagious bird flu reaches Michigan wild flocks“We’re seeing a lot of illness and deaths in wild birds and domestic birds,” Moriarty said.“Unfortunately, there are not very specific clinical signs, it could look like a lot of other things,” Moriarty said.Signs of avian flu:CoughingSneezingDiarrheaDischarge from the nostrilsAbnormal head and neck positionTremorsSeizuresInfected birds can also not show any signs, Moriarty said.The flu spreads through direct contact, but can also spread through indirect transmission, Moriarty said. This means if an infected bird touches a shared food or water source, a bird can get sick.Birdfeeders are a shared food source for wild birds and no birdfeeder is safer than another, said Louise Sagaert, director of Wildside Rehabilitation Center.“The tube feeders cause more contagious issues versus the hopper ones,” she said.“The problem with hopper feeders is that they tend to draw more types of birds and the congregation of birds is larger than at the tube feeders,” Sagaert said.A decreased use of birdfeeders could result in fewer birdseed sales.Kate Furtaw, Owner of Wildbirds Unlimited in East Lansing said she hasn’t noticed a decrease in birdseed sales, but an increase in birdfeeder cleanings.If you are willing to clean your birdfeeder often with a 10% bleach solution and don’t have backyard birds like ducks or chickens, it is safe to keep your birdfeeder out, Sagaert said.Contrary to what many people believe, stopping when you feed birds is not a hardship.“Although it seems like birds are surviving from the birdfeeders, it’s simply a treat, and they are certainly able to survive on their own without our help,” Sagaert said.It’s possible the flu can spread through objects like car tires or people’s boots, Moriarty said.“You have to dedicate clothes and boots to the area where your backyard birds are,” Sagaert said. “Do not wear those things back in the house, especially if you have indoor birds.”“You shouldn’t go from the poultry yards to the wild bird feeder,” Sagaert said.And if you must, bathe your shoes in bleach.More research is needed to fully understand the transmission of the bird flu, Moriarty said.“We do know it’s likely linked to migratory bird movement, which is why we’re seeing it so much now during the spring migration,” Moriarty said. “The virus is popping up throughout the United States. In Michigan, we’re in the Mississippi flyway, and so with a lot of our neighboring states like Ohio, Minnesota and Illinois, we’re seeing a lot of cases.”“It has the potential to impact humans, but fortunately there has been no human cases in the US from this strain of highly pathogenic influenza virus, which is good news.”We should all be cautious because influenza viruses often have the ability to jump species barriers, Moriarty said. Mammals can catch the flu, Moriarty said.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the general public has a low risk of contracting the avian flu.“It is a pretty significant outbreak we’re experiencing right now,” Moriarty said. “It’s lasting a pretty long time with no current signs of slowing down.”With migration slowing, the hope is the spread of the flu will decrease, Moriarty said.The best things to do to prevent the spread of the flu is by keeping your wild birds and domestic birds separate from each other and by practicing good hygiene like washing your hands frequently if you are touching birds, Moriarty said.“The general public should not be handling any sick or dead wild birds,” Moriarty said. “Report any sick or dead birds to the DNR so we can take them and test them.” Related Articles: Watch Bridge Lunch Break on deer hunting trends in Michigan October 31, 2024 | Amber DeLind in The Center for Michigan In razor-thin race, watch these Michigan regions in Harris, Trump race October 31, 2024 | Mike Wilkinson in Michigan Government UP lumber mills go to bank auction months after sale to private equity firm October 30, 2024 | Paula Gardner in Business Watch How impactful was this article for you?Rate1/5Rate2/5Rate3/5Rate4/5Rate5/5Michigan Environment WatchMichigan Environment Watch examines how public policy, industry, and other factors interact with the state’s trove of natural resources.See full coverageSubscribeShare tips and questions with Bridge environment reporter Kelly HouseMichigan Environment Watch is made possible by generous financial support from: Our generous Environment Watch underwriters encourage Bridge Michigan readers to also support civic journalism by becoming Bridge members.

This comes at a time when after virtually disappearing for two years, influenza is back and rapidly sweeping across Australia and the world.By PTI May 26, 2022, 10:56:45 AM IST (Published)After virtually disappearing for two years, influenza is back and rapidly sweeping across Australia and the world. So far this year, there have been more than 15,000 flu cases in New South Wales alone, of which more than 12,000 were diagnosed since the start of May. The Queensland government has announced free flu vaccinations and NSW is considering doing the same. Australian Medical Association president Omar Khorshid has urged the incoming federal government to provide free flu shots for all Australians. Meanwhile, COVID cases continue to mount as colder weather sets in. The good news is, that we know the influenza vaccine can protect against the flu and a growing body of international research suggests the flu jab might also protect against COVID. A recent study of 30,774 healthcare workers in Qatar found influenza vaccine could guard against COVID, particularly severe illnesses. These promising results have implications not only for COVID but also for future pandemics caused by newly emergent germs. However, there are some reasons for caution. The Qatar study, released online this month and yet to be independently verified, used data from more than 12,000 healthcare workers who had a COVID test during the 2020 flu season. The researchers compared influenza vaccination rates among the 576 healthcare workers who got COVID and a similar group of 2,000 healthcare workers who had tested negative for COVID in the last three months of 2020. Those who had an influenza vaccination at least two weeks before COVID testing were 30 percent less likely to have a positive COVID test and almost 90 percent less likely to develop severe or critical COVID, compared with those who hadn't been recently vaccinated against flu. This finding is consistent with similar retrospective studies from Brazil, Italy, Iran, the Netherlands, and the United States, which have also shown protective effects of influenza vaccination against COVID. Common to studies of people who work in the health field, there is the risk people in the study are health-conscious. They are likely more inclined to follow COVID protection advice such as adhering to lockdowns, physical isolation, and mask-wearing. They are also more likely to get their influenza vaccination. This potential bias is reduced in the Qatar study by focusing only on healthcare workers, however, it can't be ruled out as contributing to the findings. There are two further considerations to the implications of this study. First, the healthcare workers included in the study were young and not assessed to see if they had other health conditions. This means the effects seen in the study may not hold for older people and those with other health issues both of whom are at greater risk of severe COVID. Second, the study used data collected before COVID vaccines and before COVID variants such as Omicron. This means the impact of the findings in the current global circumstances is unclear. In the study, the average time for COVID testing after flu vaccination was six weeks. With the study using data only during a three-month period, it is unclear whether this protective effect of the flu vaccine against COVID might last beyond a few months. In the early months of the pandemic while COVID vaccines were still in development researchers were intensely interested in the possibility existing vaccines might provide some protection against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID). This is because of emerging evidence some vaccines can have additional beneficial effects, greater than just protecting against the infection they were originally designed for. This bonus protection has mostly been linked to live-attenuated vaccines, made from a weakened form of the germ or a related germ. For example, both the 100-year-old tuberculosis vaccine called Bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG) and measles vaccines have been shown to reduce infant deaths from any cause. This protection is thought to be because these vaccines can kick-start the immune system so it protects the body more effectively from infectious diseases. To understand more about the bonus protection of routine vaccines like these against COVID, multiple randomised controlled trials are underway. One multinational clinical trial, called the BRACE trial, has enrolled almost 7,000 healthcare workers to determine whether the BCG vaccine reduces the incidence of symptomatic and severe COVID. So far, we have found BCG vaccination changes the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a way that could reduce severe COVID illness. However, this trial is ongoing and we need to wait for the final results to determine whether this immune response translates into real-world protection against COVID. For influenza vaccines, one plausible explanation for their protective effect against COVID is that influenza vaccination reduces the risk of having influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection at the same time. Co-infection with flu and COVID is associated with more severe disease. Prevention of this could reduce the severity of COVID. However, due to exceptionally low influenza rates in Qatar during the 2020 flu season, this is unlikely to explain the recent findings. Like the BCG vaccine, influenza vaccines might decrease potentially harmful inflammatory immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe COVID has been linked to overactive inflammatory responses which can cause damage to tissues and result in severe symptoms. these routine vaccines might prevent related tissue damage. These promising results emerge as we grapple with growing COVID cases and the pandemic rolls on. More research is needed to confirm what researchers are beginning to report. But the potential for existing vaccines, such as the flu jab and BCG, to provide protection against COVID gives rise to the possibility they could also help to protect against future pandemics. However exciting these new results are, the best evidence remains that influenza vaccination protects us from the flu and COVID vaccination and boosters protect against COVID and severe illness.Continue ReadingCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

Image by EPA Spanish flu pandemic claim masks the truth about deaths Kate Atkinson May 26, 2022 WHAT WAS CLAIMED The vast majority of deaths during the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918-19 were due to bacterial infections caused by people wearing masks. OUR VERDICT False. Many people succumbed to bacterial pneumonia due to lung and immune system damage following influenza virus infection. There is no evidence mask use was the cause. An Australian Facebook user claims the majority of deaths during the Spanish flu pandemic a century ago were due to people wearing masks, not the influenza virus. The claim was made in a post (screenshot here) on May 10 alongside screenshots of two other Facebook posts including an Israel National News article with the headline, “New study: Face mask usage correlates with higher death rates”. “Most people don’t realise but the vast majority of the deaths during the Spanish flu were NOT actually attributed to the flu virus but rather widespread bacterial infections as a result of wearing masks,” the text in the post reads. The claim is false. While many deaths during the 1918-1919 pandemic were associated with secondary bacterial infections, evidence shows they were caused by the influenza virus – not mask use. The Spanish flu was the most severe pandemic in recent history. The US Centers for Disease Control and Protection estimates about one-third of the world’s population became infected and at least 50 million people died. A 2008 study by David Morens, Jeffery Taubenberger and Anthony Fauci examined tissue sections obtained during autopsies and found the majority of deaths in the 1918-19 pandemic likely resulted “directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory-tract bacteria”. They found pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally “inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs”. Other scientific papers here, here and here confirm bacterial pneumonia often develops after a person becomes sick with influenza. Justin Denholm, a professorial research fellow at the University of Melbourne’s Department of Infectious Diseases, says during the 1918-1919 pandemic “there were well-documented ‘waves’ of illness, and very likely a good deal of this happened because of bacterial infections (staphylococcus and streptococcus) that follow 1-2 weeks after influenza infection and can cause very severe bacterial pneumonia”. “We still see this today, and after influenza now we will often see these bacterial infections in the same pattern,” he told AAP FactCheck in an email. Prof Denholm said the problem with the post’s claim was masks “are in no way implicated” in the secondary bacterial infection process. “The bacterial infections come because of damage done to the lungs and immune system from the influenza virus itself. There’s no suggestion that masks cause or make this worse, and from a public health point of view, mask wearing is of course a critically important part of limiting the spread of infection.” Keith Klugman, professor of global health in the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, told AAP FactCheck in an email the claim face masks caused the bacterial pneumonia deaths is “total nonsense”. Prof Klugman agrees the bacterial-associated deaths which occurred during the pandemic were caused by the influenza virus. AAP FactCheck also consulted Dr David Hamer, a professor of global health and medicine at Boston University Schools of Public Health and Medicine, and Dr David Muscatello, an associate professor in infectious diseases epidemiology at the University of NSW. Both say there’s no evidence wearing masks causes widespread bacterial infection. “There’s certainly no evidence of it with COVID, as far as I know,” Dr Muscatello said in an email. Dr Hamer says it’s unlikely wearing masks contributed to bacterial infections during the 1918-1919 pandemic and “recent mask use studies in the context of COVID-19 that have shown the safety of this approach and there are no data, that I am aware of, that suggest mask use in the current pandemic has resulted in increased rates of bacterial infections”. Similar claims have been debunked here and here, while AAP FactCheck has previously debunked the claim face masks can cause illnesses. The Verdict The claim the majority of the deaths during the Spanish flu pandemic were a result of wearing face masks is false. Most deaths during the 1918-1919 outbreak were caused by bacterial pneumonia following influenza infection. Experts told AAP FactCheck there is no evidence mask use contributes to people developing bacterial infections.

We need to make sure we have this preventative measure in place."Federal health figures show only 598 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were reported around the country in the year to November 2021.The flatlining influenza figures in 2021 and 2020 show the impact of COVID isolation. (Department of Health)But in the first four months of this year, 5,049 cases have been recorded nationally.And data from some states is already showing the May figures will rapidly eclipse that number.So what are the figures saying so far?These numbers from Australia's Communicable Diseases Network show three states alone — New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland — have already had more cases this year than the entire country did last year.In the last two weeks of April alone, NSW reported 1,682 laboratory-confirmed cases, Victoria 814 cases and Queensland 622 cases.States such as Tasmania and Western Australia are posting single-digit case numbers.But if we take a look at figures from state health departments with more recent data, such as Queensland's, they point to a rapid rise in infections.Last week, 3,396 confirmed cases were reported there — up almost 1,000 on the week before when 2,362 cases were confirmed. That's a rapid rise from several hundred at the end of April.Queensland flu numbers climbed past 3,000 this week. (Queensland Health)And in New South Wales, a similar number of cases were recorded in its health department's most recent figures.In the week ending May 14, there were 3,601 people with a confirmed diagnosis, which was 63 per cent higher than the week before.Thousands have caught the virus in NSW this year.Who can get free flu shots?The Australian Medical Association says other states should follow Queensland's lead and provide free shots to reduce infections and help ease pressure on the health system.But Queensland's announcement caught GPs off guard, with patients wanting free jabs and clinics unsure if they will be reimbursed for vaccines already purchased.New South Wales and South Australia are considering the move. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says his government is talking to GPs and the Pharmacy Guild about whether the flu vaccine should be made free for everyone this winter.Mr Andrews says he will seek a contribution from the new federal government if the state is advised to cover the cost.Posted Wed 25 May 2022 at 6:14amWednesday 25 May 2022 at 6:14amWed 25 May 2022 at 6:14amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesDonald Trump calls Vladimir Putin and urges him not to escalate Ukraine war, media reportsTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Close up of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in conversation Dutton is already testing Trump's campaign slogans.

It’s the first nonprescription COVID-19 test authorized by the federal agency that also screens for other respiratory ailments. “This new at-home collection kit makes it easier for consumers to access testing for multiple respiratory viruses – COVID-19, the flu, and RSV – that can present similar symptoms,” said Dr. Brian Caveney, the chief medical officer and president of Labcorp Diagnostics, in a statement. “With the spike in RSV cases over the last year, the continued presence of COVID-19, and the ever-present threat of flu, testing for all three viruses at once enables individuals and physicians to quickly identify the illness and determine the appropriate treatment.”“RSV, flu, and COVID are some of the more dangerous of the respiratory viruses,” Dr. Anna Van Tuyl, the director of the Division of Critical Care at Staten Island University Hospital’s Department of Emergency Medicine in New York, told Healthline. “There are potential treatments for influenza and COVID depending on your co-morbidities and duration of illness.”Pia MacDonald, Ph.D., an infectious disease epidemiologist with the nonprofit educational institute RTI International, added, “In the future, there will be times in the year where all three viruses could be circulating at the same time… Once an individual knows they are infected, preventing spread from one person to another will include similar strategies for each of the three viruses, such as masking and frequent handwashing.”The new combination test can help eliminate confusion about the symptoms of these three illnesses, noted Kristen Nichols, PharmD, a senior content management consultant for the clinical effectiveness business at Wolters Kluwer Health, a healthcare information provider.However, she stressed, that a negative test result doesn’t prove that you’re not sick — or infectious.“One thing to note is that there are definitely other respiratory viruses that can cause similar syndromes that wouldn’t be detected on this test,” Nichols told Healthline. “You could also be infected with a different respiratory virus that wouldn’t be on this panel — for example, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, and adenoviruses. So for someone that has classic symptoms of an upper respiratory viral infection, they should avoid spreading their germs even if the tests are negative.”Cost could be an issueUsers of the Labcorp Seasonal Respiratory Virus RT-PCR DTC Test self-collect nasal samples at home using a swab.They then mail the sample to Labcorp for analysis. Results are delivered through an online portal, with referrals to a healthcare professional available as needed.Test kits cost $169 and can be purchased in retail stores or online. A Labcorp spokesperson told Healthline that the tests are available with no upfront cost to individuals who have health insurance and who meet clinical guidelines, such as having symptoms of a respiratory infection.But Nichols said it remains unclear whether insurers will cover the full cost of the combination test. Van Tuyl added the price of the Labcorp test makes it unlikely that it will supplant the COVID-only tests already on the market. “There is a big cost difference between the single COVID-19 test and the combination test,” she explained. “It may not be worth the extra cost just to know you do or do not have the other viral illnesses.”“Having the test available for purchase and use without a prescription makes it possible to use without taking time off work, school, or securing child care. For some people, that will be important and helpful,” MacDonald told Healthline. “Nonetheless, the price of $169 makes it prohibitive for many people to purchase.”“From a research and public health perspective, having a large group of people who use these routinely and report their status could be an excellent way to monitor the viruses in our communities,” added MacDonald. “However, in practice, at this point, the price is likely too high to be used for public health population-based surveillance.”Van Tuyl said the combination tests could have utility for testing people who are high risk, have high risk family members, or in pediatric patients. “For example, if you have a high risk family member, you may want to use the combo test, to test anyone with symptoms who is coming into contact with that person,” she said.How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by Bob Curley on May 24, 2022 — Fact checked by Jennifer Chesak, MSJRead this nextCan COVID-19 Symptoms Come Back After Using Paxlovid?

Martina Versteeg/Orphaned Wildlife Rehabilitation Society May 28, 2022 9:00 AM Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message OWL staff have been busy dealing with cases of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza.Martina Versteeg Orphaned Wildlife Rehabilitation Society (OWL) receives close to 1,000 sick or injured birds of prey each year. Through the years OWL has returned more than 27,000 raptors to the wild. OWL’s goal is to rescue, rehabilitate, and release native wild raptors, as well as educate the public on how to prevent injuries to wildlife. As you may have heard, the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI, or bird flu H5N1) is making the rounds again globally. In February we had a positive case in a Bald Eagle and immediately implemented new biosecurity measures. Unfortunately, since that first case, six more birds have arrived with the virus - five Bald Eagles and one Coopers Hawk - and we are awaiting results on four more Bald Eagles and a Peregrine Falcon. Two of the confirmed cases were from Delta. Sadly, in raptors, H5N1 has a 90 to 100 per cent mortality rate. Raptors pick up this disease from their food sources. Waterfowl are natural reservoirs for varieties of Avian Influenza yet are largely unaffected themselves and rarely show signs of the disease. The OWL team of volunteers worked tirelessly to add and improve quarantine areas so each patient can safely quarantine during testing and treatment. As you can imagine, we are using a lot of personal protective equipment (PPE) and rely on donations to help with this unexpected cost, and allow us to remain open and accept patients who need us. Sadly, numerous comparable North America facilities have had to temporarily close due to the impact of the virus. To help stop the spread of HPAI, please keep your chickens or pet birds out of yards where wild birds may congregate. Consider removing your bird feeders and baths for the time being, and plant bird friendly native plants for birds to forage on. If you find an injured raptor, please call us at 604-946-3171. Report dead wild birds to the Bird Mortality Hotline at 1-866-431-BIRD (2473).

The virucidal assays conducted at the Scripps Research Institute in the US assessed the irreversible nature of the effect of a compound against viruses. In addition to testing the virucidal activity of SPL7013, the Scripps testing assessed the activity of two antiviral agents used in widely available nasal sprays - hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) and iota-carrageenan. In contrast to the potent and rapid effect of SPL7013, HPMC and iota-carrageenan did not exhibit virucidal effect in this experiment, even after 30 minutes. The antiviral activity of SPL7013 in other pandemic-causing influenza A viruses has previously been reported by Starpharma, with SPL7013 demonstrating potent antiviral activity against H1N1 (Swine Flu) and H3N2 (Avian Flu). These new virucidal findings are consistent with the previously reported activity of SPL7013 against multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2, including Delta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Omicron, as well as other respiratory viruses that cause the common cold. The broad-spectrum antiviral and virucidal activity of SPL7013 (VIRALEZE), which encompasses all of the pandemic-causing respiratory viruses, highlights the opportunities for VIRALEZE in combatting seasonal flu epidemics as well as pandemic preparedness.

(Pexels)abc.net.auews/flu-vaccination-influenza-shot-disease-virus-immune-case-numbers/101100218Link copiedShareShare articleAustralia had a couple of virtually flu-free years, but the disease has bounced back — and then some — over the past few weeks.In the year to last Sunday, almost 40,000 influenza cases were reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, with 26,000 of those cases in the fortnight of May 9-22.That's compared to just 598 reported flu cases in the whole of 2021, thanks largely to closed borders and COVID restrictions.Now, as Australians head into winter with little natural immunity, and face the potential risk of a co-infection with COVID-19, experts say getting the flu vaccine is more important than ever."We've got around 600,000 children under the age of two who've never seen flu, so that's quite a sizeable population of young kids who are entirely susceptible," Sheena Sullivan, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at the Doherty Institute, told ABC News.Can I get the flu jab if I've just had COVID-19?Photo shows A nurse in a mask holds a vial of flu vaccine.It's not even winter but Australia is already experiencing thousands of cases of influenza, after recording just hundreds in total last year. Experts are urging people to get the flu jab."And then for our older populations … we don't know exactly how frequently people get infected, but normally, there would be a higher level of protection in the community than there is now."Sydney paediatrician Nick Wood said hospitals were already seeing more flu cases in young children, who — alongside older adults, pregnant people and adults with chronic health conditions — face a higher risk of complications should they be infected."In the paediatric space, there are definitely more hospitalisations in under 5s than we saw with COVID-19," said Dr Wood, who is also an associate director at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS)."Because [the flu] hasn't been circulating, there's not much prior natural exposure, so they're effectively immune naive."Flu shot uptake slowSome 6 million Australians have already had their flu shot this year, but that's less than a quarter of the eligible population, said Ian Barr, deputy director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute."It's low. Last year, we had about 35 per cent of eligible Australians vaccinated. So we're even below that at the moment."That said, older Australians generally have much higher seasonal flu vaccination rates than their younger counterparts. (In 2019, only 15 per cent of 20-to-50-year-olds received a flu shot.)This year's flu vaccine helps protect against four different flu viruses. (ABC Central West: Donal Sheil)In Australia, everyone over the age of 6 months is recommended to have a seasonal flu vaccine. Vaccination protects you against serious disease and also helps to protect people around you by reducing your risk of passing it on.Dr Wood suspected "vaccine fatigue" may be contributing to lagging uptake rates in some age groups."I also think the healthcare workforce is suddenly pivoting from 'go go go' with COVID-19 to 'go go go' with flu," he said.The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, especially boosters in the last six months, may also have led some people to postpone their flu jab, Dr Sullivan said."There was a bit of confusion around whether you can get the influenza vaccine at the same time, and so that meant that vaccine uptake was a bit lower."(You can now get your COVID-19 booster and flu jab at the same time.)Flu vaccine an 'excellent match' so farWhile vaccination is the best way to protect yourself against influenza, flu vaccines give better protection in some years than others.That's because the viruses that cause the flu can mutate quickly and slip past our immune defences — as well as any protection bestowed by vaccines.To stay a step ahead, the World Health Organization (WHO) keeps tabs on what viruses are circulating and where, and uses this to predict, in September each year, what will be in our next seasonal flu vaccine.The flu vax protects against four virusesTwo influenza A:H1N1 was first detected in the Americas in 2009 and caused the 2009-10 swine flu pandemicH3N2 was behind the 1968 flu pandemic, which killed an estimated 1 million people worldwideTwo influenza B:B/Victoria tends to infect younger peopleB/Yamagata may now be eradicatedSo how did they go this year?Things are looking pretty good at the moment, according to Professor Barr."Now, things can change through the season, but we've got as good a match as we could have hoped for."How that actually pans out in terms of vaccine effectiveness is too early to tell yet, but in terms of looking at the viruses which are circulating, and the match in the vaccine, they're an excellent match at this stage."Of the four flu viruses covered by the vaccine, two are influenza A viruses and two are influenza B.Influenza B viruses generally only infect people, while influenza A viruses — such as H1N1, or swine flu — can bounce between us and other animals.This year, influenza A viruses have been behind the lion's share of laboratory-confirmed cases, Professor Barr said: "It's about 75 per cent H3N2 and 25 per cent H1N1."The highest level of protection from a flu shot occurs during the three to four months after vaccination. (ABC: Emma Wynne)While there's very little B virus getting around — only comprising 0.2 per cent of laboratory-confirmed cases — the vaccine seems to be less effective against it, University of Queensland virologist Ian Mackay said."That's one to keep an eye on, because if it was to scale up or we were to get more cases of it from [travellers] introducing it into Australia … it could cause more disease."More potent vaccines for older AustraliansHow well the flu vaccine works also depends on your age and overall health.The NCIRS estimates the flu jab can prevent illness in about 50-60 per cent of young children and healthy adults under the age of 65, though this figure varies year by year.How do I know if I have flu or COVID?Photo shows Woman with respiratory illness, blowing her nose into handkerchief.Borders are open and COVID restrictions have eased and now cases of the flu have gone from "zero-to-full on". So, how do I know if COVID-19 or the flu?But older people and those with compromised immune systems may not respond as well to vaccination, meaning they may be less protected.That's why Australians over 65 are recommended one of two enhanced flu jabs, specifically designed to increase their immune system's response to the vaccine."They have an adjuvant [in the vaccine] or higher dose vaccine, basically because the immune system just needs more of an immune stimulant," Dr Wood said."For younger kids, their immune system is a bit more robust … it's the same thing we were seeing with COVID vaccines."How bad is this year's flu?While influenza can be a mild disease — leading to a few days off work with fever, aches and pains and a sore throat — it can also cause very serious illness, and should not be confused with the common cold."I think people get a bit complacent about the flu," Dr Mackay said."But we saw in 2017 and in 2019 very big flu years that had a lot of people in hospital. We saw deaths, ICU visits, and lots of time off work."Influenza is spread easily, mainly through large particle droplets produced by sneezing and coughing. (ABC News: Cason Ho)According to this year's annual FluTracking data, respiratory illness levels are "moderate and sharply increasing, particularly in children aged 17 and under".Officially reported numbers suggest influenza hospitalises around 5,100 people and kills 100 every year in Australia, but these figures are widely believed to under-represent the true burden of the disease.One mathematical modelling study in 2008 suggests the flu is likely responsible for more than 3,000 deaths and 13,500 hospitalisations each year, and that's just in people over the age of 50.It's never too late to get vaccinatedThe NCIRS recommends eligible Australians get their flu shot around April or May, when the flu season is starting to ramp up.Like some other vaccines, a flu shot's effectiveness wanes over time, but an April/May vaccine should still provide good protection when the flu season peaks in August or September.ABC Health in your Instagram feedFollow @abchealth on Instagram, where we're busting myths and sharing practical, smart health advice.If you're yet to get your flu shot this year, it's not too late, but try to get it as soon as you can so you get some protection, according to the NCIRS.As long as they're available to give, flu shots will be offered throughout the whole flu season.And if you've already had the flu? You should still get your shot.It will help reduce your risk of getting sick from other flu virus strains doing the rounds.Other ways to reduce your risk of catching the flu — and other diseases — should be pretty familiar by now: social distancing, wearing a face mask when around other people, washing your hands and staying at home.Posted Thu 26 May 2022 at 6:30pmThursday 26 May 2022 at 6:30pmThu 26 May 2022 at 6:30pm, updated Fri 27 May 2022 at 6:23amFriday 27 May 2022 at 6:23amFri 27 May 2022 at 6:23amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter) News in LanguageListen to the news in Warlpiri, Yolngu Matha and KriolListenTop StoriesDonald Trump calls Vladimir Putin and urges him not to escalate Ukraine war, media reportsTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Close up of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in conversation Dutton is already testing Trump's campaign slogans.

(Pixabay)abc.net.auews/how-to-know-if-i-have-flu-or-covid-symptoms-similar-vaccinate/101093612Link copiedShareShare articleCases of the flu are spiking around the country after the virus was forced underground for two years thanks to tight COVID-19 restrictions. Now the borders are open, restrictions have eased drastically and an expert says cases have gone from "zero to full-on". Figures from the federal government suggest cases started climbing weeks ago. And a rapid 130 per cent jump in flu cases early in the season prompted Queensland authorities to offer people free vaccine jabs.High cases in NSW have authorities thinking of doing the same.All of this is happening while the country records roughly 40,000 COVID cases per day. So, how do I know if I have COVID or the flu?It's really, really hard to know the difference from symptoms alone without a designated flu test. That's because the symptoms are so similar.With the exception of the loss of taste and smell in the case of COVID, the symptoms of the two are very similar."It's hard to know without a lab or good-quality test to know what that virus might be," says University of Queensland virologist Ian Mackay. "Flu has a muscle stiffness thing as well, headaches or a cough, it's really hard to differentiate one from the other without some sort of test."How dangerous is the flu?The rapid increase in flu cases appears to have cast influenza in a different light. The flu is a highly transmissible respiratory disease that has the potential to cause serious harm. (Unsplash: Kylie Sikkema)It's a highly transmissible respiratory disease that has the potential to cause serious harm. Sound familiar?Dr Mackay says a good way to think about it is to not get too far into the weeds about it all."When you look at crude numbers, most of the time SARS-CoV-2 is not going to kill you and most of the time influenza is not going to kill you, and it's not going to put you in ICU but sometimes it will," he says. "A large proportion of Australians have a condition that can be exacerbated by the flu."You don't know beforehand if that's going to happen to you, to your child or your grandparent."Read more about COVID-19:Do kids still need the COVID-19 vaccine in Australia?COVID cases are rising across Australia. Here's what we knowFLiRT is the new COVID causing subvariant, and it's been detected in AustraliaWhat precautions should I take then?This is where masks and physical distancing come in."Most obviously we've got this new measure which we didn't really use much before the pandemic and that's masks," Dr Mackay says. "That can help reduce our chances of getting infected and having it transmit to us."Loading...That's because COVID and the flu spread in very similar ways. "These are airborne viruses — and by airborne I mean they're not just droplets that require you to be close-range, if you like, for anything to be coughed onto you. "They [the virus] float around in clouds and the viruses can stay infectious in those aerosols for some time and you can breathe them in."It's important to remember we're not talking about different transmission routes here, there's no need to differentiate, we can treat them in similar ways."And if you're feeling unwell, stay home. "I've seen people at various workplaces coming in sick. We don't need to keep doing that, we need to understand our lives and illnesses impact others," Dr Mackay says."Stay home, if that's at all possible. If that's not possible, please get a well-fitting mask."Should I get the flu vaccine?For all their similarities, COVID and the flu require different vaccines.And while there's been a huge push to get the country vaccinated against COVID, so-called "vaccine exhaustion" has been a concern as healthcare workers urge people to get vaccinated against the flu.Australia became a world leader in COVID infectionsPhoto shows A man wearing a mask looking down the barrel of the camera With an election campaign, a war raging in Ukraine and cost of living rising, COVID-19 has dropped off the radar for some Australians. But experts say the number of daily cases and deaths is "extraordinary". "We have different vaccines for the two viruses," Dr Mackay says. "We're pretty well-vaccinated for COVID in this country, that's really great but we're often not well-vaccinated, as we often aren't, for influenza."That will need to change because with flu ripping through communities now at such a challenging pace, it's going to be important to try and prevent severe disease and we can do that."He says not being vaccinated is one of the biggest risks when it comes to the flu."The biggest risk is that we're not really well-vaccinated because we didn't really see much flu last year, or any flu the year before because of lockdown, " he says."We don't really have that vaccine immunity in our youngest children and they can be some of the most likely to end up in hospital because of the flu."Cases of the flu are climbing fastUsually, there's a gradual increase in flu cases over the cooler months. But that doesn't seem to be the case this year.There are no "foothills" in this graph recently released by Queensland Health. (Supplied: Queensland Health)Dr Mackay says we're experiencing a spike in cases early in the year."Some of that is due to increased lab capacity for flu testing, but the rate itself — or the amount of positives per number of samples tested — suggests a spike as well," he says. "We usually see a bit of a baseline, the foothills of the mountain if you like, as the season comes into play. "But this time we've gone from zero to full-on and it's not clear how high this peak will be, nor how long the flu season will last."So if you're looking to get vaccinated, now's the time to get it."How do I get a test for influenza?

(Supplied: Queensland Health)"We are seeing the impacts on our hospitals and if we don't get a vaccinated community with the flu vaccine, we are going to see escalating numbers in our hospitals."So we need to do a pre-emptive strike now — we need to make sure we have this preventative measure in place."Ms Palaszczuk said 151 people had been hospitalised with the flu so far, while 10 were in intensive care.The free flu vaccine is available to children as young as six months old. (ABC News: Alice Pavlovic)"The flu season this year is significantly bad and it's comparable to the season we had in 2017," she said.Ms Palaszczuk said young people aged between 10 and 30 were particularly at risk and warned symptoms would be similar to COVID-19.She said cost-of-living pressures were another reason she sought to make the vaccine accessible to all.'Frightening' case numbers worse than 2017 outbreakOf the two most common flu types in Australia, Influenza A is considered to cause far more severe symptoms than Influenza B.Acting Queensland Chief Health Officer Peter Aitken said cases of Influenza A will lead to more hospitalisations.He urged parents to get their children vaccinated as soon as possible as the virus commonly affects young people and older Australians."Vaccination rates for children six months to less than five years of age is just 6 per cent," Dr Aitken said.Health Minister Yvette D'Ath urged people to get vaccinated earlier this month. (Twitter: Annastacia Palaszczuk)Health Minister Yvette D'Ath said Influenza A had not circulated in Queensland in the past five years.Ms D'Ath said the 2017 flu season saw more than 750 people in intensive care."Our 2019 season saw about 300 people," she said."The fact that more than 4,000 cases have already been detected when flu seasons don't usually begin until late July is very concerning," she said."Ninety-eight per cent of our flu cases this year are Influenza A."Compared to the 2017 flu season's hospital admission rates, we are already at the admission rate that we saw at the end of July in 2017, which means this is escalating very quickly."Ms D'Ath said in the next two to three weeks, cases were expected to at least double."So we could end up with hospitalisation well over 400 or 500 hospital admissions and that won't be the peak," she said.The prediction comes after flu cases had been reduced to almost nil over the past two years following the implementation of COVID-19 lockdown and social distancing measures.[Qld local edition teaser]She said businesses should brace for staffing shortages over the winter months and encourage all staff members to get the free vaccine.Both the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Australian Medical Association (AMA) of Queensland have welcomed the move.AMA Queensland's Dr Bav Manoharan described the current flu cases as "astonishing"."We're really worried about the trajectory that this flu season is heading on … it's quite frightening," he said.Posted Mon 23 May 2022 at 4:12amMonday 23 May 2022 at 4:12amMon 23 May 2022 at 4:12am, updated Mon 23 May 2022 at 10:05amMonday 23 May 2022 at 10:05amMon 23 May 2022 at 10:05amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesDonald Trump calls Vladimir Putin and urges him not to escalate Ukraine war, media reportsTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Close up of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in conversation Dutton is already testing Trump's campaign slogans.

(Lisa Hupp/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) The new strain of bird flu that arrived in Alaska with the spring migration has now been detected in a fox that died in the Aleutian Islands. Wildlife officials say the red fox, as well as eagles, found dead in the Unalaska area, were most likely feeding on birds that had died from the H5N1 avian influenza. State veterinarian Dr. Bob Gerlach says that’s different from previous strains of bird flu. “We generally don’t see avian influenza causing problems in these species, but this is an unusual case,” Gerlach said. “So between that and the significant number of mortalities among waterfowl, it’s a concern and significant.” The H5N1 bird flu has caused the deaths of millions of poultry in the Lower 48, as well as wild birds and some foxes there. In early May, Alaska confirmed its first case of the virus. It was found in a non-commercial flock of chickens and ducks in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. But so far, wildlife officials say, it has not impacted domestic mammals in Alaska, and this strain and previous strains have not proven to be a significant health concern for humans or domesticated dogs and cats. Those pets could still be susceptible, and Gerlach says there are plenty of other reasons to keep pets away from wildlife, especially dead birds. “If there is a dead bird or dead animal there, we don’t know what they died from,” Gerlach said. “If it’s not influenza that’s transferred, it could be either bacteria or maybe another virus that is transferable, and the most common ones we see are salmonella and E. coli. And then obviously those can be transferred to people, too.” Alaskans harvesting birds or other wildlife for food are urged to use the usual safety precautions, like wearing gloves, thoroughly cooking meat and not eating animals that appear to have been sick. Anyone who sees a sick bird or one acting strangely, or the carcass of a bird, if the cause of its death is not readily apparent, can call the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Alaska Sick or Dead Bird Hotline. That number is 1-866-527-3358.

Request Media Kit Login More HealthIndustry UpdatesNews May 27, 2022 TV campaign urging people to get their flu shot The importance of getting a flu shot this season is being emphasised through the Pharmacy Guild of Australia’s TV ad campaign going to air nationally from 27 May. The advertisements highlight that the best way to protect yourself from the flu is to get vaccinated with vaccines available at your local community pharmacy. Acting National President of the Pharmacy Guild, Nick Panayiaris, said every indication was this would be a very severe flu season. “The combination of Covid-19 and a severe flu season makes having a vaccination all the more important this year to help prevent influenza and its complications,” he said. “Vaccination is a way to protect people from serious disease caused by influenza and getting vaccinated against the flu also helps protect other people, especially those who are too sick or too young to be vaccinated. “Last year influenza numbers were down, largely because of lockdowns and isolation. This year is anticipated to be a lot different and we are already seeing a resurgence of influenza infections and increased hospital presentations. “The Queensland Government’s decision to provide free flu shots is welcome and other States and Territories should also look at ways to help remove out-of-pocket costs as a barrier for patients in their jurisdiction.” Mr Panayiaris said many people failed to recognise how dangerous the flu was. “However, getting vaccinated is the way to protect yourself and your community,” he said. “Getting your flu shot at your community pharmacy is easy and convenient. “You can be confident in your local community pharmacists’ skills and ability. Pharmacists can vaccinate people across a wide range of ages, from children to elderly adults. In some States, pharmacists can vaccinate children from five years of age. “Community pharmacists are among Australia’s most accessible and trusted healthcare professionals and so are very well-placed to administer flu shots. “There is often no waiting time to receive a flu vaccine at a pharmacy. You can book an appointment to receive a flu vaccination through findapharmacy.com.au.” TagsActing National President of the Pharmacy Guildadvertisementfluflu shotflu vaccineNick PanayiarisPharmacy GuildQueensland Government’sTV campaign FacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsApp Previous articleA flu season in full forceNext articleFree flu vaccines are off to a great start Margaret Mielczarek RELATED ARTICLES Health Whooping cough outbreak worst on record Business Guild statement following ACCC decision Business PSA Annual Report FY 2023-24 released Business Chemist Warehouse Group welcomes ACCC clearance Health Scope of Practice review reiterates need for consistent, collaborative, multidisciplinary care Industry Updates APC response to Cormack Report Must Read Scope of Practice review reiterates need for consistent, collaborative, multidisciplinary care RP Editorial Team - November 6, 2024 0 Advanced Pharmacy Australia (AdPha) today welcomes the final report to the Unleashing the potential of our workforce – Scope of Practice Review which recognises...

Other States and Territories have not elected to introduce mandates at this stage, but many recommend up to date flu vaccinations for people attending facilities. This follows the Australia Health Protection Principal Committee’s ‘Statement on winter season preparedness’ which noted: all residents are strongly recommended to receive an influenza vaccination, aged care workers are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated against influenza; and visitors are strongly recommended to receive an influenza vaccine. Below is a summary of the current rules in each State and Territory as they apply to flu vaccinations in aged care (including a link to the relevant directions or guidelines): State/Territory Residents Visitors Employees Volunteers Mandate Effective Victoria Up to date influenza vaccination not required Up to date influenza vaccination not required Up to date vaccination against influenza required for workers in residential aged care services operated by public health services by 15 August 2022 and annually thereafter Up to date influenza vaccination not required As of 8 April 2022 New South Wales Recommended but not required Strongly recommended but not required Strongly recommended but not required Strongly recommended but not required South Australia Recommended but not required Requirement to be vaccinated against 2022 seasonal influenza Requirement to be vaccinated against 2022 seasonal influenza Requirement to be vaccinated against 2022 seasonal influenza As of 10 June 2022 Queensland Recommended but not required Strongly recommended but not required Strongly recommended but not required Strongly recommended but not required Western Australia Recommended but not required Up to date influenza vaccination required, if available to person Required if available to person Required if available to person As of 23 March 2022 Tasmania Strongly recommended but not required Strongly recommended but not required Strongly recommended but not required Strongly recommended but not required Northern Territory Up to date influenza vaccination required, if available to person Required if available to person Required if available to person Required if available to person As of 24 December 2021 ACT Recommended but not required Recommended but not required Recommended but not required Recommended but not required Exceptions In some States and Territories a person may be exempt from obtaining a flu vaccination, including if: the person has a documented medical contraindication to the influenza vaccine; or the health service has conducted a risk assessment and it is satisfied that it is safe for the worker to perform their role and that not employing the health care worker would result in a serious risk to patient care. There is no clear statement as to what a vaccination being “not available” to a person means. In our view, this is likely to include circumstances where there is a limited supply of the vaccine, eg in a remote area, or if person has a medical contraindication to the vaccine. It is unlikely that religious or cultural grounds would make a vaccine “not available” to a person. Additional obligations for residential aged care providers Providers should be mindful of their obligations under the Quality of Care Principles 2014 and the Records Principles 2014, which require providers to have an influenza vaccination program in place which: provides staff and volunteers access to free annual flu vaccination either on site or at a local chemist or GP; actively promotes the benefits of an annual vaccination for their staff and volunteers, and for the health outcomes of care recipients; and keeps a record of the number of staff that have the flu vaccination each year (whether or not under the provider’s flu vaccination scheme). Residential aged care, home care and other administration employees not covered by a public health order In the absence of a public health order, many factors indicate that an employer can issue a reasonable and lawful direction to require certain employees to provide evidence that they have received a flu vaccination in order to continue to work. For example, all direct care workers have personal contact with clients and, in the case of home care, possibly other household members and visitors who may also attend the workplace. We expect that a vaccination direction to a home care worker would be lawful and reasonable because home care workers may spread the infection from one client to another and clients are often receiving services because they are vulnerable. It may also be appropriate to implement the same rule for other administrative based employees who have contact with direct care workers. The Fair Work Commission has previously decided that, subject to implementing an appropriate process, a direction to home care workers to be vaccinated will be lawful and reasonable. Refusal to comply with it will be a valid reason for the termination of employment (see our previous Alert). However, it may not be reasonable to require a worker to be vaccinated if they will not have contact with vulnerable clients, or if they will not be at risk of spreading the virus. Often office-based workers who work from home may fall into this category of employees (Alexander James Marriott v Baptcare [2022] FWC 300 and Evelyn Paul v Ozcare [2022] FWC 1139). It is extremely important to check all terms and conditions of employment, follow a proper process and obtain advice prior to issuing a direction to employees who are not covered by a public health order to be vaccinated against the flu.

Raj Nadarajan/TODAY The public announcement of Dorscon levels had the unintended consequence of inducing public anxiety during the Covid-19 pandemic and sparked panic buying at supermarkets. By Hsu Li Yang By Hsu Li Yang Published May 23, 2022 Updated August 25, 2022 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn When the Covid-19 multi-ministry task force (MTF) announced that the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) level was to be adjusted from Orange to Yellow on April 26, it was met with a general sense of bemusement. Was Dorscon still relevant and did this adjustment really matter? This question was obliquely answered by Health Minister Ong Ye Kung in Parliament on May 9, when he mentioned that the Dorscon framework was a tool for government agencies to coordinate and execute the Government’s response to outbreaks. He expressed his concern that the public announcement of Dorscon levels had the unintended consequence of inducing public anxiety during the Covid-19 pandemic, and added that the Dorscon framework would be reviewed. WHAT IS THE DORSCON FRAMEWORK? Following the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) epidemic in 2003 and the avian influenza A(H5N1) outbreak in Indonesia in 2004, the Ministry of Health (MOH) developed the National Influenza Pandemic Readiness and Response Plan in 2005, which described the Dorscon framework for the first time. This would communicate the extent of the risk faced by the community, and be tied to the public health actions deemed necessary to mitigate the impact of these infectious diseases. It made intuitive sense then — and now — to have an easily understandable public alert system for infectious diseases of pandemic potential, in addition to its primary role in focusing governmental outbreak responses. There were five Dorscon alert levels initially, which at the time were coupled to the six World Health Organization (WHO) pandemic alert phases that were developed in 1999 and revised in 2005 (Table 1). These levels were thus pegged to the transmissibility — but not virulence (that is, the deadliness of an infection) — of an epidemic virus. In 2009, WHO tweaked the six pandemic alert phases for more specific and understandable trigger points, at the same time adding in a “post-peak period” and “post-pandemic period” for the provision of guidance on potential public health actions following the peak of a pandemic wave. Infographic: Anam Musta'ein EVOLUTION OF THE DORSCON FRAMEWORK The Dorscon framework was first tested in a “no duff” situation during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. The Dorscon level was duly raised to Orange on April 30, 2009 at the height of the pandemic in Singapore, but was quickly lowered to Yellow 11 days later in view of the relatively modest impact of the pandemic in Singapore. In this initial test, it was quickly decoupled from the WHO pandemic alert system —the WHO had raised its alert to Phase 6 and declared a pandemic only on June 11, 2009. Although the novel influenza virus had spread rapidly worldwide, its impact was mild especially relative to the prior experience of the 1918 influenza pandemic and the high mortality rates seen with avian influenza H5N1. This led to criticisms of the WHO pandemic alert system for its failure to include virulence as a criterion along with geographic spread. In 2014, MOH revised its National Influenza Pandemic Readiness and Response Plan and specifically addressed the issue of the virulence and public health impact of a potential epidemic virus. For a virulent virus capable of causing severe public health impact, more strict and sustained measures aimed at containing its spread could be implemented. Conversely, for a mild disease with low public health impact, a rapid shift towards reducing community impact rather than maintaining containment measures that were more restrictive and costly could be made. This was reflected in the modifications made to the Dorscon framework, which no longer mapped closely to the WHO pandemic alert phases and had the “black” colour code removed. While the new Dorscon framework was somewhat more complicated, with different potential scenarios and linked public health actions for each colour-coded level, it arguably made more sense and remained relatively easy to understand for the public. DORSCON AND COVID-19 This modified framework was tested during the Covid-19 pandemic. With the appearance of the highly transmissible Sars-CoV-2 capable of causing severe disease and death in Wuhan at the end of 2019, the Dorscon level was raised to Yellow and then quickly and publicly to Orange on Feb 7, 2020 when community cases of Covid-19 without epidemiological links to prior cases were diagnosed in Singapore. However, it stayed at Orange for the next two years, and was barely mentioned in official updates throughout this period, during which Singapore experienced a lockdown and numerous restrictions on social activities and travel amidst large waves of infections and deaths caused by the Delta and Omicron variants of SarsS-CoV-2. It seemed clear to many people in the community that the publicly published criteria for Dorscon Red had been broadly met at various points over the past two years. But the MTF had just as stolidly denied this — then Health Minister Gan Kim Yong had clarified that Red meant “uncontrollable outbreaks” — even as they had implemented virtually all the public health actions linked to Red in the revised National Influenza Pandemic Readiness and Response Plan of 2014. This led initially to many satirical social media posts on the multiple shades of Orange, but eventually to a numbed amnesia of Dorscon until the recent MTF announcement. MOVING FORWARD Can we ditch the Dorscon framework altogether or else not publicise it? This has more drawbacks than benefits, as an individualised risk communication strategy for each major epidemic will still be greatly aided by an overarching predictable risk impact framework. As an example, the various phases to reopening Singapore during this pandemic — while enabling a more granular approach — are highly specific to Covid-19 and also confusing with its multiple permutations. Looking ahead, it is clear that the original aims of the Dorscon framework remain valid even with the experience of the current Covid-19 pandemic. The issue of escalating public anxiety occurring with the raising of Dorscon levels is a predictable phenomenon and may be mitigated by better public communication. Stockpiling and “panic buying” also occurred when new social distancing restrictions were announced in late 2020, even though the Dorscon level stayed at Orange. In the process of reviewing the Dorscon framework, it will be important that the baby is not thrown out with the bathwater. The public and the government agencies should have the same understanding of what each level means and perhaps more importantly, the criteria for moving between levels. Certain lessons from Covid-19, such as the importance of the capacity of the healthcare system and our supply chains, can be more clearly articulated for a future Dorscon framework and pandemic preparedness plan. If the Dorscon framework is revised, it should not end up being more complicated and difficult to follow in an effort to capture more potential eventualities and scenarios.

According to the GHS, this influenza virus easily mutates with adults usually having stronger immunity. Symptoms of H3N2v include fever with cough and a runny nose.Other possible symptoms are body aches, nausea, chills, vomiting, or diarrhoea.The GHS added that the virus could sometimes cause severe diseases like pneumonia, which could lead to hospitalization and at the worst result in death.All matches involving the Ghana Premier League club Accra Hearts of Oak have been postponed after the virus was confirmed among the players.The Game Week 30 fixture involving Hearts of Oak and Eleven Wonders was postponed by the Ghana Football Association (GFA) following the outbreak of the disease.“Our match against Eleven Wonders has been postponed following advice from the Ghana Health Service.

English version, 25 May 2022 11:32 Scientists think vaccination against bird flu is an option By Yulia Makeeva / Translated by Xenia Rakhmanova According to Viktor Irza, the chief poultry expert of the Federal Center for Animal Health of the Rosselkhoznadzor (FSBI ARRIAH), Russian scientists suggest authorizing vaccination against highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry farms. Photo by Aleksandr Plonskii /V&L “In view of a very challenging animal health situation, we suggest allowing vaccination in both parent and commercial flocks, including laying hens and turkeys,’ Victor Irza said. According to the expert, the risk for the industry is relatively low. The vaccination hasn’t been introduced earlier due to complications that arise when a product is meant for export. “In light of the potential risk of field strains circulation, we would have to constantly demonstrate to the competent authorities of the importing countries the effectiveness of the surveillance procedures in vaccinated flocks. Constant maintenance of this status would be very complex, time-consuming work, that requires analysis of large amounts of biomaterials and sera. That used to be a deterrent. Now the global situation has changed. The panzootic has emerged. And trends in disease severity, development and spread across countries and continents remain unclear”, explained Victor Irza. FGBI ARRIAH has already submitted its opinion to the Rosselkhoznadsor. Scientists don’t suggest overall vaccination of every commercial flock, but only in those, that suffered from avian influenza in 2020, and 2021. Moreover, vaccination is subject to close monitoring by regional animal health authorities. “Besides that, the cost of the vaccine should be covered by enterprises, not from the funds of the state budget, as it had been done at backyard farms”, the expert added. Reminder: vaccination against avian influenza is allowed only in backyard farms and free range poultry operations. Vaccination in commercial flocks is currently prohibited. Earlier, the Russian Union of Poultry Producers (Rosptitsesoyuz) reached out to the Ministry of Agriculture, suggesting a review of the avian influenza vaccination strategy, and permission to be granted for parent flock vaccination in farms with the highest potential risk of outbreak. As Mikhail Volkov, head of Laboratory for Epizootology and Monitoring of the Federal Center for Animal Health (FGBI “ARRIAH”) has earlier explained to V&L, one of the primary benefits of vaccination against highly pathogenic avian influenza is a minimized financial loss. Over the past year, HPAI outbreaks were confirmed in 22 regions of Russia and more than 6 million birds were destroyed. “Vaccination helps to maintain breeder and parent flocks, and minimizes food safety risks,” said Mikhail Volkov. As V&L covered earlier, FGBI ARRIAH scientists are working on a vaccine against highly pathogenic avian influenza.

(Nine)Premier Daniel Andrews today said the government was in "deep discussions" with the Pharmacy Guild and Australian Medical Association about making flu shots free."We're working on that very issue," he said. Mum of two Erin Lisk has had her kids vaccinated and says it's now an important part of their annual routine. "One just started school this year and our younger one is at childcare, everyone has COVID-19, the flu or gastro, so it's super important," she said."It's quite terrifying, like the prospect of getting COVID-19 and flu at the same time."A new study by paediatric specialists has confirmed not all parents are on the same page."We found only half of Australian kids are likely to be vaccinated for flu this year," Royal Children's Hospital National Child Health Poll Director Dr Anthea Rhodes said. The RCH study found the cost can also be a barrier to getting vaccinated, with one in three families worried about the expense.

(Nine)There's already been close to 12,000 influenza cases recorded in Victoria this year, but the vaccination take-up is only around 12 per cent for kids aged under five.Rhodes said the flu vaccine was the most effective way to protect children against the flu. "It will reduce the chance of catching the flu in the first place – and it will also reduce the chance of serious illness," she said."Times are tough. Petrol prices are going up, food prices are going up and families are struggling."Making the flu vaccine free would almost certainly make a difference to the rates of uptake."Continue readinghealthAustraliaVictoriaMelbournemoneyfluInfluenzavaccinehospitalschildrennationalCONTACT USSend your stories to contact@9news.com.auAuto news: Most significant change to Tesla in three years.
