Influenza vaccination coverage among healthcare personnel (HCP) in acute care hospitals declined during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the prepandemic period.
In the prepandemic period, influenza vaccination coverage among HCP increased from 88.6% in 2017-18 to 90.7% in 2019-20.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of HCP vaccinated against influenza decreased to 85.9% in 2020-21 and 81.1% in 2022-23.
Efforts are needed to implement evidence-based strategies to increase vaccination coverage among HCP and protect other HCP and patients from influenza-related morbidity and mortality.
