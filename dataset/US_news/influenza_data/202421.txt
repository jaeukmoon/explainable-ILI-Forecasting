Microscopy by CDC; repositioned and recolored by NIAID.CDC and NIAID What Mice administered raw milk samples from dairy cows infected with H5N1 influenza experienced high virus levels in their respiratory organs and lower virus levels in other vital organs, according to findings published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The results suggest that consumption of raw milk by animals poses a risk for H5N1 infection and raises questions about its potential risk in humans. Since 2003, H5N1 influenza viruses have circulated in 23 countries, primarily affecting wild birds and poultry with about 900 human cases, primarily among people who have had close contact with infected birds. In the past few years, however, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus called HPAI H5N1 has spread to infect more than 50 animal species, and in late March, the United States reported a viral outbreak among dairy cows in Texas. To date, 52 cattle herds across nine states have been affected, with two human infections detected in farm workers with conjunctivitis. Although the virus has so far shown no genetic evidence of acquiring the ability to spread from person-to-person, public health officials are closely monitoring the dairy cow situation as part of overarching pandemic preparedness efforts. To assess the risk of H5N1 infection by consuming raw milk, researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory fed droplets of raw milk from infected dairy cattle to five mice. The animals demonstrated signs of illness, including lethargy, on day one and were euthanized on day four to determine organ virus levels. The researchers discovered high levels of virus in the animals’ nasal passages, trachea and lungs and moderate-to-low virus levels in other organs, consistent with H5N1 infections found in other mammals. In addition to the mice studies, the researchers also tested to determine which temperatures and time intervals inactivate H5N1 virus in raw milk from dairy cows. Four milk samples with confirmed high H5N1 levels were tested at 63 degrees Celsius (145.4 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5, 10, 20 and 30 minutes, or at 72 degrees Celsius (161.6 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5, 10, 15, 20 and/or 30 seconds. Each of the time intervals at 63℃ successfully killed the virus. At 72℃, virus levels were diminished but not completely inactivated after 15 and 20 seconds. The authors emphasize, however, that their laboratory study was not identical to large-scale industrial pasteurization of raw milk and reflect experimental conditions that should be replicated with direct measurement of infected milk in commercial pasteurization equipment. In a separate experiment, the researchers stored raw milk infected with H5N1 at 4℃ (39.2 degrees Fahrenheit) for five weeks and found only a small decline in virus levels, suggesting that the virus in raw milk may remain infectious when maintained at refrigerated temperatures. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concludes that the totality of evidence continues to indicate that the commercial milk supply is safe. While laboratory benchtop studies provide important, useful information, there are limitations that challenge inferences to real world commercial processing and pasteurization. The FDA conducted an initial survey of 297 retail dairy products collected at retail locations in 17 states and represented products produced at 132 processing locations in 38 states. All of the samples were found to be negative for viable virus. These results underscore the opportunity to conduct additional studies that closely replicate real world conditions. FDA, in partnership with USDA, is conducting pasteurization validation studies – including the use of a homogenizer and continuous flow pasteurizer. Additional results will be made available as soon as they are available.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses from H5 clade 2.3.4.4b are circulating at unprecedently high levels in wild and domestic birds and have the potential to adapt to humans. Here, we generate an mRNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vaccine encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein from a clade 2.3.4.4b H5 isolate. The H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine elicits strong T cell and antibody responses in female mice, including neutralizing antibodies and broadly-reactive anti-HA stalk antibodies. The H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine elicits antibodies at similar levels compared to whole inactivated vaccines in female mice with and without prior H1N1 exposures. Finally, we find that the H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine is immunogenic in male ferrets and prevents morbidity and mortality of animals following 2.3.4.4b H5N1 challenge. Together, our data demonstrate that a monovalent mRNA-LNP vaccine expressing 2.3.4.4b H5 is immunogenic and protective in pre-clinical animal models.

Long-distance migration of wild birds has enabled the rapid transcontinental spread of these HPAI viruses, as evidenced by past H5 outbreaks in 2005-2006, 2014-2015, and 2016-20173,4,5. Upon re-emerging in 2020, Gs/Gd lineage H5 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b have circulated at historically high levels in wild and domestic bird populations across Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and North and South America2,6,7,8.2.3.4.4b H5 viruses have persisted with outbreaks continuing uncharacteristically over the summer seasons, wreaking havoc on the poultry industry and resulting in high rates of wild bird mortality6,9,10,11. In comparison to previous H5 outbreaks, a wider range of wild and domestic bird species have been affected by the spread of clade 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses since 202012,13. There have also been occasional human infections and increasing incidences of clade 2.3.4.4b H5 virus spillover into mammals such as cows, red foxes, seals, and minks14,15,16,17. Some viruses isolated from infected mammals contain genetic mutations associated with mammalian adaptation, highlighting the potential risk an expanded host range can pose13,15,17,18,19,20.Our laboratory and others previously demonstrated that mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vaccines encoding influenza virus HA induce potent immune responses in mice, rabbits, and ferrets, and clinical trials confirm their safety and immunogenicity in humans21,22,23,24. We recently developed a multivalent mRNA-LNP vaccine that encodes an HA protein from every influenza virus subtype, including clade 1 H524. This multivalent vaccine protects experimentally infected animals against severe disease and death when challenge strains are antigenically mismatched to the vaccine immunogens24; however, the vaccine is not expected to elicit neutralizing antibodies and sterilizing immunity against mismatched influenza virus strains, such as clade 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses. It is therefore important to also develop tailored-made vaccines precisely matched to influenza virus strains with high pandemic potential.Here, we create a monovalent mRNA-LNP encoding HA from a 2.3.4.4b virus and we test this vaccine in mice and ferrets. We show that the vaccine is immunogenic in mice with and without prior H1N1 exposures. Mice that receive the H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine produce antibodies that efficiently neutralize the 2.3.4.4b H5 virus, as well as antibodies that can bind to the HA stalk of diverse H5 viruses. We show that the vaccine is also immunogenic in ferrets and prevents morbidity and mortality of ferrets following the 2.3.4.4b H5N1 challenge.Results2.3.4.4b HA mRNA-LNP is immunogenic in miceWe created a monovalent nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccine encoding HA from the clade 2.3.4.4b A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 virus. We vaccinated female mice with 1 or 10 μg of H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine or 10 μg of a control mRNA-LNP vaccine expressing an irrelevant protein (Ovalbumin), and quantified serum antibody levels using ELISAs and neutralization assays. Both doses of the H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine elicited high levels of antibodies that bound to the full-length HA protein of A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 (Fig. 1A) and a ‘headless’ H5 stalk protein (Fig. 1B). Both doses of the vaccine also elicited antibodies that neutralized virus expressing the A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 HA (Fig. 1C). Serum antibody titers remained at high levels 1 year after vaccination (Fig. 1A–C).Fig. 1: Clade 2.3.4.4b H5 HA mRNA-LNP vaccine elicits long-lasting antibody responses in mice.Five mice were included per experimental group. Mice were vaccinated i.m. with 1 or 10 μg A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 HA mRNA-LNP (H5 mRNA-LNP) or 10 µg Ovalbumin mRNA-LNP (control mRNA-LNP). Serum samples were collected from mice at 28, 100, and 365 days after vaccination and serum IgG reactive to the A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 recombinant full-length HA protein (A) or ‘headless’ H5 stalk protein (B) were quantified by ELISA. C A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 neutralizing antibodies were also quantified by a 50% Foci reduction neutralization test (FRNT50); reciprocal dilutions of serum required to inhibit 50% virus infection are shown. All data are shown as geometric means ± 95% confidence intervals. Data were compared using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.

Relative to the A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 H5 vaccine immunogen, the Aed fox/England/AVP-M1-21-01/2020 HA possesses P152S and S336N substitutions, and the A/pheasant/New York/22-009066-001/2022 HA possesses L120M, V226A, and I526V HA substitutions. The A/Astrakhan-3212/2020-based H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine elicited antibodies that bound (Fig. 2A, B) and neutralized (Fig. 2C, D) both Aed fox/England/AVP-M1-21-01/2020 and A/pheasant/New York/22-009066-001/2022. Antibody titers against these variant viruses were ~3-fold lower compared to A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 titers (Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 2: Clade 2.3.4.4b H5 HA mRNA-LNP vaccine elicits antibodies that bind and neutralize different clade 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses.Five mice were included per experimental group.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageSince we found that the vaccine elicits high levels of antibodies that bind to the H5 stalk (Fig. 1B), we completed additional experiments to determine if these antibodies could bind to diverse H5 proteins via multianalyte bead-based experiments. Consistent with our initial experiments, we found that both doses of vaccine elicited antibodies that could bind to beads coupled with the 2.3.4.4b HAs from A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 (Fig. 3A), Aed fox/England/AVP-M1-21-01/2020 (Fig. 3B), and A/pheasant/New York/22-009066-001/2022 (Fig. 3C). The vaccine also elicited antibodies that bound to beads coupled with the HAs of a clade 1 virus (A/Vietnam/1203/2004; Fig. 3D), a clade 2.3.2.1a virus (A/Hubei/1/2010; Fig. 3E), and a clade 2.1.3.2 virus (A/Indonesia/5/2005; Fig. 3F), albeit binding was at reduced levels compared to binding to HAs from clade 2.3.4.4b viruses.Fig. 3: Clade 2.3.4.4b H5 HA mRNA-LNP vaccine elicits antibodies that bind to diverse H5 viruses.Groups of five mice were vaccinated i.m. with 1 or 10 µg A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 HA mRNA-LNP (H5 mRNA-LNP) or 10 µg Ovalbumin mRNA-LNP (control). Serum samples were collected 28 days after vaccination and serum antibody binding to HA proteins from diverse of H5 viral strains was determined using a bead-based multiplex binding assay.

For these experiments, we analyzed cells 10 days after vaccinating mice with 1 μg of H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine or 1 μg of a control mRNA-LNP vaccine. We found that the H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine elicited HA-specific CD8+ T cell responses (Fig. 4A, B). The H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine elicited polyfunctional CD8+ CD44high CD62Llo T cells expressing Th1-associated cytokines IFNγ (Fig. 4C) and TNFα (Fig. 4D).Fig. 4: Clade 2.3.4.4b H5 HA mRNA-LNP vaccine elicits robust CD8+ T cell responses.Five mice per group were vaccinated i.m. with 1 μg A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 HA mRNA-LNP (H5 mRNA-LNP) or 1 μg Ovalbumin mRNA-LNP (control).

Since most humans have pre-existing immunity to seasonal influenza virus strains, we tested both vaccine types in mice with and without previous exposure to the A/California/07/2009 H1N1 virus (Fig. 5A). For these experiments, we immunized mice with either 1 µg of H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine or 50 hemagglutinating units (HAU) of an inactivated H5 vaccine. As expected, mice previously exposed to H1N1 possessed antibodies that bound to (Fig. 5B) and neutralized (Fig. 5C) A/California/07/2009, and these antibodies were not detected in mice without prior H1N1 exposure. The monovalent H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine elicited higher levels of antibodies that bound to the A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 HA compared to the inactivated vaccine, and antibody levels were similar in mice with and without prior H1N1 exposure (Fig. 5D). The two different vaccines elicited similar levels of A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 neutralizing antibodies in mice with and without prior H1N1 exposure (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these data suggest that both the monovalent H5 mRNA-LNP and inactivated H5 vaccine elicit robust antibody responses in mice previously exposed to H1N1 virus.Fig. 5: Clade 2.3.4.4b H5 HA mRNA-LNP vaccine and inactivated H5 vaccine elicit robust antibody responses in mice previously exposed to H1N1 virus.A Timeline for infections and vaccinations. Groups of 4-5 mice were uninfected or infected i.n. with 1000 TCID50 of A/California/07/2009 virus and then vaccinated i.m. 90 days later with either 1 µg of A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 HA mRNA-LNP (mRNA) or 50 HAU of an inactivated A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 vaccine (inactivated vaccine). Sera were isolated 30 days after vaccination and IgG antibody titers were measured using ELISA plates coated with HA from A/California/07/2009 (B) and A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 (D). 50% Foci reduction neutralization test (FRNT50) titers were determined using viruses expressing the HAs from A/California/07/2009 (C) and A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 (E). For the ‘no vaccineo prior exposure’ group, we tested serum obtained from mice before initiating the experiment. All data are shown as geometric means ± 95% confidence intervals. Data were compared using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. Values were log-transformed before statistical analysis. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments.

Animals were primed with 60 μg of mRNA-LNP vaccine encoding H5 or an irrelevant protein (Luciferase) and then boosted 28 days later with the same vaccine. Ferrets vaccinated with H5 mRNA-LNP produced high levels of antibodies that bound and neutralized both the A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 (Fig. 6A, B) and A/pheasant/New York/22-009066-001/2022 (Fig. 6C, D) viruses. The second dose of H5 mRNA-LNP boosted H5-reactive antibody levels ~8-fold higher relative to before the boost. Antibody titers against A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 and A/pheasant/New York/22-009066-001/2022 were similar (Supplementary Fig. 2). Similar to our murine experiments, we found that the vaccine elicited antibodies that bound to a ‘headless’ H5 stalk (Fig. 6E, F).Fig. 6: Clade 2.3.4.4b H5 HA mRNA-LNP vaccine elicits antibodies in ferrets.Four ferrets per group were immunized with 60 μg A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 HA mRNA-LNP (H5 mRNA-LNP) or Luciferase mRNA-LNP (control), followed by a 60 μg boost 28 days later. Ferret serum samples were collected before vaccination and 28 days after each vaccination. A, B A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 and (C, D) A/pheasant/New York/22-009066-001/2022 serum IgG binding and 50% Foci reduction neutralization test (FRNT50) titers were quantified. Reciprocal dilutions of serum required to inhibit 50% virus infection are shown in panels (B) and (D).

The HAs of the A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 vaccine strain and the A/bald eagle/Florida/W22-134-OP/2022 challenge strain differ by 4 amino acids. All four H5 mRNA-LNP-vaccinated ferrets survived the H5N1 challenge, while all Luciferase mRNA-LNP-vaccinated animals reached clinical endpoint by 7 days post-challenge (Fig. 7A). Luciferase mRNA-LNP-vaccinated animals lost more weight (Fig. 7B), had detectable levels of virus in nasal washes for longer amounts of time (Fig. 7C), and displayed more clinical signs (Fig. 7D) relative to H5 mRNA-LNP-vaccinated animals.Fig. 7: H5 HA mRNA-LNP vaccine protects ferrets from clade 2.3.4.4b H5 virus infection.Four ferrets per group were immunized with 60 μg A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 HA mRNA-LNP (H5 mRNA-LNP) or Luciferase mRNA-LNP (control), followed by a 60 μg boost 28 days later.

We found that the vaccine elicits robust antibody and CD8+ T cell responses in mice, and we detected high levels of H5 antibodies 1 year after a single vaccination. The vaccine elicited neutralizing antibodies and broadly binding HA stalk antibodies in both mice and ferrets. In challenge experiments, we detected the virus in nasal washes obtained from vaccinated ferrets but these animals cleared the virus more rapidly than unvaccinated controls. Vaccinated ferrets lost less weight and displayed less clinical symptoms compared to unvaccinated animals after H5N1 challenge. All of the vaccinated animals in our study survived, whereas all of the unvaccinated animals died following the H5N1 challenge.We found that the monovalent clade 2.3.4.4b H5 mRNA-LNP and an inactivated H5 vaccine both elicited high levels of antibodies in mice. It is difficult to directly compare these two different vaccine platforms, since it is unclear how vaccine doses in mice relate to vaccine doses in humans. We used a relatively low dose of mRNA-LNP vaccine (1 µg) and a relatively high dose of inactivated vaccine (50 HAU) for these comparative studies. Our experiments demonstrated that both vaccines elicited similar amounts of binding antibodies and no significant differences in neutralizing antibodies regardless of prior H1N1 exposures. A phase 1 study demonstrated that inactivated clade 2.3.4.4c H5N8 was well tolerated in humans and immunogenicity improved with higher vaccine amounts and multiple doses of adjuvanted vaccine28. It will be important to compare the clade 2.3.4.4b H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine to other vaccine platforms. A recent study demonstrated that a parainfluenza-based H5 vaccine delivered intranasally elicited antibodies that recognized diverse H5 proteins and protected animals against heterologous viral challenge, potentially through the induction of mucosal IgA responses29. A separate study demonstrated that recombinant A/Astrakhan/321/2020 HA proteins and propiolactone inactivated A/Astrakhan/321/2020 virus were both immunogenic in mice30.Our study has some limitations. We did not complete experiments to determine if the vaccine elicits antibodies that could neutralize H5 viruses from different clades. We found that the vaccine elicits antibodies that bind to the HAs of A/Vietnam/1203/2004, A/Hubei/1/2010, and A/Indonesia/5/2005; however, it is likely that the observed cross-clade HA binding is mediated by non-neutralizing HA stalk antibodies. Another limitation is that we did not comprehensively test the H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine in animals with different prior exposures. We found that the vaccine elicits robust responses in mice previously exposed to H1N1 and additional studies should test how different prior exposures in mice and ferrets impact immunogenicity of the vaccine.There are many potential benefits of mRNA-LNP based vaccines compared to inactivated vaccines. For example, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, conventional monovalent vaccines were distributed but there were manufacturing difficulties and these vaccines were not widely available until after the initial pandemic H1N1 viral waves subsided31. The capacity to make mRNA-LNPs has expanded widely since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and rapid production of mRNA-LNP vaccines is now possible. Notably, mRNA-LNP vaccines can be rapidly produced without first isolating and adapting viral strains that grow efficiently in fertilized chicken eggs or cell culture. It is now possible to start creating novel mRNA-LNP vaccines within hours of sequencing a new pandemic viral strain.It will be important to evaluate the clade 2.3.4.4b H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine in birds and other animals that could potentially serve as an intermediate host to humans, such as swine and cattle. The recent 2.3.4.4b H5 bovine outbreak is particularly alarming, due to the high number of apparent infections and potential human exposures. Our studies highlight the flexibility of the mRNA vaccine platform which allows for rapid development and precise antigenic matching of vaccine immunogens to emerging influenza virus strains with pandemic potential.MethodsmRNA-LNP productionThe HA sequence of A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 (H5) was codon-optimized, gene-synthesized by GenScript, and cloned into an mRNA production vector. mRNAs were then produced as previously described32 using T7 RNA polymerase (Megascript, Ambion) on linearized plasmids. mRNAs were transcribed to contain 101 nucleotide-long poly(A) tails. Modified nucleoside-containing mRNA was generated using m1Ψ-UTP (TriLink) instead of UTP. In vitro, transcribed mRNAs were co-transcriptionally capped using the CleanCap (TriLink), and the mRNA purified using cellulose chromatography, as previously described33. All mRNAs were analyzed using native agarose gel electrophoresis, and tested to dsRNA and endotoxin content using dot blot and the LAL chromogenic assay respectively before storage at −20 °C.Cellulose-purified, nucleoside-modified mRNAs were encapsulated in LNP using a self-assembly process as previously described34 in which an ethanolic lipid mixture was rapidly mixed with an aqueous solution containing mRNA at pH = 4.0. The LNP used here contains an ionizable cationic lipid, phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol-lipid. The LNP has a mean hydrodynamic diameter of ~80 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.02–0.06 and an encapsulation efficiency of ~95%. The assembled mRNA-LNP were stored at −80 °C at a concentration of 1 μg/μL.Mouse experimentsAll murine experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Wistar Institute and the University of Pennsylvania. Mice were housed in ventilated, ducted Innovive racks with a 12- h light/dark cycle. The temperature and humidity are maintained according to The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC), with temperatures averaging 70–72 F and percent humidity averaging in 30’s. Female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories) aged 6–8 weeks were immunized intramuscularly with 1-10 μg of mRNA-LNP vaccine encoding either H5 or ovalbumin. For immunizations, mRNA-LNPs were diluted in 50 μl PBS, and 25 μl was injected in each hind leg. Blood samples were obtained by submandibular bleeding 28, 100, and 365 days after vaccination, and sera were isolated by centrifugation using Z-Gel tubes (Sarsedt). For T cell experiments, spleens were harvested 10 days after vaccination.H1N1 prior exposure experiments in miceFor some experiments, female C57BL/6 mice aged 6-8 weeks were intranasally infected with 1000 TCID50 of A/California/07/2009 diluted in 20 µL of PBS. For these experiments, the A/California/07/2009 virus possessed a D225G HA mutation that increases infectivity in mice as previously reported35. These mice were then immunized intramuscularly with either 1 µg of H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine or 50 hemagglutinating units (HAU) of an inactivated H5 vaccine 90 days after A/California/08/2009 infection. We also immunized mice without prior H1N1 exposure intramuscularly with either 1 µg of H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine or 50 HAU of an inactivated H5 vaccine. Serum was obtained 30 days after vaccination. The inactivated vaccine was produced by β-propiolactone (BPL) inactivation of concentrated egg-grown CBER-RG8A (contains HA and NA from A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 (H5N8)) virus at the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Any mice with prior exposure to A/California/07/2009 that did not develop binding and neutralizing antibodies to A/California/07/2009 were determined to not have been properly infected and were removed from our analyses.Ferret experimentsFerret studies were approved by the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol number 428) in accordance with the guidelines established by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, approved by the Governing Board of the US National Research Council, and carried out by trained personnel working in a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-inspected Animal Biosafety Level 3+ animal facility in accordance with all regulations established by the Division of Agricultural Select Agents and Toxins (DASAT) at the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), as governed by the United States Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP) regulations (7 CFR Part 331, 9 CFR Part 121.3, 42 CFR Part 73.3). This study utilized USDA-classified select agents and A(H5N1) viruses used herein are subject to the guidelines of, and compliance with, requirements discussed in Title 9 (CFR Parts 121 [Possession, Use, and Transfer of Select Agent Toxins] and 122 [Importation and Transportation of Controlled Organisms and Vectors]). Four-to-six-month-old influenza-seronegative male ferrets (Triple F Farms, Sayre, PA, USA) were primed with 60 μg of mRNA-LNP vaccine encoding H5 (n = 4 animals) or an irrelevant protein (Luciferase, n = 4 animals) and then boosted 28 days later with the same vaccine. Blood samples were collected 28 days after each vaccine dose. Animals were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane 28 days after the second vaccination and inoculated intranasally with 106 EID50 units of A/bald eagle/Florida/ W22-134-OP/2022 (H5N1) diluted in 1.0 mL of PBS. All animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of infection. Characteristics monitored included body temperature, weight loss, relative inactivity indices, ataxia, respiratory symptoms, stool consistency, and neuropathologic signs. Animals reaching the humane endpoint, according to an IACUC-approved clinical scoring system, were euthanized. Nasal washes were collected from all surviving ferrets at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days post-infection (dpi). Ketamine was used to induce sneezing. Viral titers were determined in MDCK cells by TCID50 assay.Recombinant influenza virus HA proteinsRecombinant HA (rHA) proteins were generated using pCMV-Sport6 vectors encoding full-length, codon-optimized HA sequences from A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 (EPI ID 1038924), A/pheasant/New York/22-009066-001/2022 (EPI ID 11971502), Aed fox/England/AVP-M1-21-01/2020 (EPI ID 2081527), A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (EPI ID 116507), A/Hubei/1/2010 (Genbank CY098760.1), A/Indonesia/5/2005 (Genbank CY116648.1), or the “headless” HA stalk of A/Vietnam/1203/2004. For each of these proteins, the HA transmembrane domain was replaced with the Foldon T4 trimerization domain of T4 fibritin, an Avitag site-specific biotinylation sequence, and a hexahistidine tag as described previously36. To produce the recombinant proteins, rHA plasmid and a plasmid encoding neuraminidase (NA) from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 were co-transfected into 293 F suspension cells (Thermo Fisher) using 293Fectin (Thermo Fisher). Supernatants were collected 4 days later for protein purification by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen).Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)ELISAs were performed using 96 well plates (Immulon) coated with 2 μg/mL rHA overnight at 4 °C. Blocking and dilution buffer consisted of 1xPBS with 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5% milk, and 3% goat serum. ELISA plates were blocked for 1 h at room temperature. Heat-inactivated serum samples were serially diluted two-fold or three-fold in round bottom 96 well plates and were then added to ELISA plates and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. As a standard control to establish relative serum IgG titers, each ELISA plate included a serial dilution of the CR9114 human monoclonal antibody. Horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson, 115-035-003; diluted 1:1000), anti-ferret IgG (Abcam, ab112770; diluted 1:2500), or anti-human IgG (Jackson, 109-036-098; diluted 1:5000) were added to ELISA plates and incubated for 1 h. Plates were developed by adding SureBlue TMB substrate (SeraCare) and quenching the development reaction after 5 min using 250 mM hydrochloric acid. Plates were read using a SpectraMax 190 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at an optical density (OD) of 450 nm.H5 in vitro neutralization assaysNeutralization assays for H5 viruses were performed using viruses expressing GFP in place of the PB1 gene that can only replicate in cells expressing PB1, as previously described37. Viruses were generated by reverse genetics using the plasmid pHH-PB1flank-GFP that encodes GFP in the open reading frame of the viral polymerase PB1 gene. To generate the viruses, a coculture of 293T-CMV-PB1 and MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2-PB1 cells were transfected in serum-free DMEM with 5 bidirectional reverse genetics plasmids encoding PB2, PA, NP, M, and NS from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 along with pHH-PB1flank-GFP and 2 reverse genetics plasmids encoding the HA and NA segments from clade 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses (A/Astrakhan/3212/2020, A/pheasant/New York/22-009066-001/2022, and Aed_fox/England/AVP-M1-21-01/2020). As an additional biosafety precaution, the multibasic cleavage site KRRKR was edited to a monobasic cleavage site R in the reverse genetics HA plasmids. At 20 h post-transfection, media was changed to neutralization assay media (NAM) consisting of Medium 199 (Thermo Fisher) with 0.01% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 100 μg of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, 100 μg of calcium chloride/ml, and 25 mM HEPES. Supernatants were collected and clarified by centrifugation at 72 h post transfection and clarified supernatants were expanded on subconfluent MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2-PB1 cells for an additional 72 h. Expansion supernatants were collected, clarified, and titrated on MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2-PB1 cells using an EnVision microplate reader at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. Neutralization assays were performed using serum treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE; Denka Seiken) followed by heat-inactivation. Sera were serially diluted two-fold with NAM in flat bottom 96 well plates before an equal volume of virus was added. Serum-virus mixtures were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 1 h before 2 × 105 MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2-PB1 cells were added to each well. At 40 h post-infection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and GFP fluorescence intensities were measured on an EnVision plate reader as described above. 50% neutralization titers are reported as the highest reciprocal serum dilution that decreased GFP levels by 50% or greater in relation to the virus only control wells from each plate, as described previously24. Serum samples that were unable to reduce GFP levels by 50% at a 1:40 dilution were given a 50% neutralization titer of 20.H1 in vitro neutralization assaysA/California/07/2009 H1N1 virus engineered to possess a D225G HA mutation was created by transfecting a coculture of 293 T and MDCK-SIAT1 cells in serum-free DMEM with bidirectional reverse genetics plasmids encoding PB1, PB2, PA, NP, M and NS from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 along with the reverse genetics plasmids encoding the HA and NA segments from A/California/07/2009. At 20 h post-transfection, the media was changed to NAM, and at 72 h post-transfection, supernatants were harvested and clarified by centrifugation. Supernatants were then injected into 10 day old fertilized chicken eggs. Eggs were incubated at 37 °C for 48 hrs and then the virus was collected. Virus was titrated on MDCK-SIAT1 cells to determine the dilution that results in 300 focus-forming units per well. The FRNT assay was performed as previously described38. Briefly, serum samples were treated with RDE and heat-inactivated. MDCK-SIAT1 cells were seeded the day before the assay at 2.5 × 104 cells per well in a flat-bottom 96-well plate. The day of the assay, sera were serially diluted two-fold with serum-free MEM (SF-MEM), followed by the addition of an equal volume of virus, and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with SF-MEM and then the serum-virus mixture was added to the cells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, the serum-virus mixture was removed from the cells, and cells were washed twice and overlayed with 50% SF-MEM, 1.25% avicel, 5 mM HEPES, and 50 µg/mL Gentamycin-Sulfate. 18 h post-infection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X 100 in 1X PBS. Plates were then blocked for 1 h with 5% milk in 1X PBS. Following blocking, plates were stained with mouse anti-influenza A NP (IC5-1B7, produced in-house) at a 1:20,000 dilution in 5% milk for 1 h, followed by staining with rat anti-mouse HRP (Southern Biotech: 1170-05) at a 1:30,000 dilution in 5% milk for 1 h. Plates were developed using TrueBlue TMB substrate and read on an ELISpot reader. The FRNT titers for 50% virus inhibition are reported and samples that were unable to reduce 50% at a 1:20 dilution are reported as having a titer of 10.HA multiplex binding assaysRecombinant HA proteins were coupled to MagPlex beads (Luminex) following the manufacturer’s instructions at ratios of 0.1 nmol antigen/1 × 106 beads. Beads coupled with HA proteins and blank beads to act as a negative control were added to 96-well black, clear-bottom plates at a concentration of 2500 beads/well (per bead, i.e. for this assay with 7 bead regions, a total of 17,500 beads were added to each well). RDE-treated sera were diluted 1:400 in PBS-TBN (1X PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% tween20, and 0.05% sodium azide), added to the wells with the beads, and incubated on a plate shaker for 1 h at 600 rpm. Plates were washed twice with PBS-TBN and then r-phycoerythrin affinipure goat anti-mouse IgG (subclasses 1 + 2a + 2b + 3) Fcγ fragment specific secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch: 115-115-164) diluted to 4 µg/mL in PBS-TBN was added to each well. After a 30 min incubation on the plate shaker, plates were washed twice with PBS-TBN and 100 µL of PBS-TBN was added to each well. Plates were then read on an Intelliflex (Luminex), and the median mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) was reported.T cell assaysA pool of 139 overlapping peptides (15mers, overlapping adjacent peptides by 4 amino acids) spanning the HA sequence of A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 (H5) were prepared (≥70% purity, GenScript) and pooled for in vitro restimulation assays. Mice were vaccinated with H5 mRNA-LNP or control mRNA-LNP and spleens were isolated 10 days later. Spleens were processed into single cell suspensions, plated (5 × 106 cells/well), and cultured in the presence or absence of the peptide pool (10 μg/mL) for 6 hr at 37 °C. Protein Transport Inhibitor Cocktail (Ebioscience: 00-4980-03) was added to cultures after 3 hr for intracellular staining of cytokines and markers of degranulation. Following incubation cultures were harvested and stained for flow cytometry analysis performed on BD FACSymphony A3. Table 1 summarizes information on the antibodies that were used to assess T cell responses to the peptide pool. Analysis was performed in FlowJo v10.10.0 with automatic quality control performed by the flowAI plugin39. All gating was done from FlowAIGoodEvents subset of events following quality control. Doublet discrimination and gating out of dead cells was always performed primary to analysis of responding T cells.Table 1 Information on the antibodies that were used for T cell assaysFull size tableQuantifying nasal wash viral titersMadin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC CCL-34) were cultured in Modified Eagle’s Medium (MEM) (CellGro) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone), 1 mM L-glutamine, and 1× penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (Gibco) and NaHCO3 (1.5 g/L). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Infectious viral titers of ferret nasal washes were determined by performing 10-fold dilutions on all nasal wash samples. MDCK monolayers were inoculated with 100 µL of diluted sample and then incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. At 72 HPI 50 µL of cell supernatant was mixed with 50 µL of 0.5% chicken red blood cells (CRBC) to measure hemagglutinin agglutination. The endpoint was defined as the highest virus dilution resulting in CRBC agglutination. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) titer was determined by the Reed and Muench method40 and the lower limit of virus detection was 1.0 log10 TCID50/mL.Statistical AnalysisData were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 9.3.0.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

U. J. Alexander / iStock In experiments designed to help flesh out the risk to dairy workers, they examined the persistence of H5N1 in unpasteurized milk on surfaces found in milking equipment, including the inflation rubber liners and stainless steel, which make up the "claws" in milking machines that attach to udders.The group noted steps involved in attaching the milking machine to the udders can spread contaminated milk to the workers at several points, including when the milk is stripped by hand—producing spatters and aerosols — before the machine is attached. Release of the machine at the end of milking can spray workers, and surrounding equipment can also release aerosols. "Milking often takes place at human eye level, with the human workspace physically lower than the cows, which increases the potential for contact of infectious milk with mucus membranes. Currently, no eye or respiratory protection is required for dairy farm workers," they wrote.Threat to workers, clues for cow-to-cow spreadThey found that H5N1 remained infectious in unpasteurized milk on rubber liners and stainless steel for more than an hour. They also conducted similar tests using the 2009 H1N1 virus and found that it was a good surrogate virus for further tests, and found the virus persists on the rubber surface for at least 3 hours and at least 1 hour.The team said the findings underscore the risk of contaminated surfaces to dairy workers and suggest that contaminated milking equipment may be partly responsible for cattle-to-cattle spread on affected dairy farms. High-dose influenza vaccines outperform standard-dose in preventing hospitalization News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Influenza Vaccines A new study from Danish researchers finds that high-dose flu vaccines reduced the incidence of pneumonia- and influenza-related hospitalization (P&I), but there was no difference in death rates between recipients of high-dose and standard-dose vaccines. The study is published in the Journal of Infection. High-dose influenza vaccine (HD-IV), which contains four times as much hemagglutinin as standard-dose influenza vaccine (SD-IV), was designed to address lower protection from SD-IV in adults 65 and older. Older adults are the most at risk for flu-related complications, and HD-IV has been demonstrated to induce higher antibody responses and significantly reduce the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza among older adults in multiple randomized trials, the authors said. No difference in all-cause mortality In the current study, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of all studies reporting outcomes of HD-IV compared to SD-IV regarding P&I hospitalization, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause death in adults 65 and older over at least one flu season since 2009. Overall, their analysis included 105,685 participants with a mean age of 66 to 85 years.HD-IV recipients demonstrated a P&I hospitalization rate of 0.8%, compared to 1.1% in the SD-IV group, for an overall vaccine efficacy of 23.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.3% to 33.2%). For all-cause hospitalization, 14.1% of HD-IV recipients experienced hospitalization during the follow-up period, compared with 15.2% of SD-IV recipients, resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 7.3%.The fixed-effects model indicated no difference in overall treatment effect between HD-IV and SD-IV regarding all-cause death.“The fixed-effects model indicated no difference in overall treatment effect between HD-IV and SD-IV regarding all-cause death,” the authors said. Promising preclinical findings for mRNA vaccine against global H5N1 avian flu clade News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) A preclinical study of a monovalent mRNA vaccine that targets the H5N1 avian flu clade circulating in multiple world regions is immunogenic and protective, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital reported today in Nature. Guschenkova / iStock The team's goal was to develop tailor-made vaccines matched to flu strains that have high pandemic potential. They first reported those findings in a preprint study in April 2023.In mice, the vaccine prompted a robust antibody response, and the antibodies neutralized different 2.3.4.4b clade viruses. Experiments on ferrets showed similar results, and the group's challenge studies in ferrets found the vaccine protected the animals from disease and death.Scientists working on more closely matched versionScott Hensley, PhD, professor of microbiology at Penn Institute for Immunology and one of the study authors, said on X today that the team is producing updated versions of the vaccine that more closely matches slightly drifted strains circulating today. At a briefing yesterday, federal health officials said discussions are still underway with mRNA vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna. An announcement is expected soon on how they might be involved the development of vaccines against H5N1. Australia's imported H5N1 case linked to South Asian clade News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) An imported avian flu case involving an Australian child who contracted the virus in India involves the South Asian 2.3.2.1a clade that is known to circulate in birds in India and Bangladesh, two researchers from the University of New South Wales reported today, based on data from GISAID, the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data. NIAID/Flickr cc The clade is different than the 2.3.4.4b clade spreading globally in birds, with occasional spillovers into animals and humans. The South Asian clade is also distinct from an older clade known as 2.3.2.1c that is circulating in poultry Cambodia and Vietnam, also with rare jumps to humans.Tests reveal H7N3 in recent Australian high path poultry outbreakIn another Australian avian influenza development, Agriculture Victoria said today that it has confirmed highly pathogenic H7N3 as the cause of poultry deaths in an outbreak at a layer farm near Meredith. Officials said illnesses in humans who have contact with sick animals are possible, but the overall threat is low.The department has imposed poultry movement restrictions in the area near the outbreak farm, and it urged bird owners to double down on their biosecurity measures. International scientists propose additions to dengue virus classification system News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Dengue James Gathany / CDC An international group of experts led by the Yale School of Public Health has proposed adding two sub-classifications to the current dengue virus (DENV) nomenclature to help identify and track strains of potential epidemiologic or clinical importance.The proposed additions, published on the preprint server medRxiv, split the current genotypes of the mosquito-borne virus into "major" and "minor" lineages to provide more spatiotemporal details, offer ways to assign lineages to sequence data, and propose new lineages.DENV "is currently causing epidemics of unprecedented scope in endemic settings and expanding to new geographical areas," they wrote. "It is therefore critical to track this virus using genomic surveillance. However, the complex patterns of viral genomic diversity make it challenging to use the existing genotype classification system."Additions may improve inter-group communicationOn a website, the researchers describe their classification assignment tool and how to use it. They also updated the viral genotype definitions to reduce the number of genomes that are unassigned or amorphously categorized as "related."It is imperative to have a precise and common language to monitor continued DENV transmission in different spatio-temporal scales; and that this is communicable to clinicians and public health officials who may not have a background in genomics.The team said the added major and minor lineages will aid country- and research group–level discussions of relevant dengue virus diversity."With the implementation of interventions (e.g. vaccines, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes) that may eventually select for specific viral lineages, it is imperative to have a precise and common language to monitor continued DENV transmission in different spatio-temporal scales; and that this is communicable to clinicians and public health officials who may not have a background in genomics," the study authors wrote."Moreover, the proposed lineages are robust to classification using partial genome sequences," they added.

Characteristics and Health Coverage of Animal Production Workers Josh Michaud, Drishti Pillai, Samantha Artiga, and Jennifer Kates Published: May 21, 2024 Share this page on Facebook (opens in a new tab) Share this page on X (opens in a new tab) Share this page on LinkedIn (opens in a new tab) Share this page via Email Print this page There is an ongoing multi-state outbreak of H5N1 influenza virus in dairy cattle and other animals in the U.S., the first time this virus is known to have infected cows. So far, only one human case of H5N1 has been associated with the U.S. cattle outbreak, an eye infection in a worker at a dairy farm in Texas. However, there is increasing concern that farmworkers are being exposed to the virus and additional human infections may be occurring. Moreover, repeated exposures between infected animals and humans could result in the virus becoming more transmissible in humans, even potentially sparking a new influenza pandemic. Dairy farm workers are the population most directly exposed to H5N1 infected cattle, and therefore the people at highest risk of further infections. They also face other occupational health risks such as injury and musculoskeletal injuries. However, reports suggest there are multiple challenges to providing testing and other health services to this population including lack of health coverage, language barriers, and fears or concerns about engaging with health officials. In general, there is limited information available about the number of dairy farm workers and the working conditions, demographics and insurance status of those workers, especially at the state level. Estimates suggest that as of 2018, there were roughly 130,000 employees on U.S. dairy farms, a subset of whom come into direct contact with cattle and would be at risk for exposure. Previous studies indicate dairy farm workers typically receive poor health and safety training and often lack personal protective equipment. A USDA study found that, in 2015, over 40% of dairy farmer household members were uninsured, the highest rate among farm households nationwide, and a 2014 survey conducted for the National Milk Producers Federation estimated that immigrant workers make up over half of the dairy labor force. A 2020 survey of dairy farms nationwide found over half of farms report having employees who have a first language other than English. However, these surveys may not be representative of dairy farms and farmworkers nationwide. For example, compared to dairy farms nationwide, dairy farm respondents to the 2020 survey were disproportionately in the Northeast and had larger herd sizes, which is associated with greater likelihood of hiring non-family labor and may affect the reported characteristics of workers. To provide more information about workers at potential risk for the H5N1 influenza outbreak we analyze demographic characteristics, income, and health coverage for “animal production and aquaculture” workers in the U.S. and in states experiencing outbreaks using data from the 2022 American Community Survey (see Methods below). “Animal production and aquaculture workers” include workers who are “primarily engaged in keeping, grazing, breeding, or feeding animals.” This category includes dairy farm workers as well as other animal production workers but is the most specific category with data available to examine these workers’ characteristics. Data do not allow for estimates of what share of these workers are dairy farm workers. We compare the characteristics of workers in the animal production worker category with all workers in the U.S., and within affected states. However, of the nine states with reported dairy cattle infections as of May 14, 2024, two (Idaho and New Mexico) are not included in the state-level analysis due to insufficient sample sizes. Findings Animal production workers are more likely than workers overall to be Hispanic and noncitizen immigrants as well as to be uninsured, have lower household incomes (less than $40,000 per year), and have limited English proficiency (LEP) (Figure 1). Overall, about one in five animal production workers is Hispanic, slightly higher than the share of U.S. workers overall (22% vs. 19%). Animal production workers also include a higher share of noncitizen immigrants compared to workers overall (13% vs 8%). One in five (20%) animal production workers are uninsured, about twice the share of workers overall (9%), which may, in part, reflect that they have lower incomes (18% vs. 12%). They also are more likely to have limited English proficiency (16% vs. 9%). These differences often hold true in states that have been affected by outbreaks, although there is variation among the states, and small survey sample sizes limit the ability to identify statistically significant differences in some cases. In most of the affected states for which sufficient data are available, uninsured rates are higher among animal production workers than workers overall in a statistically significant way. For example, in Texas, 31% of animal production workers are uninsured compared to 19% of workers overall, and, in Ohio, 29% of animal production workers are uninsured compared to 7% of Ohio workers. Similarly, in four of the states (Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, and Texas), animal production workers include a higher share of workers with LEP compared to workers overall. The share of animal production workers who are noncitizen immigrants is higher than workers overall in three of the states (Kansas, Michigan, and Texas). In some cases, differences between animal production workers and total workers within states may not be statistically significant due to smaller sample sizes, which limits the power to detect significant differences. Across the affected states, there is variation in the characteristics of animal production workers largely reflecting overall demographic differences across states. For example, less than one in ten animal production workers in Ohio (4%) and South Dakota (8%) is Hispanic compared to nearly four in ten of their counterparts in Texas (37%), and the share who are noncitizen immigrants ranges from 5% in Ohio to 21% in Texas. The share of animal production workers who are uninsured ranges from 13% in Michigan and South Dakota to over one in four North Carolina (27%), Ohio (29%), and Texas (31%), and the share with LEP ranges from 6% in South Dakota to 19% in Texas. Potential Future Actions The federal government has recently announced several steps to try to address some of the potential health threats from the H5N1 outbreak. For example, on May 6, CDC announced an effort to provide personal protective equipment for affected workers, and on May 10, 2024, the USDA and CDC announced a package of incentives to support more testing and prevention at dairy farms in affected areas. Efforts to address exposure and health threats posed by H5N1 could be complicated by challenges dairy farmworkers may face accessing health care and other services given that animal production workers are disproportionately likely to be noncitizen immigrants, uninsured, and have LEP. These challenges could be mitigated by providing information and resources to dairy farmworkers in linguistically accessible formats and utilizing trusted messengers who can help mitigate potential immigration-related fears, such as community health centers and community-based organizations. Providing these resources at no cost, including for people without health coverage, also could facilitate access. The data further emphasize the potential value of tailored outreach approaches in each state to reflect varying demographics and needs across affected states as well as variation in state policies, which may impact workers’ overall access to health care and levels of immigration-related fears. For example, Colorado provides Marketplace coverage with premium subsidies to income-eligible people regardless of immigration status, while in the other affected states, undocumented immigrants are ineligible for federally funded or state coverage options. Two of the affected states (Texas and Kansas) have not implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion, resulting in more limited coverage options for low-income adults overall. In 2023, Texas passed legislation that would allow state and local police to question and arrest anyone they believe entered Texas through Mexico without authorization. While enforcement of the law is on hold pending court rulings, it likely contributes to increased uncertainty and fear among immigrants about interacting with officials. Methods The data in this brief are based on KFF analysis of the 2022 American Community Survey one-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS). Animal production workers are defined as individuals currently working in industry code 0180: Animal Production and Aquaculture. We exclude those working in occupation codes 6005 (first-line supervisors of farming, fishing, and forestry workers), 6010 (agricultural inspectors), 6040 (graders and sorters, agricultural products), 6115 (fishing and hunting workers), 6120 (forest and conservation workers), and 6130 (logging workers). One in four animal production workers are found in Texas (10%), California (8%), and WI (7%), with the remaining workers spread across the remaining states. Among the nine states with H5N1 infected cattle herds, the sample sizes are generally small (<300), which can impact the reliability of the estimates due to larger standard errors. Results for Idaho and New Mexico are not shown here due to insufficient sample size (<100).

Now, scientists at Scripps Research and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine have designed drug-like molecules to do just that, by thwarting the first stage of influenza infection. The drug-like inhibitors block the virus from entering the body's respiratory cells-;specifically, they target hemagglutinin, a protein on the surface of type A influenza viruses. The findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on May 16, 2024, represent an important step forward in developing a drug that can prevent influenza infection. We're trying to target the very first stage of influenza infection since it would be better to prevent infection in the first place, but these molecules could also be used to inhibit the spread of the virus after one's infected." Ian Wilson, DPhil, corresponding author, the Hansen Professor of Structural Biology at Scripps Research The inhibitors will need to be further optimized and tested before they can be assessed as antivirals in humans, but the researchers say that these molecules ultimately have the potential to help prevent and treat seasonal flu infections. And, unlike vaccines, the inhibitors likely wouldn't need to be updated yearly. The researchers had previously identified a small molecule, F0045(S), with a limited capacity to bind and inhibit H1N1 type A influenza viruses. "We began by developing a high-throughput hemagglutinin binding assay that allowed us to rapidly screen large libraries of small molecules and found the lead compound F0045(S) with this process," says corresponding author Dennis Wolan, PhD, senior principal scientist at Genentech and former associate professor at Scripps Research. In this study, the team aimed to optimize F0045(S)'s chemical structure to design molecules with better drug-like properties and more specific binding ability to the virus. To start, the Wolan lab used "SuFEx click-chemistry," which was first developed by two-time Nobel laureate and co-author K. Barry Sharpless, PhD, to generate a large library of candidate molecules with various tweaks to F0045(S)'s original structure. When they screened this library, the researchers identified two molecules-;4(R) and 6(R)-;with superior binding affinity compared to F0045(S). Next, Wilson's lab produced X-ray crystal structures of 4(R) and 6(R) bound to the flu hemagglutinin protein so that they could identify the molecules' binding sites, determine the mechanisms behind their superior binding ability, and identify areas for improvement. "We showed that these inhibitors bind much more tightly to the viral antigen hemagglutinin than the original lead molecule did," says Wilson. "By using click-chemistry, we basically extended the compounds' ability to interact with influenza by making them target additional pockets on the antigen surface."

Finally, the researchers used a targeted approach to further optimize 6(R) and develop compound 7, which proved to have even better antiviral ability. "This is the most potent small-molecule hemagglutinin inhibitor developed to date," says corresponding author Seiya Kitamura, who worked on the project as a postdoctoral fellow at Scripps Research and is now an assistant professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. In future studies, the team plans to continue to optimize compound 7 and to test the inhibitor in animal models of influenza. "In terms of potency, it will be hard to improve the molecule any further, but there are many other properties to consider and optimize, for example, pharmacokinetics, metabolism and aqueous solubility," says Kitamura. Because the inhibitors developed in this study only target H1N1 strains of influenza, researchers are also working to develop equivalent drug-like inhibitors to target other strains of influenza such as H3N2 and H5N1. In addition to Wilson, Wolan, Sharpless, and Kitamura, authors of the study, "Ultrapotent influenza hemagglutinin fusion inhibitors developed through SuFEx-enabled high-throughput medicinal chemistry" include Ting-Hui Lin, Chang-Chun David Lee, Akihiro Takamura, Rameshwar Kadam, Ding Zhang, Xueyong Zhu, Wenli Yu, and Yao Yao of Scripps Research; and Lucas Dada, Emiko Nagai of Albert Einstein College of Medicine This work was supported by the NIH, the Nathan Shock Institute of Aging Research, and Einstein-Montefiore.

Background This is a technical summary of an analysis of the genomic sequence of the virus identified in the Michigan case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus infection. This analysis supports the conclusion that the overall risk to the general public associated with the ongoing HPAI A(H5N1) outbreak has not changed and remains low at this time. The genome of the virus identified from the patient in Michigan (A/Michigan/90/2024) is publicly posted in GISAID (EPI_ISL_19162802) and has been submitted to GenBank (PP839258-PP839265). CDC Update May 24, 2024 – CDC has sequenced the influenza virus genome identified in a conjunctival specimen collected from the person in Michigan who was identified to be infected with HPAI A(H5N1) virus and compared each gene segment with HPAI A(H5N1) sequences from cows, wild birds and poultry and the first human case in Texas. The virus HA was identified as clade 2.3.4.4b with each individual gene segment closely related to genotype B3.13 viruses detected in dairy cows available from USDA testing. No amino acid changes were identified in the HA gene sequence from the Michigan patient specimen compared to the HA sequence from the case in Texas and only minor changes were identified when compared to sequences from cows. These data indicate viruses detected in both cows and the two human cases maintain primarily avian genetic characteristics and lack changes that would make them better adapted to infect or transmit between humans. The genome of the human virus from Michigan did not have the PB2 E627K change detected in the virus from the Texas case but had one notable change (PB2 M631L) compared to the Texas case that is known to be associated with viral adaptation to mammalian hosts, and which has been detected in 99% of dairy cow sequences but only sporadically in birdsA. This change has been identified as resulting in enhancement of virus replication and disease severity in mice during studies with avian influenza A(H10N7) virusesB. The remainder of the genome of A/Michigan/90/2024 was closely related to sequences detected in infected dairy cows and strongly suggests direct cow-to-human transmission. Further, there are no markers known to be associated with influenza antiviral resistance found in the virus sequences from the Michigan specimen and the virus is very closely related to two existing HPAI A(H5N1) candidate vaccine viruses that are already available to manufacturers, and which could be used to make vaccine if needed. Overall, the genetic analysis of the HPAI A(H5N1) virus detected in a human in Michigan supports CDC's conclusion that the human health risk currently remains low.

Downstream of the nucleic acid sensor ZBP1, RIPK3 kinase activity is critically involved in the induction of necroptotic cell death by phosphorylating MLKL, while RIPK3 as a scaffold can induce apoptosis. Paradoxically, RIPK3-deficiency of mice may result in increased or decreased susceptibility to IAV infection. Here, we critically review the published reports on the involvement of RIPK3 in IAV infection susceptibility and try to identify differences in experimental settings that could explain seemingly conflicting outcomes. Analysis of the experimental reports revealed differences in the IAV challenge dose, the IAV inoculum preparation, IAV titer assessment, as well as the route of inoculation between studies. Furthermore, differences were noticed in the inclusion of littermate controls, which show high variance in viral sensitivity. Our evaluation argues for a standardized setup for IAV infection experiments including the preparation of the IAV virus, the use of different IAV infectious doses description and the proper experimental genetic controls of the mouse strains to increase inter-laboratory consistency in this field.Workflow for IAV infection studies in vivo: Viral preparation and titer assessment should be as standardized as possible with the use of a universal repository (such as BEI resources). Infection studies in genetically modified mice and littermate controls should include dose-response experimentation, following a defined infection route and inoculation volume. Data are generated by consistent analysis methods.

Besides apoptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis are triggered both in epithelial and immune cells [2, 3] leading to an inflammatory response by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [4]. IAV is recognized by the innate immune system by at least three distinct classes of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) including the Toll-like receptors TLR3, −7 and −8 (recognizing IAV nucleic acids), the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) (recognizing the 5′- triphosphate RNA) and the NOD-like receptor family member NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) (recognizing different stimuli) [5, 6]. The activation of TLR3 by IAV dsRNA activates the production of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent cytokines and of type I and III interferons (IFN) [6]. Viral RNA in the cytosol is recognized by RIG-I which activates the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), inducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I and III IFN [7]. The matrix 2 (M2) proton-selective ion channel of IAV at the Golgi apparatus initiates the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome which leads to the caspase-1-mediated activation of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 [8]. Caspase-1 also cleaves and activates gasdermin D (GSDMD) resulting in pyroptosis. Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) is another innate immune sensor that recognizes Z-RNA generated during IAV-infection leading to RHIM-mediated recruitment and activation of receptor interacting kinase 3 (RIPK3) followed by apoptosis and necroptosis [9]. During IAV-infection ZBP1 can also engage pyroptosis by caspase-1 activation and gasdermin D (GSDMD) pore formation [10] (Supplementary Figure 1).RIPK3 at crossroad between apoptosis and necroptosis during IAV infectionIn mouse and human the RIPK1, RIPK3, ZBP1 and TIR-domain containing adaptor protein inducing interferon-β (TRIF) are the only four proteins containing a RHIM, allowing homotypic protein-protein interactions and initiating the assembly of the necrosome [11]. The necrosome contains the phosphorylated forms of RIPK3 and RIPK1, as well as FADD, caspase-8 and MLKL [12]. In IAV-infected mouse fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells, RIPK3 can mediate either necroptosis or apoptosis, pending on the availability of the necrosome constituting proteins [13]. The RHIM and kinase activity of RIPK3 is required to phosphorylate and activate downstream MLKL, while the RHIM, but not the kinase activity, is needed for apoptosis. In the context of apoptosis, RIPK3 recruits RIPK1 through RHIM-RHIM interactions and RIPK1 then acts as the scaffold downstream of ZBP1 to recruit FADD and caspase-8 [13]. Mouse fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells lacking RIPK3 cells are almost completely resistant to IAV-induced cell death compared to WT cells [13]. ZBP1 deletion in fibroblasts, respiratory epithelial cells and macrophages leads to complete cell death resistance, compared to RIPK3 deletion [13, 14, 15] suggesting that ZBP1 can also induce cell death independetly from RIPK3, most likely by directly engaging RIPK1-FADD-Caspase-8-mediated apoptosis [13].In vivo IAV infection studies: variables that may affect the outcomeRole of different cell death modulators and modalitiesCell death plays a crucial role in limiting viral spread and immune activation but if uncontrolled it can contribute pathogenic inflammation and increased lung pathology [4]. In vivo, Ripk3−/− mice and Zbp1−/− mice were reported to be more susceptible to IAV PR8 (H1N1 strain) infection compared to wild type mice, exhibiting elevated pulmonary viral load and heightened morbidity and mortality [9, 15, 16]. Apart from inducing cell death, RIPK3 may regulate type I IFN signaling at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels to inhibit viral replication and protect the host against influenza infection [17]. In contrast, Ripk3 deficiency promotes survival of mice infected with H7N9 influenza virus [18]. ZBP1/RIPK3/RIPK1/Caspase-8-mediated apoptosis limits IAV without the need for necroptosis, but in the absence of apoptosis by a mutant Casp8DA allele preventing caspase-8 autoprocessing, necroptosis may also function as an independent, “stand-alone” cell death mechanism in antiviral host defense [19]. We observed that the requirement of RIPK3 for protection against IAV PR8 (H1N1) infection in vivo is only apparent within a limited dose range of IAV challenge [17]. Moreover, this protective outcome is independent from RIPK3 kinase activity and from MLKL, demonstrating that the scaffolding function of RIPK3 rather than its kinase activity is required for protection. Altogether, this suggests that a RIPK3 function independent of necroptosis is implicated in protection against IAV-associated pathology [16] in line with the prominent role of apoptosis [19].Apparently, the involvement of necroptosis in the protection against IAV in vivo is only observed in conditions where apoptosis is prevented by blocking caspase-8 activity or deleting of Fadd [13, 16, 19]. Since RIPK3 as a scaffold can be involved in apoptosis [20] while as a kinase it promotes necroptosis, it is important to also evaluate the contribution of MLKL as the final executioner of necroptosis [13, 19]. Interestingly, several studies showed that Mlkl−/− mice in conditions without deletion of caspase-8 are equally susceptible to IAV compared to Mlkl+/+ littermates, regardless of the IAV dose of mouse adapted A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) strain [13, 16, 19, 21], confirming that apoptosis is the primary modality to protect against IAV infection. However, two independent studies reported that MLKL deficiency increased the protection in mice infected with a lethal dose of PR8 [22] or with A/California/7/2009 virus strain [23]. In these two studies, however, the WT controls were different: either C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory) or C57BL/6 N (#B6NTac) mice were used as controls. Another group reported that Mlkl−/− mice display similar survival and body weight loss as WT mice when challenged with PR8 virus [21]. A recent study showed that 70% of the Mlkl-/- mice recovered after lethal infection with IAV PR8 strain (H1N1) compared to WT controls, demonstrating that necroptosis contributes to detrimental inflammation during severe infections. Indeed, therapeutic treatment of mice with a newly developed RIPK3 kinase inhibitor improved lung function, decreased inflammation and prevented mortality [22]. However, it could noted from the same paper that also p38MAPK, JAK2 and JAK3 are targeted by the RIPK3 inhibitor at 0.5 µM, which suggests a combined contribution of the targeted kinases in the improved lung function following severe IAV infection.Moreover, we here document that the kinase activity of RIPK3 is not required for protection against IAV PR8 in vivo, confirming that necroptosis is not the main cell death mechanism implicated [16]. In line with this observation, we also showed that Fadd−/− Ripk3−/− mice are even more susceptible than their WT Ripk3+/+ littermates regardless of the IAV inoculum doses that were used, suggesting an important role for FADD-mediated apoptosis independent of RIPK3 in the control of IAV-associated mortality [16]. It should be noted that Fadd−/− Ripk3−/− mice develop autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome due to a failure of mature T cells to undergo Fas-mediated apoptosis [24]. An alternitive explanation for the extreme susceptibility of these mice may be related to a disruption in T cell function. Moreover, Casp8DA Mlkl−/− Fadd−/− and Casp8DA Mlkl−/− mice were more susceptible to IAV-associated morbidity compared to WT controls, confirming that caspase-8-mediated apoptosis is crucial for protection against IAV [13, 19]. Finally, Cellular Inhibitors of ApoPtosis (cIAPs) are E3 ligases that keep RIPK1 in the survival mode of signaling [25]. Mice deficient in cIAP2 exhibit increased susceptibility and mortality to IAV infection, which can be rescued by pharmacological RIPK1 kinase inhibition or Rip3-deficiency [26], suggesting that sensitization to cell death death can also worsen the outcome.Concerning the involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome, there are also conflicting results in Nlrp3−/− mice infected with IAV. It was shown that Nlrp3 deficiency results in the susceptibility of the mice infected with PR8 [27], but Nlrp3−/− mice were more likely to survive than the WT controls when infected with influenza A/Shanghai/4664 T/2013 (H7N9) strain [28].Virus strainsLooking in more detail at the in vivo IAV studies investigating the role of RIPK3 reveals that the different outcomes or involvement of particular cell death pathways partially could also be explained by differences in the IAV preparation, dose and route of inoculation of the mice (Table 1).Table 1 Overview of the different in vivo experimental settings to assess IAV infection susceptibility in genetically modified mice. Overview of published IAV infection models using distinct genetic mouse models and infection protocols.Full size tableThe most commonly used influenza A virus strain used to examine disease pathogenesis and the immune responses in vivo is the mouse adapted PR8 virus strain. This strain was adapted to mice by multiple serial sequential passages of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 in mouse lung. During this process, the strain acquired mutations allowing a high replication efficiency and evasion of the immune response, therefore becoming highly virulent for the mice [29]. For instance, contrary to other strains, such as H7N9, PR8 (H1N1) cannot infect macropahges [29].Viral preparations are mostly generated by allantoic inoculation of embryonated eggs or by propagation in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Embryonated chicken eggs are the standard procedure for producing viral stocks, and has the advantage of producing high virus titers in a short period of time. The mammalian cell culture-based production of viral stocks for influenza vaccine use, such as using MDCKs, produces about 4-fold lower titers than the egg-based process, increasing manufacturing costs [30, 31]. Moreover, cell culture-based viruses have increased batch-to-batch variation and risk for mycoplasma contamination [31].Viral titers are assessed by egg infectious dose (determine EID50) or by plaque froming unit assay (determine the pfu) [9, 14, 16, 19, 32]. However, some labs do not inform on the precise method of the viral preparation [17, 26]. Table 1 provides a systematic overview of the experimental settings and the different outcomes following IAV infection (Table 1). In the next paragraphs, we highlight how differences in the IAV inoculum dose, virus preparation and titration as well as the route of inoculation may impact the comparison and the conclusions.Viral dose of infectionMost studies use the mouse-adapted H1N1 laboratory strain of influenza A, PR8 [33]. Despite the use of the same strain, the lethal outcome following IAV infection looks often very different. One study found that the IAV infection with a dose that is expected to be sublethal for most of the control mice (0.4x LD50; 12.9 hemagglutination units (HAU)/ mouse) did not reveal the presumed sensitized lethality in RIPK3-deficient mice compared to their controls [26]. In contrast, other studies found that RIPK3-deficient mice were more susceptible to IAV when challenged with a dose that was sublethal for the majority of the control mice [13]. Yet, another study reported by comparing two doses that a low IAV dose (50 pfu/mouse) displayed higher lethality, while this difference is not observable with a higher challenge dose (90 pfu/mouse), likely because of the lethal outcome for the majority of the control mice [17]. This finding is in accordance with our results (see below), i.e., that RIPK3 is required for protection against IAV infection in vivo in response to a limited range of challenging dose, while at high dose it is dispensable for protection. We demonstrate that Ripk3−/− mice were more susceptible than their Ripk3+/+ counterparts when infected with medium IAV doses (in this study corresponding to 0.2x LD50/16 pfu). However Ripk3−/− mice were not more susceptible compared to their littermate controls when infected with very low or low doses (0.05x LD50/4 pfu and 0.1x LD50/8 pfu) and high doses (0.5x LD50/40 pfu) of PR8 (see Fig. 1) [16]. These results underline that the Ripk3 phenotype is restricted to a range of infectious doses. Also, the involvement of ZBP1 in modulating lethality following IAV-infection shows various outcomes. When challenged with 1x LD50 of PR8, Zbp1−/− mice were shown to be either better protected from IAV infection compared to their WT controls [14, 15] or to be more susceptible compared to their Zbp1+/+ controls [15]. Another study revealed that the infection route could explain these results. Intranasal challenge revealed that Zbp1−/− mice were more susceptible to IAV compared to Zbp1+/− mice, while intratracheal virus inoculum administration resulted in reduced mortality with the same IAV dose (1x LD50; 50 pfu) [32]. Both Zbp1−/− and Ripk3−/− mice displayed increased mortality compared to C57BL/6 J controls when challenged with a sublethal as well as a lethal IAV dose [9]. All these experiments underline the importance of testing a range of viral doses to address the susceptibility of genetically modified mice. It also shows that at higher infectious doses both ZBP1 and RIPK3 may contribute to immunopathology resulting in increased lethality.Fig. 1: Survival of genetically modified mice compared to different littermate controls (pooled) at medium IAV challenge dose and comparison of survival different littermates challenged at different IAV doses.Pooled littermate controls (Ripk3+/+, Ripk3 KD-KI+/+, Mlkl+/+, and Ripk3+/+Fadd +/+ mice) compared with the Ripk3−/−, Ripk3 KD-KIK51A/K51A, Mlkl−/−, and Ripk3−/−Fadd −/−.

Survival of littermate controls (B−D): Ripk3+/+, Ripk3 KD-KI+/+, Mlkl+/+, and Ripk3+/+Fadd +/+ mice at different IAV challenge doses Mice were challenged with different IAV doses (0.1 × LD50/8 pfu; 0.2 × LD50/16 pfu; 0.5 × LD50/40 pfu). Survival curves were plotted for indicated groups [16]. Mice: Ripk3−/− were kindly provided by Dr. Vishva Dixit (Genentech, San Francisco) [44], Mlkl−/− by Dr. Alexander Warren and Dr. James Murphy [45] and Ripk3 KD-KIK51A/K51A mice by Dr. John Bertin by GlaxoSmithKline [20]. The Ripk3−/− animals were congenic to the C57BL/6 N background, while all other strains were of the C57BL/6 J background, and were therefore compared with the appropriate littermate controls. Ripk3−/− mice were housed in individually ventilated cages in a conventional animal house. The other mice were bred and housed in the SPF facility in individually ventilated cages. Three weeks prior to the experiment all mice were transferred to the conventional animal house and allowed to go through a quarantine and accommodation period of minimum 3 weeks before the infection experiment. Littermate controls of Ripk3−/−, Mlkl−/−, Ripk3−/−Fadd−/− and Ripk3 KD-KIK51A/K51A were used in each experiment. In all experiments, 10–15- week-old mice were used. All animal experiments were done under conditions specified by law (European Directive and Belgian Royal Decree of November 14, 1993) and approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee on Experimental Animals. Viral infection: Age-matched mice were anesthetized with a cocktail of 87,5 mg/kg ketamine and 12,5 mg/kg xylazine intraperitoneally and infected intranasally with 50 μl/20 g phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing different doses of influenza virus A/PR/8/3443, as described in the legends. The plaque-forming units (pfu) were determined by plaque assay on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells [31]. The LD50 of the viral batch was determined on BALB/c mice and 1x LD50 represented 80 pfu, as determined in the lab of Prof. Saelens. Although the LD50 is not referring to 50% of death in the mice that were used in this study, the nomenclature is used together with the pfu to have a supplementary information regarding the power of the virus in vivo. This terminology is often used in the papers cited here. Age- and sex-matched mice were challenged with 0.05x LD50 (4 pfu), 0.1x LD50 (8 pfu), 0.2x LD50 (16 pfu) or 0.5x LD50 (40 pfu) and monitored for survival and weight loss over a period of at least 18 days. We used the following 4 scores of clinical symptoms: 0 = no visible signs of disease; 1 = slight ruffling of fur; 2 = ruffled fur, reduced mobility; 3 = ruffled fur, reduced mobility, rapid breathing; 4 = ruffled fur, minimal mobility, huddled appearance, rapid and/or labored breathing indicative of pneumonia and body temperature below 32 °C. For the combination of body weight loss by 30% and a clinical score 4 the mice were considered moribund and euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation or cervical dislocation (EC2016–17). The lethality includes an ethical endpoint during which euthanasia was performed. This ethical endpoint is a combination of 30% weight loss and a clinical score of 4. Survival curves: All the survival data were plotted using the Kaplan–Meier survival analysis with the software Prism 10.1.0.Full size imageBesides the range of viral dose for challenge, it is important to note that the humane endpoints for each study can vary. The maximum weight loss that are used to determine the humane endpoint beyond which the mice are euthanized are very important in determining survival numbers and impact survival curves [34]. Some institutional protocols impose euthanasia of mice that have lost 25% of their body weight relative to the time of virus inoculation. In this particular IAV infection model, mice can lose more than 30% of their weight and still recover [34]. We noticed that these humane endpoints vary between labs: some apply ethical endpoint of 30% body weight loss [9], some more than 35% [19, 32], a combination of weight loss and other clinical symptoms [16], while for other studies we were not able to retrieve this information from the methodology [4, 17, 21, 23, 26, 28].Interestingly, Mlkl-deficient mice were shown to be equally susceptible to IAV as their WT littermates [13], demonstrating that the necroptotic execution mechanism is not implicated in the protective effect. However, another independent study also showed that Mlkl−/− mice were equally susceptible to lethality as WT control in response to a moderate IAV dose (described as EID2500, approximately 1x LD20) but exhibited a better survival when challenged with a higher dose (EID6000), indicating that the presence of MLKL is associated with a worse outcome at high IAV challenge dose. In this context, MLKL was shown to drive a pathogenic recruitment of neutrophils and lethality during severe IAV disease [9]. We found, however, that different doses (0.1x LD50/8 pfu, 0.2x LD50/16 pfu, and 0.5x LD50/40 pfu,) of IAV did not reveal any role for MLKL neither protective nor worsening [16]. We showed that the RIPK3 kinase activity is not required for partial protection against IAV infection at different viral doses and neither is MLKL, suggesting that necroptosis is not involved in the protection against small, medium or high IAV doses in vivo [16]. However, the conclusions from these experiments might be difficult to draw, since it has been reported that RIPK3Ripk3 K51A kinase dead knock-in (Ripk3 KD-KIK51A/K51A) mice used here express very low levels of RIPK3 protein compared to wild type littermate [20] which may affect the scaffolding function of RIPK3. Therefore, differences in viral challenge due to non-standardized doses in titer and volume of application may explain the various outcome ranging from no [26], partial [16] to complete protection of Ripk3−/− mice [13, 17].Viral preparation, titer assessment and route of infectionIt is important that experiments performed in different laboratories can be compared in order to contribute to a better understanding of cell death induced upon IAV infection. Such a comparison relies on an exact description of the viral dose used in infection experiments. While performing these comparisons, we found that the description of the IAV challenge inoculum differs between labs (Table 1). For example, Downey and colleagues inoculated the mice with a low IAV dose defined as 50 pfu per mouse [17]. One group challenged the mice with a sublethal dose described as 0.4x LD50 corresponding to 12.9 hemagglutination units (HAU) [26]. Another group reported their viral titers as egg infectious dose 50 (EID50) [9, 13, 15]. We used the LD50 terminology as determined in BALB/c mice as well as the pfu determined by plaque assay [16].Indeed, such different ways of determining the IAV doses may affect the conclusions. The infectious dose of a certain IAV preparation may be assessed by determining the 50% egg infectious dose (EID50), the plaque forming unit assay (pfu/mL) or the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50). We propose that viral dose for in vivo use should be standardized by cellular assays (pfu/mL) and the median lethal dose for 50% of wild type mice (LD50). It is also important to note that the virulence of PR8 IAV strains may vary between laboratories and the mouse strains used. A uniform source of IAV challenge strains, e.g., use of strains that can be procured from a repository such as BEI Resources, managed by the American Type Culture Collection, could also help in this process. Finally, other variables such as the volume used (30 µl, 50 µl) and the route of infection (intranasal, versus intratracheal) may affect the outcome of the experiment [32] and also requires standardization. Regarding the inoculum volume, a study has shown that mice challenged with a 25 µl inoculum volume rapidly recovered infection with a dose considered lethal when inoculated in 35 or 50 µl volumes [35]. This could be due to poor distribution and subsequent infection of the lung when using relatively small inoculum volumes (such as 20 µL) when compared to higher inoculum volumes [36].A similar discussion regarding the roles of RIPK3, MLKL, and ZBP1 has been raised previously [37]. In this review, the authors indicated the possible outcomes of upper and lower respiratory tract administration of IAV. Human IAV strains primarily infect human epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and typically are associated with mild to moderate disease. Lower respiratory tract infections are associated with increased higher morbidity and mortality [37]. This is an important aspect that needs to be considered when analyzing tract-specific pathophysiology of IAV, respiratory epithelial damage, and inflammation.Littermate controls and genetic backgroundsFrom Table 1 it is obvious that an evenness in the use of littermate controls and comparison between appropriate genetic backgrounds in the experimental setup is also essential for reliable conclusions between genetically modified mouse strains [9, 38]. Littermates have comparable genetic background to the knock-out (KO) mice and are exposed to the same environment during development and birth. C57BL/6 N ES cells have been an important source for the construction of transgenic mice by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) [39] while some spontaneous mutations on the C57BL/6 J background are used in many biomedical studies [40]. It is also important to specify the genetic background of the transgenic mice since both C57BL/6 N and C57BL/6 J ES cells have been used [41]. If applicable, also the extend of backcrossing in the C57BL/6 N and C57BL/6 J strains should be mentioned or even quantified [42]. Indeed, genetic differences between C57BL/6 J (B6J) and C57BL/6 N (B6N) sub-strains affect the susceptibility to and pathology associated with IAV infection, with B6J mice being significantly more susceptible to A/California/04/09 H1N1 virus (H1N1), A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1), and A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus strains compared to 6NJ [43].To address the issue of different genetic background of various transgenic mice we wondered whether pooling the different littermate controls from our previous study [16] and comparing them with the different genetically modified mice challenged with the same IAV dose, would affect the interpretation of the experimental outcomes. To illustrate the effect of genetic backgrounds, we merged the IAV infection results from all control mice (Ripk3+/+, Ripk3 KD-KI+/+, Mlkl+/+, and Ripk3+/+Fadd +/+) and compared these for each IAV challenge dose (0.1x LD50/8 pfu/mouse; 0.2x LD50/16 pfu/mouse; 0.5x LD50/40 pfu/mouse) with the separate groups of Ripk3−/−, Ripk3 KD-KIK51A/K51A, Mlkl−/−, and Ripk3−/−Fadd −/− transgenic mice (Fig. 1 A). By doing so, we found that, compared to the pooled control mice, Ripk3−/− mice showed a non-significant difference for the medium dose, contrarily to the control mice as shown previously (Fig. 1A). This is probably observed because the Ripk3 KD-KI+/+ and Mlkl+/+ mice apparently are more resistant to the same IAV dose compared to the Ripk3+/+ mice [16]. The variance in survival between the different wild type littermates for all IAV challenge doses are shown in Fig. 1B−D [16]. The results of Fig. 1 emphasize again the need to include proper control mice to compare the experimental outcome of a genetic modification.ConclusionsThe complexity of the multiple cell autonomous (cell survival, apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis) and intercellular responses by immune cells, and the amplification of a virus should be carefully evaluated in vivo when comparing the outcome of loss-of-function mutations through by comparing the outcome of IAV challenge in genetically modified with control mice. First, a defined set of different viral doses should be tested in genetically modified mice to investigate their susceptibility. Second, standardized viral preparation, titer assessment, dose-response challenge experiments and a standardized route of administration are crucial to enable cross-comparisons of reported data in order to draw solid conclusions. Finally, the use of littermate controls and matched housing background for the mice are the appropriate controls in these settings to avoid inaccurate conclusions.

Amid outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in cattle, public health officials are turning to wastewater surveillance as testing of cows and farmworkers remains slow. Last week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched a dashboard that tracks the influenza A virus—including its subtype, H5N1—in wastewater treatment plants at about 600 sites across the country. Detecting viral genetic material through such surveillance can serve as an early indicator of disease presence and spread. “Wastewater is a really good, unbiased way of keeping tabs on where [the virus] is,” says Marc Johnson, a molecular virologist at the University of Missouri. So far, the CDC’s wastewater surveillance system doesn’t specifically detect H5N1, but the agency is comparing weekly influenza A levels in wastewater at each site to that of the prior flu season. If these levels are high—meaning the 80th percentile or higher relative to virus concentrations recorded at the same site between Oct. 1, 2023, and March 2, 2024—the CDC would suspect H5N1 presence given that we’re past peak months of flu activity. It would then initiate an investigation. But sometimes untimely flu outbreaks occur, says Alexandria Boehm, an environmental engineer at Stanford University. She is also program director at WastewaterSCAN, a sewage surveillance initiative that monitors 11 pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and monkeypox at 190 wastewater treatment plants across the US. Her team has sometimes noted increases in the influenza A viral RNA in samples collected during the summer. With CDC’s approach, “there are multiple assumptions that’ll have to be made to infer that something is avian influenza,” Boehm says. She and several other scientists think that tracking H5N1 could be more precise, especially when influenza A cases start rising in the fall. In an April 29 preprint,Boehm and her team showed that a real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay they developed had detected H5 viruses at three wastewater treatment plants in Texas. “That doesn’t prove it was H5N1, but there’s no other H5 influenza circulating in the US,” which suggests the presence of H5N1, she says. Another team of researchers based in Texas detected H5N1 in wastewater in nine cities around the state. As part of a program called TexWEB—Texas Wastewater Environmental Biomonitoring—these scientists test weekly wastewater samples from 10 Texas cities for 3,000-plus human and animal viruses by sequencing the entire pathogen genome. When processing March 2024 samples, “we started to see signals consistent with H5N1,” says Anthony Maresso, a microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine. His team was able to distinguish H5N1 from other subtypes of the influenza virus. Going forward, Maresso and his colleagues will be able to see if and how H5N1 evolves and what mutations occur. But it’s hard to track down the source of the virus using wastewater surveillance or tell definitively whether it came from a human, an animal, or animal products like milk from infected cows. For example, two of the three wastewater treatment plants that Boehm and her team studied permit industrial discharges from milk processing facilities, which could indicate possible H5N1 input from the dairy industry. “But we cannot rule out other potential sources,” she says. When Maresso’s team compared the H5N1 sequences from their work with those released by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) from infected cattle and the single human case from Texas, they didn’t see the hallmark, single amino acid change in the human sequence, according to Blake Hanson, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and a member of the TexWEB consortium. “That gives us confidence that this is likely nonhuman.” Public health officials have so far found several species of birds and mammals, including domestic cats, that have tested positive for H5N1. The CDC maintains that current risk of infection for the general public remains low. But as the virus spreads, wastewater surveillance could inform where testing efforts could be ramped up in cattle and other animals, and possibly humans. As of May 20, the USDA had reported H5N1 outbreaks in 51 dairy herds in nine states: Texas, Kansas, Idaho, Ohio, Michigan, New Mexico, Colorado, North Carolina, and South Dakota.

Samples from the farms were positive in tests at Michigan State University's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, and samples have been sent to the NVSL for further confirmation.According to the MDARD's line list, Michigan has now reported 18 outbreaks in dairy cows in nine counties, the most of any state. In a May 16 update, the USDA reported 51 dairy herd outbreaks in nine states, which included 2 newly affected herds, one in Michigan and one in Idaho.No known dairy or poultry links in South Dakota catsA few H5N1 detections in cats were reported earlier in the US dairy farm outbreaks, and some of the animals were known to have consumed raw milk from infected cows. However, officials have now reported two infections in domestic cats without links to poultry or dairy cow outbreak farms. The two cats are from South Dakota's Campbell County, which is in the northern part of the state on the border with North Dakota. South Dakota has one outbreak in dairy cattle, which occurred in Brown County, which is also on the North Dakota border.The WOAH report didn't say if the domestic cats in South Dakota showed clinical symptoms. Earlier reports on H5N1 in cats, both in the United States and abroad, described respiratory and neurologic symptoms in infected animals, which were often fatal.Since the Eurasian H5N1 strain was first detected in the United States in early 2022, the virus has been detected several times in mammals, mostly wildlife including bobcats and mountain lions—species known to feed on infected wild birds.FDA pasteurization validation studies under wayThe FDA today in an update outlined its next scientific studies to validate the impact of pasteurization on H5N1, which will include tests using the same pasteurization equipment that milk processors use. The agency noted that follow-up inoculation tests on 297 retail milk samples that had fragments of virus on PCR resting were all negative for live virus. Testing is under way on pooled raw milk slated for shipment for commercial processing, with the goal of characterizing virus levels before pasteurization. The FDA said the study will better replicate real-world conditions and more clearly gauge how effective pasteurization is at inactivating H5N1 in milk and other dairy products.Also, the FDA announced an additional $8 million to bolster ongoing work to ensure the safety of the milk supply, which will support the studies to validate pasteurization criteria, conduct surveillance at different points in the milk production system, boost lab capacity, and train staff on biosecurity procedures. The funding will help partnership activities with states and may allow the FDA to partner with universities to answer key research questions.CDC boosts flu surveillance, starts pandemic reviewMeanwhile, in its latest update on its response to the H5N1 outbreaks in dairy herds, the CDC said it is developing a plan for enhanced surveillance over the summer, which will include increasing the number of flu specimens tested and subtyped at public health laboratories."While influenza testing typically declines over the summer, this approach would maintain an increased level of testing," it said.The CDC also said it has started the process of conducting a pandemic risk assessment of the H5N1 virus linked to the outbreak in dairy cattle using IRAT. CDC scientists measure 10 risk elements, which can take months to complete.The CDC's last IRAT assessment was posted in July 2023 and involved the H5N1 virus that triggered an outbreak at a Spanish mink farm. Though that virus scored higher on some of the CDC's risk measures, the overall threat is moderate and similar to the earlier version of the virus.Regarding wastewater monitoring for influenza A, the CDC said it compares the most recent weekly levels with those reported from the same site the previous season. Sites in the "high" category prompt CDC outreach to local jurisdictions and intensive surveillance review.In the most recent week, there were four locations in the high category: two in California (San Francisco/San Mateo and Sonoma), and one each in Kansas (Saline County) and Texas (Dallas) The CDC said so far there are no unusual flu indicators in people, including for H5N1.

CDC quickly responded to aid in comprehensive investigations that leveraged local epidemiology, laboratory, and response capacities. This ongoing work contributes to global health security and ensures countries are more prepared to respond to pandemic threats. Enhancing pandemic preparedness through outbreak response These reports raised global alarm as they happened against a backdrop of widespread avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infections among wild birds and poultry with sporadic spillover into mammals, including rare human infections. Detection of two infections in two family members raised concerns that person-to-person spread may have happened, which could increase the risk of the virus having pandemic potential. An investigation into the outbreak began within hours of the first infection being detected. Swabbing close contacts in Cambodia, February 2023 CDC staff arrived in the field within 24 hours to aid in a comprehensive outbreak investigation that leveraged local epidemiology, laboratory, and response capacities. Investigators quickly identified the second infection, determined that the likely source of infection was dead poultry for both cases, found no indication of person-to-person transmission, and shared information with the public. Throughout the investigation, CDC staff in Atlanta worked to support the in-country response and contextualize the risk to the U.S. public from these two infections. Subject matter experts provided technical assistance for the epidemiology and laboratory aspects of the investigation. Communicators sought to counter misinformation by sharing accurate information for the public in the United States and for use in Cambodia. Building on past experience Following these first two human cases, CDC and other stakeholders worked with local officials to discuss lessons learned, which included a CDC-led regional workshop on avian influenza. Building upon experiences from the first investigation, Cambodia Ministry of Health officials and CDC staff in the region continued to improve their responses to subsequent outbreaks, including responding to nine additional H5N1 human infections in the country during the next year (February 2023-February 2024). Impact This ongoing work across the globe helps to build local outbreak response capacity that enables countries to respond to public health emergencies, contributing to stronger global health security and sustainable public health infrastructure. These responses were made possible by two decades of CDC involvement in the region, including support for flu surveillance, providing financial and technical assistance, developing strong partnerships with local governments and other partners, and maintaining regional hubs, including several in Asia.

The study looked at confirmed flu cases among those 60 and older in Ningbo, China, over four influenza seasons from 2018 to 2022. The researchers compared 1,976 cases of influenza-positive and 1,976 cases of influenza-negative controls. In China, annual flu vaccines are recommended for those 6 months and older, but the vaccination rate among the older population remains significantly below the World Health Organization's target of 75%. To increase vaccination uptake, the local government in Ningbo has funded free influenza vaccinations to residents aged 65 and older since 2020. The authors of the study wanted to examine the relationship between repeated flu vaccinations and vaccine protectiveness. To do so, each flu-positive patient was matched with a negative control. Participants were considered vaccinated if they received one dose of flu vaccine at least 14 days before the onset of symptoms during the corresponding influenza season.Participants were grouped into four categories: 1) not vaccinated in either the current or prior season; (2) vaccinated in the previous season only; (3) vaccinated in the current season only; (4) and vaccinated in both seasons.Highest risk of flu in unvaccinated adults Overall, 11.6% were vaccinated in two consecutive seasons, 16.8% were vaccinated only in the current season, 6.5% were vaccinated only in the previous season, and 65.1% were not vaccinated.Being older, male, and having hypertension were all factors associated with consecutive vaccination. The authors found no significant increased risk of influenza in consecutively vaccinated participants compared to those receiving the vaccine only in the current season (adjusted odds ratio [aOR],1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94 to 1.58). The risk of influenza was found to be elevated in individuals who received the vaccine only in the previous season (aOR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.10). The highest risk was in those who had not received the vaccine in either of the consecutive two seasons (aOR, 3.39; 95% CI, 2.80 to 4.09).Elderly individuals who received the vaccine only in the previous season or those who did not receive any vaccine for two seasons are facing a significantly increased risk of influenza infection."While there was a trend towards a reduction in protective efficacy, this difference did not attain statistical significance. Additionally, we have also observed a high degree of stability in this phenomenon across different influenza seasons. On the other hand, elderly individuals who received the vaccine only in the previous season or those who did not receive any vaccine for two seasons are facing a significantly increased risk of influenza infection," the authors concluded.

"Despite progress in management, US mortality trends for these diseases have not been thoroughly investigated."The research was published in the American Journal of Infection Control.Chronic conditions are risk factorsFrom 1999-2020, 1,257,088 Americans (AAMR, 17.09 per 100,000) died of flu or pneumonia, with a significant trend to a lower AAMR (-2.94). The AAMRs for pneumonia- and flu-related deaths were 23.49 in 1999 and 13.05 in 2020. The AAMR fell significantly from 1999 to 2010 (annual percentage change [APC], -3.87), followed by a relatively slower decline from 2010 to 2020 (APC, -1.89).People of color are between 1.3 and 23 times more likely than NH [non Hispanic] Whites to have the underlying conditions that are associated with severe influenza infections and thus experience disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mortality."Major reductions in the mortality rates have been observed since the advent of the new century," the study authors wrote. "Age-adjusted mortality rate from influenza and pneumonia has decreased 36% between 1999 and 2010. Reasons for this are multifactorial and may be attributed to recent advancements in the health care system, such as increased vaccination rates, and public health interventions."People who had one underlying medical condition were 39 times more likely to die of flu or pneumonia than those who had none, while those who had at least two were 202 times more likely. Relative to females, males had a higher AAMR (20.13 vs 15.02). American Indians had the highest AAMR, at 20.44, followed by Black Americans (18.85), while Hispanics had the lowest AAMR, at 13.91. "People of color are between 1.3 and 23 times more likely than NH [non Hispanic] Whites to have the underlying conditions that are associated with severe influenza infections and thus experience disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mortality," the researchers said. Elderly at significantly higher riskThe Northeast had the highest AAMR (18.02), and all other regions had similar AAMRs (Midwest, 16.97; South, 16.85; West, 16.59). Rural regions consistently had a higher AAMR (19.80) than their urban counterparts (16.51). "This regional disparity may be due, in part, to differences in healthcare systems and access to medical treatments," the authors observed. "Socioeconomic factors influencing healthcare quality and inconsistent vaccination rates can also have a substantial impact on mortality rates in different regions." Tailoring interventions towards high-risk groups can enhance the effectiveness of preventive measures, vaccination, and healthcare access.States with the highest AAMRs, including Mississippi (23.84), Tennessee (23.53), Arkansas (22.63), and Kentucky (21.77), had rates roughly double those of states with the lowest values, such as Florida (10.64), Vermont (11.08), Minnesota (11.72), and Washington (12.26). The crude death rate in infants younger than 1 year was 5.61 per 100,000, while it was 0.72 per 100,000 among those aged 1 to 4. People aged 85 years or older had a crude death rate of 481.07 per 100,000, falling to 114.96 in those aged 75 to 84. Of all 1,257,088 flu and pneumonia deaths, 46% were among those aged 85 or older. "Tailoring interventions towards high-risk groups can enhance the effectiveness of preventive measures, vaccination, and healthcare access," the researchers concluded. "Given that a considerable number of high-risk patients rely on private physicians for their healthcare needs, the pivotal role of these healthcare providers is paramount in ensuring the success of public health strategies aimed at reversing the trends of influenza and pneumonia."

An electron microscope image of an H5N1 avian influenza virion. Cynthia Goldsmith, Jackie Katz/CDC/AP CNN — A case of H5 influenza, also known as avian influenza or bird flu, has been reported in a farm worker in Michigan who had regular exposure to infected livestock, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s the second case reported as part of an ongoing outbreak of the virus in birds and cattle across the country and the third bird flu case ever reported in a person in the US. However, health officials emphasized Wednesday that the risk to the general public remains low.

A nasal swab tested negative for influenza at the state health department and later at the CDC, but an eye swab tested positive. The person reported only eye symptoms, and they have recovered. Eye symptoms such as redness, swelling and watering were also the only ones reported in the previous human case in this outbreak, in a dairy farm worker in Texas. That man took antiviral medications and recovered with no lasting problems. “It is not unexpected that comprehensive testing identified a human infection,” the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release Wednesday. “Information to date suggests this is a sporadic infection, with no associated ongoing spread person-to-person.” The Michigan farm worker was one of about 170 people enrolled in an active monitoring program in which they received a text message from the state health department each day that asks about potential symptoms. When the person indicated the presence of symptoms, public health workers took samples, offered antiviral medications to them and their close contacts, and urged them to isolate. The CDC received the samples on Tuesday and reported the test results to Michigan health officials that night, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC. “This case was not unexpected,” Shah said Wednesday, emphasizing the agency’s ongoing efforts to help farms prepare for the spread of the virus. “It does not change our assessment of the risk overall. What it does do, however, is it reinforces the message that CDC has been putting out since late March, which is that entities involved with this – be they local health departments, farms, farm workers and farm worker organizations – ought to be alert but not alarmed by these developments. “We have not seen evidence of other cases in this area or elsewhere in any of our monitoring systems, let alone any evidence of human-to-human transmission,” he said. “And this is reassuring, but the work of public health is not done. In the coming days, we’ll have additional information on the genomic sequence or the DNA fingerprint of this particular virus. And we’ll be able to compare it to the virus from infected cows in Michigan, as well as to compare it to the virus from the earlier human case in Texas.” The fact that the nasal specimen tested negative while the eye swab was positive is also, “in a sense, reassuring,” Shah said, as it indicates a reduced likelihood that the virus is spreading through respiration. Although remnants of the virus have been found in samples of dairy products purchased from grocery stores, the US Food and Drug Administration “continues to affirm our assessment of the safety of the commercial milk supply,” Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the agency’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said Wednesday. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team. “To date, the totality of the evidence – including studies on the effectiveness of pasteurization against multiple pathogens, recent studies on the effectiveness of pasteurization of [highly pathogenic avian influenza] and eggs at lower temperatures than generally used in dairy products, and negative retail sample results to date – continue to indicate the commercial milk supply is safe. We also continue to strongly advise against the consumption of raw milk” or milk that has not been pasteurized. Testing with a substitute virus in ground beef found some live virus in patties cooked to 120 degrees or rare, but it was present at “much, much reduced levels,” according to Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza at the US Department of Agriculture, and it’s not clear whether it would be enough to make someone sick.

WastewaterSCAN, an infectious disease-tracking sewage surveillance network led by Stanford University and Emory University in partnership with Verily Life Sciences, has begun scaling up H5-specific testing of samples from all of its 190 sites at treatment plants across 36 states. The philanthropically funded effort will begin sharing data with local public health officials and on its public dashboard in the coming weeks, one of its leaders told STAT.advertisement With widespread reluctance among the dairy industry to test cows or the farm workers who care for them, scientists and public health officials trying to assess whether the disease’s spread is speeding up or slowing down are largely in the dark. Testing wastewater for a genetic signature of the H5N1 bird flu virus could give communities another way to spot potential outbreaks. “This is a very new thing that we have avian influenza circulating among dairy cattle and there’s a lot we’re still learning,” said Marlene Wolfe, an environmental microbiologist and epidemiologist at Emory and one of the directors of WastewaterSCAN. “We’ve heard that more information would be useful, and that this is one extra piece of information that can help officials understand what may be happening with these outbreaks.” Newsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy About a year ago, the team at WastewaterSCAN developed a probe that detects H5 influenza viruses, including the H5N1 virus that has now been found in 52 dairy herds in nine states. The assay sat unused until this spring, when unusually high influenza A activity began lighting up their dashboard in the Texas panhandle — the same region where the first cases of H5N1 in dairy cattle were confirmed on March 25.advertisement Wolfe and her colleagues went back and applied the probe to samples collected at three wastewater treatment plants in the area, and found the spikes were mostly due to large amounts of viral fragments from H5-specific influenza. The WastewaterSCAN team hypothesized that those viral fragments were the result of discharges from dairy processing plants in the area. But there’s currently no good way to determine the exact source of viral contamination in a given sewershed — in addition to human sewage, animal products can also end up there, either through agricultural and industrial dumping or by environmental runoff. Related: Michigan reports a human case of bird flu, the nation’s second linked to H5N1 outbreak in dairy cows Their results, which were released as a preprint in April, were published Monday in Environmental Science & Technology Letters. So far, the scientific literature on wastewater detection of H5 influenza subtypes is scant but encouraging. In another recent preprint study, researchers at the University of Texas and Baylor University began finding H5N1 sequences in wastewater treated at 19 plants across nine Texas cities starting on March 4 of this year. Wastewater epidemiology has been in use for decades to detect polio in countries where the disease remains endemic, and more recently, to estimate the prevalence of opioid use in U.S. communities. But the nation’s wastewater monitoring capacity got a huge boost during the Covid-19 pandemic, gaining visibility and credibility as an effective pandemic management tool. In addition to academic research efforts like WastewaterSCAN, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention operates the National Wastewater Surveillance System, which monitors 600 sites for SARS-CoV-2, mpox, and influenza A. Earlier this month, the CDC began releasing data from its influenza A-tracking efforts on a public dashboard. Since the agency is not doing H5-specific testing at this time, the dashboard shows only overall influenza A activity. But because the other influenza A viruses that cause human disease tend to circulate at very low levels during the summer months in the U.S., the presence of high levels of influenza A in the wastewater could be a reliable indicator that something unusual is going on — at least until the return of higher levels of seasonal flu in the fall. Related: CDC launching wastewater dashboard to track bird flu virus spread In its interactive map, the CDC serves up current levels of influenza A compared to historical data, providing needed context to determine whether what is being seen is abnormal. When levels are at the 80th percentile or higher, officials said the agency works with state and local partners to investigate further. For now, the CDC is only including data from wastewater treatment sites that were collecting samples during last year’s flu season, starting October 1, 2023. There are currently 230 sites from 34 states that meet that criteria. Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the CDC, told STAT via email that the agency is in communication with WastewaterSCAN and other academic groups to better understand the potential value of more widespread testing for H5-specific subtypes. “CDC is considering the possible role for other sites to test for the influenza A H5 virus subtype in wastewater with our public health partners,” he wrote. “Wastewater surveillance is an evolving science. We are continuing to review data and methodologies that may improve our public health surveillance.” Wolfe agreed that there is still a lot the field of wastewater epidemiology has to learn about how to interpret the kind of H5-specific data that WastewaterSCAN will soon be collecting. But it’s that particular data that local public health authorities are hungry for right now, she said. “If there are increases in influenza A — because that’s data a lot of people have access to — is that actually being driven by an H5 virus or not? Being able to disambiguate that, and understand where these signals are coming from, is something we’ve been getting a lot of interest in.” Related: Move over, wastewater. Store-bought milk could be another way to track the bird flu outbreak in cows Wastewater isn’t the only workaround that researchers are using to try to track the spread of H5N1. Frustrated with the lack of testing and limited genetic data being shared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, some scientists have begun sequencing the bird flu virus from store-bought milk as a way to monitor its movement and look for any changes to its genome that could make it more adept at infecting humans. On Wednesday, public health officials in Michigan confirmed a second human case of bird flu infection linked to the current outbreak in dairy cows. The farm worker had only mild symptoms and has since recovered, and officials have stressed that the risk to the public from H5N1 remains low. But influenza viruses are notorious for their evolutionary capacity, and if this one were to become endemic in dairy cows, that would increase the potential risks to people.

That’s according to a team led by University of Wisconsin–Madison scientists, who reported their findings May 24 in a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The group, which also included researchers from Texas A&M University, found that mice that consumed untreated milk infected with H5N1 subsequently became ill with influenza and that small amounts of virus persist in untreated milk for weeks when kept at standard refrigeration temperatures. The research took place as the H5N1 avian influenza virus continued its spread from birds into mammals, with infections reported in dairy herds across the United States this spring. Yoshihiro Kawaoka Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a professor in the UW–Madison Department of Pathobiological Sciences, and Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, led the work. The researchers tested two methods of heat inactivation on four H5N1-positive milk samples taken from infected cows in New Mexico and Kansas. Both methods were intended to simulate common pasteurization techniques, though the equipment and exact processes the researchers used differed from standard industry practices. In the first, they heated infected raw milk to 145.4 F for a minimum of five minutes and up to 30 minutes. This method reduced the virus levels more than 99.999%. Keith Poulsen The second method involved heating raw milk to 161.6 F for up to 30 seconds. This method inactivated more than 99.99% of the virus within the samples, though it did not completely inactivate the virus. “We must emphasize that the conditions used in our laboratory study are not identical to the large-scale industrial treatment of raw milk,” says Kawaoka. “It’s important to remember that our heat-treatment findings may not perfectly translate to real-world conditions.” Meanwhile, the team orally inoculated mice with untreated milk samples to gauge the possible risk posed by consuming raw milk that contains H5N1 virus. The mice began showing symptoms of illness after one day. While no mice died as a result of infection within the experiment’s four-day window, subsequent analyses showed high levels of virus in their respiratory tracts, suggesting their infections originated in their throats. Some mice also had a significant amount of virus in their mammary glands, aligning with the high levels of virus found in infected cows’ milk. To date, only two people in the U.S. have had confirmed H5N1 infections, one in Texas and another, reported May 22, in Michigan. Both cases were in farm workers who worked closely with dairy cattle, and the primary symptom in both was inflammation of the eye. While epidemiologists haven’t confirmed the mode of transmission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the most likely routes were from infected milk splashing into the workers’ eyes or from the workers touching their eyes with hands contaminated with the virus. The latest findings suggest that people could also risk possible H5N1 infection if they consume raw milk from an infected cow. “Do not drink raw milk,” says Kawaoka.

The virus has grown more deadly to birds since it started spreading in North America in 2021. The disease spreads quickly among birds, and is nearly always fatal for poultry raised on large commercial farms. In late March of this year, federal authorities recorded the first ever cases of H5N1 in dairy cows in Texas. It has since spread to 51 herds in nine states, leading to new regulations for testing and transporting cattle. The virus has also spread among wildlife, including walruses, polar bears, and foxes. For over two years, more than 90 million commercially raised birds have been affected by the virus. More than 600,000 backyard flocks — which include poultry used for a wide range of purposes, such as breeding or fighting cocks — have also been affected.And since February 2022, more than 83 million farmed chickens and turkeys have been killed in the U.S. as a way to stem the spread, according to the USDA. A dairy worker in Texas tested positive for H5N1 in March, the second confirmed case in humans in the U.S. and the first cow-to-human transmission. In 2022, a poultry worker contracted the virus in Colorado. The CDC considers the risk for human transmission low, according to a statement released by the agency, and continues to monitor the situation. This includes testing wastewater levels of influenza A, of which H5N1 is a subtype. view more graphics GRAPHIC: US agricultural exports support 1.25 million jobs GRAPHIC: Tyson Foods under investigation for employing minors amid surge in US child labor violations Listeria outbreak linked to Boar’s Head deli meats deadliest since 2011 GRAPHIC: Since 2023, half of the USDA’s billions in bird flu payments have gone to just 10 companies.

On Wednesday, Michigan health officials said a farmworker has been diagnosed with bird flu, the second human case connected to an outbreak in U.S. dairy cows. Cynthia Goldsmith, Jackie Katz/CDC/AP NEW YORK — A Michigan dairy worker has been diagnosed with bird flu — the second human case associated with an outbreak in U.S. dairy cows. The worker had been in contact with cows presumed to be infected, experienced mild eye symptoms and has recovered, U.S. and Michigan health officials said in announcing the case Wednesday. A nasal swab from the person tested negative for the virus, but an eye swab tested positive, "indicating an eye infection," the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. Sponsor Message Health What consumers should know about the milk testing positive for bird flu The risk to the public remains low, but farmworkers exposed to infected animals are at higher risk, health officials said. They said those workers should be offered protective equipment, especially for their eyes. The first case happened in late March, when a farmworker in Texas was diagnosed in what officials called the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal. That patient also reported only eye inflammation and recovered. Shots - Health News As bird flu spreads in cows, here are 4 big questions scientists are trying to answer Since 2020, a bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal species — including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises — in scores of countries. The detection in U.S. livestock earlier this year was an unexpected twist that sparked questions about food safety and whether it would start spreading among humans. That hasn't happened, although there's been a steady increase of reported infections in cows. As of Wednesday, the virus had been confirmed in 51 dairy herds in nine states, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Fifteen of the herds were in Michigan. Health officials in Michigan have declined to say how many people exposed to infected cattle have been tested or monitored. U.S. officials said they had tested 40 people since the first cow cases were discovered in late March. Shots - Health News Launching an effective bird flu vaccine quickly could be tough, scientists warn The CDC's Dr. Nirav Shah praised Michigan officials for actively monitoring farmworkers. He said health officials there have been sending daily text messages to workers exposed to infected cows asking about possible symptoms, and that the effort helped officials catch this infection. He said no other workers had reported symptoms. USDA is expanding financial incentives to dairy farmers whose herds have not yet been infected with the virus, Eric Deeble. a federal agriculture official, said Wednesday. Shots - Health News The U.S. may be missing human cases of bird flu, scientists say The virus has been found in high levels in the raw milk of infected cows, but government officials say pasteurized products sold in grocery stores are safe because heat treatment has been confirmed to kill the virus. The new case marks the third time a person in the United States has been diagnosed with what's known as Type A H5N1 virus. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered. That predated the virus's appearance in cows.

You may have seen headlines this spring about a new problem with “bird flu” – the H5N1 avian influenza virus that has been circulating in wild and domestic bird populations since early 2022. Although the virus continues to cause headaches for the poultry sector, it’s found a new target this year – dairy cattle. Avian influenza has been reported in several mammalian species in the past but had never been detected in cattle until earlier this year. Infected cows suffer from gastrointestinal problems, declining milk yield and can infect other cows. This has led to some significant challenges to individual dairy farms and recently led to a testing mandate for lactating cows being shipped across state lines as well as biosecurity enhancements in dairy farms. For most of us, the big question is whether this outbreak is a concern for human health. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers this virus to be of low risk to humans. Unlike some viruses, avian influenza does appear in the milk of infected cows, and raw milk from these cows is possibly infectious. Therefore, workers in close contact with infected cattle and potentially exposed to splashes of raw milk should take preventive measures. For consumers, the situation is markedly different. Thanks to the pasteurization process that commercial dairy products undergo, there is no risk from consuming these products. Let’s stop and consider the evidence for this. With modern laboratory techniques, it’s relatively easy to detect the genetic material from a virus (RNA in this case), even during low-grade infections. However, these techniques detect RNA whether it’s part of a viable organism or not, meaning that these results require careful interpretation. Perhaps you’ve heard about DNA that has been recovered from a woolly mammoth or the tooth pulp of ancient humans in recent years. These discoveries were the product of similar tests, which offer tremendous sensitivity to detect and decode genetic sequences but do not demonstrate that the source organism is alive. To test whether a potentially infectious virus is present or not, an egg inoculation test is commonly used. Recently, the FDA shared the results of tests evaluating the infectious potential of pasteurized milk that had tested positive for avian influenza RNA and found no samples with viral activity. These results point to the conclusion that RNA detected in these milk samples were simply fragments of viruses that were destroyed by pasteurization. Most of us learned in school that Louis Pasteur developed pasteurization as a method for sterilizing food products. Since that discovery in 1862, pasteurization has been widely adopted and adapted for many food applications. Yet, its importance for ensuring the safety of milk may have faded from public awareness. In an era when few of us have witnessed first-hand the scourges of typhoid fever or listeriosis, it’s easy to take for granted the technologies that made these and other food-borne illnesses relatively rare. Should the avian influenza outbreak in dairy cattle remind us of the value of pasteurization in our food system? Absolutely. But there’s no reason to avoid dairy products and the essential nutrients they provide. This article was published by Michigan State University Extension.

That's what researchers are working towards, with the discovery of a super-effective molecule that could inhibit influenza A from even entering our bodies.Scientists at Scripps Research and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine have discovered drug-like molecules that could do just that: block any mutation of the super-contagious flu virus at the very first stage of infection, essentially forming a biological forcefield for long-term immunity.“We’re trying to target the very first stage of influenza infection since it would be better to prevent infection in the first place, but these molecules could also be used to inhibit the spread of the virus after one's infected,” says corresponding author Ian Wilson, the Hansen Professor of Structural Biology at Scripps Research.Right now, our best defense against flu infection is a vaccine that doesn't at all guarantee you won't get sick, and the nature of the virus and its ability to adapt each season makes it incredibly hard to get on the proverbial front foot. If you do get the flu, even if it's a milder infection, the body's natural immune response in fighting the bug can have serious ramifications, particularly in those who are immuno-compromised, have comorbidities or are older. Here, researchers have taken a new tack, homing in on a drug-like inhibitor that targets a protein on the surface of influenza A viruses, making it impossible for the bug to find a happy home in respiratory cells where it would usually initiate its attack. The new discovery builds on the foundation of earlier research that found a small molecule identified as F0045(S) could bind and inhibit H1N1 influenza A viruses, though not that effectively. But the scientists found that using the chemical structure of F0045(S), they could design molecules to absolutely bind to the virus.“We began by developing a high-throughput hemagglutinin binding assay that allowed us to rapidly screen large libraries of small molecules and found the lead compound F0045(S) with this process,” says corresponding author Dennis Wolan, senior principal scientist at Genentech and former associate professor at Scripps Research.Using SuFEx click-chemistry, a tool that enables selective synthesis of functional molecules, developed by two-time Nobel laureate and co-author K. Barry Sharpless, the researchers built a library of potential molecules by tweaking the structure of F0045(S). In this library, they found two molecules of particular interest – 4(R) and 6(R) – which had far better binding properties.X-ray crystal structures of these two target molecules attached to the virus's hemagglutinin protein then revealed how and where they were able to bind to the bug – and how this could then be improved on.“We showed that these inhibitors bind much more tightly to the viral antigen hemagglutinin than the original lead molecule did,” said Wilson. “By using click-chemistry, we basically extended the compounds’ ability to interact with influenza by making them target additional pockets on the antigen surface.”What they found was that 6(R), in particular, was able to safely bind to its target in cell culture. Importantly, it did this 200 times better than F0045(S) and was non-toxic, suggesting both efficacy and safety made this an impressive candidate for a flu-thwarting drug.But wait, there's more. Using 6(R), the researchers then tweaked the 'recipe' for what they call compound 7 – a molecule with even greater antiviral power. “This is the most potent small-molecule hemagglutinin inhibitor developed to date,” said corresponding author Seiya Kitamura, who worked on the project at Scripps Research and is now an assistant professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.The researchers are now working on optomizing their 'silver bullet' virus inhibitor, compound 7, which they'll then test on animal influenza A models. “In terms of potency, it will be hard to improve the molecule any further, but there are many other properties to consider and optimize, for example, pharmacokinetics, metabolism and aqueous solubility,” Kitamura added.The team is also looking at using a similar method to find a target for other strains of the virus, including H5N1 – what we most commonly know as avian influenza, which has the potential to pose a huge threat to humans if it becomes easily transmissible.

Karmudjun May 22, 2024 09:26 PM Nice write-up Bronwyn. I am all for molecules that block viral infections as they may have a bigger impact on human health than molecules that fight current strain's infections as they develop. Yet I fear the ancient "We are tampering with nature" - that we see with the toxicity concerns. I am lucky to be a beneficiary of the antibiotic and antiviral age, but as a physician I am all too aware of what abuse of either has caused. I fear "tampering" may yield super infections when pathogens mutate to infect - or not! Theoretically we could eliminate a viral or bacterial pathogen but then wouldn't we set ourselves up for the next pathogen's evolution into human infection? Keep the studies disseminate to us all, this gives hope even with concerns for living without need of a robust immune system..... undrgrndgirl May 23, 2024 06:53 AM given the state of avian and now bovine flu...seems to me we should be looking to use this not just on humans, but on other animals as well. flu in our food supply is just as much a threat as flu is to humans directly.

ElrickNeal RubinObserver & EccentricUSA TODAY Michigan farmworker is second US case of H5N1bird flu likely transmitted from cow to humanKristen Jordan Shamus Detroit Free PressShow Caption Hide Caption What to know about H5N1Follow these tips to keep yourself safe from avian bird fluA Michigan dairy farmworker is the second person in the U.S. to contract avian influenza from a cow, state health officials said Wednesday.The worker, a man, developed conjunctivitis, which is an eye infection commonly known as pinkeye, as his only symptom and has fully recovered, Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical officer, told the Free Press.The man worked on a farm with cattle infected with the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza strain that's spreading across the U.S. in poultry and dairy cows. He had direct contact with sick cattle, she said. The Texas dairy farmworker who had the first known U.S. case of cow-to-human transmission, which was identified April 1, also worked closely with infected cattle.Citing privacy concerns, no details were released Wednesday about specifically which farm employed the Michigan worker or in which county the infection occurred. The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development reported Monday that avian influenza outbreaks have been identified in 18 dairy cow herds in the following Michigan counties: Clinton, Gratiot, Ionia, Allegan, Ingham, Isabella, Montcalm, Barry and Ottawa.It's more cow herd outbreaks than in any other state, according to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Since the outbreak began in February 2022, H5N1 avian influenza also has been detected in domestic birds from 23 Michigan counties: Bay, Branch, Cass, Eaton, Genesee, Gratiot, Ingham, Ionia, Kalamazoo, Lapeer, Livingston, Macomb, Menominee, Montmorency, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oakland, Ottawa, Saginaw, Sanilac, Tuscola, Washtenaw and Wexford.'The system worked'A surveillance program set up by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and MDARD led to the detection of the state's first human case, Bagdasarian said."We set up a robust public health symptom monitoring system to detect cases and that's exactly what the system did," she said. That includes an automated text messaging system that allows farmworkers to complete surveys about symptoms that might be indicative of an H5N1 infection and could signal a need for testing."Our local health departments have relationships with the farms in their jurisdictions and are working with them in whatever way works best for them in that particular situation. ... There's symptom monitoring using text messages, automated text messages, where folks can just reply, 'yes,' if they're having any of the symptoms mentioned."It's unclear, Bagdasarian said, whether this infected farmworker used the text messaging system or some other method to alert local public health leaders about his symptoms."The lesson learned from this is that these are the things that public health needs to do ... to track the emergence of new diseases, monitor changes in disease epidemiology," she said. "The system worked."It is unsurprising, given what we know about H5 influenza, to find one sporadic case in a human because we know that H5 influenza does cause sporadic cases in humans when there is close exposure to impacted animals."No need to panicThough a Michigan man has contracted avian influenza, Bagdasarian said the average Michigander shouldn't panic."The risk to the general public remains low," she said. "And that's for a few reasons: No. 1, we have not seen evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. ... For this to become a bigger risk to the general public, we would be looking for sustained human-to-human transmission and we have not seen that."Farmworkers, especially those working with infected animals, however, have a higher level of risk."We have recommendations regarding personal protective equipment. We have made personal protective equipment available and we'll continue to encourage people to use it," Bagdasarian said.Additionally, she said, symptom monitoring will continue and if workers do get infected with the virus, antiviral drugs will be recommended for treatment and for postexposure prophylaxis."We have seasonal influenza vaccines so that we can make sure that people are not co-infected with multiple strains of influenza, so we'll continue to use those. We'll continue to use all the tools that we have at our disposal," Bagdasarian said.Symptomatic eyesWhat's unique about the Michigan man with avian influenza is that his nasal swab sample tested negative for the virus, but a sample from the worker's eye, which was sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for additional testing, came back positive, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, during a Wednesday afternoon news conference."We received the samples yesterday (Tuesday), tested them throughout the day," Shah said, and results were reported Tuesday night to Michigan health officials."The fact that the nasal specimen here tested negative while the conjunctival specimen tested positive underscores two things: One is, in a sense, it's reassuring. It reduces the likelihood — it does not eliminate — but it reduces the likelihood of a respiratory route of transmission," Shah said. "The other thing is that it underscores the importance of PPE, barrier protection, in particular for the eyes because now this being the second case where conjunctivitis was a feature, if not the chief feature of illness."In the Texas example ... that individual tested positive for both their nasal and conjunctival swab."The CDC recommends people who work on dairy farms and poultry farms and in slaughterhouses use personal protective equipment such as N95 particulate respirator masks, fluid-resistant coveralls, safety goggles or face shields, waterproof aprons, gloves, headcovers and rubber boots when working around farm animals.However, the agency said it's unclear exactly how transmission between infected cattle and humans is occurring and why the two known human cases have involved eye infections."It may be from contamination of the eye(s), potentially with a splash of contaminated fluid, or touching the eye(s) with something contaminated with A(H5N1) virus, such as a hand. High levels of A(H5N1) virus have been found in unpasteurized milk from H5N1-infected cows," the CDC said in a statement released Wednesday."Given the high levels of A(H5N1) virus in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, similar additional human cases could be identified. Sporadic human infections with no ongoing spread will not change the CDC risk assessment for the U.S. general public."Help for farmsHelp is available to any Michigan farm in need of PPE for workers, said Chelsea Wuth, a spokesperson for MDHHS."If any farm is in need of more PPE, MDHHS and MDARD are coordinating a one-time provision to meet this need and protect workers," Wuth said. "Farms can reach out to MDARD to request a one-time provision of PPE. MDARD will relay these requests to MDHHS which will determine local, regional, state or federal resources to fill requests. "Local health departments remain in conversations with farms and may supply PPE as well depending on local needs. MDHHS and local health departments will support the farms and MDARD to help address these concerns."Dawn O’Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, said Wednesday that the Strategic National Stockpile also can provide such items as goggles and N95 respirators and gloves to states that request them.In addition, O'Connell said, the antiviral drug Tamiflu will be made available from the federal stockpile if needed. And ASPR "started the fill-and-finish process for approximately 1.8 million doses of vaccine that is well matched to the currently circulating strain of H5N1 through the National Pre-pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile Program," she said.Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said the federal government also is offering financial assistance for farmers with dairy herds that have been infected with avian influenza and will be expanding the program to include funding even to farms where cattle have yet to be infected so they can shore up their biosecurity efforts, including the veterinary costs for testing animals and the shipping costs for those lab tests.Avian influenza has torn through Michigan's bird population for two years, forcing commercial farmers and people with backyard coops to kill roughly 6.8 million infected chickens and turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese and guinea fowl across the state — all with the hope of slowing the spread of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus.Culling infected flocks hasn't been enough to curtail the assault from the virus, so earlier this month MDARD Director Dr. Tim Boring declared an "extraordinary emergency" in the state, requiring farms to implement biosecurity practices and create emergency preparedness plans.“Since the first detection of influenza A (H5N1) in dairy cattle on March 29, Michigan has prioritized both the animal and human health aspects of this disease outbreak.

The current crop of influenza vaccines has limitations in effectively combating the billion cases of seasonal influenza each year, as they provide immunity against only one specific existing strain or mutation. The propensity of flu viruses to mutate into new strains means vaccines must be continuously monitored and reformulated each year. But a universal influenza vaccine, using mRNA technology – which was used with success during the COVID pandemic – has the potential to provide broader and longer-lasting immunity against diverse influenza strains. The technology allows for rapid development and deployment, and offers versatility in targeting multiple regions of the influenza virus. New or mutated influenza variants are always a threat, particularly those originating from animal sources. Pandemics such as the Spanish flu of 1918, which killed 50 million people, and recent outbreaks of the avian influenza (“bird flu”) viruses underscore the persistent threat posed by influenza. Read more: From the Spanish Flu to COVID-19: Tales from the healthcare frontline It also underscores the urgent need for a universal influenza vaccine capable of safeguarding against all subtypes of the virus. In recent years, lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated nucleoside-modified mRNA (mRNA-LNP) vaccines have emerged as a potent tool in combating influenza and other infectious diseases. These vaccines use mRNA created in a laboratory to teach our cells how to make a protein – or even just a piece of a protein – that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. The limited efficacy of current vaccines can be attributed to their focus on only generating strain-specific antibodies against the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA). This is a protein within the virus that causes infection. To broaden protective immunity, novel vaccine strategies aim to elicit responses against more proteins (fragments of a virus). One promising avenue involves triggering T-cell responses. T-cells are a type of white blood cell,and are part of the body’s immune system. T-cell-mediated immunity not only eliminates infected cells, but also correlates with improved outcomes in individuals affected by influenza. Animal studies have demonstrated the protective role of T-cells against various influenza virus strains. These vaccines, exemplified by the successful development and global deployment of mRNA-LNP-based COVID-19 vaccines, elicit robust T-cell and antibody responses. These vaccines also offer the advantage of rapid production and adaptation to target emerging viral variants. While several mRNA-LNP influenza vaccines are in development, most prioritise stimulating antibody responses and under-exploit the potential of T-cell immunity. How the vaccines can work The development of a universal influenza mRNA vaccine requires careful consideration of several pivotal factors to optimise its effectiveness and suitability. Initially, the vaccine should target regions within the influenza virus responsible for viral replication, but are less susceptible to mutation. By concentrating on these regions, the vaccine can elicit broad and enduring immune responses, offering protection against an array of virus strains. Encapsulating nucleoside-modified mRNA within lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has emerged as a promising strategy to bolster vaccine effectiveness. These LNPs shield the mRNA from degradation and facilitate its delivery to target cells, where it can be translated into viral proteins, triggering immune responses in the human body. Additionally, optimising the mRNA sequence can boost protein reaction, ensuring robust and persistent immune responses post-vaccination. Another crucial aspect of designing a universal influenza mRNA vaccine is incorporating adjuvants or “agents” to amplify vaccine efficacy. An adjuvant is an ingredient used in some vaccines that helps create a stronger immune response in people. Integrating adjuvants into the vaccine formulation improves vaccine efficacy, especially in individuals with compromised immune systems. The design of a universal influenza mRNA vaccine should thus prioritise triggering T-cell responses, enhancing mRNA delivery and expression, incorporating adjuvants to boost efficacy, and addressing practical considerations for global distribution. By tackling these critical aspects, a universal influenza mRNA vaccine holds the potential to revolutionise influenza prevention and control efforts, offering comprehensive and enduring protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza strains. Confidence in a universal vaccine As shown by COVID-19, mRNA vaccines have demonstrated safety and efficacy in clinical trials for various infectious diseases. This instils confidence in the feasibility of developing a universal influenza mRNA vaccine that is safe and effective. Ongoing advancements in mRNA technology, such as improved delivery systems and stabilisation methods, further enhance the prospects of creating a universal influenza vaccine that ticks all the boxes. The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has started enrolling volunteers at Duke University in North Carolina to test its experimental mRNA-LNP vaccine against seasonal influenza, one of several universal influenza vaccine candidates now in the pipeline. Another clinical trial has begun at the US National Institutes of Health’s Clinical Centre in Maryland. The mRNA vaccine technology offers several advantages, including rapid development, scalability, and precise design. Two categories of mRNA vaccines exist, conventional and self-amplifying, and both are being explored for their potential to confer broad protection against influenza viruses. Despite their promise, challenges remain in effectively delivering mRNA molecules into a vaccine due to their inherent instability. Overcoming these challenges is essential for the successful development of universal mRNA vaccines for influenza. This aside, the advancements in mRNA vaccine technology have paved the way for innovative approaches to crystallising universal influenza vaccination, offering hope for broad protection against this ever-changing virus.

Credit: NIAID Share Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Email An experimental mRNA vaccine against avian influenza virus H5N1 is highly effective in preventing severe illness and death in preclinical models. The vaccine could potentially help manage the outbreak of the H5N1 virus currently circulating in birds and cattle in the United States, and prevent human infections with the virus, according to research published in Nature Communications. The mRNA vaccine targets a specific subtype of the H5N1 virus that is circulating widely in birds and cattle. While it rarely infects humans, some fear that the virus may evolve and cause a human pandemic. The researchers found that the vaccine elicited a strong antibody and T cell response in mice and ferrets. What’s more, the animals maintained high levels of antibodies even a year after vaccination. Vaccinated animals who were subsequently infected with H5N1 cleared the virus more rapidly and displayed fewer symptoms than unvaccinated controls. The researchers also note that all of the vaccinated animals survived following H5N1 infection, whereas all the unvaccinated animals died. “The mRNA technology allows us to be much more agile in developing vaccines; we can start creating a mRNA vaccine within hours of sequencing a new viral strain with pandemic potential,” said Scott Hensley, PhD, a professor of Microbiology at the Perelman School of Medicine. “During previous influenza pandemics, like the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, vaccines were difficult to manufacture and did not become available until after the initial pandemic waves subsided.” The researchers note that it will be important to evaluate the vaccine in birds and other animals that could potentially serve as an intermediate host to humans, such as swine and cattle. This research was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Health and Human Services.

Here’s what you should know about it Rangers clear deceased birds from Staple Island in England, where avian flu had a devastating effect on a seabird colony. Owen Humphreys / PA Images via Getty Images Will Sullivan Daily Correspondent Over the past few years, avian influenza has touched almost every corner of the planet. Since 2021, outbreaks have impacted at least 320 species from 21 different orders, most of which are water birds. Tens of millions of poultry in dozens of countries around the world have died either from the disease itself or from preventative culling. The viral infection has also been spreading to mammals—and was detected in dairy cows in the U.S. for the first time in late March. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that milk and other dairy products from cows are safe to consume, since the pasteurization process seems to inactivate the virus. But genomic data suggests that bird flu has been spreading in cows for months, multiple outlets reported at the end of April. The finding suggests that infections are more widespread in the animals than previously known. Still, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that the current health risk to the general public remains low. But with so many headlines about bird flu recently, we reached out to avian influenza experts and scoured the news to provide you with up-to-date answers on four key questions. What is the history of bird flu? Researchers have been tracking bird flu since the late 19th century. The first recorded outbreak in U.S. poultry occurred in the 1920s, and outbreaks have periodically cropped up in the decades since. A million birds died in a 1968 pandemic. The H5N1 strain, which has spread widely in animals in recent years and was recently detected in cows, was first identified in 1996 in domestic waterfowl in southern China. Over the last several years, the virus’ footprint has expanded. “Prior to 2020, this virus was largely restricted to Europe, Asia and Africa,” Michelle Wille, who studies avian influenza in wild birds at the University of Melbourne in Australia, writes via email. Since then, the virus has entered North America at least three different times and spread to South America, the sub-Antarctic and the Antarctic, she says. Throughout the 21st century, numerous strains of avian influenza have spread among and between poultry and wild birds. The recent spread of the virus is due in part to a genetic tweak that makes it better adapted to waterfowl, Wille says. “Prior, this virus was highly adapted to poultry, and we generally didn’t see sustained transmission in wild birds,” she writes via email. The last couple of years, the virus has been running rampant in those wild birds. Between October 2022 and November 2023, more than half a million birds across at least 82 species died in South America. Around 40 percent of Peru’s pelicans and 17 percent of Europe’s Sandwich terns died in a matter of months, and researchers have identified the virus in hundreds of wild bird species, Wille says. A researcher inspects a dead mallard duck in Scotland after a swan was found in the country with H5N1. Klebher Vasquez / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Some researchers estimate that millions of wild birds have died from bird flu. In the U.S., H5N1 has been detected in more than 9,000 wild birds. It killed 36 bald eagles between February and April 2022, as well as 20 endangered California condors in a span of weeks in 2023. On U.S. farms, more than 90 million poultry across 48 states have been killed by the virus or culled in an attempt to stop its spread. Globally, more than 131 million poultry were culled or died in 2022 alone. How has bird flu impacted mammals? Over the last couple of years, H5N1 has also been detected in dozens of mammal species. Mammals can get infected when they consume infected birds. A combination of a few mutations that could make the virus better adapted to mammals and a high viral load in the dead bird can lead to these infections, says molecular virologist Daniel R. Perez. He studies the changes in influenza viruses that allow them to cause diseases in humans at the University of Georgia. Infections in other animals can also occur after creatures ingest food or water contaminated by wild bird secretions, or when they come into direct contact with wild birds, Noelia Silva Del Rio, an expert in dairy cattle health at the University of California, Davis, writes in an email. In one of the earlier instances of bird flu in mammals tied to the recent outbreaks, researchers found red fox cubs in the wild infected with H5N1 in the Netherlands in May 2021. In February 2022, H5N1 was detected in sea lions in Peru. In the span of a few months, more than 5,000 sea lions died. An outbreak on a mink farm in Spain in October 2022 led to the culling of all the minks on the premises—more than 50,000 in total. Across South America, more than 50,000 mammals from at least ten different species died between October 2022 and November 2023. More than 70 percent of southern elephant seal pups died at a beach in Argentina during the peak of the 2023 breeding season, and an estimated 17,400 pups may have died across the entire colony. Dead and dying sea lions were reported in Peru during an increase in avian flu infections. Klebher Vasquez / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Perez says researchers can’t definitively say why avian influenza is spreading so widely in animals. “I don’t think we have a good understanding of the molecular reason why these viruses, with this combination of gene segments, with these mutations, now have this inherent ability of infecting many more species than in the past.” Globally, more than 50 wild mammal species have been affected, Wille says. In the U.S., H5N1 infections were detected in mammals for the first time in 2022. Since then, the virus has infected a range of mammal species across the country, including mountain lions, black bears, polar bears, bottlenose dolphins, harbor seals, coyotes, red foxes, minks, otters, squirrels, raccoons and opossums. The virus also doesn’t appear to only be spreading from birds—evidence suggests it has spread between minks in Spain and between seals in coastal New England. With bird flu moving into cattle, is it safe to consume milk? At the end of March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced that dairy cattle in Kansas and Texas had tested positive for the virus. “Traditionally, flu A viruses don’t replicate in cows, so this is unique,” Perez says. As of May 13, the virus has been detected in 36 dairy herds across nine states. Testing from the FDA has not found any live, infectious virus in dairy products, showing that the pasteurization process inactivates the virus and that pasteurized products are safe to consume. The FDA recommends that people not consume unpasteurized milk. “Do I worry about the milk that I will buy on the shelf? Probably not,” Perez says. “But should I be drinking raw milk directly from a cow? Probably that’s a really bad idea.” Some states allow the sale of raw milk. Perez says it wouldn’t be a bad idea for states to rethink that. “Not because I’m saying it’s unsafe—it’s because we don’t know how safe it is,” he clarifies. A person grabs a gallon of milk at a grocery store in California. About a fifth of milk samples recently tested by the FDA had non-infectious viral fragments, which don’t pose a risk to humans. Frederic J. Brown / AFP via Getty Images The FDA’s initial testing did find that about 20 percent of milk samples from grocery stores contained non-infectious viral fragments, which do not pose a risk to consumers. But the findings did suggest that more cows are infected than previously thought and asymptomatic infected cows are producing milk containing the virus, reports Stat News’ Megan Molteni. At the end of April, the USDA released data on viral genetic sequences from infected cows indicating that the outbreak in cows had started several months earlier than previously thought, the New York Times’ Apoorva Mandavilli wrote last month. A recent USDA report found that the dairy cattle outbreak started in late 2023, and the USDA has detected the spread of virus between cows in the same herd and from cows to poultry. “Affected animals mainly shed the virus in milk,” Silva Del Rio writes via email. Researchers have theorized that the virus could be spreading between cows through contaminated milking equipment or milkers’ gloves, she says. Or, milk splashes could form aerosols that cows inhale or that contaminate feed, water or other objects. As part of an effort to slow the spread, the USDA announced at the end of April that dairy cattle would now have to test negative for the virus before being transported across state lines, and labs and veterinarians must now report positive tests to the USDA. Some researchers have called on the government to share more information on how the virus is spreading and changing. “I think at the level of the U.S. government, everyone is doing everything that they’re being asked to do and more, in terms of generating information as timely as possible,” Perez says. What threat does H5N1 pose to humans? Avian influenza viruses are categorized as low pathogenic or highly pathogenic based on how lethal they are to poultry, and H5N1 is considered highly pathogenic. Scientists used to think that highly pathogenic avian influenza didn’t pose a risk to humans, according to Perez. “That changed completely in 1997,” he says. That year, H5N1 was transmitted from animals to humans in Hong Kong, infecting 18 people and killing six. Between 2003 and April 1, 2024, 889 infections and 463 deaths in humans from H5N1 were reported across 23 countries. Bird flu viruses have only spread from one person to a close contact in rare instances and have never resulted in sustained transmission between humans, according to the CDC. Aside from H5N1, other strains of avian influenza have led to infections in humans. One person in the U.S. tested positive for H7N2 in 2002, and a second tested positive in 2003. H7N3 was detected in two people in Canada in 2004. None of these four cases was fatal. But three people tested positive for and died from H7N9 in China in 2013. Other sporadic cases of avian influenza have occurred in people throughout the 21st century. Only two people in the U.S. have tested positive for H5N1—one in Colorado in 2022, and one in Texas earlier this year, both of whom only had mild symptoms. The person in Texas works on a dairy farm and reported eye redness as their only symptom. They reported direct and close exposure to sick cows with symptoms similar to those of cows infected with H5N1. The CDC says that the spread of H5 viruses in animals and in two people in the U.S. has not affected the risk the virus poses to humans, which remains low. “The virus does not show an indication that it’s any better to infect humans than it was ten years ago,” Perez says. Silva Del Rio writes via email that there could be occasional infections among people like dairy workers or workers at milk processing facilities who are exposed to sick animals or contaminated, unpasteurized milk. The virus is not currently spreading between humans, and infections have been limited. If there were multiple, simultaneous reports of H5N1 infections in humans or identified spread between people, that would raise the public health risk, the CDC says. “The risk is today low, but we should not be complacent, and I don’t think we are being complacent,” Perez says. A pelican carcass washed up on a beach in Lima, Peru—the bird was likely killed by an outbreak of avian flu. Car / Fotoholica Press / LightRocket via Getty Images Researchers will continue to monitor the virus for genetic mutations or signs of further spread that might indicate the virus has become more transmissible or poses more of a risk to humans, Silva Del Rio says. But Perez calls the events of the last couple years “a big tragedy” for wildlife. “We are talking about very fragile ecosystems in which an outbreak like this may wipe out an entire species,” he says. “In that sense, this is a disaster.” Get the latest Science stories in your inbox.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger A dangerous strain of avian influenza (bird flu) is now wreaking havoc on every continent except Australia and the rest of Oceania. While we remain free from this strain for now, it’s only a matter of time before it arrives. Penguins in Antarctica, pelicans in Peru, sea lions in South America and dairy cows in the United States have all been hit by fast-spreading and often lethal high pathogenicity avian influenza, known as HPAI H5N1. Indeed, avian influenza is knocking on our door right now. Just today, a case of avian influenza was reported in a return traveller, and Victorian authorities have confirmed avian influenza on an egg farm. Importantly, authorities have confirmed the virus affecting chickens is not the virus we are most worried about. Authorities are responding and we expect more information to come in the days ahead. Researchers and biosecurity authorities are on high alert, monitoring poultry farms and testing wildlife. They could do with our help. Anyone who comes across dead or dying birds – or mammals – should report them to the Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline. The rise of an animal pandemic Avian influenza is a viral disease that infects birds, but can infect other animals. There isn’t just one strain of avian influenza found in wild birds – there’s a diversity of subtypes and strains. Most cause no disease at all, and are naturally found in wild birds, including in Australia. Avian influenza comes in many forms. The one we’re worried about is high pathogenicity. Michelle Wille, Author provided (no reuse) But others are deadly. The HPAI H5N1 clade was first detected in a goose in China, back in 1996. HPAI viruses cause high levels of sickness and death in both wild birds and poultry. It spreads rapidly and kills many of the birds – and animals – it infects. HPAI H5N1 has been endemic in poultry in Asia for decades, driving virus evolution and the emergence of a diversity of different virus clades (a clade is similar to a variant). In 2005 we saw the first mass mortality event in wild birds. The virus spread to Europe and Africa through both poultry trade and potentially wild birds. In 2014 the virus again entered Europe with wild birds, with spread to North America the same year, and in 2016, to Africa. But the real change came in 2020. The number of outbreaks in poultry and wild birds dramatically increased. In 2021, reports streamed in of mass mortality events in Europe and the virus rapidly travelled the world. The world was in the grip of a “panzootic” – a global pandemic in animals. This particularly lethal clade of the virus jumped the Atlantic and reached North America around October 2021. A few months later, it again jumped to North America, but this time across the Pacific. In around October 2022, the virus entered South America, where it travelled an astonishing 6,000 kilometres to the southern tip of the continent in approximately six months. The first cases were detected on the sub-Antarctic islands in October 2023 in brown skuas, scavenging birds. It’s since been found in penguins, elephant seals, fur seals and Antarctic terns. By February this year, the virus was detected on the Antarctica Peninsula). Globally, millions of wild birds are likely to have been affected. In South America alone, about 650,000 wild birds were reported dead. Many more are never reported. This virus is threatening the survival of entire species. For example, 40% of all Peruvian pelicans in Peru have died. Scientists spent years trying to bring back Californian condors from extinction, only to watch them succumb in 2023. It will take years to fully comprehend the impact this panzootic has had around the world. Some populations of birds and even entire species may never recover. Scientists are especially concerned about Antarctic wildlife. Most Antarctic species are found nowhere else on Earth. Many live in large colonies, which makes it easier for the virus to spread. Questions remain over whether the virus will persist in Antarctica over winter and how it will spread in spring or summer. Deadly bird flu is leaving a ‘trail of destruction’ in Antarctica and has scientists on edge | ABC 7.30 From birds to mammals More than 50 species of predatory and scavenging mammals have now been recorded dying from avian influenza, most likely after eating dead birds. Particularly concerning are the deaths of 30,000 South American sea lions, 18,000 southern elephant seal pups in Argentina and dairy cows on at least 51 farms across the US. A recent study from Uruguay shows sea lions were dying before mass bird deaths, suggesting mammal-to-mammal spread may be driving outbreaks in coastal South America. Since the virus appeared in dairy cows in America, it has spread to herds across ten US states. We are still learning about how the virus affects cows, but infected cows produce less milk because of infection in their udders. A recent study suggests this is because udders have receptors similar to those found in birds. The US Food and Drug Administration states pasteurisation is effective against this virus. Globally, only 13 human cases have been confirmed due to this particular variant of HPAI H5N1, but noting that over 800 cases have been recorded since 2005. So far, one dairy worker is known to have caught the virus from cows. The World Health Organization considers the risk of human infection to be low although the risk is higher (low to medium) for poultry farmers and other animal-exposed workers. There is no sign of human-to-human transmission. Australia, the lucky country To date, Australia and New Zealand have avoided HPAI H5N1. Australia has a nationally coordinated surveillance system for wild birds. This includes long-distance migratory birds such as shorebirds and seabirds. Millions of migratory birds arrive from northern Asia each year in spring. That means August to November will be our highest risk period. In response, in both 2022 and 2023 we collected almost 1,000 samples from recently arrived migratory birds without detecting the virus. Routine testing of dead birds by others around Australia has also come back negative. We know migratory birds have arrived carrying other strains of avian influenza into Australia. It is only a matter of time before this HPAI H5N1 arrives. Ducks have played a crucial role in moving the virus from place to place in the Northern Hemisphere. Studies in Asia and North America have shown some duck species are able to migrate while infected, as not all ducks die from the infection. One reason we think that Australia may have been spared so far because no ducks migrate here from Asia. When the virus does arrive, it will likely threaten entire species. Black swans are highly susceptible. Overseas, pelicans, cormorants, penguins, gannets, terns, gulls and seals have been amongst the hardest hit. This spring, please look out for sick or dead wild birds or marine mammals and report it. Surveillance could help us manage the virus. Read more: The next pandemic?

Flu surveillance activity is generally conducted at low levels during the late spring and summer months, in recognition of the fact that as temperatures rise, transmission of seasonal flu viruses drops to minimal levels in the Northern Hemisphere.advertisement But in a call with state and local health authorities, Nirav Shah, CDC’s principal deputy director, said flu surveillance efforts should not be allowed to go into off-season mode this summer, given the need to detect human infections with H5N1, if they are occurring. “The bottom line is that in light of the ongoing outbreak of H5 among domestic dairy cattle, we want to maximize our chances of spotting a case of novel influenza in the community and minimize the risk that a case of H5N1 would go undetected in the community,” Shah told STAT in an interview after his call with leaders of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, the Association of Public Health Laboratories, the Big Cities Health Coalition, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the National Association of County and City Health Officials.

Privacy Policy Shah asked jurisdictions to increase the number of positive influenza virus samples that they submit to public health laboratories for subtyping, a form of testing that detects the precise type of influenza virus a positive specimen contains.advertisement “We say we don’t believe that there are cases of H5 novel influenza circulating because we haven’t seen any evidence that would be suggestive of that. But until and unless we enhance our subtyping, we are basing that conclusion on negative implication rather than on affirmative data,” Shah said in the interview. He estimated that over the summer, roughly about 600 to 700 positive samples a week that could be subtyped will be collected nationally. In the meeting with the representatives of the state and local health agencies and the testing labs, none raised concerns about having to do the extra work, Shah said. The outbreak, the first time H5N1 has been seen to transmit in dairy cattle, has been detected in 51 herds in nine states over the past two months. Scientists studying the phenomenon believe the virus is much more widespread. But reluctance on the part of farmers to cooperate with investigations has stymied efforts to gauge how far the virus has spread and how many people may have been infected. To date only one human infection has been detected, in a man who worked on a Texas dairy farm. The man developed conjunctivitis, the only discernible sign that he had been infected. H5N1 is a virus that originated in wild ducks. But over the last 27 years, it has spread widely across the globe, killing hundreds of millions of poultry and a variety of mammalian species, including seals, bears, raccoons, and cats, both large and domestic. Until now, it has not been seen in cows. While it is not killing cattle, the virus’ presence in a species with which people have regular contact is concerning, because it gives the virus more opportunities to evolve to be better at mammal-to-mammal spread, potentially even human-to-human spread. If it acquires that capacity, it could trigger a pandemic. In addition to maintaining flu surveillance systems throughout the summer, the CDC and others are using detection of influenza A viruses in wastewater to try to look for places where the H5N1 virus might be spreading. H5N1 is an influenza A virus; so too are the H3N2 and H1N1 viruses that circulate during flu season. But because the latter two typically circulate at very low levels during the summer, it’s thought that detecting flu A in wastewater could signal presence of H5N1 in a community — whether that’s in wild birds, cows, milk disposed of by an affected farm, or people.

They are also calling for the agency to protect farm workers and do a better job of keeping the public informed about its findings.The request follows the spread of the disease to at least 51 dairy herds in at least nine U.S. states.“It’s critical we learn from the mistakes of the early COVID-19 response and aggressively address industrial animal agriculture’s key role in spreading these highly contagious viruses,” said Hannah Connor, environmental health deputy director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “The CDC must ignore the pushback from big agribusiness interests and ramp up its work to protect communities and prevent the avian flu outbreak from becoming the next pandemic.”Avian influenza, also called bird flu, refers to diseases often spread among bird species, including wild birds and domestic poultry. It is not known to have spread to cattle until recent months, leading to concerns about evolution in the spread of this disease.Because of lax oversight of the dairy industry, it is unclear when H5N1 started circulating among cattle populations. But recent genomic analyses of U.S. Department of Agriculture data indicate that it probably began in December or January and had been spreading for four months before it was detected. But a shortage of data is hampering efforts to pin down the source, according to researchers.Some industrial dairy operators and state officials have opposed federal efforts to track and contain the virus, telling the CDC to “back off.”Before spreading among domestic cattle populations, the virus spread first from birds into wild mammal populations, leading to significant concerns about the disease’s threats to imperiled wildlife. Since this outbreak started, the virus has been found in federally threatened and endangered species like polar bears, grizzly bears and fishers. Outbreaks in South America have killed tens of thousands of seals and sea lions, demonstrating H5N1’s ability to cause mass mortality in mammals.The three reported U.S. cases of avian influenza infections in humans — including the two cases connected to the most recent outbreak — have occurred on industrial agricultural operations. One occurred at a poultry operation in Colorado, the second at a dairy in Texas and the third at a dairy in Michigan. All three individuals have recovered.Globally between 2003 and 2023, 878 humans are reported to have tested positive for the H5N1 virus. Of those, 458 deaths were reported, indicating a fatality rate of approximately 52%, according to the CDC.“The consequences of allowing continued outbreaks of H5N1 may be severe,” said Connor. “In addition to the virus’s potential to cause pandemics in humans and wildlife, each industrial dairy operation that experiences an outbreak could put already vulnerable workers at risk and strain the food supply chain.”Industrial animal agriculture increases the risk of an avian influenza pandemic by confining stressed animals in crowded, unhygienic conditions — the perfect breeding ground for viruses to rapidly spread, mutate and adapt. Since February 2022 more than 90 million farmed birds have been culled because of the virus.Today’s letter was delivered to the CDC by the Center for Biological Diversity, CleanAIRE NC, Coastal Carolina Riverwatch, Mercy for Animals, North Carolina Environmental Justice Network, Socially Responsible Agriculture Project (SRAP), Southern Coalition for Social Justice, Waterkeeper Alliance and Winyah Rivers Alliance. The Center for Biological Diversity is a national, nonprofit conservation organization with more than 1.7 million members and online activists dedicated to the protection of endangered species and wild places.

(Updated May 24) Search for: Search May 20, 2024May 27, 2024 I’m sure you’ve heard that the H5N1 avian influenza strain has been recently discovered to have jumped to cattle and has been detected (by PCR) in raw milk in at least 59 cattle herds among 9 states. No herds are known to have been infected in Arizona as of yet (that we know of). What are the public health implications and what’s being done to investigate and intervene? Background Let’s start with a quick history of how the H5N1 avian influenza virus got started. In 2020 it appears that there was some reassortment (aka gene-swapping) between dually infected domestic poultry and wild bird influenza viruses that resulted in the new ‘HPAI’ H5N1 influenza virus. In February 2022 the USDA discovered this new version of the influenza virus rifled through a US commercial turkey facility, marking the first known commercial outbreak of the virus in the US. The H5N1 avian virus is shed in the saliva, mucous, and feces of infected birds. It spreads rapidly through poultry flocks and among wild birds and is quite lethal for poultry. An estimated half a billion farmed birds have been slaughtered in efforts to contain the virus. For the most part the virus has just been making birds sick – but there have been detections of the virus in all kinds of mammals as well – ranging from sea lions to mink to polar bears. New Regulations after Some Cattle Became Infected Last month, the USDA found that the virus had begun to infect domestic cattle… although the symptoms and virulence in cattle is much lower than in birds. While infected cattle had some symptoms, they haven’t been serious nor lethal (in contrast with the effect of the virus on birds). The USDA is the regulatory authority for the testing, investigation, and control measures for both the birds and the cattle. USDA has several new regulatory measures already in place that you can see here: aphis-requirements-recommendations-hpai-livestock.pdf (usda.gov). Virus Surveillance & Investigations So far all of USDA’s testing in actual meat from cattle is clear of the virus, but it’s showing up in high concentrations in the milk of infected dairy cows. The vast majority of milk on the shelf is pasteurized and not a threat at all because if the virus is in the milk, the heat of pasteurization kills it. Raw milk (legal in Arizona) of course is a theoretical risk for humans but is unlikely to cause severe illness unless the virus changes dramatically from where it is today. Note: It’s legal to sell raw milk that’s not pasteurized but it must meet specific standards in ARS 3-606. The Arizona Department of Agriculture (ADA) is the regulatory authority (not ADHS). Raw milk producers need to get a separate license from the ADA and comply with detailed regulations that cover sanitation, handling, and labeling. Raw milk must be specifically labeled indicating that it’s not pasteurized and summarizing the potential health threats from consuming raw milk. Workers close to infected cows and birds haven’t been becoming sick – except for a couple cases of ‘pink eye’ where workers got an eye infection from splashes while milking cows. The meat that has been tested at retail sites in the 9 states that have found infected dairy cows has so far all been negative. USDA is testing meat at licensed slaughterhouses (using PCR), but the results aren’t out yet. A hamburger study is underway at the slaughterhouses too. No results yet – but there will likely be results by next week. Here are the results so far: Updates on H5N1 Beef Safety Studies | Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service USDA still doesn’t know exactly how the cows are getting it from the birds – but that’s under investigation. My bet is that it’s because some farmers feed dairy cattle chicken feces (they call it litter), which could be infecting the cows. Bird flu outbreak: Arizona farms haven’t detected any cases If that turns out to be the case the intervention is simple – order farmers to stop feeding chicken feces to cows. Whether they’d comply is another matter. Future Implications As for the H5N1 virus mutating in cows and jumping to people in a much more virulent form… yeah it’s theoretically possible but has never been observed before. The normal pathway for new virulent influenza virus (pandemics) is birds > pigs > humans. That’s the long-term pattern including H1N1 back in 2009. Why? Because believe it or not pigs are close to humans on the biological tree and have similar respiratory receptors. New strains almost always come from China because in rural China humans, pigs and birds (usually geese) all live together. Cattle are far from humans on the mammal tree so it’s unlikely the H5N1 virus would mutate and become a virulent human strain in a bovine. May 23, 2024 Update: USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service collected 30 samples of ground beef from retail outlets in the states with dairy cattle herds that had tested positive for the H5N1 influenza virus at the time of sample collection. The samples were sent to APHIS’ National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) for PCR testing. NVSL reported that all samples tested negative for H5N1. USDA’s FSIS, APHIS, and Agricultural Research Service (ARS) are working on three separate beef safety studies related to avian influenza in meat from dairy cattle. Samples of ground beef obtained at retail in the affected States test negative: Samples were collected at retail outlets in the States in which dairy cattle herds have tested positive for H5N1 influenza virus. The samples were analyzed by APHIS using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to indicate whether any viral particles were present. No virus particles were found to be present. Beef muscle sampling of dairy cows at select FSIS-inspected slaughter facilities: FSIS has completed collection of muscle samples at from cull dairy cattle that have been condemned for systemic pathologies. The samples are currently being analyzed by APHIS using PCR to determine presence of viral particles. The results are forthcoming and will be posted as soon as they become available. Ground beef cooking study: ARS inoculated a very high level of a HPAI virus surrogate into 300 grams ground beef patties (burger patties are usually 113 grams) to determine whether FSIS recommended cooking temperatures are effective in inactivating H5N1 virus The burger patties were cooked to three different temperatures (120-, 145-, & 160-degrees Fahrenheit), and virus presence was measured after cooking. There was no virus present in the burgers cooked to 145 (medium) or 160 (well done) degrees. Even cooking burgers to 120 (rare) degrees, which is well below the recommended temperature, substantially inactivated the virus. Related Post 09 Apr Immigration Policy .

Opens in a new tab or window Share on X. Opens in a new tab or window Share on LinkedIn. Opens in a new tab or window email article (Cynthia Goldsmith, Jackie Katz/CDC via AP) A Michigan farmworker has been diagnosed with bird flu -- the second human case associated with an outbreak in U.S. dairy cows. The patient had mild symptoms, Michigan health officials said in announcing the case Wednesday. The person had been in contact with cows presumed to be infected, and the risk to the public remains low, officials said. In a statement, the CDC noted that an initial nasal swab turned up negative for influenza, but an eye swab sent to the agency tested positive for influenza A(H5) virus. Similar to the other U.S. case reported earlier this year, the Michigan patient only had eye symptoms. The first case happened in late March, when a farmworker in Texas was diagnosed in what officials called the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal. That patient reported eye inflammation and was treated with an antiviral drug. "CDC has been watching influenza surveillance systems closely, particularly in affected states, and there has been no sign of unusual influenza activity in people, including in syndromic surveillance," the agency said, adding that the new Michigan case "does not change CDC's current H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which the agency considers to be low." Since 2020, a bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal species -- including dogs, cats, skunks, bears, and even seals and porpoises -- in scores of countries. The detection in U.S. livestock earlier this year was an unexpected twist that sparked questions about food safety and whether it would start spreading among humans. That hasn't happened, although there's been a steady increase of reported infections in cows. As of Wednesday, the virus had been confirmed in 51 dairy herds in nine states, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Fifteen of the herds were in Michigan. Health officials there have declined to say how many people exposed to infected cattle have been tested or monitored. The new human case "underscores the importance of recommended precautions in people with exposure to infected or potentially infected animals," the CDC said. The virus has been found in high levels in the raw milk of infected cows, but government officials say pasteurized products sold in grocery stores are safe because heat treatment has been confirmed to kill the virus. The new case marks the third time a person in the U.S. has been diagnosed with what's known as Type A H5N1 virus. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered. That predated the virus's appearance in cows. Share on Facebook. Opens in a new tab or window Share on X. Opens in a new tab or window Share on LinkedIn.

The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services reported that the person had underlying medical conditions and was treated at the hospital with influenza antiviral medications, according to a statement from the CDC. The person has recovered. The infection is the 14th human case of avian influenza A reported in the United States this year and the first case where the person had no known contact with infected poultry or dairy cows, the CDC said. H5 bird flu has not been reported among cattle in Missouri, the CDC said Sept. 6. However, H5 bird flu outbreaks have been reported in commercial poultry and backyard flocks. Bird flu is a disease caused by infection with avian influenza A viruses, which occur naturally among wild aquatic birds and circulate among poultry, TODAY.com previously reported.Occasionally, bird flu viruses spread to mammals and, rarely, to humans. Based on available information, the CDC still assesses the current risk to the general public posed by bird flu to be “low.” However, the recent human cases has sounded the alarm among officials in the U.S. and abroad, who are monitoring bird flu viruses closely.14 human cases of bird flu detected in the U.S. in 2024Since the start of 2024, 14 people have been infected with bird flu, the CDC said Sept. 6. In most human cases, people experienced “mild flu-like symptoms,” such as fever or runny nose. Conjunctivitis (pink eye) was also reported in many of those cases. In July, five poultry workers in Colorado tested positive for bird flu, linked to a multi-state outbreak among poultry and dairy cows, according to the CDC. At least 196 herds of dairy cows in 14 states have confirmed outbreaks of H5 bird flu, and outbreaks in poultry have been found in 48 states, per the CDC.The workers experienced mild illness, including pink eye and respiratory symptoms, and none were hospitalized, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health. Less than two weeks earlier, Colorado confirmed a case of H5N1 among a dairy worker who had exposure to sick cows.Two farmworkers in Michigan tested positive in May, and one dairy worker in Texas tested positive for H5N1 in April.The human case in Texas was the first time this strain of H5N1 — referred to as highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) — had been detected in cows and the first instance of cow-to-human transmission, according to the CDC. “The current bird flu strain that we’re concerned with, H5N1, has been circulating around the world for quite some time,” Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, previously told TODAY.com.The cases in Colorado and the second case in Michigan reported pink eye and respiratory symptoms, officials said. The first Colorado case, the first Michigan case, and the Texas case reported mild pink eye as their only symptom.The highly pathogenic H5N1 strain causing the U.S. outbreak is severe and often fatal in birds, but appears to be mild in cows.“Based on the information available at this time, this case does not change CDC’s current A(H5N1) bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public. The risk to members of the general public who do not have exposure to infected animals remains low,” the CDC said.Fatal case of bird flu in MexicoIn late May, authorities in Mexico reported a confirmed human case of H5N2 to global authorities. The patient was the first human have been infected with an avian H5 virus in Mexico, per the World Health Organization. The 59-year-old resident died in a hospital in Mexico City in April after developing a fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and “general malaise,” per the WHO. The victim reportedly had multiple underlying health conditions and had already been bedridden for three weeks for other reasons prior to developing symptoms of bird flu. The source of exposure is unknown, and the victim had no known contact with infected animals, but H5N2 viruses have been detected in poultry in multiple states in Mexico, the WHO said. Respiratory samples collected from the victim later tested positive for avian influenza A (H5N2), the first human case reported globally. There were no further cases identified, and all potential contacts of the victim are being monitored, the WHO. What are the symptoms of bird flu?Bird flu infections in humans can range in severity, experts note. Some people have no symptoms at all or only a mild flu-like illness, while others develop severe disease requiring hospitalization, according to the CDC. “It can be a serious infection with a high mortality rate,” said Schaffner. According to the CDC, reported signs and symptoms of bird flu include: FeverCoughRunny noseMuscle achesHeadacheFatigueShortness of breathEye redness or inflammation (conjunctivitis)DiarrheaNauseaVomitingBird flu in humans may look similar to seasonal influenza flu or upper respiratory infection. In severe cases, bird flu can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure and other complications, TODAY.com previously reported. Many of the human cases in the U.S. have reported eye redness and conjunctivitis, with some patients reporting additional respiratory symptoms including a cough and a fever. They have since recovered.One case of H5N1 in a child in Australia was a severe infection, but the child fully recovered. Victorian health officials did not release additional details about the patient's symptoms. An infection with bird flu viruses cannot be diagnosed by signs or symptoms alone, the CDC says. Laboratory testing is required.How does bird flu transmit to humans?Transmission of bird flu viruses to humans is rare. According to the WHO, since 2003, there have been 903 cases caused by H5N1 in 24 countries. Most human cases worldwide have been caused by H7N9, highly pathogenic H5N1 or H5N6 viruses, per the CDC.Avian influenza can spread from infected birds to humans in a few ways, per the CDC:Directly from an infected birdFrom environments contaminated with bird flu virusesThrough an intermediate host, such as another animalInfected birds can shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, mucus and feces, TODAY.com previously reported. People can become infected when the virus particles get into the mouth, nose, eyes or are inhaled, Schaffner said.Humans typically become infected with bird flu viruses through close, unprotected contact with an infected bird.When it comes to the dairy workers with conjunctivitis, the CDC noted in a press release that “it’s not known exactly how eye infections result from avian influenza exposures.” “It may be from contamination of the eye(s), potentially with a splash of contaminated fluid, or touching the eye(s) with something contaminated with A(H5N1) virus, such as a hand. High levels of A(H5N1) virus have been found in unpasteurized milk from H5N1-infected cows.”Human-to-human transmission of bird flu viruses is rare. The few cases that have been documented have occurred primarily through prolonged, unprotected contact between a symptomatic person and a family member or caregiver, per the CDC.“The virus doesn’t have the (genetic) capacity to spread easily from person to person,” Schaffner said. However, in an April press conference, the chief scientist of the World Health Organization called the risk of the bird flu spreading to humans “an enormous concern,” and warned about the potential for the virus to acquire the ability to spread more efficiently between people. Scientists are closely monitoring bird flu viruses for any changes.Preventing bird fluThere is no evidence that humans can get bird flu from chicken, eggs or beef that's been properly prepared and cooked, and it is safe to drink pasteurized milk, experts say. The risk of getting bird flu is low, but the CDC recommends people:Avoid direct contact with wild birdsAvoid visiting poultry farmsWhen in contact with poultry, wear a mask and eye protectionWash hands after any contact with poultryVisit a doctor if you become sick after contact with birdsCaroline KeeCaroline Kee is a health reporter at TODAY based in New York City.Becca Wood contributed.RelatedCourtesy Sydney Towle Woman, 23, had a ‘burning sensation’ in her stomach.

The Michigan farmworker diagnosed with bird flu had mild symptoms and has recovered. To protect farm and farmworker privacy, additional details about the case are not being provided.The virus has been circulating in dairy and poultry farms across the U.S. this spring, and state and local public health officials have been closely monitoring for human cases, which can occur sporadically in individuals with close contact with ill animals. This virus has been associated with the ongoing multistate outbreak of influenza A (H5N1).As such, it is not unexpected that comprehensive testing identified a human infection. According to the MDHHS, information suggests this is a sporadic infection, with no associated ongoing spread person-to-person.Avian Influenza is spread when domestic birds interact with wild birds who are carrying the disease.(wluc)“Michigan has led a swift public health response, and we have been tracking this situation closely since influenza A (H5N1) was detected in poultry and dairy herds in Michigan. Farmworkers who have been exposed to impacted animals have been asked to report even mild symptoms, and testing for the virus has been made available,” State of Michigan Chief Medical Executive Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian said. “The current health risk to the general public remains low. This virus is being closely monitored, and we have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission at this point. This is exactly how public health is meant to work, in early detection and monitoring of new and emerging illnesses.”MDHHS and local health departments continue to work closely with the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD), farms and workers to conduct monitoring of the health of people exposed to ill animals.“Since the first detection of influenza A (H5N1) in dairy cattle on March 29, Michigan has prioritized both the animal and human health aspects of this disease outbreak. Today’s news underscores the continued importance of limiting nonessential farm visits, including farm tours and field trips, as well as the use of personal protective equipment when working with livestock,” MDARD Director Tim Boring said.Three U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) emergency management teams have been on the ground assisting MDARD in day-to-day responses at all impacted poultry facilities statewide. An epidemiological team from USDA is also deployed to further assist in tracing and testing within dairy herds to be able to provide real-time information.MDARD says it has taken proactive actions by signing a “Determination of Extraordinary Emergency” order Wednesday, May 1, which further protects Michigan’s poultry and livestock industries from the ongoing threat of influenza A (H5N1). Michigan’s order enhances USDA’s federal order, which was issued Wednesday, April 24.MDARD has identified both dairy and poultry farms that have tested positive for influenza A (H5N1) in several Michigan counties. Risk is not limited to those geographies as additional detections may be possible.MDHHS recommends seasonal flu vaccination for people working on poultry or dairy farms. It will not prevent infection with avian influenza viruses, but it can reduce the risk of coinfection with avian and flu viruses.Since 2022, there have been two previous human cases related to bird and dairy exposure in the U.S., with one in Colorado in 2022 and one in Texas in 2024.Copyright 2024 WLUC.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urges state and local health officials to keep up with influenza testing over the summer to track any potential human infections of the H5N1 virus, also know as bird flu.CDC Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah told a variety of health leaders during a meeting on Tuesday that flu surveillance programs should "continue operating at enhanced levels" over the next several months, according to a readout of the call. The recommendations are intended to help keep a "heightened awareness" of influenza transmission during the summer season amid an outbreak of the H5N1 virus in poultry and U.S. dairy cattle.Read more: Compare Top Health Savings AccountsLocal health officials are encouraged to work with laboratories to increase submissions of positive flu virus samples for subtyping, the process used to determine whether an influenza sample is a "common, seasonal" flu virus or a "novel virus" like the bird flu, the CDC said.

More Stock Photo, Getty Images The meeting on Tuesday included CDC Influenza Division Director Vivien Dugan; the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials; the Association of Public Health Laboratories; Big Cities Health Coalition; the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists; and the National Association of County and City Health Officials.Newsweek reached out to the CDC via email for additional information on Tuesday.Only two known cases of human H5N1 infections have been reported in the United States. A dairy farm worker in Texas tested positive for the virus last month. The first case was reported in 2022 and involved a Colorado poultry worker.According to the CDC's count, over 90 million cases of the H5N1 virus have been detected in wild aquatic birds, poultry and common backyard flocks across the nation since January 2022. The first known transmission of the virus to dairy cattle was reported in Texas in March. To date, 51 dairy herds across nine U.S. states have reported an outbreak in the bird flu virus in livestock.Read more: What Is a Health Savings Account?There has been concern that the spread of bird flu in animals could lead to a new epidemic or pandemic, although there have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission. The CDC issued a health alert on April 1 after reports of the Texas dairy farmer's positive case, but told Newsweek at the time that the risk of infection "to the general public" remains "low."Those working with birds or livestock are encouraged to use personal protective equipment to lower the risk of H5N1 infection. Symptoms of the virus can include acute respiratory illness, conjunctivitis, sore throat, fever, coughing and shortness of breath.According to the World Health Organization, there have been 889 human cases of bird flu infections from 2003 to April 2024 across 23 countries. Of those cases, 463, or 52 percent, have resulted in death.

Everything you need to know May 22, 2024 / By Mary Cunningham Body Professor Amira RoessIn April, the World Health Organization confirmed a case of Avian influenza A (H5N1), commonly known as bird flu, in a human in Texas. The individual contracted the disease while working on a commercial dairy cattle farm where the cows are believed to have been infected. The individual reported only minor symptoms and is the first confirmed human case in 2024. A second case of bird flu was reported in a human in May 2024. Cases of bird flu in cattle and other animals have now been found in Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Texas, and other states. Reports have emerged that virus particles have been found in milk, but it is important to note that the virus particles are not infectious in pasteurized milk. Global organizations continue to monitor the situation as it evolves. Amira Roess, professor of global health and epidemiology, offers insight and clarity on the uncertainties of this early disease outbreak. Roess is an epidemiologist who studies emerging zoonotic infectious diseases and their risk factors. Her research is interdisciplinary and includes complex longitudinal studies throughout the world. She served as the science director of the Pew policy commission on Industrial Food Animal Production and also served as a consultant on preparedness and response to H5N1 in 2007. Should I be worried about bird flu right now? Right now, most individuals do not need to be particularly worried about this strain of influenza because it is not affecting large numbers of people. There are many actions being taken to protect humans and to limit the impact of this virus on both our food supply and on people. For example, surveillance of animals has ramped up in response to the growing epidemic in animals. As infected animals are being identified, they are removed from the food supply before they can spread the virus. Should we be worried that the current outbreak will spread? Several agencies are closely monitoring the situation. So far this year, cows, birds, and one person in the U.S. have been infected with the virus. Influenza viruses are notorious for their ability to mutate. We have limited knowledge of cow viruses adapting to humans so the mutations must be monitored closely for any changes that may occur that make the virus more transmissible or more dangerous to humans. If changes occur, early interventions can be put in place, including the development of tailored, vaccines. We have decades of experience monitoring influenza and H5N1 in particular. What we have seen time and time again is that surveillance of human, animal, and environmental samples is extremely important. Surveillance allows us to identify new viral strains that may have public health importance before they cause large numbers of severe illness and death in both people and animals. Is milk safe to drink even though the virus has been found in milk? Here I will emphasize the pasteurized milk is safe for consumption. There have been reports of cats being fatally infected with this strain of influenza after consuming contaminated raw milk. Testing by the FDA and USDA has not detected any live viruses in retail pasteurized dairy products like cheese, sour cream, or milk powders. Essentially, this means that while viral particles have been detected in pasteurized dairy products, including milk, these are not infectious. The bottom line is that pasteurization is effective in inactivating potentially live strains of bird flu. ## To speak to Amira Roess about bird flu or other emerging diseases, please contact Michelle Thompson at mthomp7@gmu.edu Amira Roess is a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University's College of Public Health, Department of Global and Community Health. She is an epidemiologist with expertise in infectious diseases epidemiology, multidisciplinary and multi-species field research and evaluating interventions to reduce the transmission and impact of infectious diseases. Roess currently oversees several longitudinal studies to understand emergence and transmission of zoonotic infectious diseases globally, including the emergence and transmission of Campylobacter (with support from The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation), MERS-CoV (with support from the U.S. National Science Foundation), and the development of the microbiome during the first year of life. She studies links between food animal production and emerging infectious and zoonotic diseases emergence globally, and mHealth (especially apps) technology integration and evaluations to reduce the impact of infectious disease outbreaks, promote health care, and help reduce disparities.

A child acquired the H5N1 strain of the virus in India and became ill upon returning home to Australia in March this year. Based on information made available yesterday on the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), we can ascertain the child is a two-year-old girl. She tested positive in early March and was reportedly very unwell but has since fully recovered. According to the Victorian Department of Health, contact tracing revealed no additional cases, and the risk to others is very low. Humans who acquire H5N1 generally have close contact with infected poultry; H5N1 does not spread easily between people. But the fatality rate in human cases is about 50%. So what should we make of this latest development, as bird flu makes news locally and around the world? H5N1 There’s no publicly available information on how this child became infected in India, or even where in India this case came from. However, the country is currently facing significant avian flu outbreaks in the states of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. H5N1 is a strain of influenza A, which is further divided into variants called clades. GISAID data shows the virus the child was infected with belongs to the H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1a. The South Asian clade 2.3.2.1a was first identified in 2009 and is still circulating in birds in Bangladesh and India. This is different from the clade behind outbreaks in dairy cattle making headlines in the United States (H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b). A second human case in the US associated with this outbreak has just been reported – a dairy worker in Michigan. Globally, a total of 14 human cases have been linked to this clade. What about the poultry farms? On the same day we heard about the child with H5N1, a bird flu outbreak was reported at an Australian egg farm in Meredith, Victoria. This was a different strain, influenza A H7N3. H7 outbreaks are not new to Australia. The earliest H7 outbreak in Australia was an H7N7 outbreak in Melbourne, Victoria in 1976. The three most recent outbreaks occurred in free-range farms in Lethbridge, Victoria, in 2020. While some strains of avian flu tend to produce mild or no visible disease (called low pathogenic), H5N1 and H7N3 are both highly pathogenic viruses. This means they cause severe illness in poultry and wild birds. Wild birds are the source, and can infect farmed or domestic poultry. They can also infect animals such as pigs and horses. Free range farms are at risk of avian flu, as they are outdoors and may be exposed to infected wild birds. But overall there have been very few highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in Australian poultry, summarised in the table below. The strain dominating Europe and the Americas, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, began in 2020 and spread globally to infect more than 300 avian and 40 mammalian species. This is the most worrying clade, as it has spread further and more widely than any other avian flu virus. In mammals and birds it causes severe respiratory disease but also affects the brain. Some good news To date, H5N1 has not been detected in birds in Australia. It’s positive news that the egg farm outbreak is H7N3 rather than H5N1. The unrelated H5N1 infection in the child showed no evidence of spread, and the child recovered. Australia has historically been protected from highly pathogenic avian flu because it’s spread by migrating ducks, geese and swans (known as waterfowl) from Asia. Their flyways bypass Australia. However, with a range of different wild birds now infected by H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, including in Antarctica, there may be new bird migration routes by which the virus could enter Australia. The egg farm outbreak should be controlled quickly by culling infected birds. There are vaccines for poultry, but they are only partially effective and can mask outbreaks, so tend not to be used. France, which has had widespread outbreaks of H5N1 in its farms, began vaccinating poultry recently, but has experienced continued outbreaks. Bird flu can be spread by waterfowl. Iv-olga/Shutterstock What needs to happen now? Past H7 outbreaks have been controlled rapidly in Australia, but we must remain vigilant. Meanwhile, an outbreak of low-pathogenic avian influenza virus H9N2 has been reported in a poultry farm in Western Australia today. The situation is being closely monitored. There are often delays in reporting and sharing of avian flu data. Information on the child in Victoria was reported almost three months after the event, which is not ideal for preparedness. Open source surveillance using publicly available data and intelligence, such as our Epiwatch platform, can provide more rapid information where there may be delays in updates to international reporting databases. Avian influenza is a global concern, so heightened and timely surveillance in animals, birds and humans is crucial, as is global data sharing. The impact of avian flu on farming and the economy is substantial, but we also worry about a human pandemic arising. H5N1 is so widespread globally now that the chance of it mutating to a point where it’s able to spread between humans is higher than ever.

Store-bought milk could be another way to track the bird flu outbreak in cows By Helen Branswell May 21, 2024 Reprints FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images Scientists from the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center have managed to generate a full genetic sequence of H5N1 virus from milk, a development they suggest means commercially purchased milk products could be used to monitor the progress of the bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle and to check for important changes in the virus over time. With dairy farmers still reluctant to allow testing of their cattle, scientists trying to assess whether the outbreak is increasing or waning are in the dark. Likewise, their surveillance for important changes in the viruses — changes that would signal the virus is evolving to be better able to infect mammals — has been hampered by the limited data being shared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.advertisement Analyzing store-bought milk could provide a work-around, the University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson researchers suggested, similar to the efforts underway to analyze wastewater from around the country to check for presence of influenza A viruses. (H5N1 is a member of that large family of flu viruses.) “I think the big thing is we’ve shown that this can be done, and it’s a good tool,” said Pavitra Roychoudhury, a research assistant professor in the department of laboratory medicine and pathology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. “And so if there’s resistance to having cows tested, this might be the next best option. And I think we can track for variant changes over time with this method.” Since the outbreak of H5N1 in cows was first confirmed on March 25, a total of 51 herds in nine states have tested positive for the virus. One human infection has been detected, in a dairy farm worker in Texas who developed conjunctivitis.advertisement Newsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Public health authorities and scientists believe H5N1 is more widely disseminated than those numbers would suggest, but are stymied in efforts to map the scale of the problem due to a lack of cooperation from dairy farmers. Farmers have been reluctant to allow their cattle to be tested, seeing no upside and plenty of downside in being identified as having cows infected with the bird flu virus. A U.S. Department of Agriculture regulation that went into effect on April 29 requires farmers to test lactating dairy cows due to be shipped across state lines. But the rule limits the number of cows that must be tested per shipment to 30, leaving the choice of the cows to be tested to the individual farmer. Only 15 new herds have been reported since the rule went into effect, leaving observers to wonder whether it can have its intended effect, as currently written. “Whenever you have a regulation, someone will find a way around it,” said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and a professor of large animal internal medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Poulsen, who believes testing of milk in the bulk tanks on individual farms will eventually need to take place, agrees that monitoring milk for virus particles would provide useful data. So does Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals, located at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. Webby’s laboratory was involved in early testing to see if evidence of H5N1 RNA could be found in commercially purchased milk. H5N1 bird flu: Go deeper The federal response to bird flu spreading among dairy cattle could be hampered by USDA-FDA turf wars. Scientists with 30 years of experience in avian flu are watching the latest outbreak developments with vigilance and dread. The CDC launched a bird flu wastewater surveillance dashboard to warn localities of possible outbreaks. Many dairy farmers were reluctant to embrace H5N1 control measures, so the federal government started offering incentives for bird flu protective measures. A large survey, conducted in mid-April by the Food and Drug Administration, found that one in five milk samples brought in 38 states was positive for H5N1 virus. It should be noted that the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that was used can detect both live viruses and fragments of dead ones, and cannot differentiate between the two. Efforts to grow live, infectious virus from positive milk samples have failed so far, buttressing the FDA’s claim that pasteurization kills H5N1 virus in milk. Webby said there are some potential complications involved in using milk to monitor changes in H5N1; as the virus changes, it could be difficult to know at times what is being seen. For instance, if genetic sequencing showed evidence of more than one version of the virus in a sample, it might be hard to know whether changes observed in, say, the hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase proteins — the H and N in an influenza A virus’ name — occurred in all the viruses, or if some had one of the changes, some had the other, and some had both. That’s not to suggest the work wouldn’t still provide important data, Webby said. “The fact that viruses with those two mutations are out there in itself is useful information. So I don’t want to pooh-pooh the whole idea at all. I think it’s absolutely a great way to follow the continued evolution of the virus. It’s just not going to be as tidy as doing single source samples.” Peter Han, research manager of a laboratory run by Lea Starita at the Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine at the University of Washington, said the group collected 40 samples of milk simply by asking people to bring in a test tube’s worth from the supply in their own fridges. Two of the 40 were positive for H5N1 fragments and the full genetic sequence was generated from one of those two samples. The two positive samples were from milk that was packaged in Colorado, which has reported outbreaks in herds. Though inexpensive, the work wasn’t easy, Roychoudhury said. “Milk’s a really challenging sample to work with, because there’s a lot of fat,” she said. “So the fact that we were able to get a whole genome out of it was slightly surprising to us. It also means there was enough virus in there to pull a genome out, which to me was slightly — maybe not slightly — alarming.” The genetic sequence of the virus was uploaded to Genbank, a sequence database run by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Roychoudhury said the group struggled to figure out how to date the finding — genetic sequences are typically identified by where and when the virus sample was taken, and the species or substance from which the viral information was retrieved. With no clear idea when the milk was produced, the group identified the sequence simply by month and year. The sequence has also been posted on Nextstrain.org, a website designed to track the evolution of pathogens like influenza and SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19. Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist in the vaccine and infectious disease division at Fred Hutchinson and one of the architects of Nextstrain, said the group behind the generation of the genetic sequence from milk has notified the various U.S. government agencies involved in the H5N1 response in the hopes that an organized effort to use this form of surveillance can be put in place. “You could either imagine some systematic effort from something like USDA — I’m not sure who’s the exact right agency — or the academic groups could collaborate a bit more,” Bedford said, adding he thinks monitoring milk could provide key information that’s been missing up till now. “Separate from the sequencing for evolution [of the virus], which I think is very important, just even understanding prevalence through space and time, I think, would be really helpful and important.” About the Author Reprints Helen Branswell Senior Writer, Infectious Diseases Helen Branswell covers issues broadly related to infectious diseases, including outbreaks, preparedness, research, and vaccine development.

Narrative Change Who We Are Our Methodology Media Contact Jobs Support Our Work A Bipartisan Majority of Voters Support a Federal Ban on Raw Milk Products in the Face of Bird Flu Threat By Matthew Cortland and Grace AdcoxIn March, federal public health officials announced that the bird flu known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), specifically the H5N1 strain, had been confirmed in American dairy cattle for the first time.Although H5N1 does not currently transmit easily to humans, according to the World Health Organization there were 889 known cases of human H5N1 infection worldwide between 2003 and April 1, 2024. Of those 889 cases, H5N1 caused 463 deaths (a case fatality rate of 52%). Federal public health officials have confirmed three human cases in the United States, including two exposed to the virus by working in proximity to infected dairy cows. With the current outbreak impacting not only wild birds and poultry, but also now spreading through dairy cattle, public health experts are concerned that this increased mammal-to-mammal transmission may allow the virus to mutate in such a way that it poses increased danger to humans. Workers in the agricultural industry as well as individuals who consume unpasteurized dairy products are among those at greatest risk. To understand the public salience of these concerns, Data for Progress fielded a survey of 1,213 national likely voters in May. After reading a description of the U.S. outbreak of avian influenza that was identified in 2022, including its impacts to poultry farms, dairy cattle, and — at the time the survey was fielding — two human workers in these industries, 49% of voters say they are “somewhat concerned” or “very concerned” about avian influenza becoming widespread in the U.S., with heightened concern among Democrats (61%). In recent weeks, H5N1 fragments have been found in American commercially available milk. Importantly, milk pasteurization, the flash heating of milk to at least 161°F for at least 15 seconds, has been confirmed to destroy the H5N1 virus. When asked whether they believe raw milk and cheeses made from raw milk are safe or dangerous to consume, half of voters say they think unpasteurized dairy products are dangerous. In contrast, only 22% of voters think unpasteurized dairy products are safe to consume, with 27% unsure about the level of risk associated with these food products. Finding such a high proportion of voters unsure about the safety of these products presents a significant opportunity for public health education about the dangers of unpasteurized dairy products. Pasteurization not only guards against H5N1, it also destroys other pathogens commonly found in raw milk, including salmonella, E. coli, and listeria. After reading that some health experts have recommended banning the sale of foods made from raw dairy products in order to lower the risk of H5N1 spreading, 65% of likely voters say they would support banning the sale of raw dairy products. Support for a ban exists across party lines, with 80% of Democrats and 56% of both Independents and Republicans in favor. Federal law currently bans the interstate sale of raw milk, but does not prohibit in-state sales.

Chiara Eisner/NPR hide caption toggle caption Chiara Eisner/NPR Raw milk is getting fresh scrutiny, as bird flu continues to infect dairy herds. A highly pathogenic strain of flu, deadly to birds, has spread to at least 58 herds of dairy cattle in nine states, and to at least two people. Samples of unpasteurized milk have been found to contain the virus, according to USDA tests. But while federal authorities have advised people not to drink raw milk, it is still on sale and easily accessible in many places across the country. Even in Texas, where the bird flu in cows was first detected and where it has been found in more than a dozen herds, some farms selling unpasteurized raw milk to the public declined to have their supply examined, NPR found after reporters purchased raw milk and submitted it for testing on May 8. Sponsor Message The USDA-approved lab authorized to test the milk for the H5N1 bird flu virus called the farms to seek their permission to examine the milk, then also declined to test the milk for bird flu when the farmers did not grant it. “[The farms] are aware of what a nonnegative test would do to their business,” said Brandon Dominguez, the Veterinary Services Section Head at the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic laboratory in College Station, Texas. “They asked that we do not run the test.” After NPR reported that the USDA had confirmed the agency does not require labs to have permission from farms to test milk samples for bird flu, Amy Swinford, the director of the Texas A&M lab, added that another reason the lab could not perform the test is that reporters did not provide the premise identification numbers for each of the farms. Those numbers are not publicly available; reporters did include the license numbers of each of the farms when they submitted samples for testing. The lab and the farms’ refusal to test samples of raw milk comes as scientists have criticized the federal government for being slow to collect and report information about the virus. There has been no widespread testing of dairy workers to understand how many may be infected, no mandate that dairy farms test their herds if they aren’t moving cattle between states, and no clear testing data to support federal authorities’ warnings of a potential threat of bird flu in raw milk that people drink. Sponsor Message Advocates and critics of unpasteurized milk square off In the void of evidence, both sides of the raw milk debate are shoring up their traditional perspectives. Public health officials and academics say the risks are currently heightened, and that precautions should be taken until there’s a clearer understanding of the scope of bird flu in dairy cows, and how it’s spreading between animals and humans. “Pasteurization is effective at inactivating the virus,” said Don Prater, head of the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, in a press call on May 1. “[We] strongly advise against the consumption of raw milk – milk that has not been pasteurized – and recommend that the industry does not manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products made with milk from cows showing symptoms of illness, any illness, including those infected with avian influenza virus,” Prater said. Raw milk advocates say the theoretical risks are exaggerated and are the latest chapter in their long, contentious battle with the federal government, which banned the interstate sale of raw milk in the 1980s. “The FDA will take any excuse to blast us any way they can,” says Marc McAfee, a raw milk dairy farmer in California and founder of the Raw Milk Institute, an advocacy organization. Raw milk for sale, but not recommended It’s not hard to get raw milk in Texas. You can pick it up at a fitness center in Austin, or drive directly to the farmhouse stoops of dozens of raw milk dairies sprinkled throughout the state. There, if you drop some money in a lockbox, you can leave with a cold gallon of milk, straight from the cow, that’s never been heated to a temperature that would kill the bacteria and microorganisms that might be living in it. Sponsor Message Cheryl Masraum was unconcerned about bird flu as she bought raw milk from Stryk Jersey Farm in Schulenburg, Texas, between Houston and San Antonio. “We were keeping up on that, but it didn't seem to be a threat here,” said Masraum, noting that the outbreaks in cows were reported in northwest Texas, near the New Mexico border. “I think the raw milk is typically a much better quality, and it just tastes better.” Samples of raw milk from different Texas dairy farms that NPR collected for testing. Lucio Vasquez/Houston Public Media hide caption toggle caption Lucio Vasquez/Houston Public Media Masraum is part of the small but passionate group of raw milk consumers in America. Roughly 1.6% of U.S. adults frequently drink milk that’s never been pasteurized to kill germs, according to a survey from the Food and Drug Administration. Now, the bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle has prompted federal health officials to renew their warnings to the public not to drink raw milk. Public health officials say they’ve long recommended against drinking raw milk, because it can harbor disease-causing bacteria. Pasteurization, the brief heating of milk, can kill or inactivate microbes.. Still, the risk of contracting bird flu from raw milk is largely theoretical. “There's not a tremendous amount of studies showing the infectivity related to this virus and raw milk products,” FDA’s Prater said during the press briefing. How much bird flu virus is in milk? The FDA found bird flu virus fragments in 20% of pasteurized, grocery store samples the agency collected and tested, according to a recent survey. Those virus fragments were not capable of causing infection, according to FDA tests. According to the federal government, the virus appears to be spreading between herds through the movement of infected cows. In the current working theory, H5N1 jumped from birds to dairy cows in Texas towards the tail end of 2023. Then, “the transportation of cattle from Texas to a number of other states basically created problems in those states,” U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack told reporters May 10. Vilsack said that the USDA’s current strategy – of requiring cows to test negative before they move across state lines – is aimed at “trying to contain the spread and eventually allowing for specific herds to have the virus peter out.” Sponsor Message Raw milk advocates say their farms are small, and their herds are relatively isolated. Raw milk can only be legally purchased in the state it’s produced in. “There’s been no exposure of our cows with cows that are positive from other states. We don’t buy cows from other states. So why would [our cows] be positive?” McAfee, in California, says. No cows or milk samples from California have tested positive. Virus researchers counter that there’s not enough ongoing surveillance to establish the limits of the outbreak. “I don't know that we have the information because we haven't been systematically testing,” saysDr. Helen Chu, an infectious diseases specialist at University of Washington in Seattle. “This is a virus that mutates very quickly, that goes from humans to birds to pigs to cows – to all of these different species.” Given that avian influenza is carried by wild waterfowl and migratory birds “who are flying all over the place and defecating into the feed of farms everywhere… I don't know that we've been looking [enough] to know for sure that this is the one event,” Chu says. One way to determine if there’s H5N1 virus in raw milk, intended for humans to drink, is to test for it. Chu’s colleague Lea Starita, who leads a genomic testing lab at the University of Washington, has tested dozens of milk samples, raw and pasteurized, purchased from local farmer’s markets and grocery stores. She has found probable viral fragments in about 5% of the samples, though the raw milk samples have tested negative. But testing raw milk for bird flu is not happening regularly, and farms have declined requests to have their raw milk tested, NPR and others have found. “They're frankly afraid of what's going to happen to their farms, their families. It isn't just strictly a public health issue. It's an issue of economics and frankly, survival,” said Swinford, the director of the Texas A&M lab that declined to test the milk NPR submitted for analysis. Sponsor Message On May 21, an employee of the Texas A&M lab confirmed that the lab could ship the samples to another laboratory for NPR, and that shipping was a service the lab provided to clients. But on May 22, Swinford called a reporter to say that she would not allow that for the raw milk that NPR purchased and submitted for testing of bird flu. “I’m not going to facilitate that…because these dairies told us not to test them,” Swinford said. Could consuming avian influenza in raw milk infect people? The federal government’s warnings against raw milk consumption are based on known dangers. Raw milk has been implicated in food poisoning of more than 2,500 people food poisoning over the past 20 years, with bacteria such as Campylobacter and Cryptosporidium. But whether unpasteurized milk can give people bird flu is unclear. Farm cats that drank unpasteurized milk from infected cows became seriously ill – some cats went blind, experienced serious neurological effects and died after drinking it, according to a recent report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. And mice that were fed samples of infected, unpasteurized milk from cows in New Mexico got sick very quickly and had high virus loads in their respiratory tracts, according to a May 24 report in the New England Journal of Medicine, co-authored by Swinford at Texas A&M. So far, there are no confirmed cases of humans getting bird flu from drinking raw milk. Two dairy workers – one in Texas and one in Michigan – got sick with avian influenza after working closely with infected cows. In both cases, the workers developed eye infections and have since recovered. On May 1, the CDC said health authorities had monitored over 100 exposed workers without finding any bird flu infections. But a veterinarian in Texas told the publication Bovine Veterinarian of sick farm workers that have not been tested. Sponsor Message As far as consumers go, McAfee and other raw milk advocates see the lack of cases to be reassuring. If nobody has caught bird flu from drinking raw milk yet, it may not happen at all. But public health officials maintain that bird flu in dairy cattle remains a new, evolving situation. “There are a lot of unanswered questions, and much more to learn,” says Lori Freeman, head of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. “Until we learn more about this particular pathogen spreading among animals and to people, we should be taking an abundance of precaution.” Raw milk farmers say they’re following the developments closely, and working to ensure that their cows are healthy and their milk is safe. And that these arguments are unlikely to sway many of their committed customers. “People that follow us – if FDA says it's bad, they'll run [towards] it,” McAfee says, “In my opinion, here in California with our raw milk, it's much ado about zero.” bird flu raw meat dairy farms H5N1 texas farmers Facebook Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Instagram Press Public Editor Corrections Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity NPR Network Accessibility Ethics Finances Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor5 Minnesota poultry flocks struck by HPAI, APHIS reports | WATTPoultry.comMarket InformationTop Poultry CompaniesExpert InsightsBlogsRegionsMagazinesSign InPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureTopicsPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureRegionsMarket InformationTop Poultry CompaniesTop Feed CompaniesAgriculture ProductsDirectory of SuppliersEvent CalendarExpert InsightsWebinarsBrand InsightsPodcastsWhite PapersWATT Poultry ChatTop Companies Data DownloadsMagazinesMoreSign InSubscribeAdvertiseAbout UsContact UsFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconSign InFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureMarket InformationTop Poultry CompaniesExpert InsightsBlogsRegionsMagazinesSubscribeAdvertiseBroilers & TurkeysDiseases & HealthAvian Influenza5 Minnesota poultry flocks struck by HPAI, APHIS reportsAmong those birds affected were egg layers, meat turkeys and turkey breeder hens.Roy GraberMay 23, 2024Trend Design | BigstockThe presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been confirmed in five commercial poultry flocks in Minnesota.According to information from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), three of the affected premises are in Stearns County, while Meeker and Morrison counties each had one flock infection.The Meeker County case involved a flock of 1,368,800 commercial table egg layers, while the Morrison County flock involved 51,900 commercial meat turkeys.Two of the Stearns County flocks were commercial meat turkeys. One of those flocks included 22,000 turkeys, while APHIS has not yet released the number of birds in the other flock. The third Stearns County case was a flock of 7,500 commercial turkey breeder hens.All five cases were confirmed by APHIS on May 21.Prior to these flock infections, the last time HPAI was confirmed in a commercial poultry operation was May 2, when a commercial breeder operation in Dodge County was affected. In this instance, 8,500 birds were lost.The only other U.S. commercial poultry operation to be struck by HPAI in May was a commercial meat turkey flock in Gratiot County, with 26,400 birds involved. That case was also confirmed on May 2.To learn more about HPAI cases in commercial poultry flocks in the United States, Mexico and Canada, see an interactive map on WATTPoultry.com.

In March, a Texas farmworker was infected, reporting “redness and discomfort in the right eye,” according to a case report in the peer-reviewed New England Journal of Medicine.Sponsor Similarly, the Michigan dairy worker only reported eye symptoms, according to information released Wednesday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Related:Michigan farmers must step up bird flu fight under new emergency orderBird flu hits turkey flock in Newaygo County as virus spreads in MichiganBird flu found in hens at Michigan’s top egg producerBird flu found in cattle on a dairy farm in central MichiganThe Michigan case was mild and the worker has “recovered,” according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. Federal and state officials maintain that the risk to the public is low. Regular surveillance systems across the nation have detected no unusual flu activity, according to the CDC.“Information to date suggests this is a sporadic infection, with no associated ongoing spread person-to-person,” according to the Michigan health department release. In Michigan, the case initially went undetected. A nasal swab first tested negative for influenza in Michigan, but an eye swab from the patient was shipped to CDC. There, it tested positive for the flu virus, according to the CDC.Eye infections, or conjunctivitis, have been associated with previous human infections with avian influenza A viruses around the world, but it’s known exactly how eye infections result from avian influenza exposures. It may be from splashes of contaminated fluid from the livestock or when workers — with the virus on their hands — touch their eyes. “High levels” of the virus have been found in unpasteurized milk from infected cows, according to the CDC.That means “people with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals” and to those animals’ environments should take precautions, according to the CDC.Because of the increased surveillance, it comes as little surprise that human cases may be detected, health officials have said.The virus has been circulating in dairy and poultry farms across the U.S. for several months, and was detected in Michigan cattle March 29. Just more than a month later, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s director Tim Boring directed farmers to take extra precautions to separate potentially infected livestock and to minimize interaction between humans and farm animals.Boring, in the statement released Wednesday afternoon, said finding the human case is “exactly how public health is meant to work, in early detection and monitoring of new and emerging illnesses.”And he urged farmworkers to “report even mild symptoms,” in an email to Bridge sent through the department’s communications department. Sponsor Still, it was not clear what part of the state nor when the case occurred.MDARD spokesperson Jennifer Holton referred questions to the MDHHS, citing the health department as the lead agency for any human illness. Health department spokeswoman Chelsea Wuth, citing the farmer’s confidentiality, declined to release to the public where the case occurred or a broad time frame for the case.Since 2022, there have been three human cases related to bird and dairy exposure in the U.S. In addition to the Texas case, Colorado reported a human case in 2022 — the first in the U.S. In the 2022 case, the worker was involved in a poultry operation.

Shares in some companies that produce vaccines have seen stock boosts following a small number of reports of bird flu among people in the U.S.On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced a second case of a farmworker contracting the "highly pathogenic avian influenza virus" H5N1 from dairy cows in Michigan, which is a disease "caused by infection with avian influenza Type A viruses."These viruses can also spread among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species.The latest case followed reports on April 1 that a dairy worker in Texas had previously been diagnosed with bird flu, while the only other human case in the U.S. was detected in a Colorado poultry worker in April 2022, raising concerns that bird flu could spread further among humans.While the CDC said the risk to humans remains low, with the only symptom reported by people with the infection being conjunctivitis, shares went up in some companies that could develop a vaccine if a bird flu pandemic materializes.

Photo by DANIEL DORKO/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images CureVac, a Germany-based company, announced an early-stage H5N1 vaccine trial in collaboration with GSK last month. Its shares rose 18 percent, while GSK's gained 7.87 percent.In the past month, Moderna, which is in discussions with the U.S. government over advancing its flu vaccine development, gained 13.7 percent.BioNTech rose 11 percent in the last month, while Pfizer's share price increased by 12.46 percent, according to Google Finance data.Newsweek has contacted the companies mentioned for comment via email.Including the U.S. cases, there have been eight human bird flu infections worldwide.Earlier this month, government officials said they were looking into vaccines against bird flu that could be ready within weeks.A Moderna spokesperson told Newsweek: "Moderna can confirm we are in discussions with the U.S. government on advancing our pandemic flu candidate, mRNA-1018. The Phase 1/2 dosing of mRNA-1018 is complete, with data expected soon. The H5 vaccines in this trial cover the same clade as the currently circulating variant in the United States. We remain committed to using our mRNA platform to respond to public health concerns."A GSK spokesperson added to Newsweek: "GSK is closely monitoring the H5N1 situation and the evolving epidemiology. We are directly connected with our contractual partners to deliver on our commitments in the event that an influenza pandemic is declared."GSK is committed to helping authorities around the world to be better prepared for future pandemics, including a potential pandemic influenza outbreak. In 2022 GSK was awarded multi-year contracts with the U.S., Canada, the EU and the WHO to supply our pandemic preparedness vaccine if the World Health Organization declares an influenza pandemic. These contracts will support the ready production and supply of this vaccine, and together could provide at least 200 million doses of pandemic influenza vaccine around the world."The nine states where H5N1 has been detected in cows as of Wednesday are: Texas, Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Kansas, South Dakota, Idaho, Colorado and New Mexico. A total of 52 herds are believed to be affected.The virus has also been discovered in poultry in 48 states and 524 counties, affecting over 90 million birds as of Wednesday. The CDC says that bird flu has also been found in tests of 9,352 wild birds.One in five commercial milk samples have tested positive for genetic traces of the virus. However, these traces are not capable of causing an infection in pasteurized milk.The CDC recommends the following actions to keep people safe from bird flu: avoid direct contact with wild birds, report sick or dead birds to local authorities and avoid unprotected direct physical contact or close exposure to cattle.Update 05/23/24, 10:31 a.m. ET: This article was updated with comment from a Moderna spokesperson.Update 05/24/24, 05:48 a.m. ET: This article was updated with comment from a GSK spokesperson.

An experimental mRNA vaccine against avian influenza virus H5N1 is highly effective in preventing severe illness and death in preclinical models. The vaccine could potentially help manage the outbreak of the H5N1 virus currently circulating in birds and cattle in the United States, and prevent human infections with the virus, according to research from the Perelman School of Medicine published in Nature Communications. Penn Medicine’s Scott Hensley (left) and Drew Weissman. (Image: Courtesy of Penn Medicine) “The mRNA technology allows us to be much more agile in developing vaccines; we can start creating a mRNA vaccine within hours of sequencing a new viral strain with pandemic potential,” says Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology. “During previous influenza pandemics, like the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, vaccines were difficult to manufacture and did not become available until after the initial pandemic waves subsided.” Hensley and his laboratory collaborated in the study with the laboratory of mRNA vaccine pioneer and Nobel Prize winner, Drew Weissman, the Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research and director of Vaccine Research at Penn Medicine. “Before 2020, experts thought the influenza virus posed the greatest risk of causing a pandemic, and we had limited options for creating a vaccine if that had happened,” says Weissman. “COVID-19 showed us the power of mRNA-based vaccines as a tool to protect humans from emerging viruses quickly, and we are better prepared now to respond to a variety of viruses with pandemic potential, including influenza.”The Penn researchers developed an mRNA vaccine targeting a specific subtype of the H5N1 virus that is circulating widely in birds and cattle. While it rarely infects humans, some fear that the virus may evolve and cause a human pandemic.Read more at Penn Medicine News.

Colorized H5N1 virus particles (in gold) turned up in Texas' wastewater monitoring in early March, before researchers knew the virus was spreading in dairy cows. Cynthia Goldsmith/CDC CNN — In early March, Dr. Blake Hanson and his colleagues at the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute were preparing for a fire drill of sorts. What if a virus with the potential to spark the next pandemic turned up in the wastewater they monitor? And what if that virus was the bird flu, H5N1, which has killed millions of animals and about half the nearly 900 people it has infected worldwide over the past two decades? They gamed out this what-if exercise on a Monday. By Thursday of that same week, Hanson’s colleague, Dr. Michael Tisza, a molecular virologist and microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, was ringing the alarm. This time, it was not a drill. “Mike had called me and said, ‘Hey, I think I found it,’” said Hanson, an epidemiologist at UTHealth Houston who uses big data methods and genomics to investigate infectious diseases. That was March 7, about three weeks before the US Department of Agriculture announced that H5N1 had infected dairy cattle in Texas for the first time. A different kind of wastewater monitoring Over the past two years, as the idea of sampling sewer systems for the virus that causes Covid-19 and other pathogens has caught on across the country, the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute — or TEPHI — took a different approach. Rather than looking only for specific viruses, researchers there decided to use advanced techniques and computers to help sift through the vast soup of genetic material in their wastewater samples. By doing this, they’re able to find viruses they expect to see as well as ones they don’t know to look for. “We can capture every known virus that that’s in the sample, and then the computational team will analyze the data comprehensively and see signals for many viruses, and that’s the benefit, I think, of what we’re doing relative to other sites,” said Dr. Anthony Maresso, a molecular virologist and microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who envisioned the system. Cows are seen standing in a feedlot on June 14, 2023 in Quemado, Texas. Brandon Bell/Getty Images Related article Spikes of flu virus in wastewater raise questions about spread of bird flu At least two other organizations have also been looking for signs of H5N1 in wastewater. The WastewaterSCAN network, which is directed by researchers at Stanford and Emory Universities and Verily, recently posted a preprint study showing that it could detect the H5N1 virus in wastewater by looking for one specific part of the virus. In addition to that early data, the team has since tested three additional sewer systems: one in North Carolina near a known H5N1 cattle outbreak, one in a California city that was having an unseasonably high number of human influenza A cases and one in a city in Hawaii where there are no dairy processing plants and no known cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza. In each case, the test correctly ruled in or out H5N1 infections. It was so successful that WastewaterSCAN plans to start using the test at all 190 wastewater sites it monitors. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recently launched a dashboard showing sites where influenza A viruses are being detected at unusually high levels. H5N1 is an A strain of the flu virus, like some types of seasonal flu. Detecting A strains now, in the offseason, is a reasonable proxy for H5N1, Maresso said, but it will be a less useful approach when seasonal influenza picks up again in the winter. TEPHI’s system, on the other hand, could serve as a first alert for new viruses, the holy grail of pandemic prevention. Since the team started monitoring in 2022, they have found over 400 viruses in Texas wastewater. Data at the flush of a toilet Unlike taking a swab of a person’s — or a cow’s –—bodily secretions, wastewater monitoring is passive and doesn’t depend on getting permission to test or having a person come into a clinic or emergency room, care that may be out of reach for farmworkers. Researchers get data every time someone flushes a toilet or perhaps when wastewater systems treat agricultural waste, such as the permitted disposal of discarded milk. The biggest drawback of wastewater monitoring is that it is difficult to pinpoint the source of the pathogen. Since March 4, the date of the sample in which H5N1 was first detected by the TEPHI group, the researchers have found it all over the state, in the wastewater of nine cities in Texas and in 19 of the 23 sites they monitor. They did not name the cities they tested in the study but said they did notify local public health authorities and the CDC about their results. Their findings were published recently as a preprint study, ahead of scrutiny by outside experts. Source of the signal is still a mystery “We don’t really know where it’s coming from,” said Dr. Eric Boerwinkle, dean of the UTHouston School of Public Health and director of TEPHI. “We can all guess, and some people have their favorite ideas,” he said, noting that Texas is in the path of two major flyways for migratory birds and has a large agricultural industry that includes farmed birds and cows. But H5N1 has been tearing through wild and commercially farmed bird flocks in the US since 2022, when the team started monitoring wastewater, and they haven’t seen it in any of their samples until now. “Certainly, something that’s different now,” Tisza said, “is that it’s commonly infecting dairy cows.” Only one person has tested positive for H5N1 in connection with the cattle outbreak. That person, a farm worker who had close contact with infected cows and developed a severe case of conjunctivitis, or redness and swelling of the eyes, but no breathing problems or congestion. He was treated with antiviral medications and has recovered, public health officials said. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team. The CDC says the current risk to public health is low, but it’s keeping a close eye on the situation. The FDA recently tested 297 samples of dairy products purchased at grocery stores across the country. In expanded test results released Monday, the agency said, it found samples that were positive for dead fragments of the H5N1 bird flu virus in 15 of the 38 states where products were processed. About 1 out of every 5 samples had some traces of the virus, indicating that the outbreak might be more widespread than previously known. TEPHI’s Maresso says they can’t rule out that what they are seeing is virus from milk that’s been poured down the drain or even asymptomatic human infections. He notes that they are not seeing an increase in flu cases in hospitals, which would alert them to severe infections. “It would be maybe a more easily solvable puzzle if it was just one or two sites and we had some dairy or other processing plants right near that that plant where we’re sampling from. It would explain things. but we have essentially detected the signal on in nearly every site and certainly every city to this point,” Maresso said – even big cities in the state that aren’t near dairy farms. As far as the direction of the Texas outbreak, whether it’s getting worse or going away, Tisza says, it’s hard to say. At first, he said, some cities his group monitors had a signal from H5N1 that was as strong as the one they see from seasonal influenza over the winter. “But overall, it’s been only maybe about 25 percent of that signal,” he said. “As far as the overall trajectory, it’s really kind of at a plateau right now.

(U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/The Associated Press)Social SharingThis story is part of CBC Health's Second Opinion, a weekly analysis of health and medical science news emailed to subscribers on Saturday mornings. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.When U.S. dairy cows began falling ill with a dangerous form of bird flu, many scientists were struck by an unusual pattern: The virus kept showing up in cows' udders, of all places.Influenza is usually known as a respiratory virus, entering the body through the throat and nose before heading to the lungs. But Canadian virologist Alyson Kelvin wasn't among those shocked by the udder discovery."We've known that the cow mammary gland is susceptible to influenza virus infections since at least the '50s," said Kelvin, a longtime influenza researcher who works at the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization. "So this isn't that surprising."Indeed, decades of scientific study provided early clues that something like this was possible. WATCH | 1st human infection linked to U.S. dairy cow H5N1 outbreak:Human bird flu case linked to U.S. dairy cattle outbreaks7 months agoDuration 2:32A person in Texas who had close contact with infected dairy cattle has been diagnosed with bird flu. It's the country's second known human case after the virus was discovered circulating among dairy cows across at least four U.S. states for the first time.Even though 2024 marked the first time H5N1, a form of influenza A, was reported in dairy cows, researchers knew influenza viruses can target the cells that make up mammary glands.The little-understood transmission pathway may have also played a role in two human infections linked to the current U.S. outbreak — both of which only involved eye infections, possibly from the virus entering the eye membranes through contaminated milk."I think if we paid more attention to [these possibilities]," Kelvin said, "we might have not been so surprised."Early research showed flu can infect cow uddersSo far, cases among U.S. dairy cows have officially spread to more than 50 herds across nine states. But multiple scientists who spoke to CBC News in recent weeks say sluggish data-sharing and limited testing — and the detection of harmless viral fragments in the country's processed milk supply — suggest the virus is already more widespread. Genetic sequencing of the virus, showing its evolution, also suggests H5N1 was likely circulating in cows months before the first cases were discovered in March.That explosive spread appeared to come out of thin air.Second OpinionThere's no question H5N1 bird flu has 'pandemic potential.' How likely is that worst-case scenario?Yet decades earlier, researchers from Canada's department of agriculture were conducting "preliminary" experiments on lactating dairy cows to see what would happen when the animals were infected with several types of viruses.Their 1953 paper showed that a type of human influenza A could infect cows' mammary glands, leading to live virus in milk secretions.University of Saskatchewan virologist Alyson Kelvin says researchers have known for decades that influenza viruses can target the cells that make up mammary glands. ( David Stobbe/VIDO/University of Saskatchewan)Kelvin's own research, published in 2015, probed the issue further. Her team explored influenza transmission between mother and infant ferrets, an animal scientists typically rely on for flu research since ferrets' airway receptors are the most similar to humans'.After infecting ferrets with a type of influenza, the researchers observed several key outcomes: infant ferrets became severely ill or even died; transmission of the virus from infants back to the mother ferrets led them to develop potentially deadly lung infections; and live virus was found in both the mammary gland tissue and the mother ferrets' milk."These findings suggest the mammary gland may have a greater role in infection and immunity than previously thought," the team concluded.Federal tests find no signs of bird flu virus in Canadian retail milkKelvin said her discoveries were met with crickets. "I had lots of people say, 'Who cares about the mammary glands? Why do you care about what happens if an influenza virus infects a breast?'" recalled the virologist."Well, I have a long list of reasons. But it was really hard to get more funding to understand the answers to those questions."Human cases linked to outbreakFinding answers to how flu viruses are transmitted has perhaps never been more pressing given the ripple effects of H5N1's unusual spread — from infections back and forth between cows and birds, to a rising number of human exposures and infections.The two human cases linked to the outbreak so far, both among farm workers, only involved eye infections — including eye inflammation for an individual in Texas, and undisclosed eye symptoms for a more recent case in Michigan.While it's not clear how bird flu reaches the eye membranes, contaminated milk may play a role there as well, possibly from a "splash of contaminated fluid" or someone touching their eye with their hand, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a recent statement.Earlier research also showed that simply getting virus-filled milk in the eye area could lead to an eye infection, Kelvin noted — highlighting yet another way flu viruses can spread, beyond the tried-and-true respiratory system route.Canadian dairy farmers urged to consider goggles, gloves and other bird flu protectionsEye infections from other forms of bird flu had been seen prior to 2018.In those cases, the only known exposure was contact with infected poultry — often during culling operations, during which eye protection isn't necessarily worn, one research team said. "This suggests that ocular infection usually occurs either from workers touching their eyes with contaminated hands or from the virus traveling through the air," the scientists wrote. It's possible that the virus could be spreading in a similar way now, but through cows, creating ever more opportunities for human infections.'It's easy to dismiss that literature'But before the unusual U.S. cow outbreak, there wasn't much awareness about past research — often contained in "niche, quite often a bit older papers" — that suggested other sorts of transmission routes were possible, research virologist Tom Peacock said.A fellow with the Pirbright Institute, a U.K.-based research organization striving to prevent and control viral diseases that can spread from animals to people, Peacock said lab-based studies may hint at the myriad ways flu can infect animals, but often, those outcomes aren't observed in the wild. "Prior to something like this, it's easy to dismiss that literature," he said. "And I think a lot of people did dismiss it incorrectly."Raw milk may be riskier amid avian flu outbreak in U.S. Stick to pasteurized dairy, experts warnThe spread of H5N1 to nearly every corner of the world, even mainland Antarctica — and to a dizzying array of species, including dozens of mammals — continues to prove scientists should "expect the unexpected," Peacock said. One fresh case study from Michigan State University, for instance, focused on one of the state's dairy farms and revealed striking new details on the presentation of cow infections.LISTENCould H5N1 become the next pandemic?The May 17 report, based on conversations with a farmer and testing on their roughly 500-cow herd, noted the farm's outbreak began in a barn with just two pens of cattle. Yet the virus somehow spread to an estimated 40 per cent of the herd within a couple of weeks.While earlier reporting suggested cows only experienced mild infections, the Michigan case study revealed infected cows had high fevers leading to "severe dehydration," aborted calves and a substantial drop in milk production. Another farmer also noted symptoms sometimes lasted for four to six weeks. The H5N1 virus can show up in milk from infected cows. Scientists believe raw milk could pose a risk to humans as a result, though studies suggest pasteurization ensures processed milk is safe to drink. (Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters)Milking process could fuel transmissionWhat's unique about dairy cows, immunologist Stephanie Langel said, is that their milk is used for mass production, rather than just feeding their own offspring, which could help explain these striking patterns in transmission and symptoms.For one thing, dairy cows are milked over and over using shared equipment. New research — published online Wednesday as a preprint that hasn't yet been peer reviewed — suggests the messy milking process could facilitate udder-to-udder transmission of H5N1 between cows, and surface-based transmission to farm workers.Pasteurized milk includes remnants of H5N1 bird flu, U.S. officials sayMilk drips during milking, farmers spray water to clean up, and the whole process means plenty of virus-filled particles may be floating around, said Langel, a Cleveland-based researcher and assistant professor in Case Western University's school of medicine, who wasn't involved in the paper.And though it's still not clear exactly how the virus is moving cow-to-cow, it's apparent that mammary glands are a huge reservoir containing "massive amounts" of this virus that can wind up in raw milk, Langel said."This is a very unique, perfect-storm kind of way that the mammary gland can serve as a vector now for transmission," she said. That may also help explain both the eye infections experienced by dairy workers and the dire health impacts on farm cats who drink raw, virus-filled milk.Second OpinionBird flu vaccine candidates already exist. But if H5N1 sparks a pandemic, making enough doses won't be easyOne U.S. CDC study found more than half the cats at a Texas dairy farm died after drinking milk from infected cows, and faced systemic infections involving serious brain inflammation and high viral loads."The cats may be like this canary in the coal mine," Langel said. Scientists believe raw milk could pose a risk to humans as well, though studies suggest pasteurization ensures processed milk is safe to drink.Scientists watching wastewater for signs of H5N1 as U.S. bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle growsIn another lab-based study, published as correspondence in the New England Journal of Medicine on Friday, mice that were administered raw milk from infected dairy cows experienced high virus levels in their respiratory organs, and lower virus levels in other vital organs."The results suggest that consumption of raw milk by animals poses a risk for H5N1 infection and raises questions about its potential risk in humans," said the U.S. National Institutes of Health in a statement about the findings.Burning questions still remainBoth Kelvin and Langel called for more research to better understand the complex mechanics at play when viruses infect mammary glands, and what that means for transmission to cows, humans and other species.Effective use of personal protective equipment among farm workers is also important, farmers and medical experts recently told CBC News. Scientists warn Canada 'way behind the virus' as bird flu explodes among U.S. dairy cattleAnd most crucial, Langel said, is finding out how to prevent these specific kinds of influenza infections in cows' udders in the first place. Doing so could help protect the dairy industry and slow transmission to ensure humans aren't being repeatedly exposed to a virus, she said.One study produced during the current outbreak, which hasn't yet been peer reviewed, showed the cells in cows' mammary glands can be infected by both avian and human influenza viruses, perhaps giving it opportunities to further adapt in ways that could one day facilitate human-to-human transmission.WATCH | Bird flu outbreaks shake poultry industry:Avian flu outbreaks shake Quebec poultry industry1 year agoDuration 2:02A Quebec poultry farmer is taking extra precautions to protect his livelihood and livestock as the province grapples with avian flu outbreaks that have killed almost one million birds in the past year.While emerging research offers new pieces to the puzzle, Kelvin said a long-standing lack of interest in maternal health has left scientists somewhat in the dark over what could come next.It's still not fully clear why mammary glands are susceptible to influenza, how often those kinds of infections can occur, and whether it takes a certain level of virus to sicken an animal through that transmission route, she said. Second OpinionWhy dangerous bird flu is spreading faster and farther than first thought in U.S. cattleWith those burning questions in mind, Langel also questioned if it's even possible to stop the spread of H5N1 among cows, given how widespread the virus is throughout the U.S. dairy industry."I'm hoping that this outbreak shows we need to understand women's health — female health, lactating animal health — more," Langel said.ABOUT THE AUTHORLauren PelleySenior Health & Medical ReporterLauren Pelley covers the global spread of infectious diseases, pandemic preparedness and the crucial intersection between health and climate change.

The child contracted the virus in India in March of this year – likely through contact with a sick bird – and experienced a “severe infection,” but has since made a full recovery, according to local health authorities. Officials said contact tracing has not identified any further infections and that the risk of transmission to others was “very low”, as the virus has not yet shown evidence that it can spread between people. The Department of Health in the Australian state of Victoria, where the human case was identified, are also responding to an outbreak of avian influenza at a poultry farm but has said that it is an unrelated incident. Although H5N1 infections in people are rare, the highly pathogenic virus carries an alarmingly high mortality rate. Of the 800 cases reported since the late 1990s, roughly 50 per cent resulted in death. The virus has recently broken out among dairy cattle in the US in an unprecedented outbreak. So far, 51 herds in nine US states have been affected, although experts think it is far more widespread. The apparent ability of the virus to spread between cows is significant because it provides more opportunities for it to evolve to better infect and spread between other mammals. Of particular concern is whether H5N1 might now be able to infect pigs, often described as ‘mixing vessels’ for influenza and making it more likely that the virus could adapt to spread between humans. So far this year, there have been two other confirmed human cases of H5N1. In Vietnam, a man died in March after direct contact with an infected bird, whilst in Texas a farm worker caught the virus from sick cattle – although his symptoms were mild.The US Centre for Disease Control is monitoring a further 300 people who have been exposed to the virus via cattle for signs of infection. The WHO still considers the risk to humans low but urged countries to rapidly share information to enable real-time monitoring of the situation to ensure preparedness as the virus continues to spread.

The propensity of flu viruses to mutate into new strains means vaccines must be continuously monitored and reformulated each year. Telegram Facebook Copy Link PTI Updated On May 20, 2024 at 02:28 PM IST Read by: 100 Industry Professionals Read by 100 Industry Professionals By Vinod RMT BalasubramaniamNew Delhi: Clinical trials of an mRNA vaccine have begun and researchers expect broadly positive outcomes in the battle against the widespread illness. Influensa kills up to 650,000 people around the world each year. Ninety-nine per cent of deaths in children under five years of age in developing countries are due to influensa-related infections, according to the World Health Organisation. The current crop of influensa vaccines has limitations in effectively combating the billion cases of seasonal influensa each year as they provide immunity against only one specific existing strain or mutation. The propensity of flu viruses to mutate into new strains means vaccines must be continuously monitored and reformulated each year. Advt But a universal influensa vaccine, using mRNA technology - which was used with success during the COVID pandemic - has the potential to provide broader and longer-lasting immunity against diverse influensa strains. The technology allows for rapid development and deployment and offers versatility in targeting multiple regions of the influensa virus. New or mutated influensa variants are always a threat, particularly those originating from animal sources. Pandemics such as the Spanish flu of 1918, which killed 50 million people, and recent outbreaks of the avian influensa ("bird flu") viruses underscore the persistent threat posed by influensa. It also underscores the urgent need for a universal influensa vaccine capable of safeguarding against all subtypes of the virus. In recent years, lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated nucleoside-modified mRNA ('mRNA-LNP') vaccines have emerged as a potent tool in combating influensa and other infectious diseases. These vaccines use mRNA created in a laboratory to teach our cells how to make a protein - or even just a piece of a protein - that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. The limited efficacy of current vaccines can be attributed to their focus on only generating strain-specific antibodies against the influensa virus hemagglutinin (HA). This is a protein within the virus which causes infection. Advt To broaden protective immunity, novel vaccine strategies aim to elicit responses against more proteins (fragments of a virus). One promising avenue involves triggering T-cell responses. T-cells are a type of white blood cell and are part of the body's immune system. T-cell-mediated immunity not only eliminates infected cells but also correlates with improved outcomes in individuals affected by influensa. Animal studies have demonstrated the protective role of T-cells against various influensa virus strains. These vaccines, exemplified by the successful development and global deployment of mRNA-LNP-based COVID-19 vaccines, elicit robust T-cell and antibody responses. These vaccines also offer the advantage of rapid production and adaptation to target emerging viral variants. While several mRNA-LNP influensa vaccines are in development, most prioritise stimulating antibody responses and under-exploit the potential of T-cell immunity. How the vaccines can work The development of a universal influensa mRNA vaccine requires careful consideration of several pivotal factors to optimise its effectiveness and suitability. Initially, the vaccine should target regions within the influensa virus responsible for viral replication but are less susceptible to mutation. By concentrating on these regions, the vaccine can elicit broad and enduring immune responses, offering protection against an array of virus strains. Encapsulating nucleoside-modified mRNA within lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has emerged as a promising strategy to bolster vaccine effectiveness. These LNPs shield the mRNA from degradation and facilitate its delivery to target cells, where it can be translated into viral proteins, triggering immune responses in the human body. Additionally, optimising the mRNA sequence can boost protein reaction, ensuring robust and persistent immune responses post-vaccination. Another crucial aspect of designing a universal influensa mRNA vaccine is incorporating adjuvants or 'agents' to amplify vaccine efficacy. An adjuvant is an ingredient used in some vaccines that helps create a stronger immune response in people. Integrating adjuvants into the vaccine formulation improves vaccine efficacy, especially in individuals with compromised immune systems. The design of a universal influensa mRNA vaccine should thus prioritise triggering T-cell responses, enhancing mRNA delivery and expression, incorporating adjuvants to boost efficacy and addressing practical considerations for global distribution. By tackling these critical aspects, a universal influensa mRNA vaccine holds the potential to revolutionise influensa prevention and control efforts, offering comprehensive and enduring protection against seasonal and pandemic influensa strains. As shown by COVID-19, mRNA vaccines have demonstrated safety and efficacy in clinical trials for various infectious diseases. This instils confidence in the feasibility of developing a universal influensa mRNA vaccine that is safe and effective. Ongoing advancements in mRNA technology, such as improved delivery systems and stabilisation methods, further enhance the prospects of creating a universal influensa vaccine that ticks all the boxes. The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has started enrolling volunteers at Duke University in North Carolina to test its experimental mRNA-LNP vaccine against seasonal influensa, one of several universal influensa vaccine candidates now in the pipeline. Another clinical trial has begun at the US National Institutes of Health's Clinical Centre in Maryland. The mRNA vaccine technology offers several advantages, including rapid development, scalability, and precise design. Two categories of mRNA vaccines exist, conventional and self-amplifying and both are being explored for their potential to confer broad protection against influensa viruses. Despite their promise, challenges remain in effectively delivering mRNA molecules into a vaccine due to their inherent instability. Overcoming these challenges is essential for the successful development of universal mRNA vaccines for influensa. This aside, the advancements in mRNA vaccine technology have paved the way for innovative approaches to crystallising universal influensa vaccination, offering hope for broad protection against this ever-changing virus.

The child, who arrived in Australia in March, experienced a “severe infection” but has since made a full recovery and contact tracing has not identified any further cases of avian influenza.The virus was detected through the state’s disease surveillance system, in which positive influenza cases are subject to further testing to identify novel or concerning flu virus strains.It removes Australia’s status as the only continent not to have a confirmed case of H5N1 in a bird or mammal. The H5N1 strain has yet to be detected in birds in Australia. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Earlier, Agriculture Victoria reported that the avian influenza virus was detected at an egg farm near Meredith in western Victoria after a number of poultry deaths.The Victorian chief veterinary officer, Dr Graeme Cooke, told the ABC Country Hour on Wednesday that the variant detected was H7N3, a type of high pathogenicity (HPAI) strain of avian influenza that has been detected in Australia before, most recently in Victoria in 2020 and 2021.Cooke said that H7 subtype of HPAI was “the most common variety that occurs in Australia from time to time”.‘The issue is when to pull the trigger’: how prepared are we for human bird flu?Read more“There is a type of virus which is causing great concern in the USA and other parts of the world and has behaved unusually in that it has infected dairy cattle and some other marine mammals and so on,” Cooke said. “This is not the strain that we’re dealing with. This is a strain that’s occurred in Australia before. It’s likely not new”.He said he would “never say it’s a relief to have a type of high pathogenicity avian influenza”.A global outbreak of the H5N1 subtype of HPAI has killed millions of wild birds and thousands of mammals on six continents, and devastated commercial bird populations.It has spread to more than 40 species of mammals, including polar bears, and is widespread among dairy cattle in the US.Only one case has been reported in a human in an apparent transfer of the virus from another mammal: a man in Texas who had been in contact with dairy cows. The World Health Organization has said the spread of the virus to dairy cattle is an “enormous concern” but the director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, this month said the virus had so far shown no signs of adapting to human-to-human transmission and public health risk remained low.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The outbreak was declared over on 26 February 2021.Cooke said to control this outbreak, there would be a “depopulation” of the “diseased and at risk” population of birds – reported to be hundreds of thousands at the one egg farm.The Meredith property has been placed under quarantine and authorities have established an “intensive restricted movement zone” 5km around the property, with another controlled movement zone on a larger radius, in an attempt to stop the spread. This article was amended on 23 May 2024 to correct the variant of avian influenza identified at a Meredith egg farm. It was H7N3, not H7N7 as a previous version said.Explore more on these topicsBird fluThe rural networkRural AustraliaAgricultureVictorianewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Victorian Farmers Federation says vast numbers of birds will have to be culled and that farmers are doing all they can to ramp up biosecurity.Avian influenza has spread to a second poultry farm in Victoria, authorities have confirmed, which has led to more than 500,000 birds being euthanased this week.The H7N3 strain of the virus commonly known as bird flu was found on an egg farm in Meredith on Wednesday and has now been linked to another site 130 kilometres south-west, near Terang.The ABC understands the two farms are owned by the same person.The H7N3 is a high pathogenic strain of avian influenza and resulted in 400,000 chicken deaths at the Meredith farm in a bid to control the spread of the virus.A 5km restricted area has been established around the Meredith property and a 1.5km exclusion zone is in place around the Terang property.Poultry and equipment can only be moved by authorised officials.Additional movement controls and surveillance within at least 15km of properties are in place and permits are required for the movement of poultry, poultry products and equipment.Quarantine measures are in place after the detection at Surf Coast Eggs. (ABC South West Vic: Jean Bell)More than 500,000 birds deadVictorian Chief Veterinary Officer Graeme Cooke said the Terang egg farm housed more than 150,000 birds."It's not unexpected when you start this type of tracing exercise to find that there is evidence of the virus in other premises," he said."It's not unusual for poultry farms to be under the same management in very different areas — it's much too early to draw any conclusions and we're awaiting the results of the laboratory analysis."The birds on the infected premises which are showing clinical signs … are humanely destroyed and disposed of in a safe manner, all to prevent any onwards spread."It's an unfortunate event, but we don't want it to become any worse."This is the ninth outbreak of avian influenza recorded in Australian poultry farms.The most recent outbreak was in Victoria four years ago and began at a poultry farm in the state's west.Agriculture Victoria is urging all poultry and bird owners to follow biosecurity practices such keeping poultry sheds, yards, aviaries and equipment clean and restricting contact between poultry and wild birds.More than 150,000 birds will be euthanased at the Terang site to control the virus spreading.

Two different strains of avian influenza — also known as "bird flu" — have been detected in Victoria. Here's what to know about bird flu, its risk of transmission to humans and what precautions to take against its spread.She said poultry owners were worried about the welfare of their flocks and the potential impact on the bottom line."No industry and no farmer wants to cull birds — that's the first problem for our industry," Ms Cucinotta said."Hundreds of thousands of birds unfortunately will have to be culled."Then, what that does for demand and supply — and we don't want the public to feel like they can't consume either poultry or egg products."They are completely safe to consume."She said industrial poultry owners across the state were ramping up biosecurity measures."Despite the fact that I'm not in that region, it's extremely stressful on the farm," Ms Cucinotta said."Where have our eggs been, where have our pallets been, what contractors have been on the farm?"It is the first time in four years that bird flu has been found in Australia. (Supplied)Wild birds 'the biggest risk'Ms Cucinotta said the biggest risk to poultry was wild birds spreading the virus."We're a flight path in Australia, so we have a lot of birds that come in from South-East Asia that fly over," she said."We can't reduce that risk and that's probably the scariest part for us."Even if a farmer or Agriculture Victoria does absolutely everything in their power to create great biosecurity and to control disease, at the end of the day the biggest risk are wild birds."Dr Cooke said all Victorian bird owners should ensure their poultry are kept separated from wild birds, that their footwear is clean, always wash their hands before and after handling birds or eggs, and quarantine new birds before integrating them with flocks."Biosecurity is always important in the poultry industry, many diseases are carried by wild birds, particular ducks and waterfowl," he said."Wild birds don't show any signs of the disease, normally, and domestic poultry are very susceptible, so don't feed them in the same place and don't allow access to the same water."Consumers should not be concerned about eggs and poultry products from the supermarkets — they do not pose a risk and are safe to consume.Separately, Australia recorded its first-ever human case of bird flu this week, after H5N1 avian influenza was detected in a child travelling home to Victoria.The human case is not related to the virus detections on either poultry farm.ABC Rural RoundUp newsletterStories from farms and country towns across Australia, delivered each Friday.Your information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Email addressSubscribePosted Thu 23 May 2024 at 10:22pmThursday 23 May 2024 at 10:22pmThu 23 May 2024 at 10:22pm, updated Fri 24 May 2024 at 1:52amFriday 24 May 2024 at 1:52amFri 24 May 2024 at 1:52amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger New Zealand’s decision to no longer offer free influenza vaccines for all children under 12 will likely wipe out recent gains in uptake. And it will disproportionately affect those living in deprived areas and with a high risk of disease. Influenza accounts for more than half of all potentially vaccine-preventable hospitalisations of children under 14 in New Zealand. But those living in poorer areas are three times more likely to be hospitalised due to a lung infection. Health New Zealand recommends annual vaccination for all children from the age of six months. During the 2022 winter season, New Zealand’s medicines funding agency Pharmac made flu vaccines free for all children aged three to 12. In 2023, this was extended to start at six months of age. But in 2024, the funding was cut back to the previous criteria. This means only children with a history of significant respiratory illness, certain long-term medical conditions, or those hospitalised for any respiratory illness when aged under four are eligible for free vaccines. We compared how many New Zealand children received the flu vaccine before (2018-21) and during (2022-23) universal funding and found substantially higher uptake when vaccines were free. A step backwards In 2018, before the COVID pandemic and free influenza vaccines for all children, only 4.4% of those under five received the vaccine. The uptake was lower in tamariki Māori (1.9%) and Pacific children (3.1%). Flu vaccine uptake increased in 2020, likely because of general concern about respiratory illness during the first year of the COVID pandemic. But it declined again in 2021 to below 2018 levels. Following universal funding in 2022, uptake almost tripled for under-fives (4.4% in 2018 to 12% in 2023). However, there were substantial differences by ethnicity. Uptake was highest in Asian children (21.3%) and lowest in Pacific children (8.0%) and tamariki Māori (4.9%). The trends by age group give some insight into the impact of funding. In 2022, uptake increased more than two-fold in age groups where all children were eligible for free vaccines. In 2023, we saw a three-fold increase in uptake in the only newly eligible age group (six to 12 months). Overall, 12% of children of all ages except the oldest (nine to 12) were vaccinated. Focusing flu vaccination funding only on those at the highest risk is a step backwards for New Zealand and will likely reduce uptake. In contrast, Australia has funded flu vaccines for all children aged six months to five years since 2019. Influenza in children Acute respiratory hospitalisations from any cause are almost three times higher in New Zealand than in comparable countries. A recent report shows influenza accounted for 56% of all potentially vaccine-preventable hospitalisations between 2016 and 2020 in children under 14 years. This is more than varicella, measles, whooping cough and meningococcal disease combined. In New Zealand, influenza accounts for more than half of potentially vaccine-preventable hospitalisations. Christian Charisius/Getty Images It is not just children with medical conditions who get severely sick from influenza. In Australian children under five, less than half of those hospitalised due to influenza had long-term medical conditions, although these children were more likely to require intensive care. While deaths from influenza are rare in children, over half of US children who died from it during the 2023-2024 winter season were previously healthy. Vaccination remains the best protection The effectiveness of the influenza vaccine varies from season to season, depending on circulating strains and how well that year’s vaccine is matched. But vaccination remains the main way to protect against severe influenza. Studies in children found the influenza vaccine reduces the risk of hospitalisation by about 50%, and even higher for some influenza strains and years. Studies in countries comparable to New Zealand (UK, Italy and Finland) looking at the cost effectiveness of flu vaccines found universal funding to be highly cost-effective compared with a high-risk approach. In 2024, Pharmac stated: We considered widening access to the flu vaccine […] we would like to fund in the future, depending on available budget. In contrast, the comparable Australian advisory committee concluded in 2019 that universal influenza vaccination for children under five met its cost-effectiveness criteria. Where to next Influenza causes more illness in young children, including severe disease requiring hospitalisation, than we generally recognise. An age-based universal programme would almost certainly result in substantially higher uptake, including in higher-risk children, than a targeted approach. We believe the high and inequitable burden of influenza in young New Zealand children and the low cost of influenza vaccines, compared to other vaccines currently funded, should prompt urgent reconsideration of universal funding, at least for children below the age of five. If universal funding is not considered affordable in the Pharmac budget, the case for restoring free vaccines for all Māori and Pacific children is strong given their high burden of disease. As for the influenza immunisation programme in general, it is not just about funding. We must engage with the community to raise awareness of the severity of flu in children and the effectiveness and safety of vaccines, along with improving access to immunisation services. We would like to acknowledge the contribution from colleagues Ewan Smith and Emily Dwight.

Read our privacy policyA new case of highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected at a poultry farm in Australia’s southeastern Victoria state, officials said on Thursday, a day after the country reported its first human case of the virus and also a strain on an egg farm.The human case found in Australia is of the same H5N1 strain that has spread rapidly around the world but the ones detected on the farms in Victoria are of the different H7N3 strain.Agriculture Victoria, in a statement, linked the strain detected at the poultry farm in the Terang region to that reported at the egg farm in Meredith, where it said “the H7N3 high pathogenic strain of avian influenza virus has resulted in numerous poultry deaths”.“The property in Terang is directly connected with the Meredith property, through joint management, staff and machinery,” it said.The statement quoted Victoria’s Chief Veterinarian Graeme Cooke as saying that Agriculture Victoria staff were on the ground to help contain and eradicate the virus.Victoria was also the site of an H7N7 outbreak in 2020, the most recent of Australia’s nine outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) since 1976. All were quickly reined in and stamped out, the government says.Bird Flu (Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)In the United States, a second human case of bird flu has been confirmed since the virus was first detected in dairy cattle in late March, US officials said on Wednesday.The H5N1 outbreak among dairy cattle in at least nine U.S. states since late March has raised questions over whether it could spread to humans.The gruesome symptoms of a dairy farm worker who contracted avian flu from an infected cow in America were revealed in a new medical study this month.Avian Influenza Eye Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus Infection in a Dairy Farm Worker (The New England Journal of Medicine)The photo of the employee, who is based in northern Texas, shows both of their eyes with burst blood vessels. In the right eye, there was also yellowish fluid which typically leaks out of a wound.The employee suffered a subconjunctival hemorrhage, according to the New England Journal of Medicine (NJEM) study. The patient tested positive for influenza A and A (H5) virus based on eye and nasal swabs. Medical officials say that the symptoms closely resembled pink eye, an inflammation that causes the eye to turn red.The dairy worker, who was not identified, did not suffer from symptoms typically associated with avian flu such as fever, coughing or sneezing, meaning that the illness might not be easily transmittable from person to person. The worker was treated for the symptoms with oral oseltamivir, an anti-viral medication, and later recovered from the illness.More aboutAustraliavirusAgriculturebird fluJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/3Australia reports new bird flu case day after first human infectionAustralia reports new bird flu case day after first human infectionBird FluCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The property is in quarantine and poultry keepers are being urged to monitor their birds carefully.Hundreds of thousands of birds have been euthanased at a Victorian egg farm after the detection of avian influenza.The property near Meredith, in the state's west is in quarantine and testing has revealed that the strain of the disease is H7N3, which is the most commonly occurring variant in Australia.Agriculture Victoria said the detection was the result of investigations of poultry deaths at the farm.Late Thursday, Agriculture Victoria confirmed the same strain of the virus was linked to a second outbreak, at a poultry farm at Terang, in the state's south west.The confirmation comes amid fears of a global bird flu outbreak following the widespread detection of the H5N1 strain overseas.Victorian Chief Veterinary Officer Graeme Cooke said avian influenza was present in Australian wild birds and "from time to time spilled over into the domestic poultry population"."We are putting in place all the requirements to prevent it spreading any further and removing the chance of any onwards spread," he said."This area [surrounding the detection] does have a high density poultry businesses, both egg laying and meat."Poultry farmers, backyard flock and bird owners are urged to report any cases of unexplained bird deaths to the 24-hour Emergency Animal Disease Hotline on 1800 675 888, or to your local vet."Movement restrictions are in place in a bid to control an outbreak of bird flu. (ABC News: Rochelle Kirkham)Global outbreakAvian influenza is a highly contagious virus that affects bird species and some variants can spread to other species, including humans.There's an animal pandemic sweeping the world. Will humans be next?Photo shows A person in a white protective suit stands next to a lake holding a dead crane. Australia is one of the last places on the planet free from high pathogenicity bird flu. But authorities warn there's an increased risk of an outbreak here as scientists say the world is in an animal pandemic.There are many types of bird flu, including the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, which has been a cause of concern for local authorities as there is a global outbreak which has been detected in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, North America, South America and Antarctica.Dr Cooke said all variants of bird flu were of serious concern and it was a relief that H5N1 was not detected in the outbreak near Meredith."In the USA and other parts of the world the H5N1 virus is causing great concern, as it has behaved unusually, as it has infected dairy cattle and some other marine mammals and so on."This is not the strain that we're dealing with."After the news of the outbreak near Meredith was reported on Wednesday, the Victorian government announced that a human H5N1 infection had been reported in Victoria.The case related to a child who returned from overseas in March.The child experienced a severe infection, the government said, but made a full recovery.The outbreak near Meredith and that infection are not related.There is no risk to the public of contracting avian influenza through food. (ABC News: Sophie Johnson)Bird flu was last detected in Australia in 2020, when it was found on an egg farm south of Ballarat.This resulted in multiple outbreaks in Victoria and led to tens of thousands of farmed birds being euthanased.Agriculture Victoria is urging all poultry and bird owners to follow biosecurity practices such keeping poultry sheds, yards, aviaries and equipment clean and restricting contact between poultry and wild birds.Bird owners should also ensure their footwear is clean, always wash their hands before and after handling birds or eggs, and quarantine new birds before integrating them with flocks.Consumers should not be concerned about eggs and poultry products from the supermarkets — they do not pose a risk and are safe to consume.ABC Rural news dailyKey stories of the day for Australian primary producers, delivered each weekday afternoon.ABC Rural Weekday NewsABC Rural Weekly NewsYour information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Email addressSubscribePosted Wed 22 May 2024 at 12:44amWednesday 22 May 2024 at 12:44amWed 22 May 2024 at 12:44am, updated Thu 23 May 2024 at 8:49pmThursday 23 May 2024 at 8:49pmThu 23 May 2024 at 8:49pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

Scientists say it's only a matter of time before it reaches Australia.Antarctica is home to some of the world's most unique animals.Now, scores of them are dying in "mass mortality events", the likes of which the continent has never seen.

A research team inspecting skua carcasses at Beak Island. (Supplied: Ben Wallis)“It was quite devastating, every couple of metres you’re finding another dead bird," Federation University Australia researcher Dr Meagan Dewar told 7.30.A multinational crew of scientists led by Dr Dewar made the grim Antarctic finding on their most recent disease surveillance expedition in March.Among the casualties were dozens of skuas — the big brown seagull-like birds had suffered a sudden death."It's devastating that we may have lost a population, just as we've discovered it," Dr Dewar told 7.30.

Dr Dewar said there were clues to indicate sudden death as their bodies appeared healthy and many had food in their stomachs."It indicates most likely [the cause of death was] an infectious disease of some sort," she told 7.30. Samples from the penguins are still being analysed. Antarctica is a frigid and fragile ecosystem, home to some of the world’s most unique animals.

More than half of the world's penguins call Antarctica home.(Supplied: Michelle Wille )There are now concerns for all bird and mammal species across the continent. Adult and baby penguins in Antarctica.(Supplied: Michelle Wille)"Now that it's moved onto the peninsula, there's a greater risk it'll spread to other parts of Antarctica," Dr Dewar said. A flock of skuas in Antarctica.(Supplied: Michelle Wille)Skuas are known to frequently move between animal populations across Antarctica, and could potentially spread the virus to penguin colonies next season. "We do know there are species that mix with similar species from different populations during winter, so there's a chance of [further] spreading the virus and taking it back to their colonies," Dr Dewar said.How did bird flu get to Antarctica? The working theory for the Antarctic spread is relatively simple, and commonly attributed to most other bird flu outbreaks: wild birds.In this case, it's suspected infected skuas carried the virus from the sub-Antarctic Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island, where there were several known hotspots – including infections in mammals.Those sub-Antarctic cases were introduced by birds who carried the deadly strain from South America, which has seen bird populations decimated in recent years. The avian influenza virus can spread through marine mammals.

(Supplied: Michelle Wille)Developments have been closely monitored and logged by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), and show a clearly defined route.Virus Ecologist Dr Michelle Wille has been tracking bird flu for years."If we look at what's happening around the world – this virus has arrived and left a trail of destruction, we're talking species-level consequences," she told 7.30.Loading..."The worst-case scenario is arriving at penguin colonies that are silent, arriving at places where there should be abundant wildlife and having nothing."It's very hard to predict what's going to happen in the next season, or even this winter."A mutating shapeshifterBird flu isn't anything new.It became a well-known virus in the late 1990s, when an outbreak in a Hong Kong poultry market resulted in the deaths of several people.The disease then appeared in other birds and poultry throughout Asia, before breaching Europe, spreading into Africa and reaching the Americas. 2000: Officers from Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department take chicken blood samples obtained from a farm.(Reuters) 2006: Turkish veterinary officials in protective suits collect ducks in a village named Yilanli near the eastern Turkish town of Dogubayazit.(Reuters: Umit Bektas) 2014: An aerial view shows workers wearing protective suits culling chickens at a poultry farm in Japan's Kumamoto prefecture.(Reuters/Kyodo) 2022: Workers removing cranes that died following an outbreak of avian flu in northern Israel.(Reuters: Ronen Zvulun) 2023: An oceanologist photographs a dead porpoise on the Atlantic coast off Brazil during an outbreak of bird flu.

Dead pelicans lie on the shore of the river Camana after Peruvian authorities recorded first cases of bird flu in November 2022.(Reuters: Sebastian Castaneda)In Peru, at least 40 per cent of the native pelican population has been wiped out. A dead penguin on the beach of Punta Bermeja. (AP: Juan Macri)More than 10 per cent of the penguin species have been affected as well. Sea lions in Argentina affected by bird flu.(AP)And this strain is not just killing birds — more than 10 per cent of sea lions have died across the continent.The list goes on.Globally, more than 500 bird species have been affected, and more than 60 mammalians.In poultry, some of the worst outbreaks have been recorded in the United States. The Centre for Disease Control estimates total losses exceeding 90 million chickens and turkeys across 48 states.And the most recent unexpected developments with bird flu have come in the US.Authorities there are dealing with the fallout from a peculiar "spillover" event — which is when animals pass the virus to other species.Somehow, a herd of dairy cattle became infected, spreading it to other bovines, and to at least one person — a farmer who reported having mild flu symptoms and conjunctivitis.The transmission to multiple species and humans has raised questions.Another pandemic?While this strain has jumped species and finds new hosts with ease, scientists say there is little concern for humans at present.A team of Australian scientists at the CSIRO's Centre for Disease Preparedness (ACDP) are an authority on the matter and back that statement.Dr Frank Wong, who is a global authority on avian flu, described humans as "dead-end hosts", which means an infected person cannot pass it on to others."In the few cases where people have got infected, they've mainly been people at the front lines dealing with the outbreak or infection," Dr Wong told 7.30."The virus still hasn't been able to easily transmit from a mammalian host — from person-to-person or mammal-to-mammal."Dr Wong and others know this because of their research, which takes place in an airtight high-biosecurity laboratory where they're growing the latest H5N1 strain to study it more closely. Dr Frank Wong is a CSIRO and World Organisation for Animal Health reference expert for highly pathogenic and low pathogenic avian influenza.(ABC News: Patrick Rocca)Loading...Loading... The procedures here are strict and the rooms are airtight.(ABC News)The virus is injected into eggs and replicates itself before being harvested.This is also how some vaccines are developed.So if the day ever comes when we need one for bird flu, they already know how to develop it.Will bird flu breach Australia? No one is certain, but the highest risk period for Australia is theorised to be from September — the start of Spring.That's when migratory birds are expected to make their return from Europe.The first place of incursion depends on which birds (species and populations) are involved.Shorebirds stop along the top end of Australia first — where places like Broome are important sites.But some fly directly to the country's southern parts, bypassing the top end.If it arrives with seabirds, like muttonbirds, it would first arrive at their colonies, and this could be across many places.

Some sectors are watching more closely than others.Australia's poultry industry, which has fallen victim to a number of past deadly outbreaks, including previous strains of bird flu, has increased biosecurity to its strictest level yet.A bleak picture has been painted in Australia's Avian Influenza Plan, written by a National Biosecurity Committee.Loading...It suggests our domestic economy could suffer from a widespread outbreak and disruptions within the poultry sector.Export markets for chicken products would "likely close immediately".It predicted other industries, including tourism, would be affected.There are grave concerns for wildlife too, with a widespread outbreak potentially reversing "decades of conservation efforts".There are currently 163 bird species considered either critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable and those could be pushed closer to extinction.

Admitting an outbreak is unavoidable doesn't mean the outlook is hopeless. For several years, state, territory and federal governments have been preparing and considering an incursion to be inevitable.You can't stop wild birds at the border, so enhanced surveillance is the key to spotting and controlling any outbreaks."Our teams here keep a close eye on genetic evolution of the virus and we know what new strains are emerging as the virus spreads in different parts of the world — particularly in our region," Dr Wong told 7.30."With influenza, we never say never, but we are confident that we're well prepared for any possible incursion." The highest risk period for avian influenza in Australia is theorised to be from September.(Supplied: Dr Meagan Dewar)In a country as vast as Australia, the public plays an important role too.We're being asked to immediately report any unusual bird deaths to the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline on 1800 675 888.Health authorities have also warned against handling sick or dead birds.Those now in charge, watch, wait and hope.CreditsReporter: Tom HartleyPhotos and videos: Dr Meagan Dewar, Dr Michelle Wille, Ben WallisDigital production: Jenny KyEditor: Paul JohnsonWatch 7.30, Mondays to Thursdays 7:30pm on ABC iview and ABC TVContact 7.30Do you know more about this story?

Both properties are also subject to a broader control area buffer.First human H5N1 case reported in Australia as another highly pathogenic strain of bird flu detected on Victorian farmRead moreThe strain at both properties was not the same as the H5N1 strain which had been wreaking havoc globally, Victoria’s chief veterinarian, Graeme Cooke, said.“The strain of the virus detected near Meredith is H7N3, which is different from the H5N1 avian influenza strain that’s impacting the US and other parts of the world,” Cooke said.“While cases among humans in direct contact with animals infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are possible, the current risk to the public remains low.”On Wednesday, a child was confirmed as Australia’s first human case of the H5N1 variant spreading around the world.The child, who returned to Victoria from India in March, experienced a “severe infection” after contracting the strain but had made a full recovery, and contact tracing had not identified any further cases.The H5N1 strain had yet to be detected in birds in Australia. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Dr Joanne Sillince, the acting chief executive of the Australian Chicken Growers’ Council, said the H7N3 strain in Terang and Meredith was “the devil we know” for Australian poultry farmers, whereas the H5N1 strain causing global destruction was “the devil we don’t”. The latter, she said, was much more worrying for producers.Sillince said Australia was fortunate in that its egg and chicken production areas were siloed from each other, which may slow the spread of a potential outbreak.The managing director of peak body Australian Eggs, Rowan McMonnies, praised the operators of the Meredith farm for raising the alarm quickly, saying “early reporting, quarantine and decontamination puts us in the best position to eradicate this virus”.Meanwhile, in Western Australia, biosecurity measures had been tightened on a poultry farm in the state’s south-west after a third, unrelated strain of avian influenza was found.Authorities said the WA detection was a low pathogenic H9N2 strain and not connected to the Victorian outbreak.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Rural NetworkFree newsletterSubscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The child is no longer unwell. “A child in Victoria has been confirmed as having the first case of bird flu in Australia. The child acquired the avian influenza A (H5N1) infection while in India, and was unwell in March this year,” 9news.com.au said quoting state health officials. "A human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) infection, also known as “bird flu”, has been reported in Victoria. There is no evidence of transmission in Victoria and the chance of additional human cases is very low as avian influenza does not easily spread between people," the Victorian Department of Health posted on X. "The recently reported case was in a child who returned to Australia from overseas in March 2024. The child experienced a severe infection but is no longer unwell and has made a full recovery," it said in another post without identifying the foreign country. The case was announced hours after bird flu was detected on a farm in Victoria, 9news.com.au said. “Contact tracing has not identified any further cases of avian influenza connected to this case,” the Victoria Health said in a statement and added, that the child reportedly experienced a severe infection but is no longer unwell. “The avian influenza virus was detected through further testing of positive influenza samples that take place to detect novel or concerning flu virus strains, as part of Victoria's enhanced surveillance system,” the news portal said quoting health officials. Victoria Health said the child was the first case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Australia, and the first detected case of the H5N1 strain in the country. A different strain of bird flu was detected on the Victorian egg farm after several poultry deaths. “While the human case detected today is the H5N1 strain, the strain on the farm was found to be a different H7N7 variety,” the report said. A report in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) said, “Contact tracing has not identified any further cases of avian influenza connected to this case. The department reassured the community that the chances of additional human cases are ‘very low’.” Humans are not at risk from this virus unless they had contact with infected birds or animals or their secretions. “Rarely, avian influenza infection in humans can pass to another person with prolonged contact. However, there is no evidence that the H5N1 strains of avian influenza circulating globally can spread easily from human to human,” the officials added. Elaborating on the strain on the farm, the H7N7 variety, the ABC report said, hundreds of thousands of chickens at the egg farm in Victoria were being euthanased after the disease was detected there. The property near Meredith, in the state's west, is in quarantine, the Department of Health said and added the Victorian child has no links to the egg farm outbreak. Bird flu in poultry was last detected in Australia in 2020.

What's next? The Department of Health says there is no evidence of transmission in the state. Australia has recorded its first ever human case of highly pathogenic bird flu, after H5N1 avian influenza was detected in a child travelling home to Victoria. The Victorian Department of Health confirmed the child returning to the country became unwell in March and subsequently tested positive to the avian influenza, also known as bird flu. "The child experienced a severe infection but is no longer unwell and has made a full recovery," the spokesperson said. "Contact tracing has not identified any further cases of avian influenza connected to this case."The department reassured the community that the chances of additional human cases was "very low"."Avian influenza does not easily spread between people," the spokesperson said. Case not linked to egg farm outbreakAvian influenza is an infectious viral disease of birds that is not commonly detected in humans. There are many strains of avian influenza and the Department of Health said "most of them don't infect humans". "Some subtypes, including H5N1, are more likely to cause disease and death in poultry," a spokesperson said. Australia's Department of Health said while this is the first case of the H5N1 strain, there have been previously reported human infections of other strains. "In March 2010, an outbreak of low pathogenicity avian influenza a (H10N7) occurred on a chicken farm in Australia," a spokesperson said."After processing clinically normal birds from the farm, 7 abattoir workers reported conjunctivitis and minor upper respiratory tract symptoms."Influenza virus A subtype H10 infection was detected in two workers. There is a current out break of the H5N1 strain in other parts of the world including in dairy cows in the United States of America.One dairy worker in America recently tested positive to the virus. Millions of wild birds have died in the avian influenza H5N1 outbreak sweeping the world since 2020. (REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun)It comes as hundreds of thousands of chickens at an egg farm in Victoria were being euthanased after the disease was detected there. The property near Meredith, in the state's west, is in quarantine.The Department of Health said the Victorian child has no links to the egg farm outbreak.

This report describes the final influenza vaccine uptake for the school-aged programme targeted at all school children aged 4 to 16 years old (Reception to Year 11) in England during 2023 to 2024. All data in this report represents data returned from 100% (154 of 154) of local authorities (LAs) in England on cumulative influenza vaccinations administered from 1 September 2023 to 31 January 2024. Comparison data is given to last season (2022 to 2023). Because of differences in the programme between seasons (see background information and appendix), throughout this report, comparison data to last season (2022 to 2023) is for Reception to Year 9 aged children, unless otherwise stated. Last season, Years 10 and 11 were vaccinated subject to vaccine availability, and at a national level very little activity took place in these years groups. Main points This season: 52.2% (3,498,576 out of 6,708,016 ) of school-aged children who were eligible in both seasons (Reception to Year 9 combined) were vaccinated, compared with 51.9% (3,502,566 out of 6,747,523) in the 2022 to 2023 season 55.1% (2,554,536 out of 4,631,343) of primary school children (Reception to Year 6) combined were vaccinated, compared with 56.3% (2,647,295 out of 4,705,474) during the 2022 to 2023 season 45.6% (946,040 out of 2,076,673) of secondary school children (Year 7 to Year 9) combined were vaccinated, compared with 41.9% (855,271 out of 2,042,049) during the 2022 to 2023 season (Year 7 to Year 9) 42.9% (1,472,280 out of 3,432,207) of secondary school children (Year 7 to Year 11) combined were vaccinated, compared with 26.7% (867,651 out of 3,254,203) (Year 7 to Year 11) 49.9% (4,022,141 out of 8,063,277) of all school-aged children in Reception to Year 11 combined were vaccinated, compared with 44.2% (3,514,946 out of 7,959,677) (Reception to Year 11) Cumulative influenza vaccine uptake by academic year for the national programme in England this season, as presented in table 3 of the supplementary data, was: 55.9% (342,744 out of 612,943) of children in Reception (aged 4 rising to 5 years) compared with 56.7% during the 2022 to 2023 season 56.4% (359,476 out of 637,143) of children in school Year 1 (aged 5 rising to 6 years) compared with 56.4% during the 2022 to 2023 season 55.6% (365,212 out of 656,633) of children in school Year 2 (aged 6 rising to 7 years) compared with 57.5% during the 2022 to 2023 season 55.8% (375,706 out of 673,407) of children in school Year 3 (aged 7 rising to 8 years) compared with 57.3% during the 2022 to 2023 season 55.1% (372,891 out of 676,420) of children in school Year 4 (aged 8 rising to 9 years) compared with 56.2% during the 2022 to 2023 season 54.1% (367,822 out of 679,847) of children in school Year 5 (aged 9 rising to 10 years) compared with 55.6% during the 2022 to 2023 season 53.3% (370,401 out of 695,083) of children in school Year 6 (aged 10 rising to 11 years) compared with 54.2% during the 2022 to 2023 season 49.2% (341,077 out of 692,900) of children in school Year 7 (aged 11 rising to 12 years) compared with 45.2% during the 2022 to 2023 season 45.1% (313,576 out of 694,772) of children in school Year 8 (aged 12 rising to 13 years) compared with 40.7% during the 2022 to 2023 season 42.5% (293,077 out of 688,904) of children in school Year 9 (aged 13 rising to 14 years) compared with 39.6% during the 2022 to 2023 season 41.6% (282,801 out of 679,095) of children in school Year 10 (aged 14 rising to 15 years) compared with 1% during the 2022 to 2023 season. Note that in 2022 to 2023, Years 10 and 11 were vaccinated subject to vaccine availability and at national level very little activity took place in these years groups 35.7% (241,749 out of 676,536) of children in school Year 11 (aged 15 rising to 16 years) compared with 1% during the 2022 to 2023 season. Note that in 2022 to 2023 Years 10 and 11, were vaccinated subject to vaccine availability and at national level very little activity took place in these years groups The national ambition for the 2023 to 2024 flu season was to demonstrate a 100% offer and to achieve at least the uptake levels of 2022 to 2023. Of 154 local authorities (LAs) in England, 81 (52.9%) had an uptake equal or above that of the 2022 to 2023 season. This season (2023 to 2024) influenza vaccine uptake across primary school-aged children (Reception to Year 6) was 1.2 percentage points lower than it was in the 2022 to 2023 season (as described earlier in the section). Comparability between seasons for secondary school-aged vaccine uptake is limited. However, this season has seen the greatest number of secondary school-aged children vaccinated in a season (1,469,605 children, see supplementary Table 6a). For the first time since the school-aged programme was introduced, influenza vaccine uptake in excess of 90% was achieved in a school year group at an LA level (this was seen in 3 year groups: Reception, Year 2 and Year 7). Results of influenza vaccine uptake in school-aged children Full data tables and graphs showing final influenza vaccine uptake for children in school years Reception to Year 11 at NHS region and local authority level are described and shown throughout this section. Data for this season and prior seasons is also available at vaccine uptake guidance and the latest coverage data. Response rates All data in this final end of season report represents data returned from 100% (154 of 154) of local authorities (LAs) in England on cumulative influenza vaccinations administered from 1 September 2023 to 31 January 2024. Data from last season’s annual report (2022 to 2023) also represented a 100% return (153 of 153 LAs). Throughout the 2023 to 2024 season, provisional uptake data was published on GOV.UK on a cumulative monthly basis. The final end of season response rate for this annual report (100%) was higher than that observed in the provisional monthly surveys (Table 7a and Table 7b). This includes the last monthly survey (data up to 31 January 2024, published February 2024) which had a response rate of 88.3%. In that survey, a total of 50.0% of all school-aged children (Reception to Year 11), 55.2% of primary school-aged children (Reception to Year 6) and 43.0% of secondary school-aged children (Year 7 to Year 11) received the influenza vaccine in England. Caution should be used when interpreting provisional monthly data as the vaccine uptake percentages are based on denominators of those LAs returning data that month. Differences in response rates account for the slight decrease in vaccine uptake seen between the provisional monthly January 2024 survey and the end of season data presented in this report. National uptake This season (2023 to 2024) an estimated 4,022,141 children from school years Reception to Year 11 in England were vaccinated with an influenza vaccine between 1 September 2023 to 31 January 2024. Cumulative influenza vaccine uptake based on combined data for the target populations (Reception to Year 11) was 49.9% (4,022,141 out of 8,063,277) and the median uptake is given in Table 1. Last season (2022 to 2023) an estimated 3,514,946 children from school years Reception to Year 11 in England were vaccinated with an influenza vaccine between 1 September 2022 to 28 February 2023. This season (2023 to 2024), 507,195 more children were vaccinated than in the 2022 to 2023 season. Table 1.

This was when compared to the corresponding groups in the previous 2022 to 2023 season (56.3%, at 2,647,295 out of 4,705,474) (Table 2a and Table 2b). For secondary school-aged children (Year 7 to Year 9) influenza vaccine uptake increased by 3.7 percentage points to 45.6% (946,040 out of 2,076,673) in the 2023 to 2024 season (Table 4). This was when compared to the corresponding groups in the previous 2022 to 2023 season (41.9%, (855,271 out of 2,042,049) (Table 3a and Table 3b). For secondary school-aged children (Year 7 to Year 11) influenza vaccine uptake increased by 16.1 percentage points to 42.8% (1,469,605 out of 3,431,934) in the 2023 to 2024 season (Table 4). This was when compared to the corresponding groups in the previous 2022 to 2023 season (26.7%, at 867,651 out of 3,254,203) (Table 3a and Table 3b). Note that in 2022 to 2023, Years 10 and 11 were vaccinated subject to vaccine availability and at national level very little activity took place in these years groups. The total percentage of school-aged children vaccinated in 2023 to 2024 was 49.9% (Reception to Year 11). This is compared with 51.9% in 2022 to 2023 (Reception to Year 9). For school-aged children who were eligible in both seasons (Reception to Year 9), influenza vaccine uptake was comparable between seasons (a 0.3 percentage point difference) (Table 4). This was 52.2% (3,498,576 out of 6,708,016) in the 2023 to 2024 season, compared with 51.9% (3,502,566 out of 6,747,523) in the 2022 to 2023 season. Table 4.

For this season (2023 to 2024), in primary school year groups, the difference between influenza vaccine uptake between 2 consecutive year groups was 1 percentage point or lower. For secondary school year groups, the difference in uptake between 2 consecutive year groups was greater and ranged between less than 1 percentage point (0.9% between Years 9 and 10) to 5.8 percentage points between Years 10 and 11 (Table 2a and Table 2b, Table 4, and Tables 5a and 5b). Ambitions In the 2023 to 2024 season, out of 154 local authorities (LAs) in England, 81 (52.9%) had an uptake equal or above that of the 2022 to 2023 season. Therefore, a higher number of LAs achieved the national ambition this season (2023 to 2024) than the previous season (2022 to 2023), when 33.3% (51 out of 153 LAs) achieved uptake equal or above the season before that (2021 to 2022). For the 2023 to 2024 season, in primary school-aged children, 40.2% (62 out of 154) of LAs had an uptake equal or above that of the 2022 to 2023 season. In secondary school-aged children, 69.3% (106 out of 154) LAs had an uptake equal or above that of the 2022 to 2023 season. Trends in uptake over seasons Comparability between seasons for school-aged influenza vaccine uptake is limited due to differences in cohort eligibility and planning and implementation challenges (see background information and appendix). The cumulative influenza vaccine uptake for all eligible year groups each season since the schools’ programme was rolled out nationally are shown in Tables 5a and 5b. The highest national uptake on record in England for school-aged children was during the 2020 to 2021 season (Reception to Year 7 were eligible that season). For most year groups (Year 1 to Year 7), the highest uptake was seen in the 2020 to 2021 season (the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic). For reception-aged children, the highest uptake was seen before the COVID-19 pandemic (2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020) with uptake of 64.3% in both seasons. The highest uptake in a year group was seen in 2020 to 2021 in Year 1 (64.5%). For the ninth consecutive season, the general trend was one of decreasing uptake with increasing age of school-aged children (Tables 5a and table 5b). Table 5a.

Note 2: figures not reported here (subject to vaccine availability, any remaining vaccine offered to years 10 and 11 once an offer had been made to younger children and at-risk groups). Note 3: this figure shows the season with the highest uptake on record for that year group. Note 4: shows total for years 7 to years 9 only. Note 5: includes total for all secondary school-aged children, years 7 to years 11. Note 6: shows total for year 7 only. All primary school-aged children have been eligible for the national influenza vaccination programme since the 2019 to 2020 season (the last season prior to the COVID-19 pandemic). Across those 5 seasons, the 2023 to 2024 season has the lowest uptake (55.1%, 2,552,536 out of 4,631,343). Compared with the last pre-pandemic season (2019 to 2020), this season is 5.3 percentage points below that (60.4%, 2,876,531 out of 4,764,192). Compared with the season with the highest primary school uptake on record (2020 to 2021 season, the first year of the pandemic), this season is 7.4 percentage points below that (62.5%, 2,962,494 out of 4,740,044). See supplementary Table 6a for the number of children vaccinated each season since the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) programme was introduced in the 2013 to 2014 season; and supplementary Table 6b for a summary of the total number of children vaccinated in each delivery setting. Progress throughout the 2023 to 2024 season The national level influenza vaccine uptake data in primary school-aged children during the 2023 to 2024 season showed an increase during the first 2 months of vaccination (October and November) which then plateaued during December and January. Please see supplementary Table 7a on influenza vaccine uptake (%) in each survey month in primary school-aged children. For primary school-aged children when compared with the same timepoint in previous seasons, the 2023 to 2024 season saw the highest influenza uptake recorded by 31 October (supplementary Table 7a. After the robust start to the vaccination campaign, momentum was lost as the campaign continued. By 30 November, influenza vaccine uptake was comparable (less than 1 percentage point difference) to the highest season on record (2020 to 2021) at that time point. By 31 December, influenza vaccine uptake was comparable to the lowest on record and showed the lowest amount of vaccination activity occurring in primary schools between 1 and 31 December (less than a 6 percentage point increase during this time). Vaccine uptake data up to 31 January was the lowest on record (supplementary Table 7a). This was comparable to the uptake seen last season (2022 to 2023, 55.9%) and in the first 2 years of the schools’ programme roll out (2015 to 2017). In 2015 to 2016, only 2 year groups in primary school were vaccinated. In 2016 to 2017, 3 year groups in primary school were vaccinated (Table 5a). In secondary school-aged children during the 2023 to 2024 season, influenza vaccine uptake increased during the first 3 months of vaccination (October, November and December) and plateaued in January. See supplementary Table 7b on influenza vaccine uptake (%) in each survey month in secondary school-aged children. Throughout the vaccination campaign, uptake in secondary school-aged children was lower than in primary school-aged children. In contrast to primary school activity during December, vaccination uptake in secondary school children saw almost a 12-percentage point increase during this time. Although the cumulative monthly influenza vaccine uptake data published during the 2023 to 2024 season demonstrated some variability in the prioritisation of school-aged cohorts early in the vaccination campaign, the national vaccination trends align with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advice to vaccinate the youngest age groups first (PDF, 484 KB). NHS region Variation in vaccine uptake was observed between the 7 NHS England Regions, ranging from 40.4% (London) to 57.5% (East of England). The East of England, South East, and South West were all above the national average uptake of 49.9% (Table 6). Table 6.

This is seen in Table 4 of the supplementary data. The following local authorities report collectively: City of London and Hackney Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Leicestershire and Rutland Therefore, the total local authority count in this section is 151 in contrast to the 154 referenced in the report. For all school-aged children (Reception to Year 11), 9 out of 151 LAs (6.0%) had uptake in the range of 0% to 29%. A further 28 (18.5%) had uptake in the range of 30% to 39%, with 46 (30.5%) in the range of 40% to 49%, 44 (29.1%) in the range of 50% to 59%, 23 (15.2%) in the range of 60% to 69%, and 1 (0.7%) in the range of 70% to 79%. None had uptake of over 80%. See Figure 3a. For primary school-aged children (Reception to Year 6), 4 out of 151 LAs (2.6%) had uptake in the range of 0% to 29%. A further 12 (7.9%) had uptake in the range of 30% to 39%, 34 (22.5%) were in the range of 40% to 49%, 51 (33.8%) were in the range of 50% to 59%, 41 (27.2%) were in the range of 60% to 69%, and 8 (5.3%) were in the range of 70% to 79%, with 1 (0.7%) achieving uptake of over 80%. See Figure 3b. For secondary school-aged children (Year 7 to Year 11), 37 out of 151 LAs (24.5%) had uptake in the range of 0% to 29%, while 38 (25.1%) had uptake in the range of 30% to 39%, 37 (24.5%) were in the range of 40% to 49%, 32 (21.2%) were in the range of 50% to 59%, 6 (4.0%) were in the range of 60% to 69%, and 1 (0.7%) was in the range of 70% to 79%.

This was seen once in 3 year groups: Reception, Year 2 and Year 7). Glossary At-risk At-risk patients with clinical risk groups as listed in the Green Book. Green Book The Green Book, or Immunisation against infectious disease has the latest information on vaccines and vaccination procedures, for vaccine preventable infectious diseases in the UK. Chapter 19 refers to influenza. ImmForm A website that provides a secure online platform for vaccine uptake data collection for several immunisation surveys, including the seasonal influenza vaccine uptake collection. School-age year The school-age year is determined by the child’s age on the 31 August. This will be correct for the majority of children. Data sources and methodology UKHSA provides screening and immunisation teams in England a standard protocol describing the inclusion criteria and method of collecting the data. Data providers must use a suitable data source to identify eligible school cohorts in the local area. These sources are decided upon locally, usually by the screening and immunisation team or the school-aged immunisation service (SAIS). Most children are offered a single dose of vaccine. Eligible children in clinical at-risk groups without prior vaccination history aged under 9 years are recommended 2 doses of vaccine and are counted as one vaccination in the numerator. More information about this can be found in chapter 19 of the Green Book. Cumulative data on seasonal influenza vaccine uptake was collected for all 153 local authorities between 1 September 2022 to 28 February 2023 using the ImmForm website managed by UKHSA. ImmForm provides a secure online platform for vaccine uptake data collection for nearly all the national immunisation programmes, including the seasonal influenza vaccine uptake collections. UKHSA co-ordinated and managed the data collection and produced monthly provisional data on vaccinations. This allowed the NHS and Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to track the progress of the programme during the 2023 to 2024 influenza season. This collection received approval as a mandatory collection from the Data Alliance Partnership Board (DAPB) under the reference ‘DAPB2195 Amd 50/2022 Childhood Influenza Vaccination Programme: Primary School Age Children’. End-of-season programme vaccine uptake was calculated based on the number of children in the target population reported as having received the influenza vaccine (either LAIV or inactivated influenza vaccine during the campaign period). Therefore, vaccine coverage reflects all children in school years Reception to Year 11 (aged 4 years rising to aged 16 years old, based on age on 31 August 2023) that received an influenza vaccine between 1 September 2022 and 31 January 2024. Data in this report covers all reported vaccinations given during the 2022 to 2023 season and is compared with data from the season before where this is available. Additional tables also compare uptake data from 2022 to 2023 season with all previous seasons where school-aged delivery has taken place. Target population In 2022 to 2023, primary school-aged children in Reception to Year 6 and secondary school-aged children focusing in Years 7 to 11 were included for the national school-aged childhood influenza vaccination programme. Any remaining vaccine was offered to Years 10 and 11, subject to vaccine availability. Vaccination of younger cohorts and at-risk children was prioritised first with vaccination of secondary school-aged children continuing into the new year. The target population is defined by school age cohorts born between 1 September 2007 and 31 August 2019, as defined by the child’s age on 31 August 2023 (Table 8). This season all children in Reception to Year 11 (aged 4 years rising to 16 years old) were offered the vaccine.

Children who reside in one locality attending schools in neighbouring localities would be captured by the schools in the neighbouring locality to avoid double counting. Data providers can use single or multiple sources as appropriate to identify their eligible population. For the 154 local authorities where the programme was delivered through a school model, the denominator was based on all the eligible children in schools (all state-funded primary schools, special schools, academies, faith schools, free schools, pupil referral units, and independent schools) in the local authority geography. The denominator was also based on those children who were educated out of school in the local authority geography. This was defined by child age on 31 August 2023 using routine data sources such as the local education authority school registers. Data was submitted by data providers and/or screening and immunisation coordinators at the local authority level. Data was submitted on the ImmForm reporting website via manual upload. For the Kernow local authority (which comprises Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly), most children were offered the vaccine through school delivery programmes, except for the Isles of Scilly, where the programme was delivered through GPs. The denominators for the Isles of Scilly were derived from GP systems that are based on the number of patients registered with a GP practice located within the local authority’s geographical boundary, as defined by a child’s age on 31 August 2023. Data was submitted on the ImmForm reporting website either via an automated extraction (XML bulk upload or a web service) or provided by GP IT software suppliers who extract data directly from GP computer systems as described in full in the GP flu vaccination annual report. Data was submitted at GP practice level and then aggregated at local authority level by GP postcode for reporting purposes. Data limitations The identification of the school-aged population may differ between localities depending on the data sources consulted. Depending on the characteristics of the local school-age population, it may be necessary that providers use multiple data sources to identify eligible school-aged cohorts. These include the school roll call and the local Child Health Information Services (CHIS) system. Where the denominators (total number of children for the influenza vaccine) were not amended, denominators from the school census survey from January 2023 were used. This survey was provided to data providers at the start of the data collection as not all will have a complete school roll call while consent forms are still being collected. Some of the school data providers will only be indicating those children that have returned information on their vaccination status in consent forms (those who have already received the vaccine at the GP). Although every effort is made to capture vaccinations delivered in other settings within this data collection, where data providers have indicated that they have included additional children that were vaccinated in other settings, it should be noted that the completeness of these figures may vary. It is important to note that not all data providers may be able to access information on children vaccinated through other settings such as GP practices. Most of the children vaccinated in GP practices are at-risk children that have been called in by their GP to receive the vaccination. Healthy children in school years Reception to Year 11 who are not in a clinical risk group should not ordinarily be offered vaccination by their GP practice unless commissioned to vaccinate these children. For these reasons, some caution is advised when making direct comparisons of vaccine coverage between localities and historic data as delivery models and timing of vaccine supply will affect any comparisons. Throughout the 2023 to 2024 season, provisional uptake data by school year cohort was published on UKHSA’s website on a cumulative monthly basis. Background information This is the ninth report evaluating uptake in the national childhood influenza school-aged vaccination programme across England. The appendix outlines the changes in the school-aged programme for each season since the schools’ programme was introduced. In summary, between 2014 to 2015 and the 2020 to 2021 seasons, the school-aged immunisation programme has seen a consistent expansion with the addition of one year group each season. In contrast both this season (2022 to 2023) and the previous season (2021 to 2022) have seen the addition of multiple additional year groups within one season. Implementation of the secondary school programme began in 2020 to 2021 season with an addition of 1 school year group (Year 7). In contrast to previous seasons, the 3 subsequent seasons (2021 to 2022, 2022 to 2023 and 2023 to 2024) have seen the addition of multiple secondary school-aged year groups within one season. An additional challenge to all of these seasons was that the announcements of the expansion into secondary schools were made later in the programme planning cycle than usual (in July 2021, July 2022 and July 2023, respectively), just weeks prior to schools closing for the summer term. This meant that the time to plan the secondary school age programme was reduced. See the appendix for links to the annual flu letters with more details for each season. Further challenges to note were in the 2021 to 2022 season, (the second year that implementation of the secondary school programme took place), the influenza immunisation programme was also affected by pupil and immunisation staff absences as a result of COVID-19. Last season (2022 to 2023) saw a change in policy for secondary school age children between April and July 2022, and therefore the time to implement the secondary school-aged programme was extended into the new year. For the first time, the annual report for last season (2022 to 2023) described influenza vaccine uptake for children of school age up to 28 February (rather than 31 January). Comparability between seasons for secondary school-aged vaccine uptake is therefore limited. It is important to continue to monitor uptake in all current groups and build on the uptake in future seasons. It is important to improve the uptake in the school-aged national influenza vaccination programme to provide both direct protection for those immunised and indirect protection to the wider population by reducing transmission. Intended audience This report is aimed at professionals directly involved in the delivery of the influenza vaccine to children such as GPs, pharmacy leads, screening and immunisation teams, local commissioners involved in the planning and financing of local health services, the wider public health community, governmental organisations and researchers with an interest in the influenza vaccination programme in England. Aim of the report This report provides an evaluation of the national childhood influenza vaccination programme in school-aged children (from school years Reception to Year 9) at national and sub-national levels. Childhood influenza programme roll-out timeline Following the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) (PDF, 91 KB) in 2012 and accompanying statement (PDF, 111 KB), the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) (formerly the Department of Health) in partnership with UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA, formerly Public Health England) and the National Health Service (NHS) England began the phased roll-out of the national influenza vaccination programme to ultimately cover all those aged 2 to 16 years (inclusive) in the UK. This programme uses the licensed live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), with the aim of providing direct protection for those immunised, as well as indirectly protecting the remaining population by reducing transmission. Children in clinical risk groups who are contraindicated for LAIV would most likely be offered the injectable vaccine through their GP.

Appendix Childhood influenza vaccination programme roll-out timeline 2013 to 2014 The children’s programme began in the 2013 to 2014 season with all 2- and 3-year-olds being offered vaccination with LAIV through general practice and a school pilot programme was rolled out in geographically distinct areas in England, targeting all primary school-age children (aged 4 to 10 years, rising to 11 years old). 2014 to 2015 In the 2014 to 2015 season, the national programme was extended to 4-year olds through general practice in England. In addition, the school pilot programme was extended to a total of 14 pilot areas (including 6 pilots that participated in 2013 to 2014 season), targeting both primary school-age children (aged 4 to 10 years, rising to 11 years old) and secondary school- age children (12 years rising to 13 years old). 2015 to 2016 In the 2015 to 2016 season, the national programme was extended to include children of appropriate age in school years 1 and 2. For most children, this was offered via a school-based programme, although in a few areas of England vaccinations were delivered through alternative schemes such as community pharmacies and general practices. The 2014 to 2015 pilot areas continued to offer vaccination to all primary school-age children (aged 5 to 10 years, rising to 11 years old) in 2015 to 2016. 2016 to 2017 In the 2016 to 2017 season, the national programme was extended to include children in school year 3, offering LAIV vaccination to all children in school years 1, 2 and 3. Most children were offered the influenza vaccine via a school-based programme. However, in a few areas vaccinations were delivered through alternative schemes such as community pharmacies and general practice. Children aged 2, 3 and 4 years (but not 5 years or older) continued to be vaccinated by GPs. Vaccination continued to be offered to primary school-aged children (aged 5 to 10 years, rising to 11 years old) in the areas that had participated previously as pilot areas in England. 2017 to 2018 In the 2017 to 2018 season, the national programme was extended to include children in Reception (aged 4 years, rising to 5 years old) to children in Year 4 (aged 8 years rising to 9 years old) and all children of primary school age (aged 4 to 10 years, rising to 11 years old) in areas that participated previously as pilot areas. The mode of vaccination remained primarily through school delivery models with children aged 2 and 3 years offered the vaccine in GP practices, the only exception being the Isles of Scilly who delivered the vaccines through GP practices. 2018 to 2019 In the 2018 to 2019 season, the national programme was extended to include children in Year 5 (aged 9 years rising to 10 years old). For most children, the LAIV vaccine was offered via school-based programmes (with additional mop-up clinics where required), with the Isles of Scilly operating via a GP model. Children aged 2 and 3 years (but not 4 years or older on 31 August 2018) were still offered the vaccine through general practices. Vaccination continued to be offered to primary school-aged children in reception to Year 6 (aged 4 to 10 years rising to 11 years old) in those areas that previously participated in primary school pilots in England. 2019 to 2020 During the 2019 to 2020 season, the national programme was extended to include children of Year 6 (aged 10 years rising to 11 years old) and thus included all children of primary school age for the first time and no additional age cohorts were added to the previous pilot areas. It is important to note that there were supply issues for the LAIV vaccine in this season that may have affected the programme (more information about this can be found in the 2020 to 2021 edition of this release). The mode of vaccination remained primarily through school delivery, with eligible children in the Isles of Scilly (and all children aged 2 and 3 years) offered the vaccine in GP practices. 2020 to 2021 During the 2020 to 2021 season, the national programme was extended to include children of Year 7 (aged 11 years rising to 12 years old), with no pilot areas. The mode of vaccination remained primarily through school delivery, with eligible children in the Isles of Scilly and all children aged 2 and 3 years offered the vaccine in GP practices. Please note that the programme will have been affected by the second and third national COVID-19 restrictions (‘lockdowns’) in England that began on the 31 October 2020 and 6 January 2021. The third lockdown included school closures except for vulnerable children and children of key workers. 2021 to 2022 During the 2021 to 2022 season, the national programme was extended as a temporary measure to include children of Year 8 (aged 12 rising to 13 years), Year 9 (aged 13 rising to 14 years), Year 10 (aged 14 rising to 15 years) and Year 11 (aged 15 rising to 16 years) with no pilot areas. This was the first season where all children aged 2 through to 16 years old had been offered the vaccine. This was an expansion of 4 additional year groups (whereas previous seasons have seen an expansion of one additional year group) and was announced later in the programme planning cycle than usual (July 2021). The mode of vaccination remained primarily through school delivery, with eligible children in the Isles of Scilly (and all children aged 2 and 3 years) offered the vaccine in GP practices. Note that the programme will have been affected by the COVID-19 related pupil and immunisation staff absences. 2022 to 2023 For the 2022 to 2023 season, between April 2022 and July 2022 there was a change in policy for school-aged children, with an expansion from the original policy of primary school-aged children (Reception to Year 6), to also include secondary school-aged children focusing on Years 7, 8 and 9, with any remaining vaccine offered to Years 10 and 11, subject to vaccine availability. More details about this can be found in the National flu immunisation programme plan 2022 to 2023 and Statement of amendments to annual flu letter 2022 to 2023. Vaccination of younger cohorts and at-risk children was therefore prioritised first with vaccination of secondary school-aged children continuing into the new year. Therefore, for the first-time data for the 2022 to 2023 season included data submitted up until 28 February. During the 2022 to 2023 season, the national programme included all primary school-aged children and secondary school-aged children in Year 7 to Year 9 (aged 13 years rising to 14 years), with no pilot areas. The mode of vaccination remained primarily through school delivery, with eligible children in the Isles of Scilly and all children aged 2 and 3 years offered the vaccine in GP practices. 2023 to 2024 For the 2023 to 2024 season, the national programme included all primary school-aged children and secondary school-aged children in Year 7 to Year 11 (aged 15 years rising to 16 years), with no pilot areas. The inclusion of primary school-aged children (Reception to Year 6) in the national programme was announced in May 2023, with confirmation of the inclusion of secondary school-aged children (Year 7 to Year 11) announced in July 2023. The mode of vaccination remained primarily through school delivery, with eligible children in the Isles of Scilly (and all children aged 2 and 3 years) offered the vaccine in GP practices.

Herald Illustration / Guy BodyThe latest ESR data showed hospitalisations with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in Auckland crossed the seasonal baseline in late March, when 54 cases were reported within a week. Herald Illustration / Guy BodyCould it be time to bring in rules around mask use?We’re not officially into winter yet, but as the days get darker and the nights get colder – many of us are already starting to come down with bugs and viruses.The question comes as New Zealand looks on the cusp of another Covid-19 wave similar in size to our last two.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.University of Otago epidemiologist Michael Baker told The Front Page he was part of a team of 13 researchers who conducted what is probably the most extensive review of masks worldwide.“If you’re sick and you’re wearing a mask, that greatly reduces the number of particles you put out into the air. And similarly, if the other people around you are wearing masks, they get a lot of protection.“The masks you have to wear are these respirator-style masks that have a good fit. The N95 type masks fit around your nose and mouth and don’t have gaps in the sides, whereas the blue medical surgical masks don’t do that.”Baker said there is an argument for introducing policies around mask use - especially around vulnerable people.“Waiting rooms and hospitals and doctors surgeries and also if you’re visiting aged care facilities and so on. You do need to be protecting the people there and I think that’s a setting where masks are important. And I think we need more consistency with this.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“Because we’re seeing people getting Covid-19 in hospitals and unfortunately sometimes dying from those infections and that shouldn’t happen.”We live in a world that has a vast number of mandates, Baker said, so introducing a policy around mask use should be a natural progression.“Think about how we make it safe to travel on the roads, how we make it safe to travel on aircraft, and so on. They’re based on huge quantities of mandates, which is just another word for rules. And so I think the seat belt metaphor is quite valid for masks on public transport. It’s a way of making it safe for you and in the case of masks, also for the other people on the bus,” he said.Led by University of Oxford’s Professor Trisha Greenhalgh, the research into mask use was published in the journal Clinical Microbiology Reviews and shows masking in settings like workplaces, transport, and other public settings can help people avoid catching infections and passing them on. Their use can also reduce Covid-19 reinfections that are driving the rise in Long Covid.“We now have a clear pathway to action, including reducing the number of respiratory infections in winter 2024. Masks can also provide effective protection in a public health emergency, for example, if avian influenza (bird flu) starts to spread between humans,” Associate Professor Amanda Kvalsvig wrote.And the threat of bird flu is closer than we might think.Avian influenza has been detected on an egg farm in the Australian state of Victoria. While this strain is not the highly pathogenic H5N1, the country reported its first human case this week in a child who authorities said had been infected in India but made a full recovery.“I’m very worried about what’s happening with bird flu,” Baker said.“One thing to remember is even the 1918 flu only had what we call a ‘case fatality risk’ of 2 per cent of the people who got it died from it and that was still a catastrophe. At the moment avian influenza has a case fatality of 50 per cent of the people who are getting this infection.“That’s based on 800 or 900 cases that have happened over the last 20 years. We wouldn’t expect that level of mortality risk to carry on if it did start to spread between humans. That would be less, but it could be well above 2 per cent - and that would be something that would be just utterly devastating.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“I don’t think any country would tolerate that virus spreading, we would do everything we could to stop it,” he said.Listen to the full episode to hear advice for making it through this cold and flu season.The Front Page is a daily news podcast from the New Zealand Herald, available to listen to every weekday from 5am.

Health officials confirm the rare avian influenza case, emphasizing the potential risks and symptoms. Australia faces its first H5N1 case amidst global outbreaks in birds. A child has been confirmed as the first human case of H5N1 virus in Australia. As per reports, the child had returned from India in March, and is believed that he contracted the flu virus there. "This is the first human case of H5N1 avian influenza in Australia. The case occurred in a child, who acquired the infection in India and was unwell in March 2024. The avian influenza virus was detected through further testing of positive influenza samples that takes place to detect novel or concerning flu virus strains, as part of Victoriaâs enhanced surveillance system. Contact tracing has not identified any further cases of avian influenza connected to this case," Victoria Health Department has said in an official statement. "There is a current global outbreak of avian influenza in birds and animals. Avian influenza does not usually infect people, but in rare cases human infection can occur. The recently reported case in Victoria was in a child who returned to Australia from overseas in March 2024. The child experienced a severe infection but is no longer unwell and has made a full recovery," it has also said.How hormones impact ovarian cancer growthAustralia is the only continent where animals have so far stayed free of the H5N1 avian influenza virus, but authorities on Wednesday said a different strain of highly pathogenic bird flu had been detected at an egg farm near Melbourne. "Transmission to humans is very rare, with a small number of human cases of H5N1 reported globally, resulting in death in a number of cases. This is the first confirmed human case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Australia, and the first time the H5N1 strain has been detected in a person or animal in Australia," the Health Department has said.What is the H5N1 virus?The H5N1 virus, also known as avian influenza or bird flu, is a highly pathogenic strain of the influenza virus that primarily infects birds. First identified in humans in 1997, it can occasionally transmit to humans through direct contact with infected birds or contaminated environments. H5N1 is concerning due to its high mortality rate in humans and its potential to cause severe respiratory illness. While human-to-human transmission is rare, there is fear that the virus could mutate to enable easier spread among people, posing a significant pandemic threat. Preventive measures include monitoring and controlling outbreaks in poultry populations.Symptoms one must pay attention toThe symptoms of H5N1 virus infection in humans can range from mild to severe and often resemble those of other types of influenza. Early symptoms typically appear within 2-8 days of exposure and include high fever (over 100.4Â°F or 38Â°C), cough, sore throat, and muscle aches. As the illness progresses, severe respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, and pneumonia can develop. Gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting are also common.In severe cases, the infection can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, and septic shock. Neurological symptoms, including altered mental status and seizures, have been reported in some instances. The high mortality rate associated with H5N1 makes early detection and treatment critical.About the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

(Reuters: Ronen Zvulun)abc.net.auews/bird-flu-detections-in-australia-what-do-we-know/103881608Link copiedShareShare articleTwo different strains of avian influenza — also known as "bird flu" — have been detected in Victoria.Australia's first-human infection of HPAI manifested in a child returning from an overseas trip in March, but was only confirmed over the weekend.Meanwhile, a recent outbreak at an egg farm led to hundreds of thousands of chickens being euthanased.The two events are not related and stem from two different variants of bird flu. The virus picked up by the child is the H5N1 variant that has swept the world since 2020, killing millions of wild birds.Health officials say the risk of additional human cases in Australia is "very low", but recommend Australians take precautions against its spread.Here's what to know about bird flu, how it's transmitted to humans, and whether it's still safe to eat poultry and eggs.What is bird flu?Avian influenza is an infectious disease that spreads widely among wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, as well as domestic ones such as poultry.There are many strains of avian influenza and Victoria's Department of Health says "most of them don't infect humans"."Some subtypes, including H5N1, are more likely to cause disease and death in poultry," it said.There is a current outbreak of H5N1 in other parts of the world, including in dairy cows in the United States.What is the risk of transmission to humans?The transmission of avian influenza from birds or animals to humans is "very rare," Victoria's Department of Health said in a statement."Most people are not at risk, unless they have contact with infected birds or animals, or their secretions, while in affected areas of the world," it said."Rarely, avian influenza infection in humans can pass to another person with prolonged contact."Clare Looker, Victoria's chief health officer (CHO), said the avian influenza was "much less transmissible" than the seasonal flu and she was confident no one else had caught the virus in the state."We think there's a very, very low risk that there has been any other transmission," she told ABC Radio Melbourne.Movement restrictions are in place in a bid to control an outbreak of bird flu. (ABC News: Rochelle Kirkham)The Department of Health said the child who caught H5N1 has no links to the H7N3 strain identified at the egg farm on Wednesday.The H7N3 strain is the most common type of avian influenza detected in Australia, Victoria's chief veterinary officer, Graeme Cooke, said.At the Victorian farm, Dr Cooke said the virus was spreading "very quickly" and was causing "increasing levels of death" among birds.He said it was important to control these outbreaks because of the "small risk" of transmission from birds to humans."The more avian flu is circulating, the more that risk might actually become something of more relevance to our public health system."A Texas farm worker tested positive for the virus earlier this year as it spread through a US cattle herd.What are the symptoms of bird flu?In humans, the symptoms of H5N1 infection may include fever, coughing, headaches, aching muscles and respiratory symptoms, the Department of Health said."Other early symptoms may include conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal symptoms," it said."The infection may progress quickly to severe respiratory illness and neurological changes."The department said the Victorian child experienced "a severe infection" but was no longer unwell and had made a "full recovery".Is it still safe to eat poultry and eggs?"You can't catch avian influenza through eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas with an outbreak of avian influenza," Victoria's Department of Health said. Veterinarian Dr Cooke also said it was safe for Australians to keep eating eggs and chicken."There is no risk to humans in terms of public health if products are properly cooked, and that's always been the advice for any form of egg products and poultry products," he said.Health officials advise to only eat properly cooked poultry and eggs. (ABC News: Sophie Johnson)While Dr Cooke said he was not worried about this type of strain being passed to other animals, he urged poultry farmers to do their part to prevent further infections."This is something that's carried by wild birds without symptoms, traditionally ducks and other types of waterfowl, and then their faecal material is allowed to make contact with domestic poultry, which are very, very susceptible to [infection]," he said."That's why we emphasise that poultry farmers should really have high levels of biosecurity, trying their best to separate wild fowl and ducks from domestic poultry."Rowan McMonnies, the chief executive of industry body Australian Eggs, said only a small part of the industry has been affected, adding that farmers would be "working hard to ensure there are eggs on shelves".The Australian Chicken Meat Federation (ACMF) said its companies had also stepped up biosafety measures as a precaution, but that "no discernible impact is expected on chicken meat supplies at the retail level".Bird flu was last detected in Australia in 2020, when it was found on an egg farm south of Ballarat.This resulted in multiple outbreaks in Victoria and led to tens of thousands of farmed birds being euthanased.How did the H5N1 strain come to Australia?Dr Looker said the child in Victoria had caught a type of H5N1 that has been circulating in India and Bangladesh."There's a handful of cases, a very small number, fewer than five, where there have been human cases of this strain internationally."Bird flu detected in childPhoto shows Melbourne AirportA Victorian child has tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza after returning to the country from overseas earlier this year. The Department of Health says transmission to humans is rare.She said the H5N1 virus in Victoria, whilst sharing the same name, was different to the type of H5N1 spreading through the United States and affecting dairy cows."My understanding is it's not at the same level of concern as the United States variety."Dr Looker said her team was unsure where the child picked up the virus, but noted when humans did contract H5N1 like this, it was likely from exposure to poultry."So either visiting poultry farms or live wet markets, which have birds at them, or if they've had a lot of contact with domesticated birds," she said."Occasionally, people can also get it from handling the meat or eggs of infected birds."We couldn't identify a clear event that led to this child's infection, but we suspect it's one of those things."Australia is the only continent where animals have so far stayed free of the H5N1 virus.Dr Looker said there were a number of surveillance mechanisms in place across the country in both human specimens and animal flocks to ensure this virus continued to be detected.So, what precautions are recommended?The Victorian Department of Health recommends on its website that Australians take the following precautions against the H5N1 bird flu:People travelling to areas affected by avian influenza should:avoid poultry farms and live bird "wet" marketsavoid contact with wild or domesticated birdswash their hands thoroughly after handling birds and uncooked poultry products such as meat or eggsensure that poultry or poultry products are cooked thoroughly before eatingImmunisation against seasonal influenza is recommended for everyone aged ≥6 months and over. Speak to your immunisation provider to see if you are eligible for a free flu vaccine. Otherwise, you can purchase the flu vaccine from your immunisation provider. In Victoria the most common way people access the flu vaccine is from their doctor (GP) or a pharmacist immuniser (a service fee may apply). Some local council immunisation services also provide the flu vaccine as do some hospitals, maternity services and community health services.As a reminder, poultry workers, people who handle poultry, and people involved in culling during an outbreak of avian influenza are recommended to receive annual seasonal influenza vaccine.If you have returned from a country affected by avian influenza and feel unwell, it is important to seek medical advice. Although the risk of becoming infected with avian influenza is very low, it is important when making an appointment with your healthcare provider to tell them about any possible exposures to avian influenza.Posted Wed 22 May 2024 at 11:24pmWednesday 22 May 2024 at 11:24pmWed 22 May 2024 at 11:24pm, updated Fri 24 May 2024 at 8:46amFriday 24 May 2024 at 8:46amFri 24 May 2024 at 8:46amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

Authorities will continue to work with the WA farm to manage the situation.A mixed poultry farm in Western Australia's South West has been placed under a pest control notice after a low pathogenic strain of avian influenza was detected. The farm reported chickens had become unwell three weeks ago, leading to the case being investigated by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD).Avian influenza can be high or low pathogenic.The case detected in WA has been confirmed as the low pathogenic H9N2 type. In Victoria, authorities say there is no evidence of transmission after a child tested positive to the H5N1 strain in March, which can jump across species.Hundreds of thousands of birds have also been euthanased after the H7N3 strain of the virus was found on a farm in Victoria's west.The chicken and egg industries are closely watching avian influenza across the world. (Supplied: Woodland Valley Farm)Wild bird interaction riskWild birds can carry the high and low strains of avian influenza. DPIRD acting chief vet Katie Webb said some chickens at the mixed poultry farm in WA had been euthanased as a result of the H9N2 outbreak. "We do surveillance for influenza in wild birds regularly. We do know H9 low pathogenic strains occur in wild birds," Dr Webb said. "Occasionally we do find it has transmitted from wild birds into poultry. This is one example where we have picked that up."Dr Webb said the remaining birds at the farm were healthy, but DPIRD would continue its inspections and testing, and the property would remain under a pest control notice, which managed the movement of animals and products off the farm. She said DPIRD was working with the farmer to reduce the likelihood of disease spread and future transmissions from wild birds. "The appropriate response depends upon the strain that has been identified," Dr Webb said."In the particular case in the South West, it was one of low pathogenicity and less concerning strains from a poultry disease point of view, and that impacts the way we approach managing it with the property."Backyard poultry holders have been encouraged to consider how to reduce potential interactions with wild birds. (ABC Rural: Jo Prendergast)Consider biosecurityMs Webb said the case was a timely reminder to the poultry industry and backyard chicken owners to be vigilant about the risk of bird flu transmission from wild birds. "Understand the importance of really good biosecurity practices to help protect from that potential pathway of disease introduction" she said. "In a backyard setting, that's things like restricting contact with wild birds as much as possible, keeping poultry sheds and yards clean to minimise the attractiveness to wild birds, placing feeders in sheds, and quarantining new birds before introducing them to a flock." Unusual signs of disease or mass mortalities in domesticated birds, wild birds, or other wildlife should be reported to the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline on 1800 675 888.

This is a strain that's occurred in Australia before. It's likely not new."H7N7 was the most common strain of bird flu in Australia, Cooke said.One of the strains in the last bird flu outbreak in Australia in 2020, which affected one-in-three egg farms in Victoria, was a H7 strain and testing is underway to determine if it's the same one.The property has been placed into quarantine with a 5km radius set up and affected animals will be "depopulated".A new strain of H5N1, clade 2.3.4.4b, emerged in 2020 and has been causing record numbers of deaths among wild birds and domestic poultry in recent months.

Diagnostic testing at CSIRO’s Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness at Geelong in Victoria has confirmed it as the highly pathogenic H7N3 strain of avian influenza, or ‘bird flu’. The strain was detected after an investigation into unexpected poultry deaths on the farm. Agriculture Victoria released a statement saying the property has been placed into quarantine with a reported 400,000 birds being “depopulated”, and that staff are on the ground to support the business and investigate further. “Movement controls are now in place to prevent any spread of avian influenza. This includes a Restricted Area covering a five-kilometre radius around the affected property and a broader Control Area buffer zone covering a zone off [sic] 20 kilometres around the affected property. “The Control Area Order requires permits for the movement of poultry, poultry products and equipment on or off the properties in these areas. Penalties apply for those who do not follow these restrictions.” Movement controls implemented by Agriculture Victoria after a bird flu outbreak near the town of Meredith. Image credit: Agriculture Victoria What is bird flu? Avian influenza is a viral infection most prevalent in birds. There are a variety of subtypes and strains, with strains classified as ‘low pathogenicity’ (LPAI) and ‘high pathogenicity’ (HPAI) in relation to poultry. Professor Raina MacIntyre, Head of the Biosecurity Program at the Kirby Institute at the University of NSW, says the virus is typically spread by wild birds flying long distances on migratory routes. “It’s the waterfowl – which are ducks, swans and geese – that normally spread a highly pathogenic avian influenza. However, the waterfowl that originate in Asia, their flyways bypass Australia, which is why we’ve been spared some of the really bad outbreaks that other countries have had.” Although an outbreak of an HPAI virus has never been detected among Australia’s wild birds, LPAI viruses are “part of the natural virus community of wild birds worldwide, including in Australia,” according to Wildlife Health Australia (WHA). The independent coordinating body reports almost all LPAI subtypes (H1-16, excluding H14) have been detected in Australian wild birds. LPAI viruses tend to be carried by wild birds with no apparent symptoms, and fatality from the virus has not been reported in Australia. However, there are concerns native wildlife could be devastated if an HPAI virus outbreak were to occur in Australia, and with no way to prevent migratory birds from entering the continent, some researchers believe it will only be a matter of time before an outbreak will occur. How concerning is H7N3? Professor MacIntyre says the strain of bird flu detected in Victoria is highly infectious. “It’s highly pathogenic, which causes the birds to be very sick.” “It’s a cause for concern because, obviously, any avian influenza outbreak in farmed poultry has an economic impact. Generally, you’ve got to cull the birds to control the outbreak, so there are significant losses for farmers, and of course, you don’t want it to spread,” says Professor MacIntyre. Chickens walk on the grass in the morning. Image credit: shutterstock “However, in the past, we’ve had about nine H7 outbreaks in poultry in Australia, and they’ve all been brought under control fairly quickly, usually through the culling of the birds. “If it has got to the poultry, then yes, our native wildlife probably has been exposed to H7N3. There would have been exposure, but it hasn’t been apparent in the way that the H5N12.3.4.4B has been in the US and Europe. They’ve noticed wild animals dying.” Past cases of HPAI virus in Australia YEARAVIAN INFLUENZA SUBTYPELOCATION1976H7N7Melbourne, VIC1985H7N7near Bendigo, VIC1992H7N3near Bendigo, VIC1994H7N3Brisbane, QLD1997H7N4near Tamworth, NSW2012H7N7near Maitland, NSW2013H7N2near Young, NSW2020H7N7near Ballarat, VICSource: An Outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H7N7) in Australia and the Potential for Novel Influenza A Viruses to Emerge, Andrew T. Bisset and Gerard F. Hoyne “On each occasion, the outbreaks were quickly detected and eradicated, and only a small number of farms were affected. Effective eradication measures ensured that Australia has remained free of HPAI.”– Agriculture Victoria The rise of H5N1 A new HPAI virus that became known as H5N1 began concerning researchers when it was first detected in China’s southern Guangdong region in 1996. With a fatality rate in reported cases of 59 per cent, this highly infectious strain swiftly killed large numbers of birds across Asia before spreading through Europe, Africa, North and South America, and the Middle East. In less than three decades, it has caused a panzootic (the animal equivalent of a pandemic), while over half a billion poultry have been euthanased in an effort to prevent further spread of the virus. Although it is impossible to calculate the true toll on wildlife due to the difficulties of monitoring, millions of fatalities have occurred globally. Around 650,000 wild birds have been reported dead in South America alone. The H5N1 virus reached the Antarctica mainland in February, with scientists especially concerned for the continent’s vulnerable wildlife. It leaves Oceania (Australia and New Zealand) as the only remaining region unaffected by the strain. “The clinical picture for H5N1 is really quite scary,” says Professor MacIntyre. “It’s more than just a severe respiratory infection, we’re seeing quite severe brain infection and effects on the neurological system in mammals and birds that are infected.” Silhouettes of common cranes in flight. Image credit: shutterstock Human transmission H5N1 is known to have crossed the species barrier at least three times, with at least 26 species of mammals having been infected. Despite being first reported on Antarctica’s mainland less than three months ago, the virus has already been found in penguins, elephant seals and fur seals. This also means transmission to humans is possible. In a separate incident to the H7N3 outbreak at the egg farm, Victorian authorities also announced yesterday the first confirmed human case of H5N1 avian influenza in Australia. The patient was a child who had travelled to India in March and acquired the infection. Clare Looker, Victoria’s Chief Health Officer, said it was unclear how the child had contracted the virus, although it was likely from coming into contact with infected poultry. The World Health Organization has reported a total of 889 cases and 463 deaths from 2003 to 1 April 2024 from H5N1. The H7N3, H7N7 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses are also known to have been transmitted to humans. While most transmission of avian influenza occurs from birds to humans, mutations in the strains are leading to changes in how the virus works. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports nine states are struggling with H5N1 outbreaks among dairy cattle. However, it today reported a second case of transmission from cows to humans after the infection of a Michigan dairy worker. “Scientists have gone and just tested the milk on the [US] supermarket shelves and found more than 30 per cent of the milk samples are contaminated with H5N1,” says Professor MacIntyre. “Pasteurisation should kill the virus, but there is quite a big trend in the US to drink raw milk. And of course, there’s also incidents where the milk is inadequately pasteurised. “There’s also eating of meat, so eating a rare steak, for example, could be quite a risk. Once it gets into the food chain at that level, which it clearly is in the US, there’s a much greater risk of a mutation arising that becomes transmissible in humans.” Australia’s safety measures Australia has so far avoided an outbreak of the H5N1 strain. We know this due to a nationally coordinated surveillance system for avian influenza in wild birds, which includes monitoring long-distance migratory birds. Between July 2005 and December 2022, over 135,000 wild birds were tested for influenza viruses across Australia. In 2022 and 2023 alone, researchers from WHA collected almost 1000 samples from recently arrived migratory birds without detecting the virus. Other routine testing of dead birds around Australia also found no trace of HPAI strains. Australia has some of the world’s strictest biosecurity measures to protect against diseases entering the country through imported birds or poultry products. These measures include screening incoming goods and passenger luggage with x-rays, inspections, and detector dogs at airports, seaports and mail centres. Poultry producers also have monitoring systems that quickly detect disease in flocks, leading to veterinary investigations. While there is no way to prevent H1N5 from entering the country through wild birds, Australia does have an emergency response plan for HPAI outbreaks. The AUSVETPLAN Response Strategy for Avian Influenza outlines a nationally agreed approach to avian influenza outbreaks in Australia. Australia’s response to avian influenza Procedures for responding to outbreaks generally include: euthanasia of infected and in-contact poultry (depopulation) decontamination strict quarantine movement controls to prevent spread of infection tracing and surveillance to locate the extent of infection Source: Agriculture Victoria During the most recent outbreak in 2020 and early 2021, there were three different strains of avian influenza across three local government areas – three egg farms with HPAI H7N7, and two turkey farms and an emu farm with LPAI strains. These outbreaks were controlled through the destruction of approximately 433,000 domestic birds, and continued surveillance of both domestic and wild birds. There is currently no permitted treatment for infected birds due to the strict policy of eradication of HPAI and LPAI. As of August 2020, one avian influenza (H5N2) vaccine is registered in Australia, and three other active constituents (H7N1, H5N9, H5N2) have been approved by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA). If any of these vaccines or active constituents were to be considered for use in the case of an Australia-wide HPAI outbreak, the APVMA would need to be consulted. Any suspicion of an emergency animal disease (EAD) should be immediately reported to the 24-hour EAD Hotline on 1800 675 888 or to your local vet.

(ABC SW Victoria: Jean Bell)“Authorities are really very professional at dealing with these outbreaks," Dr Short said."Unfortunately what happens in these kind of outbreaks when it is highly pathogenic avian influenza there is a large culling of poultry."It’s a very dramatic policy but it has to be because it is the way of stopping it from spreading to other poultry farms."Killing infected chickens helps protect the food system and stop one highly populated farm being the source of more widespread infection to other farms and back into the environment.The government authority responsible for managing this latest outbreak at farms at Meredith and Terang in Victoria, Agriculture Victoria, refers to this as ‘depopulation,’ of the infected farms."We now move towards stamping out the disease which means removing the diseased and at risk population and disposing of them in a way which means there is no risk of onward spread," Victoria’s Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Graeme Cooke explained.Victoria's Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Graeme Cooke. (ABC Landline: Tim Lee )Culling protects birds, food and farmersThe decision to cull infected chicken properties is supported by the chicken industry.An outbreak is tragic for the grower but ultimately the protection of the industry and the safety of food for consumers is most important, according to Australian Chicken Growers Council CEO Joanne Sillince."There is absolutely no doubt that this a complete tragedy for that farm," Ms Sillince said."The government will help out a bit but it’s not the same as losing everything you have ever worked for."But moving very quickly to control this disease saves the birds and the incomes of all the other farms in the area — indeed all of Australia."More than 150,000 birds will be euthanased at the Terang site to control the virus spreading. (ABC South West Victoria: Jean Bell)Supply impact ‘a blip’Vice president of the Victorian Farmers Federation Danyel Cucinotta is a third-generation egg farmer at Werribee, west of Melbourne — a long way from the infected farm.But she knows despite the best efforts of biosecurity agencies and farmers she may still bare the brunt of the outbreak.“Worst of all for us is, is what [the outbreak] does to demand and supply,” she said.“If those birds are in peak production, we are looking at being about 450,000 eggs a day down."Danyel Cucinotta's family has farmed caged eggs in Werribee for 53 years. She is seen here with her father, Brian Ahmed. (ABC News: Kyle Harley)Brendan Blake, owner of Blake Family Grocers in Daylesford, Castlemaine and Ballarat said this was not a particularly substantial portion of the state’s supply.He said any further outbreaks would be concerning as they could affect the supply chain, but currently consumers should not worry."If there is a massive reduction in stock, it evidently will lead to a price rise," he said."Simply the supply and demand issue comes into play - there is less supply, therefore there is greater demand."Mr Blake said he would be watching the outbreak closely, particularly if it spread into chicken meat farms. Health officials advise to only eat properly cooked poultry and eggs. (ABC News: Sophie Johnson)Dr Sillince said she was confident Australia would be able to maintain egg supply. “Australia is a very robust supplier of eggs and you can move eggs within states,” she said. “It is only 24 weeks between a fertile egg turning into an egg producer. “If there is a blip, it won’t last very long.” Australian Chicken Growers Council acting CEO Joanne Sillince. (ABC Central Coast: Mary-Louise Vince)The ABC understands Coles is also closely watching the situation and will work with suppliers across the country to keep eggs on shelves. And it's understood Woolworths does not expect any supply challenges or changes to egg prices.No food safety riskVictoria’s Chief Vet was confident in reassuring Australians that their food was safe to eat.“There is no risk. The Department of Health work very closely with us and their advice of food remains the same,” Dr Cooke said. “We don’t want the general consumer to feel like they can’t consume either poultry or egg products."They are completely safe to consume and anything that isn’t safe will be destroyed and will never leave farm," Ms Cucinotta said."If anyone is concerned about eating eggs or poultry product, [this virus] is just like any other kind of bacteria. As long as you cook them in their full capacity."So just scramble an egg instead of having it soft poached, that will kill off any bacteria to start with."Control measuresAgriculture Victoria has implemented a housing requirement for all birds within designated movement control zones around Meredith and Terang.These restricted areas cover a 5km radius around the infected farms, with a broader buffer zone for both properties. Under the requirement, all poultry farmers, backyard flock and bird owners within these areas must house or keep birds enclosed as practically as possible, or risk penalties. In a statement issued on Friday evening, Dr Cooke said the move has been supported by the industry. "The order will reduce the risk that more birds will contract avian influenza, however it will not eliminate the risk of spread."ABC Rural RoundUp newsletterStories from farms and country towns across Australia, delivered each Friday.Your information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Email addressSubscribePosted Fri 24 May 2024 at 9:09pmFriday 24 May 2024 at 9:09pmFri 24 May 2024 at 9:09pm, updated Sat 25 May 2024 at 1:07amSaturday 25 May 2024 at 1:07amSat 25 May 2024 at 1:07amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

As well as a child with bird flu, there has also been an outbreak at a poultry farmAPCatherine Wylie|Lowenna Waters22 May 2024A child in Australia who recently returned from India has contracted the first human case of the H5N1 avian influenza.It is the first time the highly pathogenic strain of bird flu has been detected on the continent. Local health authorities say that the child contracted the virus in India in March, likely through contact with a sick bird. They experienced a “severe infection” but have since made a full recovery.In an unrelated incident, there has also been an outbreak of avian influenza at a poultry farm in Victoria, Australia.Of the 800 H5N1 cases reported since the late 1990s, roughly 50 per cent resulted in death. The virus has recently broke out among dairy cattle in the US, affecting 51 herds in nine US states.The US Centre for Disease Control is monitoring 300 people who have been exposed to the virus via cattle for signs of infection. But what do you know about bird flu and what should you do if you see an affected bird?What is bird flu and how is it transmitted?The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said wild birds migrating to the UK from mainland Europe during the winter months can carry the disease and this can lead to cases in poultry and other captive birds.ImageEnvironment Secretary George Eustice described the current outbreak as the “largest-ever” Birds can be infected with the avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds or waste products. Wild birds including waterfowl (swans, ducks, geese) can carry and transmit the virus without showing evidence of disease, according to Paul Walton, head of habitats and species at RSPB Scotland.How do you spot bird flu?There are two types of avian influenza, with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) being the more serious type. It is often fatal in birds.Some of the clinical signs of HPAI in birds include sudden and rapid increase in the number of birds found dead, several birds affected in the same shed or air space, a swollen head, closed and excessively watery eyes, head and body tremoring, drooping of the wings and/or dragging of legs, twisting of the head and neck, and swelling and blue discolouration of comb and wattles.Chickens at Leicestershire-based egg producer Sunrise Poultry Farms playing with a football while they are stuck indoors during the bird flu lockdown PA MediaOther signs include haemorrhages on shanks of the legs and under the skin of the neck, loss of appetite or marked decrease in feed consumption, sudden increase or decrease in water consumption, respiratory distress, sneezing, noticeable increase in body temperature, discoloured or loose watery droppings, and cessation or marked reduction in egg production.What is the risk to the public?No further infections have been identified and that the risk of transmission to others is “very low” as the virus has not yet shown evidence that it can spread between people. People are advised not to touch or pick up any dead or sick birds that they find and instead report them to the relevant helpline.Is it still okay to feed birds in your garden?The RSPB said everyone should take care to maintain good hygiene when feeding garden birds, and also recommended “regularly cleaning feeders outside with mild disinfectant, removing old bird food, spacing out feeders as much as possible, and washing your hands”.UK chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss said people who keep chickens and want to feed wild birds need to make sure everything is kept “scrupulously clean” and “absolutely separate” to avoid infecting their own flocks.What should you do if you see a sick or injured bird?The RSPB said if people find any dead waterfowl, any gulls or birds of prey, or five or more of any other species in one place, they should report them to the Defra helpline on 03459 335577 or in Northern Ireland to DAERA on 0300 200 7840.The RSPB also advises that people who live in bird-flu areas should keep their dogs on a lead, as the virus can be passed to pets.Read More'Disturbing' report of bird flu spreading to dairy cows in USRare vulnerable bird species sees record year for breeding, RSPB saysSeabird colony to reopen to public after two-year closure due to avian fluPoultry farmers win High Court fight over compensation for culled birdsCreate a FREE account to continue readingRegistration is a free and easy way to support our journalism.Join our community where you can: comment on stories; sign up to newsletters; enter competitions and access content on our app.* FIRST NAME* LAST NAME* EMAILYour email address* PASSWORDMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberShow* YEAR OF BIRTHYou must be at least 18 years old to create an account20062005200420032002200120001999199819971996199519941993199219911990198919881987198619851984198319821981198019791978197719761975197419731972197119701969196819671966196519641963196219611960195919581957195619551954195319521951195019491948194719461945194419431942194119401939193819371936193519341933193219311930192919281927192619251924192319221921192019191918191719161915191419131912191119101909190819071906* Required fieldsI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from Evening Standard.

The first infected property near Meredith is confirmed to have the H7N3 strain of avian influenza and the second infected property near Terang is confirmed H7N9. These properties have been placed in quarantine and all poultry will be safely disposed of and the sites cleared of the infection. Housing requirement There are movement controls that include a housing requirement for all birds within the restricted areas and control areas in Merdith and Terang. Under the housing requirement all poultry farmers, backyard flock and bird owners must house or keep their birds enclosed in cages or sheds as practically as possible. Agriculture Victoria staff are on-the-ground to supporting the businesses and working closely with industry to contain and eradicate the virus. Contact tracing is also underway to determine the source and spread of the infection. Avian influenza is a viral disease of birds found globally. Virus strains are described as low pathogenicity (LPAI) or high pathogenicity (HPAI). While cases among humans in direct contact with animals infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are possible, the current risk to the public remains low. Poultry farmers, backyard flock and bird owners are urged to report any cases of unexplained bird deaths to the VicEmergency Hotline on 1800 226 226. While cases among humans in direct contact with animals infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are possible, the current risk to the public remains low. Find out more about avian influenza in humans from the BetterHealth Channel. Movement controls Movement controls are now in place to prevent any spread of avian influenza. This includes: a restricted area covers a 5 km radius around the Meredith farm with a broader Control Area buffer zone in the eastern part of Golden Plains Shire Council. The western boundary of this area is the Colac-Ballarat Road. a restricted area covering a 5 km radius around the Terang farm with a broader control Area buffer zone covering a 15 km radius. a housing requirement for all birds within these areas. The movement controls require permits for the movement of birds, poultry products, feed and equipment on or off the properties in these areas. Penalties apply for those who do not follow these restrictions. Examples of products that can’t be moved without a permit include eggs, poultry feed, drinking water and bedding.

Housing requirement There are housing requirement for all birds within the restricted areas and control areas in Merdith and Terang. Under the housing requirement all poultry farmers, backyard flock and bird owners must house or keep their birds enclosed in cages or sheds.

The order will reduce the risk that more birds will contract avian influenza, however it will not eliminate the risk of spread. If you don’t have a building in which to house your birds, then efforts should be made to separate them and their food and drink from wild birds that may be carrying avian influenza (e.g. by using netting).

Australia, on Wednesday, reported its first case of avian influenza (H5N1) in a young child who previously contracted the disease in India but recuperated. This happened simultaneously with another strain highly transmissible after avian flu was detected on an egg farm in the country. The virus has led to the deaths of birds and mammals in recent years. Australia’s southeastern state health authorities stated that there is a low possibility of people contacting the disease because it doesn’t spread to humans. Australia was the only continent where animals were free of the H5N1 avian influenza. State Chief Health Officer, Dr Looker, stated, “This is the first confirmed human case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Australia.” He added that this was the first time the virus was found in a person or animal in Australia.Related News:Covid-19: US Reports First Known Case of Highly-infectious VariantNew Zealand Reports First Community Covid-19 Case in MonthsThailand Reports New Mpox Case In European Man Returning From Africa Looker, clarifying the case of the young child with H5N1, noted, “The child experienced a severe infection but is no longer unwell and has made a full recovery.” Chief Executive of Australia Eggs, Rowan Mcmonnies, revealed that part of the industry that has been affected is poultry, but the farmers are “working hard to ensure there are eggs on shelves.” The Australian Chicken Meat Federation (ACMF) said companies have intensified their biological safety measures as a precaution.

Diagnostic testing at CSIRO’s Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness at Geelong in Victoria has confirmed it as the highly pathogenic H7N3 strain of avian influenza, or ‘bird flu’. The strain was detected after an investigation into unexpected poultry deaths on the farm. Agriculture Victoria released a statement saying the property has been placed into quarantine with a reported 400,000 birds being “depopulated”, and that staff are on the ground to support the business and investigate further. “Movement controls are now in place to prevent any spread of avian influenza. This includes a Restricted Area covering a five-kilometre radius around the affected property and a broader Control Area buffer zone covering a zone off [sic] 20 kilometres around the affected property. “The Control Area Order requires permits for the movement of poultry, poultry products and equipment on or off the properties in these areas. Penalties apply for those who do not follow these restrictions.” Movement controls implemented by Agriculture Victoria after a bird flu outbreak near the town of Meredith. Image credit: Agriculture Victoria What is bird flu? Avian influenza is a viral infection most prevalent in birds. There are a variety of subtypes and strains, with strains classified as ‘low pathogenicity’ (LPAI) and ‘high pathogenicity’ (HPAI) in relation to poultry. Professor Raina MacIntyre, Head of the Biosecurity Program at the Kirby Institute at the University of NSW, says the virus is typically spread by wild birds flying long distances on migratory routes. “It’s the waterfowl – which are ducks, swans and geese – that normally spread a highly pathogenic avian influenza. However, the waterfowl that originate in Asia, their flyways bypass Australia, which is why we’ve been spared some of the really bad outbreaks that other countries have had.” Although an outbreak of an HPAI virus has never been detected among Australia’s wild birds, LPAI viruses are “part of the natural virus community of wild birds worldwide, including in Australia,” according to Wildlife Health Australia (WHA). The independent coordinating body reports almost all LPAI subtypes (H1-16, excluding H14) have been detected in Australian wild birds. LPAI viruses tend to be carried by wild birds with no apparent symptoms, and fatality from the virus has not been reported in Australia. However, there are concerns native wildlife could be devastated if an HPAI virus outbreak were to occur in Australia, and with no way to prevent migratory birds from entering the continent, some researchers believe it will only be a matter of time before an outbreak will occur. How concerning is H7N3? Professor MacIntyre says the strain of bird flu detected in Victoria is highly infectious. “It’s highly pathogenic, which causes the birds to be very sick.” “It’s a cause for concern because, obviously, any avian influenza outbreak in farmed poultry has an economic impact. Generally, you’ve got to cull the birds to control the outbreak, so there are significant losses for farmers, and of course, you don’t want it to spread,” says Professor MacIntyre. Chickens walk on the grass in the morning. Image credit: shutterstock “However, in the past, we’ve had about nine H7 outbreaks in poultry in Australia, and they’ve all been brought under control fairly quickly, usually through the culling of the birds. “If it has got to the poultry, then yes, our native wildlife probably has been exposed to H7N3. There would have been exposure, but it hasn’t been apparent in the way that the H5N12.3.4.4B has been in the US and Europe. They’ve noticed wild animals dying.” Past cases of HPAI virus in Australia YEARAVIAN INFLUENZA SUBTYPELOCATION1976H7N7Melbourne, VIC1985H7N7near Bendigo, VIC1992H7N3near Bendigo, VIC1994H7N3Brisbane, QLD1997H7N4near Tamworth, NSW2012H7N7near Maitland, NSW2013H7N2near Young, NSW2020H7N7near Ballarat, VICSource: An Outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H7N7) in Australia and the Potential for Novel Influenza A Viruses to Emerge, Andrew T. Bisset and Gerard F. Hoyne “On each occasion, the outbreaks were quickly detected and eradicated, and only a small number of farms were affected. Effective eradication measures ensured that Australia has remained free of HPAI.”– Agriculture Victoria The rise of H5N1 A new HPAI virus that became known as H5N1 began concerning researchers when it was first detected in China’s southern Guangdong region in 1996. With a fatality rate in reported cases of 59 per cent, this highly infectious strain swiftly killed large numbers of birds across Asia before spreading through Europe, Africa, North and South America, and the Middle East. In less than three decades, it has caused a panzootic (the animal equivalent of a pandemic), while over half a billion poultry have been euthanased in an effort to prevent further spread of the virus. Although it is impossible to calculate the true toll on wildlife due to the difficulties of monitoring, millions of fatalities have occurred globally. Around 650,000 wild birds have been reported dead in South America alone. The H5N1 virus reached the Antarctica mainland in February, with scientists especially concerned for the continent’s vulnerable wildlife. It leaves Oceania (Australia and New Zealand) as the only remaining region unaffected by the strain. “The clinical picture for H5N1 is really quite scary,” says Professor MacIntyre. “It’s more than just a severe respiratory infection, we’re seeing quite severe brain infection and effects on the neurological system in mammals and birds that are infected.” Silhouettes of common cranes in flight. Image credit: shutterstock Human transmission H5N1 is known to have crossed the species barrier at least three times, with at least 26 species of mammals having been infected. Despite being first reported on Antarctica’s mainland less than three months ago, the virus has already been found in penguins, elephant seals and fur seals. This also means transmission to humans is possible. In a separate incident to the H7N3 outbreak at the egg farm, Victorian authorities also announced yesterday the first confirmed human case of H5N1 avian influenza in Australia. The patient was a child who had travelled to India in March and acquired the infection. Clare Looker, Victoria’s Chief Health Officer, said it was unclear how the child had contracted the virus, although it was likely from coming into contact with infected poultry. The World Health Organization has reported a total of 889 cases and 463 deaths from 2003 to 1 April 2024 from H5N1. The H7N3, H7N7 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses are also known to have been transmitted to humans. While most transmission of avian influenza occurs from birds to humans, mutations in the strains are leading to changes in how the virus works. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports nine states are struggling with H5N1 outbreaks among dairy cattle. However, it today reported a second case of transmission from cows to humans after the infection of a Michigan dairy worker. “Scientists have gone and just tested the milk on the [US] supermarket shelves and found more than 30 per cent of the milk samples are contaminated with H5N1,” says Professor MacIntyre. “Pasteurisation should kill the virus, but there is quite a big trend in the US to drink raw milk. And of course, there’s also incidents where the milk is inadequately pasteurised. “There’s also eating of meat, so eating a rare steak, for example, could be quite a risk. Once it gets into the food chain at that level, which it clearly is in the US, there’s a much greater risk of a mutation arising that becomes transmissible in humans.” Australia’s safety measures Australia has so far avoided an outbreak of the H5N1 strain. We know this due to a nationally coordinated surveillance system for avian influenza in wild birds, which includes monitoring long-distance migratory birds. Between July 2005 and December 2022, over 135,000 wild birds were tested for influenza viruses across Australia. In 2022 and 2023 alone, researchers from WHA collected almost 1000 samples from recently arrived migratory birds without detecting the virus. Other routine testing of dead birds around Australia also found no trace of HPAI strains. Australia has some of the world’s strictest biosecurity measures to protect against diseases entering the country through imported birds or poultry products. These measures include screening incoming goods and passenger luggage with x-rays, inspections, and detector dogs at airports, seaports and mail centres. Poultry producers also have monitoring systems that quickly detect disease in flocks, leading to veterinary investigations. While there is no way to prevent H1N5 from entering the country through wild birds, Australia does have an emergency response plan for HPAI outbreaks. The AUSVETPLAN Response Strategy for Avian Influenza outlines a nationally agreed approach to avian influenza outbreaks in Australia. Australia’s response to avian influenza Procedures for responding to outbreaks generally include: euthanasia of infected and in-contact poultry (depopulation) decontamination strict quarantine movement controls to prevent spread of infection tracing and surveillance to locate the extent of infection Source: Agriculture Victoria During the most recent outbreak in 2020 and early 2021, there were three different strains of avian influenza across three local government areas – three egg farms with HPAI H7N7, and two turkey farms and an emu farm with LPAI strains. These outbreaks were controlled through the destruction of approximately 433,000 domestic birds, and continued surveillance of both domestic and wild birds. There is currently no permitted treatment for infected birds due to the strict policy of eradication of HPAI and LPAI. As of August 2020, one avian influenza (H5N2) vaccine is registered in Australia, and three other active constituents (H7N1, H5N9, H5N2) have been approved by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA). If any of these vaccines or active constituents were to be considered for use in the case of an Australia-wide HPAI outbreak, the APVMA would need to be consulted. Any suspicion of an emergency animal disease (EAD) should be immediately reported to the 24-hour EAD Hotline on 1800 675 888 or to your local vet.

(ABC Rural: Jo Prendergast)abc.net.auews/chicken-cull-to-save-industry-after-bird-flu/103890152Link copiedShareShare articleTo protect our birds and your food, more than half a million chickens need to die.That's the cold, harsh reality of Australia's tough biosecurity measures, facing their latest test from avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu.The average Australian eats 263 eggs a year and nearly 50kg of chicken, so protecting the supply of some of our favourite foods is important to government authorities, businesses that sell it and farmers that produce it.The ninth outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Australia since 1976 is on our shores and two Victorian farms are in lockdown, under strict quarantine restrictions and government authorities are working hard to control the outbreak.University of Queensland virologist Kirsty Short said this swift reaction was a sign of Australia’s strict biosecurity system working."The first thing that goes through my mind is it was detected and reported, which is fantastic because the last thing we want to have is a bird die off that is not reported," she said.Finding any animal disease early is key as it allows authorities to put restrictions on movement and stop the spread, but that doesn’t mean birds on an infected farm will survive.A Terang poultry has been placed into quarantine after the detection of H7N3 avian influenza. (ABC SW Victoria: Jean Bell)“Authorities are really very professional at dealing with these outbreaks," Dr Short said."Unfortunately what happens in these kind of outbreaks when it is highly pathogenic avian influenza there is a large culling of poultry."It’s a very dramatic policy but it has to be because it is the way of stopping it from spreading to other poultry farms."Killing infected chickens helps protect the food system and stop one highly populated farm being the source of more widespread infection to other farms and back into the environment.The government authority responsible for managing this latest outbreak at farms at Meredith and Terang in Victoria, Agriculture Victoria, refers to this as ‘depopulation,’ of the infected farms."We now move towards stamping out the disease which means removing the diseased and at risk population and disposing of them in a way which means there is no risk of onward spread," Victoria’s Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Graeme Cooke explained.Victoria's Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Graeme Cooke. (ABC Landline: Tim Lee )Culling protects birds, food and farmersThe decision to cull infected chicken properties is supported by the chicken industry.An outbreak is tragic for the grower but ultimately the protection of the industry and the safety of food for consumers is most important, according to Australian Chicken Growers Council CEO Joanne Sillince."There is absolutely no doubt that this a complete tragedy for that farm," Ms Sillince said."The government will help out a bit but it’s not the same as losing everything you have ever worked for."But moving very quickly to control this disease saves the birds and the incomes of all the other farms in the area — indeed all of Australia."More than 150,000 birds will be euthanased at the Terang site to control the virus spreading. (ABC South West Victoria: Jean Bell)Supply impact ‘a blip’Vice president of the Victorian Farmers Federation Danyel Cucinotta is a third-generation egg farmer at Werribee, west of Melbourne — a long way from the infected farm.But she knows despite the best efforts of biosecurity agencies and farmers she may still bare the brunt of the outbreak.“Worst of all for us is, is what [the outbreak] does to demand and supply,” she said.“If those birds are in peak production, we are looking at being about 450,000 eggs a day down."Danyel Cucinotta's family has farmed caged eggs in Werribee for 53 years. She is seen here with her father, Brian Ahmed. (ABC News: Kyle Harley)Brendan Blake, owner of Blake Family Grocers in Daylesford, Castlemaine and Ballarat said this was not a particularly substantial portion of the state’s supply.He said any further outbreaks would be concerning as they could affect the supply chain, but currently consumers should not worry."If there is a massive reduction in stock, it evidently will lead to a price rise," he said."Simply the supply and demand issue comes into play - there is less supply, therefore there is greater demand."Mr Blake said he would be watching the outbreak closely, particularly if it spread into chicken meat farms. Health officials advise to only eat properly cooked poultry and eggs. (ABC News: Sophie Johnson)Dr Sillince said she was confident Australia would be able to maintain egg supply. “Australia is a very robust supplier of eggs and you can move eggs within states,” she said. “It is only 24 weeks between a fertile egg turning into an egg producer. “If there is a blip, it won’t last very long.” Australian Chicken Growers Council acting CEO Joanne Sillince. (ABC Central Coast: Mary-Louise Vince)The ABC understands Coles is also closely watching the situation and will work with suppliers across the country to keep eggs on shelves. And it's understood Woolworths does not expect any supply challenges or changes to egg prices.No food safety riskVictoria’s Chief Vet was confident in reassuring Australians that their food was safe to eat.“There is no risk. The Department of Health work very closely with us and their advice of food remains the same,” Dr Cooke said. “We don’t want the general consumer to feel like they can’t consume either poultry or egg products."They are completely safe to consume and anything that isn’t safe will be destroyed and will never leave farm," Ms Cucinotta said."If anyone is concerned about eating eggs or poultry product, [this virus] is just like any other kind of bacteria. As long as you cook them in their full capacity."So just scramble an egg instead of having it soft poached, that will kill off any bacteria to start with."Control measuresAgriculture Victoria has implemented a housing requirement for all birds within designated movement control zones around Meredith and Terang.These restricted areas cover a 5km radius around the infected farms, with a broader buffer zone for both properties. Under the requirement, all poultry farmers, backyard flock and bird owners within these areas must house or keep birds enclosed as practically as possible, or risk penalties. In a statement issued on Friday evening, Dr Cooke said the move has been supported by the industry. "The order will reduce the risk that more birds will contract avian influenza, however it will not eliminate the risk of spread."ABC Rural RoundUp newsletterStories from farms and country towns across Australia, delivered each Friday.Your information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Email addressSubscribePosted Fri 24 May 2024 at 9:09pmFriday 24 May 2024 at 9:09pmFri 24 May 2024 at 9:09pm, updated Sat 25 May 2024 at 1:07amSaturday 25 May 2024 at 1:07amSat 25 May 2024 at 1:07amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

Source: AAP / Joel CarrettLooker said the chance of additional human cases was low as avian influenza does not easily spread between people.Bird flu detected at Victorian egg farmThe revelation comes on the same day that agricultural authorities revealed a different strain of bird flu had been detected at an egg farm in regional Victoria.Agriculture Victoria has ordered urgent testing after avian influenza was detected at a farm near Meredith, about 40km northwest of Geelong, following a number of poultry deaths.Chief veterinary officer Graeme Cooke said the outbreak likely involved the H7N7 strain, different to the highly pathogenic H5N1 variant."There is a type of virus which is causing great concern in the USA and other parts of the world and has behaved unusually in that it has infected dairy cattle and some other marine mammals," Cooke told the ABC's Country Hour."This is not the strain that we're dealing with. This is a strain that's occurred in Australia before. It's likely not new."H7N7 was the most common strain of bird flu in Australia, Cooke said.One of the strains in the last bird flu outbreak in Australia in 2020, which affected one-in-three egg farms in Victoria, was a H7 strain and testing is underway to determine if it's the same one.The property has been placed into quarantine with a 5km radius set up and affected animals will be "depopulated".A new strain of H5N1, clade 2.3.4.4b, emerged in 2020 and has been causing record numbers of deaths among wild birds and domestic poultry in recent months. Source: Getty / Peter Garrard BeckSamples of the virus have been sent to the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness in Geelong for testing.What is avian influenza?Avian influenza is a highly contagious viral infection which can cause severe symptoms and sudden death in domestic poultry, wiping out entire populations.Wild birds are the natural host for the disease and it can spread through close contact or contaminated environments.All bird species are thought to be susceptible to the deadly H5N1, which has also been detected in more than 50 mammal species, including humans.Infected people have observed mild symptoms or have been asymptomatic, but some experience severe illness.Authorities have reassured the public that eggs and poultry products in supermarkets do not pose a risk and are safe to consume.Bird owners have been reminded to keep enclosures clean, quarantine new birds before integrating them with existing flocks, ensure footwear is clean and to always wash hands before and after handling birds or eggs.Share3 min readPublished 22 May 2024 1:00pmUpdated 22 May 2024 4:50pmSource: AAPAvailable in other languagesTagsBird fluHealthShare this with family and friendsCopy linkShareRecommended for you'Remarkable courage': Principal speaks as student who died in schoolyard crash identifiedcar accidentsAustralians are obsessed with Japan, but a new travel hotspot is emergingtravel and tourismThe disease that's now overtaken COVID-19 as the world's top infectious killertuberculosisUS presidential election results: What we know so far2024 united states presidential electionAn OnlyFans content creator planned to go to Schoolies.

On Thursday afternoon, Agriculture Victoria revealed bird flu had been found at a second poultry farm near Terang.The slaughter of 400,000 chickens is under way as Victoria tries to curb the latest avian flu outbreak.Credit: Jason SouthThe initial find came as a second human case of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu was discovered in a dairy worker in the US state of Michigan, transmitted by cattle.The Victorian chickens at the centre of Australia’s first avian flu outbreak in four years were contained on Thursday in nine vast sheds on the Meredith property, linked by narrow outdoor spaces. Until last year, the farm traded as Moorabool Valley Eggs, before being sold and trading as AVGO Eggs. Happy Hens and Surf Coast Eggs trucks were also on the property on Thursday.As busloads of workers arrived at the property, wearing hazmat suits and masks under the supervision of Agriculture Victoria officials, vehicles delivered dozens of large gas canisters.Agriculture Victoria announced it had placed a five-kilometre cordon around the egg farm. It also imposed a broader control area buffer zone covering 20 kilometres around the farm.This allows authorities to restrict the movement of poultry, poultry products, equipment and vehicles on or off properties in the area, and impose penalties on people who fail to comply with directions.A road closure sign was placed on the road leading up to the farm, preventing access to the final 150 metres approaching the property.AdvertisementContact tracing was also under way to determine the source and spread of the infection.Agriculture Victoria said a 1.5-kilometre cordon and a larger buffer zone of 15 kilometres had been implemented near the Terang outbreak, which it says is linked to the Meredith farm.Workers prepare to kill the chickens near the town of Meredith.Credit: Jason SouthThe H7N3 strain of avian flu is different from the virulent strain of H5N1, which has been ripping through wildlife populations on every continent except Australia.Fears the virus could evolve to pass between mammals were sparked earlier this year when cow herds in the US were infected and a dairy worker fell ill.Sustained transmission of avian flu between humans has not yet been recorded.Victoria’s Chief Veterinarian, Graeme Cooke, said the virus strain detected near Meredith was H7N3, as opposed to the H5N1 strain that has ravaged bird and mammal populations in the US and elsewhere.“The current risk to the public remains low.”Victoria’s Chief Veterinarian, Graeme CookeThe deadly H5N1 variant was first detected in wild birds in Europe in 2020 and spread to birds in the US and Canada in late 2021.More than 90 million birds and poultry have been infected with the H5N1 variant in the US since 2022, and it has killed thousands of Adelie penguins and skua seabirds in Antarctica. H5N1 has not yet been detected in birds in Australia.“While cases among humans in direct contact with animals infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are possible, the current risk to the public remains low,” Cooke said.LoadingFederal Agriculture Minister Murray Watt said while it was a relief H5N1 had not been detected, Australia took any instance of highly pathogenic avian flu seriously.“Australia has effective, nationally agreed response and cost-sharing arrangements in place to address animal disease incursions and outbreaks, and this has swung into action to support Victoria,” he said.“Australia is well practised in responding to disease incidents in poultry and has successfully responded to eight outbreaks of HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] in poultry since 1976.“In all those cases, we were able to eradicate the disease successfully and rapidly with minimal spread between farms.”In Western Australia, biosecurity measures have been tightened on a poultry farm in the state’s south-west after the discovery of an unrelated strain of avian flu.A highly pathogenic strain of avian flu was detected at the vast egg farm in Meredith. Credit: Jason SouthAuthorities say the strain detected in WA was a low pathogenic H9N2 strain and not connected to the Victorian outbreak.On Wednesday, a child was confirmed as Australia’s first human case of the lethal H5N1 strain spreading around the world.LoadingThe child, who returned to Victoria from India in March, experienced a severe infection after contracting the strain, but had made a full recovery, Victorian Chief Health Officer Clare Looker confirmed.Authorities say contact tracing has not identified any further cases.With AAP, Lachlan Abbott and Marta Pascual JuanolaStart the day with a summary of the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

As well as a child with bird flu, there has also been an outbreak at a poultry farmAPCatherine Wylie|Lowenna Waters22 May 2024A child in Australia who recently returned from India has contracted the first human case of the H5N1 avian influenza.It is the first time the highly pathogenic strain of bird flu has been detected on the continent. Local health authorities say that the child contracted the virus in India in March, likely through contact with a sick bird. They experienced a “severe infection” but have since made a full recovery.In an unrelated incident, there has also been an outbreak of avian influenza at a poultry farm in Victoria, Australia.Of the 800 H5N1 cases reported since the late 1990s, roughly 50 per cent resulted in death. The virus has recently broke out among dairy cattle in the US, affecting 51 herds in nine US states.The US Centre for Disease Control is monitoring 300 people who have been exposed to the virus via cattle for signs of infection. But what do you know about bird flu and what should you do if you see an affected bird?What is bird flu and how is it transmitted?The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said wild birds migrating to the UK from mainland Europe during the winter months can carry the disease and this can lead to cases in poultry and other captive birds.ImageEnvironment Secretary George Eustice described the current outbreak as the “largest-ever” Birds can be infected with the avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds or waste products. Wild birds including waterfowl (swans, ducks, geese) can carry and transmit the virus without showing evidence of disease, according to Paul Walton, head of habitats and species at RSPB Scotland.How do you spot bird flu?There are two types of avian influenza, with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) being the more serious type. It is often fatal in birds.Some of the clinical signs of HPAI in birds include sudden and rapid increase in the number of birds found dead, several birds affected in the same shed or air space, a swollen head, closed and excessively watery eyes, head and body tremoring, drooping of the wings and/or dragging of legs, twisting of the head and neck, and swelling and blue discolouration of comb and wattles.Chickens at Leicestershire-based egg producer Sunrise Poultry Farms playing with a football while they are stuck indoors during the bird flu lockdown PA MediaOther signs include haemorrhages on shanks of the legs and under the skin of the neck, loss of appetite or marked decrease in feed consumption, sudden increase or decrease in water consumption, respiratory distress, sneezing, noticeable increase in body temperature, discoloured or loose watery droppings, and cessation or marked reduction in egg production.What is the risk to the public?No further infections have been identified and that the risk of transmission to others is “very low” as the virus has not yet shown evidence that it can spread between people. People are advised not to touch or pick up any dead or sick birds that they find and instead report them to the relevant helpline.Is it still okay to feed birds in your garden?The RSPB said everyone should take care to maintain good hygiene when feeding garden birds, and also recommended “regularly cleaning feeders outside with mild disinfectant, removing old bird food, spacing out feeders as much as possible, and washing your hands”.UK chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss said people who keep chickens and want to feed wild birds need to make sure everything is kept “scrupulously clean” and “absolutely separate” to avoid infecting their own flocks.What should you do if you see a sick or injured bird?The RSPB said if people find any dead waterfowl, any gulls or birds of prey, or five or more of any other species in one place, they should report them to the Defra helpline on 03459 335577 or in Northern Ireland to DAERA on 0300 200 7840.The RSPB also advises that people who live in bird-flu areas should keep their dogs on a lead, as the virus can be passed to pets.Read More'Disturbing' report of bird flu spreading to dairy cows in USRare vulnerable bird species sees record year for breeding, RSPB saysSeabird colony to reopen to public after two-year closure due to avian fluPoultry farmers win High Court fight over compensation for culled birdsCreate a FREE account to continue readingRegistration is a free and easy way to support our journalism.Join our community where you can: comment on stories; sign up to newsletters; enter competitions and access content on our app.* FIRST NAME* LAST NAME* EMAILYour email address* PASSWORDMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberShow* YEAR OF BIRTHYou must be at least 18 years old to create an account20062005200420032002200120001999199819971996199519941993199219911990198919881987198619851984198319821981198019791978197719761975197419731972197119701969196819671966196519641963196219611960195919581957195619551954195319521951195019491948194719461945194419431942194119401939193819371936193519341933193219311930192919281927192619251924192319221921192019191918191719161915191419131912191119101909190819071906* Required fieldsI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from Evening Standard.

The first infected property near Meredith is confirmed to have the H7N3 strain of avian influenza and the second infected property near Terang is confirmed H7N9. These properties have been placed in quarantine and all poultry will be safely disposed of and the sites cleared of the infection. Housing requirement There are movement controls that include a housing requirement for all birds within the restricted areas and control areas in Merdith and Terang. Under the housing requirement all poultry farmers, backyard flock and bird owners must house or keep their birds enclosed in cages or sheds as practically as possible. Agriculture Victoria staff are on-the-ground to supporting the businesses and working closely with industry to contain and eradicate the virus. Contact tracing is also underway to determine the source and spread of the infection. Avian influenza is a viral disease of birds found globally. Virus strains are described as low pathogenicity (LPAI) or high pathogenicity (HPAI). While cases among humans in direct contact with animals infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are possible, the current risk to the public remains low. Poultry farmers, backyard flock and bird owners are urged to report any cases of unexplained bird deaths to the VicEmergency Hotline on 1800 226 226. While cases among humans in direct contact with animals infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are possible, the current risk to the public remains low. Find out more about avian influenza in humans from the BetterHealth Channel. Movement controls Movement controls are now in place to prevent any spread of avian influenza. This includes: a restricted area covers a 5 km radius around the Meredith farm with a broader Control Area buffer zone in the eastern part of Golden Plains Shire Council. The western boundary of this area is the Colac-Ballarat Road. a restricted area covering a 5 km radius around the Terang farm with a broader control Area buffer zone covering a 15 km radius. a housing requirement for all birds within these areas. The movement controls require permits for the movement of birds, poultry products, feed and equipment on or off the properties in these areas. Penalties apply for those who do not follow these restrictions. Examples of products that can’t be moved without a permit include eggs, poultry feed, drinking water and bedding. To apply for a permit fill in this online form. Read the latest restriction and control order. Housing requirement There are housing requirement for all birds within the restricted areas and control areas in Merdith and Terang. Under the housing requirement all poultry farmers, backyard flock and bird owners must house or keep their birds enclosed in cages or sheds. Penalties apply for those who do not follow these restrictions. Housing birds is an effective method of minimising direct contact with wild birds that can carry the disease with no apparent symptoms. The order will reduce the risk that more birds will contract avian influenza, however it will not eliminate the risk of spread. If you don’t have a building in which to house your birds, then efforts should be made to separate them and their food and drink from wild birds that may be carrying avian influenza (e.g. by using netting).

Australia, on Wednesday, reported its first case of avian influenza (H5N1) in a young child who previously contracted the disease in India but recuperated. This happened simultaneously with another strain highly transmissible after avian flu was detected on an egg farm in the country. The virus has led to the deaths of birds and mammals in recent years. Australia’s southeastern state health authorities stated that there is a low possibility of people contacting the disease because it doesn’t spread to humans. Australia was the only continent where animals were free of the H5N1 avian influenza. State Chief Health Officer, Dr Looker, stated, “This is the first confirmed human case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Australia.” He added that this was the first time the virus was found in a person or animal in Australia.Related News:Covid-19: US Reports First Known Case of Highly-infectious VariantNew Zealand Reports First Community Covid-19 Case in MonthsThailand Reports New Mpox Case In European Man Returning From Africa Looker, clarifying the case of the young child with H5N1, noted, “The child experienced a severe infection but is no longer unwell and has made a full recovery.” Chief Executive of Australia Eggs, Rowan Mcmonnies, revealed that part of the industry that has been affected is poultry, but the farmers are “working hard to ensure there are eggs on shelves.” The Australian Chicken Meat Federation (ACMF) said companies have intensified their biological safety measures as a precaution. The organisation added, “No discernible impact is expected on chicken meat supplies.” Nancy Mbamalu Follow us on: ON NOW POPULAR Politics 10th Nov, 2024 by AriseNews Okpebholo: Obaseki Frustrating Handing Over Power To Me AFRICA 10th Nov, 2024 by AriseNews Ukrainian War: Varsity Don Asks UN, Others to Stop Russia from Alleged Recruitment of Nigerian Women Global 10th Nov, 2024 by AriseNews Qatar Suspends Mediation Efforts in Israel-Hamas Talks Amid Escalating Tensions, Diplomatic Frustrations Global 10th Nov, 2024 by AriseNews Tens of Thousands Protest In Valencia Over Floods, Demand Resignation Of Regional Leader Carlos Mazón AFRICA 11th Nov, 2024 by AriseNews Peter Obi Encourages Nigerian Students to Migrate for Greener Pastures Breaking 11th Nov, 2024 by AriseNews Korea to Provide $10 Billion Development Aid for Africa, Nigeria Among Top Beneficiaries Breaking 11th Nov, 2024 by AriseNews IG Egbetokun Orders No Quasi-Security Groups for Election Duty, Assures Voters of Safe Polls AFRICA 11th Nov, 2024 by AriseNews Presidency Condemns Atiku’s Criticism of Tinubu’s Policies, Calls for End to ‘Grand Illusions’ Top Stories AFRICA 11th Nov, 2024 by Frances Ibiefo Olisa Agbakoba: Coast Guard Proposal Essential for Maritime Security AFRICA 11th Nov, 2024 by Boluwatife Enome Mike Ejiofor: Politicians Are Manipulating Elections, Not Out to Serve the People But Their Own Interests AFRICA 10th Nov, 2024 by AriseNews Chief Justice Kekere-Ekun: Few Judges are Tarnishing the Image of Judiciary Politics 9th Nov, 2024 by Fidelis David Ondo Guber: Aiyedatiwa, Agboola, Other Candidates Gear Up For Race, Sign Peace Accord Breaking 8th Nov, 2024 by Fidelis David APC, PDP, Others Sign Peace Accord Ahead of Ondo Poll AFRICA 8th Nov, 2024 by Boluwatife Enome Yemi Oke Calls For Decentralised Power Solutions, Says We Can’t Rely On A Weak National Grid AFRICA 8th Nov, 2024 by AriseNews Tinubu: Nigeria’s Economy Is Gradually Rebounding With Our Administration’s Reforms Global 7th Nov, 2024 by Ozioma Samuel-Ugwuezi Lower The Temperature, Don’t See Yourselves As Adversaries But Fellow Americans, Biden Says To Americans Post Trump Win Navigation Home Breaking Global AFRICA Business Politics Entertainment Sports Tech Health Videos More Company About Us Advertise Contact Us Privacy Policy Specialist Markets Easily access major global news with a strong focus on Africa.

Photo: CHRISTOPH REICHWEIN New Zealand must be prepared for the bird flu strain causing concern overseas, public health experts say, as Australia confirms its first human case. The H5N1 strain of bird flu has been spreading among wild birds and poultry globally for more than two years. But scientists are on alert for changes in H5N1 which could signal the virus is adapting to spread easily among humans amid reports of human cases and spread among cattle in the US too. "The H5N1 virus is constantly evolving and could potentially become easily transmissible from person to person," the World Health Organization's (WHO) website states. "If this occurs, it could be the start of a new influenza pandemic, as was the case with the 1918 and 2009 H1N1 pandemics." Read more: The mutating bird flu lurking on our borders What is avian influenza H5N1, also known as bird flu, and why has it been found in US dairy cows? Last week, New Zealand public health experts, via a Public Health Communication Centre briefing, said recent developments underscored the urgent need for pandemic preparedness efforts "to the evolving threat" posed by H5N1. The authors - Michael Baker, John D. Potter, Nigel French, Jemma L. Geoghegan, Nick Wilson, Oz Mansoor, Sue Huang and Richard Webby - said New Zealand needed to update its national pandemic plan, effective public health and social measures, and timely access to testing, vaccines, antivirals, and infection prevention equipment. "We need to make sure our pandemic preparedness is up to scratch and ready for emerging threats such as H5N1. Careful reviewing of our pandemic plan, as well as cross-agency practice exercises will give us a better chance of preventing and minimising the impact of pandemics in Aotearoa," Prof Baker said. A 'One Health' approach to surveillance and response was key to identifying and swiftly responding to potential outbreaks, the authors said. "We need to use this opportunity now as we never know the timing of the next pandemic," Prof Baker said. "These capabilities are a good investment as they also help New Zealand prevent and manage the infections we already have, which is a further benefit." Professor Michael Baker is among those calling for an update to the national pandemic plan. Photo: Supplied to RNZ It has long been on the list of viruses with pandemic potential, and any expansion to a new mammal species is concerning. "The increasing host range of the virus, potential spread among mammals and between a mammal and a human, its wide geographical spread, and the unprecedented scale of the outbreaks in birds raise concerns about the pandemic potential of HPAI A(H5N1)," an article on medical journal The Lancet stated. Distinguished Professor of infectious disease epidemiology and public health Nigel French, of Massey University, said they also backed the 'one health' approach, given the strain's effects on animals and the potential for it to infect humans. "Aotearoa's Health agencies, the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Department of Conservation, iwi, community groups and the farming sector are working together to ensure any incursion of bird flu is detected early and an appropriate response instigated. "This includes the H5N1 strain of global concern, and all other avian influenza viruses, including H7N3. The public are also encouraged to help with surveillance by familiarising themselves with the signs to look out for, particularly in wildlife, and what to do to report anything that looks suspicious of bird flu. Comprehensive information on what to look for and how to respond is here." From 2003 to 1 April 2024, a total of 889 cases and 463 deaths caused by H5N1 have been reported worldwide from 23 countries, according to WHO. The United Nations agency said there was a risk for sporadic infections in mammals and humans due to exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments, and so further human cases were not unexpected. Recent developments in the bird flu outbreak The US Department of Agriculture is ordering dairy producers to test cows that produce milk for infections from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) before the animals are transported to a different state following the discovery of the virus in samples of pasteurized milk taken by the Food and Drug Administration. Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images / AFP The H5N1 outbreak has spread to dairy cattle in nine states, including Michigan and Texas where two farm workers were found to be infected. However, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the risk to the general public remained low and it had not seen evidence of human to human transmission of bird flu, Reuters reported. US officials had thought the outbreak was recent, but a recent study found bird flu was likely circulating on a limited basis as far back as late 2023.. The study said it believed wild birds transmitted the virus to cattle, which then expanded when the cows were shipped to other states. On Wednesday, Australia confirmed its first human case of the bird flu after a child returning from overseas tested positive for the H5N1 strain. Meanwhile, another strain of the virus, H7N3, was found on an egg farm in the Australian state of Victoria. "This is the second time an outbreak of a strain of avian influenza has emerged in Australian egg producers in the last few years, the last being an outbreak of H7N7 in 2020," Prof French said. "The human case in Australia was a traveller from a country where H5N1 is circulating. No other cases have been identified through contact tracing, and although they developed severe symptoms, they have since recovered. This is a common scenario for human cases of bird flu - sporadic, severe infections with no evidence of sustained transmission." The WHO's advice on recent US cases stated "enhanced surveillance in potentially exposed human populations becomes necessary" where there is exposure to an outbreak or a confirmed human infection. "Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans." In cooperation with other districts, the German Ennepe-Ruhr district rehearses what to do in the event of an outbreak of bird flu. Photo: Christoph Reichwein / DPA / dpa Picture-Alliance via AFP New Zealand's situation There are no known outbreaks in animals - or human cases - in New Zealand so far. H5N1 is among the notifiable infectious diseases, meaning health professionals are required to report to the local Medical Officer of Health if they find a suspected or confirmed case. Prof French is also the chief science adviser at Te Niwha - an infectious disease research platform - which is funding a University of Otago and Environmental Science and Research project to develop monitoring for bird flu in wildlife. "The Department of Conservation is trialling vaccination of endangered taonga wild birds." In March, the Ministry for Primary Industries and Department of Conservation said they were preparing a contingency plan for an inevitable "tsunami" of bird flu coming to New Zealand. "Biosecurity New Zealand has systems in place to prevent HPAI entering New Zealand through human activity and to ensure early detection if it does arrive," the Department of Conservation's website stated. How is H5N1 spreading? It remains unclear how the virus is spreading, but there is evidence of wild bird-to-cow, cow-to-cow, cow-to-poultry, and one case of cow-to-human transmission. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, US officials reiterated. Because of the heavy viral load in milk and mammary glands, scientists suspect the virus is being spread to animals during the milking process, either through contact with infected equipment or with virus that becomes aerosolised during cleaning procedures. It remains unclear whether the virus can spread through respiratory droplets that infect the airway, as flu viruses typically spread in humans. A nasal swab from the Michigan worker tested negative for influenza in a state lab. But an eye swab from the patient was shipped to CDC and tested positive for the H5N1 virus, the CDC said, indicating it may have been transmitted in that way. - Reuters / RNZ Tags: health world Share this Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share via email Share on Reddit Share on Linked In Copyright © 2024, Radio New Zealand Subscribe to RNZ's Daily Newsletter View latest newsletter Next story in New Zealand $2 billion bill to rescue courthouses leaves officials considering PPPs Related Stories Stricter mask use could reduce the spread of respiratory infections - researchers 23 May 2024 "We now have a clear pathway to action, including reducing the number of respiratory infections in winter 2024," associate professor Amanda Kvalsvig says.
