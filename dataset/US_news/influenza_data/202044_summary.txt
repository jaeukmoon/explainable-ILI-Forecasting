1. Exuberant fibroblast activity compromises lung function via the enzyme ADAMTS4.
2. Excess activity of damage-responsive lung fibroblasts during severe influenza virus infection drives lethal immunopathology.
3. Damage-responsive fibroblasts produce ECM-remodeling enzymes and inflammatory cytokines, modifying the lung microenvironment and promoting immune cell infiltration at the expense of lung function.
4. Levels of ADAMTS4 in the lower respiratory tract are associated with the severity of infection with seasonal or avian influenza virus in human participants.
5. Targeting the ECM protease activity of damage-responsive lung fibroblasts could be a promising therapeutic approach to preserving lung function and improving clinical outcomes in severe respiratory infections.
