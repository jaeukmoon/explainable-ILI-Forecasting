COVID-19 vs. the Flu Infectious Diseases Reviewed By: Lisa Lockerd Maragakis, M.D., M.P.H. Updated on July 29, 2022 Influenza (the flu) and COVID-19, the illness caused by the pandemic coronavirus, are both contagious respiratory illnesses, meaning they affect your lungs and breathing, and can be spread to others. Although the symptoms of COVID-19 and the flu can look similar, the two illnesses are caused by different viruses. Lisa Maragakis, M.D., M.P.H., senior director of infection prevention at Johns Hopkins, explains how the flu and COVID-19 are similar and how they are different. Similarities: COVID-19 and the Flu Symptoms Both illnesses can cause fever, cough, body aches, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea (especially in children). Learn more about COVID-19 symptoms. Both can result in pneumonia. Both flu and COVID-19 can be asymptomatic, mild, severe or even fatal. How It Spreads Both the flu and COVID-19 spread in similar ways. Droplets or smaller virus particles from a sick person can transmit the virus to other people nearby. The smallest particles may linger in the air, and another person can inhale them and become infected. Or, people can touch a surface with viruses on it, and then transfer the germs to themselves by touching their face. People infected with the coronavirus or the flu may not realize they are sick for several days, and during that time can unknowingly spread the disease to others before they even feel sick. Prevention and Vaccines COVID-19: There are several COVID-19 vaccines recommended by the CDC. It is also important to receive a booster when you are eligible. Flu: A vaccine is available and effective in preventing some of the most dangerous types or to reduce the severity or duration of the flu. The flu vaccine is reformulated every year in anticipation of the influenza strains that are expected to circulate. It is very important to get vaccinated for the flu as the COVID pandemic continues. Other Ways to Prevent COVID-19 and Flu In most cases, serious disease and death due to COVID-19 or the flu can be prevented by vaccines. In addition, mask-wearing, frequent and thorough hand washing, coughing into the crook of your elbow, staying home when sick and limiting contact with people who are infected are effective safety precautions. Physical distancing limits the spread of COVID-19 and flu in communities.

How can you protect yourself and your family from both illnesses? Get these and other questions answered by Johns Hopkins Medicine infectious diseases experts from our Nov 12 Facebook Live event: “Staying Safe from the Flu and COVID-19 This Winter.” Differences: Covid-19 and the Flu Cause COVID-19: Caused by the 2019 coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2. There are different SARS-CoV-2 that have some differences in how severe or transmissible they are. Flu: Caused by the influenza virus. There are two main types of influenza virus called influenza A and influenza B. Different strains of influenza A and influenza B emerge and circulate each year. Symptoms COVID-19: Many people infected with the coronavirus do not feel sick or have only mild symptoms, but they can still transmit the coronavirus to other people. Review the full list of symptoms. COVID-19 can sometimes cause a person to suddenly lose their sense of smell (anosmia) or taste (ageusia). This rarely occurs with flu, but it can occur with certain strains of the virus. Flu: Flu does not typically affect a person’s sense of smell or taste, but otherwise has many symptoms similar to COVID-19 Rarely, as during the 1918 flu pandemic, a certain influenza strain does cause many people to lose their sense of taste or smell. Treatment While different treatments may be used for COVID-19 and the flu, both are treated by addressing symptoms, such as reducing fever. Severe cases may require hospitalization and very ill patients may need a ventilator — a machine that helps them breathe. For some patients, medications may help lessen the symptoms and shorten the duration of COVID-19 or flu. COVID-19: Treatment for COVID-19 depends on the severity of the infection. For milder illness, resting at home and taking medicine to reduce fever is often sufficient. More severe cases may require hospitalization, with treatment that might include intravenous medications, supplemental oxygen, assisted ventilation and other supportive measures. Flu: Oral antiviral medications can address symptoms and sometimes shorten the duration of the illness. Because they are given by mouth, these antiviral therapies can be prescribed for patients at home or in the hospital. Complications COVID-19: The development of complications, including long-term damage to the lungs, heart, kidneys, brain and other organs and a variety of long-lasting symptoms, is possible after a case of COVID-19. Flu: Influenza complications can include inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis) or muscles (myositis, rhabdomyolysis), and multi-organ failure. Secondary bacterial infections, particularly pneumonia, can occur following a bout of influenza infection. Infections COVID-19: The first cases appeared in China in late 2019, and the first confirmed case in the United States appeared in January 2020. Current COVID-19 infections* Flu: The World Health Organization estimates that 1 billion people worldwide get the flu every year. Coronavirus vs. Flu Deaths­ COVID-19: Current COVID-19 deaths* Flu: The World Health Organization estimates that 290,000 to 650,000 people die of flu-related causes every year worldwide. The COVID-19 situation continues to change, sometimes rapidly. Doctors and scientists are working to estimate the mortality rate of COVID-19. At present, it is thought to be substantially higher (possibly 10 times or more) than that of most strains of the flu. *This information comes from the Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases map developed by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering. Cold and Flu Season Precautions: What to Do Stay up to date with coronavirus vaccinations and boosters. Visit the CDC site for vaccination and booster details. Get a flu shot. Even if you usually skip a flu shot, it is especially important to make sure you get one as long as the coronavirus pandemic continues. It is safe for you to go to the doctor for a flu shot. For the 2021–2022 flu season, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, recommends that you get your flu shot in September or October. Ask your doctor if you should get a pneumonia shot, too. Don’t forget the kids. It’s important to ensure your children (over 6 months old) get flu shots — and any other vaccines they need. Kids age 5 and up are eligible to receive one of the current COVID-19 vaccines. Learn more about keeping up with routine vaccinations for babies and kids during the coronavirus pandemic. Care for yourself and your family with good nutrition, plenty of rest, proper hydration, regular exercise and stress management. And always stay home if you don’t feel well. Continue protecting yourself from the coronavirus. Even if you are tired of following coronavirus precautions such as washing your hands frequently, cleaning and sanitizing, wearing a face mask and physically distancing, it’s especially important now to keep up the good work — and encourage your family to do the same.

Worse yet, coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) leads to more severe clinical outcomes. The development of a combined vaccine against both COVID-19 and influenza is thus of high priority. Based on our established lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA vaccine platform, we developed and characterized a novel mRNA vaccine encoding the HA antigen of influenza A (H1N1) virus, termed ARIAV. Then, ARIAV was combined with our COVID-19 mRNA vaccine ARCoV, which encodes the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, to formulate the final combined vaccine, AR-CoV/IAV. Further characterization demonstrated that immunization with two doses of AR-CoV/IAV elicited robust protective antibodies as well as antigen-specific cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and IAV. More importantly, AR-CoV/IAV immunization protected mice from coinfection with IAV and the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants. Our results highlight the potential of the LNP-mRNA vaccine platform in preventing COVID-19 and influenza, as well as other respiratory diseases.

As of 17 December 2021, more than 270 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 with approximately 5.33 million deaths have been reported globally by the World Health Organization1. Varying degrees of clinical symptoms have been reported for SARS-CoV-2 infection, ranging from fever, cough, sore throat, mild or severe pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome2,3.Worse yet, as the cold season approaches, the possibility of a simultaneous epidemic of other respiratory diseases has also raised serious concerns about the potential risk of coinfection with two or more respiratory pathogens4,5. Influenza virus is one of the most common pathogens that was found to establish a concurrent infection with SARS-CoV-24,6,7, and multiple clinical cases of coinfection have been reported8,9,10. Both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus are mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and nasal or throat secretions and cause similar clinical manifestations after a respiratory infection. Several recent studies were conducted to explore whether SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus coinfection leads to more serious diseases, and the results have suggested that influenza virus infection efficiently facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, leading to prolonged pneumonia with more severe lung lesions than single infection11,12,13. Coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus also causes more severe weight loss and a higher proportion of death in mammals12,13,14,15, likely resulting in a more serious threat especially during the flu season16. Therefore, the development of a combined vaccine is urgently needed to reduce the risk of infection with both pathogens.In the past decade, messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines have been developed as an effective approach to overcome the existing bottleneck of conventional vaccines in the prevention of infectious diseases17,18,19, and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been demonstrated to serve as an effective system for mRNA delivery20. During the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech that encode the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were authorized for use in humans for the first time21,22,23. In addition, mRNA vaccine candidates against other respiratory viral diseases, including influenza, are also under different stages of development. LNP-delivered mRNA vaccines encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) proteins of H10N8 and H7N9 were demonstrated to elicit a robust immune response with high levels of protective antibodies according to a phase 1 clinical trial24,25.Previously, we reported a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA (mRNA-LNP) vaccine (ARCoV) encoding the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is currently being evaluated in multicenter phase 3 clinical trials26,27,28. In the present study, we developed another mRNA vaccine (ARIAV) encoding the HA antigen of influenza A virus (IAV) H1N1. Then, a final combined vaccine formulation named AR-CoV/IAV was designed and prepared as a combination of ARCoV and ARIAV under the same technology platform. Further experiments clearly demonstrated that AR-CoV/IAV immunization readily induces an antigen-specific immune response in mice and confers protection against infection with IAV and SARS-CoV-2 both individually and in combination.RESULTSRational design and characterization of an mRNA vaccine candidate (ARIAV) encoding the full-length HA protein of influenza A (H1N1) virusWe developed an mRNA vaccine candidate (ARIAV) against IAV based on an LNP-encapsulated mRNA platform as previously described (Fig. 1a)26. Briefly, we chose the HA of influenza virus A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1) as the mRNA-encoded antigen; this antigen is included in the WHO recommended composition of quadrivalent or trivalent influenza vaccines for use in the 2021-2022 influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere. We also performed multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis based on 143 HA gene sequences of influenza A (H1N1) virus isolated in the Northern Hemisphere from 2009 to 2020. A maximum-likelihood tree constructed by the Tamura-Nei model showed that A/Wisconsin/588/2019 clustered closely and exhibited high sequence identity with globally isolated virus strains from 2018 to 2020 (Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 1: Design and characterization of ARIAV mRNA-LNP encoding HA protein of influenza A (H1N1) virus as a vaccine candidate.a Schematic diagram of ARIAV, encoding the full-length HA protein. b Indirect immunofluorescence assay of HA protein expression in HEK293T cells 48 h post-transfection. Scale bar, 20 μm. c HA expression in HEK293T cells was determined by immunoblotting. d HA-specific IgG antibody titers were determined by ELISA. e Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers were determined 14 and 28 days post-initial immunization. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM (n = 8). Statistical differences were analyzed by using two-tailed unpaired t tests. *P < 0.05,**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.Full size imageTo evaluate the in vitro expression profile of HA-mRNA, immunofluorescence staining was performed by using a polyclonal HA antibody for H1N1. As expected, a large number of HA-positive cells were detected in mRNA-transfected HEK293T cells, and most fluorescence signals located along the plasma membrane (Fig. 1b). Similarly, western blotting analyses of cell lysates from the mRNA-transfected HEK293T cells also showed a high expression level of HA protein (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Further flow cytometry assay showed that abundant expression of membrane-bound HA protein (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4a). To assess the immunogenicity of ARIAV, groups of 6- to 8-week-old mice were immunized with 10 or 20 µg of ARIAV and boosted with the same dose two weeks later; animals injected with placebo served as a control group. Serum samples were collected 14 and 28 days post-initial immunization and subjected to antibody detection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed and demonstrated that ARIAV effectively induced an antigen-specific IgG antibody response (Fig. 1d). The HA-specific functional antibody response was also identified by a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay using influenza virus A/California/07/2009 (H1N1), showing seroconversion in all animals with HAI titers of ~1:38 or 1:60 after one 10 or 20 µg dose of the ARIAV vaccine (Fig. 1e). Booster immunization effectively improved antigen-specific IgG and HAI antibody titers in a dose-dependent manner. The IgG titers reached ~1:364,500, and HAI titers reached ~1:2816 28 days post-initial immunization in the 20 µg group (Fig. 1d, e). The serum IgG and HAI antibodies were below the detection threshold in all of the placebo-vaccinated mice. Our results demonstrate that two immunizations of ARIAV elicit robust antibody responses in mice, supporting its further evaluation as a vaccine candidate against IAV infection.A combined mRNA vaccine (AR-CoV/IAV) for COVID-19 and influenza elicits a robust humoral immune response in miceNext, we sought to develop a combined mRNA vaccine candidate by mixing ARCoV and ARIAV under the same LNP-mRNA vaccine platform (Fig. 2a). Particle size measurements indicated that ARCoV and ARIAV exhibited similar average particle sizes of 78.9 and 77.95 nm, respectively, with particle dispersion indices (pdi) less than 0.1 (Fig. 2b, c). Next, the expression of both antigens in HEK293T cells was assessed by immunoblotting following transfection of HA- and RBD-encoded mRNAs, suggesting abundant expression of HA and RBD in cell lysates and supernatants, respectively (Fig. 2d; Supplementary Fig. 2a–c).Fig. 2: AR-CoV/IAV immunization elicits a humoral immune response in BALB/c mice.a Schematic diagram of the AR-CoV/IAV formulation as a combination of ARCoV and ARIAV. b, c Representative intensity-size graphs of ARCoV and ARIAV. d HA and RBD protein expression in HEK293T cells was determined by immunoblotting. e Schematic diagram of the experimental design. Groups of mice were immunized with 30 µg of AR-CoV/IAV and boosted with the same dose after two weeks.

Data are shown as the mean ± SEM (n = 8). Statistical differences were analyzed by using two-tailed unpaired t tests. ***P < 0.001.Full size imageNext, as the molecular weight of HA-encoded mRNA is nearly double that of RBD-encoded mRNA, we delivered 30 µg of AR-CoV/IAV as a single vaccination dose that contains 20 µg of HA-encoded mRNA and 10 µg of RBD-encoded mRNA. To evaluate the immunogenicity of AR-CoV/IAV, groups of 6- to 8-week-old mice were immunized with 30 µg of AR-CoV/IAV and boosted with the same dose after two weeks (Fig. 2e). At 14 and 28 days post-initial immunization, ELISA results showed that AR-CoV/IAV vaccination effectively induced the production of IAV-HA and SARS-CoV-2-RBD antigen-specific IgG antibodies (Fig. 2f, h). We also detected high levels of HAI antibodies and of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The HAI antibodies reached ~1:2048 (Fig. 2g), and the SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies reached ~1:3192 with a 50% neutralization titer (NT50) (Fig. 2i) at 28 days post-initial immunization. All of the placebo-vaccinated mice showed undetectable antibody levels for SARS-CoV-2 or IAV. These results suggest that two immunizations with AR-CoV/IAV effectively elicit vaccine-induced protection against SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infection.AR-CoV/IAV effectively elicits an antigen-specific T cell immune responseWe also evaluated the cellular immune response induced by the combined vaccine at 7 days after the second immunization. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to show antigen-specific T cell responses in the spleen of immunized mice, indicating an obvious increase in HA- and RBD-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T cells secreting interferon γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), or interleukin-2 (IL-2) in AR-CoV/IAV immunized mice compared with placebo vaccination (Fig. 3a, c; Supplementary Fig. 4b). Our results suggested the predominant expression of T-helper-1 (Th1) cytokines in response to ex vivo stimulation with the full-length HA or RBD peptide pool. In addition, HA- and RBD-specific CD8+ T cells secreting IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 were also detected in AR-CoV/IAV-immunized mice (Fig. 3b, d). Moreover, enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) analysis revealed significant induction of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 in the splenocytes from vaccinated mice (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). Together, the combined mRNA vaccine AR-CoV/IAV effectively activated obvious antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses.Fig. 3: AR-CoV/IAV immunization elicits an antigen-specific T cell immune response in BALB/c mice.a, b HA-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 were determined by flow cytometry. c, d RBD-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 were determined by flow cytometry. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM (n = 6). Statistical differences were analyzed by using unpaired t tests. **P < 0.01.Full size imageVaccine-induced protection from IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection in miceTo explore the protective efficacy induced by AR-CoV/IAV, groups of mice immunized with two doses of AR-CoV/IAV or placebo were challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of 1.5 × 106 PFU of influenza virus A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) 51 days after initial immunization (Fig. 2e). The infected animals were monitored for signs of influenza, and weight changes were also recorded for 15 days post-inoculation. 87.5% of the placebo-immunized mice showed a severe weight loss of more than 20% within 5 days after infection, while the AR-CoV/IAV-immunized mice slowly gained weight, although a slight weight loss was observed only during the first few days after infection (Fig. 4a). In addition, all of the mice that received two immunizations with AR-CoV/IAV survived the lethal dose of IAV infection without symptoms of disease, while the placebo-treated animals died within one week (Fig. 4b). Lung tissues of infected mice were collected and subjected to virological analyses, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunostaining. As expected, abundant viral RNAs of IAV (2.61 × 1011 RNA copies/g) were detected in the lung sections of mice treated with placebo 5 days postinfection, whereas a significant decrease in viral RNA loads (4.35 × 107 RNA copies/g) by ~3.8 orders of magnitude was observed in the vaccinated animals (Fig. 4c). An immunofluorescence staining assay also showed robust HA protein expression in lung sections from placebo-treated mice, while viral protein expression was not detected in the vaccinated mice (Fig. 4d). Histopathological analyses revealed a severe pathological change in the lung sections from the placebo group, characterized by alveolar septal thickening, alveolar atrophy, massive inflammatory cell infiltration and vascular congestion. In contrast, the AR-CoV/IAV-vaccinated mice exhibited no typical pathological changes after infection (Fig. 4e). Our results distinctly demonstrate the effective protection of the combined mRNA vaccine against IAV infection.Fig. 4: AR-CoV/IAV protects mice from an IAV or SARS-CoV-2 challenge.AR-CoV/IAV- or placebo-immunized mice were challenged with 1.5 × 106 PFU of IAV (A/California/07/2009) (a–e) or 1.6 × 104 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (MASCp6) (f–h) at the indicated time points post-initial immunization. a Weight changes were recorded for 15 days and are shown as the mean ± SEM (AR-CoV/IAV, n = 7; placebo, n = 8). b Mortality was monitored for 21 days after inoculation. c Viral RNA copies in the lung tissues of IAV-infected mice (AR-CoV/IAV, n = 5; placebo, n = 4) were determined by qRT–PCR and are shown as the mean ± SEM. d Immunostaining results for HA protein in lung tissues. e H&E staining of lung tissues from IAV-infected mice. f Viral RNA copies in the lung tissues of SARS-CoV-2-infected mice (AR-CoV/IAV, n = 5; placebo, n = 6) were determined by qRT–PCR and are shown as the mean ± SEM. g ISH assay of lung tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. h H&E staining of lung tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Scale bar, 100 μm. Statistical differences between groups were analyzed using two-tailed unpaired t tests. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.Full size imageNext, we utilized a mouse-adapted strain to evaluate the protective efficacy of AR-CoV/IAV against SARS-CoV-2 as previously described29. Mice were intranasally challenged with 1.6 × 104 PFU of MASCp6 46 days post-immunization (Fig. 2e). Although high levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected in the lung tissues from the placebo-immunized group 4 days postinfection, viral RNAs were under the detection threshold among the AR-CoV/IAV-immunized mice (Fig. 4f), indicating potent protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, in situ hybridization (ISH) by RNAscope indicated that viral RNAs could be detected in the lung sections of placebo-treated mice but not in those of the vaccinated group (Fig. 4g). Additionally, AR-CoV/IAV conferred protection to mice from lung injury, as the placebo group developed moderate interstitial pneumonia characterized by thickened alveolar septa and inflammatory cell infiltration, which was not observed in the vaccinated group (Fig. 4h).AR-CoV/IAV immunization protects mice from IAV and SARS-CoV-2 variant coinfectionConsidering the potential risk of coinfection with different respiratory pathogens during their epidemics, we further determined whether the combined AR-CoV/IAV vaccine confers protection against coinfection with IAV and SARS-CoV-2 variants. We first evaluated the cross-neutralizing antibodies against Alpha and Delta variants prior to coinfection experiments. As expected, mouse sera from AR-CoV/IAV immunized mice are also capable of neutralizing the two variants, and the NT50 titers reached ~1:4097 for SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant and 1:2148 for Delta variant, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 6). Next, we employed a IAV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection animal model as previously described.11 Briefly, groups of mice receiving two immunizations of AR-CoV/IAV or placebo were intranasally inoculated with 2 × 105 PFU of influenza virus A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) 73 days post-initial immunization. Mice were subsequently infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha or Delta variant 2 days later (Figs. 5a and 6a). Infected mice were sacrificed 4 days after IAV infection for viral detection and histopathological analysis. AR-CoV/IAV was demonstrated to protect animals from weight loss; the vaccinated mice experienced only a transient, slight weight loss of less than 5% without typical symptoms of disease, whereas the placebo-treated mice continuously lost weight by more than 15% (Figs. 5b and 6b). Additionally, we observed a significant reduction in the viral RNA levels of IAV and the SARS-CoV-2 variants in the lung tissues from AR-CoV/IAV-vaccinated mice compared with those of the placebo group (Figs. 5c, d and 6c, d). A decrease in influenza virus RNA loads by ~5 orders of magnitude was detected in the vaccinated mice (Fig. 5c and Fig. 6c). For SARS-CoV-2 infection, AR-CoV/IAV showed partial protection against the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha or Delta variant, as the viral RNA loads exhibited 50- and 68-fold decreases compared with those of the placebo group, respectively (Figs. 5d and 6d). Additionally, as previously reported, IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection resulted in an aggravated pathological change in the lung sections of placebo-treated mice, as the histopathological analyses indicated distinct interstitial pneumonia with alveolar septal thickening and infiltration of lymphocytes (Figs. 5e and 6e). In contrast, the vaccinated group showed no obvious signs of inflammation or alveolar lesions. Furthermore, an increased level of cytokine and chemokine expression was detected in serum samples from coinfected mice by Luminex analysis (Fig. 5f). Notably, the vaccinated mice displayed a lower concentration of most cytokines and chemokines after infection (Fig. 5f), including IL-5, IL-22, IP-10 and MCP-3 (Fig. 5f–j), suggesting that the combined mRNA vaccine effectively reduces proinflammatory cytokines and confers protective efficacy against influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection.Fig. 5: AR-CoV/IAV confers protection against coinfection with IAV and the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant in mice.a Schematic diagram of experimental design. Groups of AR-CoV/IAV- or placebo-immunized mice were intranasally challenged with 2 × 105 PFU of IAV (A/California/07/2009) 73 days after the initial immunization, followed by infection with 4 × 103 PFU of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant 2 days later.

Recently, Bao et al demonstrated that a combined vaccination with inactivated COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine induced protection against both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infection13. The CRISPR-Cas13 system has also been reported as a specific therapeutic strategy by utilizing CRISPR RNAs targeting the polymerase-encoding genes of influenza virus as well as the replicase and nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoV-230. Additionally, another group developed a combination of oral bacteria and intranasal inactivated vaccine to protect mice from SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection31.In the current study, we developed a combined mRNA vaccine (AR-CoV/IAV) for COVID-19 and influenza based on the LNP-mRNA platform and reported its immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice. AR-CoV/IAV comprises the LNP-encapsulated mRNAs encoding IAV-HA and SARS-CoV-2-RBD via a combination of ARCoV and ARIAV (Fig. 2a). The HA protein of the influenza virus was recognized as a promising candidate antigen because of its capacity to elicit HA stalk-specific antibodies with broad reactive responses and protective efficacy against heterologous or heterosubtypic viruses32,33,34. The RBD at the C-terminal region of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit is also a promising vaccine target that has been demonstrated to induce robust neutralizing antibodies and cellular responses.26 We noticed that the formulations of ARCoV and ARIAV possess very similar particle sizes (Fig. 2b, c), which provides a distinct advantage for their usage as a combined vaccination. We also verified abundant expression of HA in cell lysates and secreted RBD in supernatants after mRNA cotransfection (Fig. 2d). Accordingly, two doses of AR-CoV/IAV vaccination elicit robust HAI antibodies (>1: 1024) against IAV (Fig. 2g) and neutralizing antibodies (>1: 849) against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2i), that are far beyond the known surrogate correlate of protection35,36,37. Notably, the protective antibody titers were comparable to those from immunization with either ARCoV or ARIAV separately. In addition, our combined vaccine elicited Th1 cytokine-secreting CD4+ T cells and IFN-γ+ or TNF-α+ CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3a–d), indicating an increased antiviral capability without causing severe disease38,39, which is consistent with the previous studies26,40,41. After two immunizations with AR-CoV/IAV, mice were well protected from SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infection or coinfection. Notably, our results demonstrated that the combined vaccine still protected mice from IAV and SARS-CoV-2 variant coinfection over 2 months post-immunization. Although the vaccinated mice were not fully protected, significantly decreased viral loads in lung sections, as well as mild or inconspicuous lung damage were detected without symptoms of either disease, indicating distinct long-term protection against coinfection. Moreover, previous studies have reported a significant elevation of cytokine or chemokine expression in IAV- and SARS-CoV-2-coinfected animals, which may have an intrinsic correlation with inflammatory diseases12,14. Immunization with AR-CoV/IAV was shown to contribute to the reduction in numerous proinflammatory cytokines post-coinfection (Fig. 5f–j). Together, our combined vaccine exhibited a potent ability to confer protection against either SARS-CoV-2 or IAV infection.Due to the constant variation and evolution of respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, the development of universal vaccines is important for ensuring vaccine effectiveness against currently circulating strains. Previously, mRNA vaccine platforms were also utilized in the design of universal vaccines to cover various seasonal influenza virus subtypes. Several conserved antigens, including the stalk domain of HA, matrix protein-2 (M2), nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein-1 (M1), were considered targets for universal influenza virus vaccines34,42. In 2020, a multitargeting mRNA vaccine encoding HA-stalk, NA, M2 and NP was reported to induce robust immune responses in mice with broad protective potential as a universal vaccine candidate43. Moreover, as increased genetic diversity has been detected during the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the development of universal coronavirus vaccines that can induce broad and durable protection against multiple variants is of high priority44,45. Combined with the prominent advantages of mRNA technologies, including their intrinsic characteristics for rapid production, excellent safety profile without nuclear entry, and ability to effectively induce humoral and cellular immune responses, the further design of universal vaccines based on mRNA platforms is of great importance to the effective control of COVID-19 and other respiratory disease pandemics in the future.MethodsCells and VirusesVero cells and MDCK cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 mM HEPES, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant (CSTR.16698.06.NPRC 2.062100002) was obtained from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Delta variant (CSTR.16698.06.NPRC 6.CCPM-B-V-049-2105-6) was obtained from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The mouse-adapted strain BetaCoV/Beijing/IME-BJ05-P6/2020 (MASCp6) was acquired by serial passaging of a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract of BALB/c mice29. Influenza virus A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was grown and titrated in MDCK cells. SARS-CoV-2 variants were titrated on Vero cells. All experiments with infectious SARS-CoV-2 were conducted under biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facilities in the Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology.mRNA synthesisPlasmids ABOP-02826 and ABOP-140 (GENEWIZ), which encode the RBD region of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession no. MN908947) and the full-length HA of IAV (A/Wisconsin/588/2019, GenBank accession no. MT058823), respectively, were constructed, incorporating the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions and a poly-A tail. mRNAs were produced in vitro by using a T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription from the linearized plasmid. A cap 1 structure was added to the 5’ end of mRNA to maintain mRNA stability and enhance translation efficiency by using Vaccinia Capping Enzyme (Hongene Biotech) and mRNA Cap-2’-O-Methyltransferase (Hongene Biotech). The mRNA products were purified by lithium chloride (LiCl) precipitation.LNP Formulation of the mRNAThe mRNA vaccine encoding HA protein of H1N1 was prepared in LNP formulations. Briefly, a lipid mixture including ionizable lipids, 1-,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), cholesterol and PEG-lipid (molar ratios of 50:10:38.5:1.5) was combined with 20 mM citrate buffer (pH 4.0) containing mRNA at a ratio of 1:2 through a T-mixer. The formulation were then diafiltrated in 10 × volume of PBS (pH 7.4), reduced to the desired concentrations through a tangential flow filtration membrane with 100 kD, passed through a 0.22 mm filter, and stored at 2–8 °C until use. All formulations were tested for particle size, distribution, RNA concentration and encapsulation. The combined mRNA vaccine candidate (AR-CoV/IAV) was developed by mixing ARCoV and ARIAV under the same LNP-mRNA vaccine platform. Empty LNPs were utilized as placebo.mRNA transfectionHEK293T (ATCC) cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 4 × 105 cells per well and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 12 h. mRNAs encoding HA or RBD protein were transfected into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine MessengerMAX Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Supernatants and cell lysates were harvested at 48 h after transfection. Supernatants were clarified at 13500 × g by centrifugation and then mixed with 5 × SDS loading buffer (nonreducing). Cell lysates were harvested by RIPA lysis buffer (CWBIO) with cOmplete™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), incubated on ice for 30 min, and mixed with 5 × SDS-loading after centrifugation at 13500 × g. The samples were loaded for SDS–PAGE. The secreted RBD protein in supernatants and HA protein in cell lysates were then detected by western blotting using a chimeric MAb for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (SinoBiological, 40150-D001, 1:1000) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody for influenza A (H1N1) virus HA protein (GeneTex, GTX127357, 1:1000). GAPDH was detected using GAPDH Loading Control Antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA5-15738, 1:1000). All blots derive from the same experiment and processed in parallel.For immunofluorescence staining, HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 4 × 105 cells per well and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 12 h. mRNA encoding HA was transfected into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine MessengerMAX Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Transfected cells were fixed with cold methanol/acetone (7:3) 48 h post-transfection and incubated with primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal antibody for H1N1-HA, GeneTex, GTX127357, 1:400) at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were then washed with PBS three times and then incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Proteintech, SA00013-2, 1:400). HA-positive cells were examined using a PerkinElmer High Content Analysis System Operetta CLS and processed using Harmony 4.9 software.Vaccination and virus challenge experimentsThe animal experimental procedure was reviewed and approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of Laboratory Animal Center, AMMS (approval number: IACUC-DWZX-2020-063). Six- to eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with ARIAV, AR-CoV/IAV or placebo and boosted with an equal dose at 14 days post-initial immunization. 50 μl of mRNA vaccine or placebo were injected into shank muscles. Serum samples were collected prior to immunization and 14 and 28 days after initial immunization and subjected to antibody detection as described below.Vaccinated mice were anesthetized and infected intranasally with the mouse-adapted strain MASCp6 (1.6 × 104 PFU per mouse) or influenza virus A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) (1.5 × 106 PFU per mouse) at the indicated time points post-immunization. For IAV infection, weight loss was monitored for 15 days, and mortality was monitored for 21 days after inoculation. Animals that lost more than 25% of their initial body weight were humanely anesthetized. Some infected animals (AR-CoV/IAV, n = 5; placebo, n = 4) were sacrificed 5 days post-challenge for tissue harvest and virological analyses. For SARS-CoV-2 infection, infected animals (AR-CoV/IAV, n = 5; placebo, n = 6) were sacrificed 4 days post-challenge for tissue harvest and virological analyses.For the IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection experiments, groups of AR-CoV/IAV-immunized mice (n = 5) were intranasally challenged with influenza virus A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) 73 days after initial immunization, followed by infection with a SARS-CoV-2 variant 2 days after IAV infection. Mice were sacrificed 4 days after IAV infection for viral detection and histopathological analysis.SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody detectionSARS-CoV-2-RBD-specific IgG titers were determined by ELISA using a commercial kit (Beijing Wantai Biological). Briefly, serum samples were heated at 56 °C for 30 min before use. Inactivated serum samples were serially diluted twofold and added to blocked 96-well plates coated with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and washed with wash buffer five times. Then, secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated reagent) at a dilution of 1:2 was added to each well to a final volume of 100 µl. Plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and washed five times with wash solution. Fifty microliters of chromogen solution was added, and the solution was incubated for 15 min before being quenched with 25 µl stop solution. Plates were read on a Synergy H1 hybrid multimode microplate reader (BioTek) at 450/630 nm. The endpoint titers were defined according to the manufacturer’s instructions.IAV-specific IgG antibody detectionIAV-specific IgG antibody titers were evaluated by ELISA. Flat-bottom, 96-well plates (Corning) were coated with influenza A H1N1 virus HA protein (Sino Biological) at 2 µg/ml to a volume of 50 µl per well. Plates were stored overnight at 4 °C. The following morning, plates were washed five times with PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). Then, 100 µl of blocking buffer (PBST containing 5% nonfat milk) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Serial threefold dilutions of inactivated serum were added to blocked plates and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were then washed with PBST five times, and secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG; ZSGB-BIO) at a dilution of 1:5000 was added to each well to a final volume of 100 µl. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and washed five times with PBST. Then, 100 µl of chromogen solution was added and incubated for 2 min before being quenched with stop solution. Plates were read on a Synergy H1 hybrid multimode microplate reader (BioTek) at 450/630 nm. The endpoint titers were calculated according to the reciprocal of the highest dilution to achieve an optical density (OD) more than two-fold that of negative serum.Pseudovirus-based neutralization assayNeutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 were determined by a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay. Pseudovirus expressing the surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank accession no. QHD43416.1) as well as Alpha variant (GISAID accession no. EPI_ISL_7745829) and Delta variant (GISAID accession no. EPI_ISL_1544070) (Beijing Tiantan Biological Products, 80033, 80043, 80048) were used in the tests. Serial 3-fold dilutions of inactivated serum were incubated with 600 TCID50 of pseudovirus in 96-well plates at 37 °C for 1 h, leaving the first and last columns and rows blank to account for edge effects. One hour later, Huh7 cells were added to 96-well plates at 3.5 × 104 cells per well and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The supernatants were removed, and luciferase substrate was added to the 96-well plates and incubated for 2 min in darkness. Luciferase activity was determined by using a GloMax 96 Microplate Luminometer (Promega). The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) was defined as the serum dilution at which the relative light units (RLUs) were reduced by 50% compared with the virus control wells.Hemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) AssayHA-specific functional antibody titers were determined by HAI assay. Serial 2-fold dilutions of inactivated serum samples were incubated with an equal volume of four agglutinating doses of influenza virus A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) at room temperature. Then, 1% chicken erythrocytes were added to each plate and incubated at room temperature. HAI titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution at which hemagglutination was completely inhibited.Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assayCellular immune responses were evaluated by using IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 precoated ELISpot kits (MabTech, 3321-4AST, 3511-4APW, 3441-4APW) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, single-cell suspensions from mouse spleens were made in complete medium at 3 × 106 cells/ml. A total of 3 × 105 cells (100 µl) per sample were cultured and stimulated using the influenza A virus (A/California/07/2009) HA peptide pool and SARS-CoV-2 RBD peptide pool (peptides are 15mers, with 11 amino acid overlaps, Genscript) at 1.5 µg/ml per peptide. Concanavalin A (ConA, Sigma) was used as a positive control, and RPMI 1640 medium was used as a negative control. Plates were washed with PBS after incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 36 h and incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Secondary antibody was added to each well to a final volume of 100 μl and incubated for 1 h. Plates were then washed five times with PBS. Then, 100 μl of BCIP/NBT-plus was added and quenched with deionized water. The air-dried plates were read using ImmunoSpot S6 Ultra (CTL). The numbers of spot-forming cells (SFCs) per 1 × 106 cells were calculated.Flow CytometryTo evaluate the expression of membrane-bound HA in vitro, HEK293T cells were transfected with or without 4 μg of HA-encoded mRNA. Cells were collected into 1.5 ml EP tubes after 48 h incubation, and washed twice with 1 mL FACS buffer (PBS with 2% FBS). For membrane staining, 100 μl working solution of the primary antibody to H1N1-HA (Sino Biological, 11055-MM04T, 1:200) was added to each tube to resuspend the cells. The tubes were then placed at 4°C for 30 min in dark. Then, cells were washed two times and incubated in 100 μl working solution of the secondary antibody (Abcam, ab150113, 1:200) at 4 °C for 30 min in dark. The cells were washed twice and resuspended with 200 μl FACS buffer and subjected to flow cytometry.To evaluate the antigen-specific T cell response, a total of 2 × 106 mouse splenocytes were stimulated with overlapping influenza A virus (A/California/07/2009) HA peptide pool or SARS-CoV-2 RBD peptide pool (peptides are 15mers, with 11 amino acid overlaps, 95% purity, Genscript) at 1.5 µg/ml per peptide at 37 °C with 5% CO2. 1 µg/ml anti-mouse CD28 antibody (Biolegend, 102116) and CD49d antibody (Biolegend, 103710) were used to provide co-stimulation. RPMI 1640 medium with DMSO was used as a negative control. After 1 h, Protein Transport Inhibitor (BD Biosciences, 555029, 1:1000) was added to splenocytes and incubated for 8 h. Then cells were collected and washed twice with PBS, blocked with anti-CD16/CD32 antibody (BioLegend, 101303, 1:200) and stained with Zombie Aqua™ Fixable Viability Kit (Biolegend, 423102, 1:200), fluorescently conjugated antibodies to CD3 (BV421, BioLegend, 100341, 1:200), CD4 (FITC, BD, 553046, 1:200), and CD8 (APC/Cyanine7, BioLegend, 100714, 1:200) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Following two washes with PBS, splenocytes were fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences, 554714), and then stained with fluorescently conjugated antibodies to IFN-γ (PE, BioLegend, 505808, 1:200), IL-2 (PE-Cy™7, BioLegend, 503832, 1:200), and TNF-α (PerCP/Cyanine5.5, BioLegend, 506322, 1:200) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Data were collected on FACSVerse flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software.RNA extraction and qRT–PCRTotal RNA was isolated using the PureLink™ RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured with the following primer-probe set: E_CoV2_F (5’-ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCGT-3’), E_CoV2_R (5’-ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA-3’), and E_CoV2_P (5’-ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-3’). IAV RNA was measured with the following primer-probe set: FluA-F (5’-GACCRATCCTGTCACCTCTGAC-3’), FluA-R (5’-GGGCATTYTGGACAAAKCGTCTACG-3’), and FluA-Probe (5’-TGCAGTCCTCGCTCACTGGGCACG-3’). Amplification was performed using a One Step PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa, RR064A). PCR was conducted in a LightCycler® 480 Instrument (Roche Diagnostics Ltd).RNAscope in situ hybridizationThe SARS-CoV-2 RNA ISH assay was performed with RNAscope® 2.5 HD Reagent Kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 2 μm paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a series of graded alcohols. Endogenous peroxidases were quenched with hydrogen peroxide for 10 min at room temperature. Slides were then boiled for 15 min in RNAscope Target Retrieval Reagents and incubated for 30 min in RNAscope Protease Plus before probe hybridization. Tissues were counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin and imaged with microscopy.Histopathological analysisFor histopathology, lung tissues from mice were fixed in 4% neutral-buffered formaldehyde for 48 h, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with H&E. Sections at 4-μm thickness were examined by light microscopy and analyzed from three independent replicates.Multiplex immunofluorescent assayThe HA protein expression in lung tissues was determined by multiplex immunofluorescent assay. Lung paraffin sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a series of graded alcohols. Antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer (pH = 6) by heating in a microwave for 20 min at 95 °C followed by a 20 min cool-down period at room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched with hydrogen peroxide for 20 min, followed by treatment with blocking reagent for 30 min at room temperature. The primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal antibody for H1N1-HA, GeneTex, GTX127357, 1:500) was incubated overnight in a humidified chamber at 4 °C, followed by detection using the Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Servicebio, GB21303, 1:300). The slices were imaged using confocal laser scanning microscopy.Phylogenetic analysisA total of 143 HA gene sequences of influenza A H1N1 virus isolated from the Northern Hemisphere from 2009 to 2020 were collected from the influenza virus database of the NCBI.

If you have heart disease, one answer may be life-threatening.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyInfluenza-related stress on your body can launch a negative chain of events that builds toward a heart attack. And research shows that people with heart disease are nearly 10 times more likely to have a heart attack after coming down with the flu.To explain the connection, we turn to infectious disease expert Kristin Englund, MD.How the flu can affect your heartIf you get the flu, your immune system moves aggressively to fight off the virus. The response leads to internal inflammation, which can elevate your blood pressure and put extra stress on your heart.Plaque buildup (a waxy, fatty substance) in arteries becomes increasingly vulnerable to ruptures in this situation. As the plaque weakens and breaks, artery-clogging clots can form and disrupt blood flow to your heart — a blockage could trigger a heart attack.Anyone with an existing heart issue is more likely to have their cardiovascular system overwhelmed by the effects of the flu, says Dr. Englund.“Fighting off the infection can put a lot of stress on the heart,” she adds. “If you have an underlying health issue, such as heart disease, complications from the flu can cascade into something much worse.”Can the flu cause other serious health issues?Absolutely — and that’s a reality seen through statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).AdvertisementBetween 2010 and 2020, the flu hospitalized between 140,000 and 710,000 in the U.S. annually, according to estimates from the CDC. Deaths tied to the flu ranged from 12,000 to 52,000 over the same period.“People often underestimate the flu,” notes Dr. Englund. “It’s not just a cold, and it can be deadly.”Possible complications from the flu include:Pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure. “This is the #1 complication,” says Dr. Englund. “If people’s pneumonia gets bad enough, they’ll often end up on a ventilator.”Additional cardiac issues such as myocarditis (inflammation of your heart muscle) or an arrhythmia.Stroke, through the same clotting process that can cause a heart attack.Encephalopathy (severe central nervous system damage).Who’s most at risk for flu complications?You’re at high risk for developing flu complications if you have:Other severe health problems, including heart disease.A compromised immune system due to age (either very young or elderly) or pregnancy.Tips to prevent flu-related heart issuesBe proactive in preventing problems with the flu by doing the following:Get your flu shot. Getting a seasonal flu shot can significantly lower your risk of having a heart attack or cardiac arrest if you’re in a high-risk group, according to research reported by the American Heart Association.Avoid contact with people who are sick. No handshaking during flu season. Stay away from other people’s bodily fluids. Practicing good hand hygiene with frequent hand washing is important as well.Keep your heart in check. If you have heart disease, manage your condition carefully with medication, diet and exercise as recommended by your doctor. These preventive actions will help keep your overall immune system strong. If your heart condition is stable and you end up with the flu, chances are, you’ll experience fewer, less severe complications.Don’t dismiss flu-like symptoms. Especially if you’re in a high-risk group, talk to your doctor right away. Timing is important. Tamiflu® is a prescription medication that may mildly shorten the duration of the flu if taken within a few days of the onset of symptoms.Take time to rest. If you have flu-like symptoms, take time to rest and drink plenty of fluids. The longer you stay at home and rest, the faster you’ll recover.AdvertisementLearn more about our editorial process.AdvertisementRelated ArticlesNovember 4, 2024/NutritionWhat You Need To Know About AlluloseAlthough allulose is an FDA-approved sugar substitute, more research is needed to understand its safetyOctober 29, 2024/Children's HealthRSV vs. Pneumonia: Sorting out Your Child’s Fever and CoughRSV can lead your child to develop pneumonia and have trouble breathingOctober 23, 2024/Cold, Flu & Respiratory IllnessesWhat Is Respiratory Season, and Are You Ready?Getting vaccinated in October can help protect you against severe illness between November and MarchOctober 8, 2024/Mental HealthHands Off!

Jessica Nye, PhD | July 26, 2022 Using a large US claims database, researchers compared the risk for incident AD between patients with and without a prior influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccination reduced the risk for Alzheimer disease (AD) among adults aged 65 years and older, according to study findings published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease. Mounting evidence suggests that systemic immune responses may affect AD risk and/or progression and a range of microorganisms and infectious diseases have been associated with AD risk. Previous studies have linked influenza vaccination with reduced AD risk among veterans and individuals with chronic health conditions. The researchers of the current study hypothesized that the association between vaccination and AD risk is likely similar among the general population. Researchers at the John P and Katherine G McGovern Medical School at UTHealth sourced data for this study from the Optum® Clinformatics® Data Mart. This database contains medical, pharmacy, and administrative claims from individuals with private insurance or Medicare Advantage Part D in the United States. Individuals who were aged 65 years and older as of September 2015 were evaluated for the number of annual influenza vaccines received between September 2009 and August 2015 and related with AD onset between September 2015 and August 2019 using a propensity matching approach. Incident AD was defined as 2 or more AD-related claims. Prior to propensity matching, 1,170,868 individuals were unvaccinated and 1,185,611 received a vaccine. The propensity-matched cohorts comprised 935,887 individuals each. At the beginning of the follow-up period, the unvaccinated and vaccinated cohorts were aged mean 73.7 (standard deviation [SD], 6.3) and 73.7 (SD, 6.0) years, 57.0% and 56.8% were women, and 75.6% and 76.6% were White, respectively. During the follow-up period, there were 79,630 incident AD events in the unvaccinated group and 47,889 in the vaccinated cohort. Vaccination was associated with reduced risk for AD (relative risk [RR], 0.60; 95% CI, 0.59-0.61; absolute risk reduction [ARR], 0.034; 95% CI, 0.033-0.035). In sensitivity analyses, similar results were observed when nonspecific and senile dementia codes were excluded (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.64-0.66; ARR, 0.016; 95% CI, 0.015-0.017) and when all AD and related dementias were included (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.59-0.61; ARR, 0.033; 95% CI, 0.032-0.034). The number of influenza vaccines was significantly related with AD risk (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.74-0.79 per vaccine). This study may have been limited by not including evidence of influenza infection. These data indicated that receiving a vaccine for influenza decreased the risk for developing AD over the next 4 years by 40% among individuals aged 65 years and older. The researchers concluded that “It will be critical for future investigations to clarify which mechanisms underlie the apparent effect of flu vaccination on AD risk, whether age at vaccination moderates the vaccine’s association with AD risk, and whether influenza vaccination also affects rate of progression in patients with MCI [mild cognitive impairment] or AD.” Disclosure: Multiple authors declared affiliations with industry.

A rapid and simple test is needed to confirm infection in suspected cases during disease outbreaks.MethodsIn this study, we developed a reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (RT-RAA) assay for the detection of H5 subtype AIV. Assays were performed at a single temperature (39 °C), and the results were obtained within 20 min.ResultsThe assay showed no cross-detection with Newcastle disease virus or infectious bronchitis virus. The analytical sensitivity was 103 RNA copies/μL at a 95% confidence interval according to probit regression analysis, with 100% specificity. Compared with published reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays, the κ value of the RT-RAA assay in 420 avian clinical samples was 0.983 (p < 0.001). The sensitivity for avian clinical sample detection was 97.26% (95% CI, 89.56–99.52%), and the specificity was 100% (95% CI, 98.64–100%).ConclusionsThese results indicated that our RT-RAA assay may be a valuable tool for detecting H5 subtype AIV. IntroductionInfluenza A virus (IAV), a member of the genus Influenza, family Orthomyxoviridae, contains eight single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments encoding at least 10 proteins [1, 2]. The IAV member avian influenza virus (AIV) can cause avian disease and public health problems. AIV can be classified into highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) and low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) based on pathogenicity in chickens. The current HPAI H5N1 virus outbreak (from 2003 onwards) is, however, unprecedented in scale and geographic distribution, which have been prevalent among poultry in Asia, Europe and Africa. The viruses constantly undergo genetic drift and shift that permanently threatens the poultry industry and human health [3].All LPAIV and HPAIV infections with H5 subtypes in poultry are notifiable to the World Organization for Animal Health [4]. Determination of the subtypes of AIV is of importance for the diagnosis of these infections, which can be achieved by analysis of the amino acid sequence of the cleavage site in the AIV hemagglutinin (HA) gene [5]. Besides, there are many methods, such as restriction enzyme cleavage patterns, probe hybridization and real time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) [5,6,7,8]. Based on the widespread availability of RT-qPCR technology in diagnostic laboratories, it has been used to identify H5 subtype HPAIV of the goose/Guangdong (gs/GD) lineage.Recently, rapid isothermal amplification techniques have been developed, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [7], recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) [8], recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) and strand displacement amplification (SDA) [9], and widely used in clinical detection. Among these rapid nucleic acid detection methods, reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (RT-RAA) is a rapid thermostatic nucleic acid amplification technology that utilizes a recombinant enzyme obtained from bacteria or fungi. At room temperature, the recombinant enzyme can tightly bind to the primer DNA to form polymer. When the primer recognizes the template DNA for a complementary sequence that perfectly matches it, with the help of a single-stranded DNA binding protein, it opens the double-stranded structure of the template DNA under the action of DNA polymerase, a new cDNA strand is formed, and the amplification product grows exponentially [10]. This technology has the characteristics of high sensitivity, stronger specificity and reliability.In order to quickly and simply detect H5 subtype AIV and provide more sufficient preparation time for prevention and control, an RT-RAA assay was designed and its analytical specificity and sensitivity were evaluated in this study. The result suggested that RT-RAA assay meet the need of field testing, and presented a rapid and sensitive detection method that could be used as an alternative to animal inoculation or nucleotide sequencing.Materials and methodsEthics statementThis study was conducted according to the animal welfare guidelines of the World Organization for Animal Health and was approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of the China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center (CAHEC). CAHEC has permission to study the activities of HPAIV. The swab samples were collected after being granted permission by several relevant parties, including the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China, CAHEC, the relevant veterinary sections of the provincial and national governments, and the relevant farm owners.Samples and extraction of viral nucleic acidsAll the nucleic acid of AIVs, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) used in this study were identified in our laboratory (the National Avian Influenza Professional Laboratory in China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center) and were stored at − 80 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant from each sample was used for RNA extraction on the QIAxtractor platform using a cador Pathogen 96 QIAcube HT kit (Qiagen). The extracted RNA was stored at − 80 °C for subsequent tests.Preparation of viral RNA standardAn H5 subtype AIV viral RNA standard was developed using the reference strain A/duck/Yunnan/5310/2006(H5N1) (GenBank accession number CY030889). A 1776-bp fragment of the whole HA gene of H5 subtype AIV was constructed and digested with enzyme. The digested plasmid was purified with DNA recovery kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transcribed in vitro with RNA Production System-T7 kit. The products were extracted and purified by Rneasy MiNi Kit to remove the heteroproteins and various ions in the system. The concentration of cRNA standard transcribed in vitro was accurately measured by Nano Drop nucleic acid quantitative analyzer, and the copy number was calculated. The cRNA standard was continuously diluted with RNase free H2O in tenfold gradient. The sensitivity of the RT-RAA was evaluated by real-time fluorescence detection, using the diluted cRNA standard ranging from 106 to 101 copies/μL.Design of H5 RT-RAA primers and exo-probesTo detect H5 subtype AIV, a total of 4636 available HA gene sequences of H5 subtype AIV obtained from GenBank database were aligned, which contained the HA gene sequence of all currently circulating branches of H5 subtype AIV, and highly conserved regions were subsequently identified with Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software 6.0 [11] for the design the gene-specific primers and probes. Primers were designed using OLIGO 7 software [12] and showed no major nonspecific sequence similarities by BLAST analysis. Three H5 forward primers and five reverse primers were designed to select the best primers and probes in combination. The appropriate primers and probe combination were selected by sequence analysis, which were shown in Table 1. The 30th base at the 5′ end of the probe was labeled with the FAM fluorophore. The 30th base was connected to the abasic site tetrahydrofuran (THF). The 31st base was labeled with the BHQ1 quencher, and the 3′ end was modified by 3′ block. All the primers and probes were synthesized by Sangon Biotech.Table 1 Primer and probe sequences used for RT-RAA and RT-qPCR assaysFull size tableRT-RAA for detection of H5 subtype AIVThe appropriate primers and exo-probes were screened, and the RT-RAA reaction was performed with an RT exo kit in 50 μL reaction mixture including the necessary enzymes and reagents for RT and DNA amplification in lyophilized pellets (Jiangsu Qitian Bio-Tech Co. Ltd.). The reaction mixture contained the following: 2 μL RNA template, 25 μL rehydration buffer, 15.7 μL deionized distilled water, 2.5 μL magnesium acetate, 2.1 μL each primer (10 μM) and 0.6 μL target-specific RT-RAA exo-probe (the probe concentration is 40 ng/μL). For amplification, the tubes were then transferred to a tube holder in an RT-RAA fluorescence detection device (QT-RAA-F7200; Jiangsu Qitian Bio-Tech Co. Ltd.) set at 39 °C for 20 min. Each run included nuclease-free water as a negative control. The results of the RT-RAA interpretation criteria were determined by the slope of amplification curve of the RT-RAA fluorescence detection device (QT-RAA-F7200), the test result is positive when the slope k value was greater than or equal to 20, in addition, the test result is negative.Analytical sensitivity and analytical specificity of RT-RAARecombination plasmid of HA gene of H5 subtype has been constructed using the pEASY™-T5 Zero Cloning Kit. The plasmid was cleaved using a suitable restriction enzyme. The digested plasmid was purified with a DNA recovery kit, the concentration was measured with a Nano Drop nucleic acid quantifier, and then an appropriate amount was taken as a template according to its concentration, and the RNA Production System-T7 kit was used for in vitro transcription. The in vitro transcription products were extracted and purified with the Rneasy MiNi Kit to remove impurities and various ions in the system. Serial tenfold dilutions of known concentrations of in vitro transcribed cRNA standards with RNase Free H2O.A dilution range of H5 subtype HA plasmid standard was used to select the appropriate RAA primers and exo-probe combination. The selected appropriate primers and exo-probes were verified by H5 RT-RAA analysis. To determine the analytical sensitivity of the H5 RT-RAA assay, we detected the H5 subtype AIV molecular RNA standard over a dilution range of 107–101 copies/μL under the optimal RT-RAA conditions, with eight replicates for each dilution.The analytical specificity assay of the RT-RAA for H5 subtype AIV was evaluated using four H5-positive AIVs (one strain in clade 2.3.2.1, one in clade 7, and 55 in clade 2.3.4.4), 10 other subtype AIVs (H1N2, H3N2, H4N2, H6N2, H7N3, H7N9, H9N2, H10N7, H11N9), two NDVs and two IBVs. These viruses are the main respiratory viruses affecting birds and were previously identified by our laboratory. The details of all the viruses tested are listed in Table 2.Table 2 Some information about the samples used for analytical sensitivity and analytical specificity assay in the studyFull size tableDetection and evaluation of clinical samples by H5 RT-RAATo test the efficacy of the method for clinical application, 420 throat and cloacal swabs and tissue samples whose hosts contained chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons and wild birds were collected from 29 live poultry markets and farms in six provinces. Throat and cloacal swabs were immediately placed in 1 mL antibiotic-containing PBS as described above and then stored at − 80 °C until total nucleic acids were extracted with the above viral RNA extraction kit [14]. The tissue samples were sheared and ground after adding PBS, and their supernatants are extracted after centrifugation for nucleic acid extraction. We evaluated the performance of the RT-RAA assay in 420 avian clinical samples and compared it with the published RT-qPCR method for H5 subtype AIV. The primers and probe of the RT-qPCR assay are listed in Table 1 [13]. The RT-qPCR assay was conducted with the One Step PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Takara).Statistical analysisTo determine the RT-RAA detection limit, a probit analysis was performed at a 95% confidence interval (CI), and the κ and p values of RT-qPCR and RT-RAA were calculated [15]. In addition, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of RT-qPCR and RT-RAA for detection in clinical samples of poultry. All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS 21.0 (IBM).ResultsAnalytical sensitivity of RT-RAAThe sequences of the appropriate H5 RT-RAA primers and exo-probe are listed in Table 1. The detection results of RT-RAA sensitivity assay are shown in Fig. 1. The primer and probe combinations designed by the present invention have a cRNA concentration of 106 copies/μL, 105 copies/μL, 104 copies/μL, and 103 copies/μL, 102 copies/μL, 101 copies/μL, a fluorescence amplification curve appears. Therefore, the detection limit of H5 RT-RAA assay was 102 cRNA copies/μL (Table 3, Fig. 1).Fig. 1Analytical sensitivity of the H5 RT-RAA assay. A dilution range from 106 to 101 copies/μL of H5 subtype AIV cRNA was used to evaluate the detection limit of H5 RT-RAA assay. Negative represents negative control. 1–6: 106 copies/μL–101 copies/μL; 7: negative controlFull size imageTable 3 Assay data used for probit analysis to calculate the detection limits of H5 RT-RAAFull size tableAnalytical specificity of RT-RAAThe test group corresponding to the H5 subtype AIV RNA template showed standard fluorescence detection curves, and the other virus test groups and negative control groups did not show amplification curves. Thus, the RT-RAA assay did not crossreact with other subtype AIVs, NDVs and IBVs and demonstrated high specificity for the detection of H5 subtype AIV (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Analytical specificity of the H5 RT-RAA assay. Detection signals were recorded by real-time fluorescence RT-RAA with four samples including H5 subtype AIVs (H5N1, H5N2 and H5N6), while no signals were detected from the 14 samples including other subtype AIVs, NDVs, IBVs and negative controls. 1: K144 (H5N1); 2: QD1 (H5N2); 3: G2324 (H5N6); 4: G2084 (H5N6)Full size imageEvaluation of the RT-RAA for clinical samplesThe 420 conserved avian clinical samples collected from live poultry markets were tested by RT-RAA assay and compared with RT-qPCR. A threshold cycle value of 36 was used as the cut-off for a positive result in RT-qPCR. RT-qPCR detected 73 of the 420 samples as positive (17.38%), while RT-RAA correctly identified and differentiated 71 positive samples, with a sensitivity of 97.26% (95% CI, 89.56–99.52%) and 100% specificity (95% CI, 98.64–100%) (Table 4). The κ value for RT-RAA and RT-qPCR was 0.983 (p < 0.001).Table 4 Detection of H5 subtype AIV in avian clinical samplesFull size tableDiscussionThe frequent variation of AIV antigen increases the difficulty of AIV detection. Among all the AIV subtypes, H5 subtype HPAIV often leads to high morbidity and mortality in poultry. Nowadays, the H5 subtype AIV is widely prevalent and of significant concern to the poultry industry and public health in China. Therefore, early detection of AIV and H5 subtype is necessary in the surveillance and control of AIV outbreaks. Until now, there have been many methods used in AIV detection, such as gold immunochromatographic assay [16], microarray [17], immunosensor [18], immunofluorescence [19] and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [20]. However, many methods require complex and costly devices and are difficult to perform in the field. So far, many detection methods have been used for rapid detection of the AIV in the field, such as nucleic acid sequence amplification [21], RT-LAMP and RT-RPA [22]. Moreover, as the mutation rate of the H5 subtype AIV accelerates, the previous detection methods may not meet the actual detection needs. Some of them fail to subtype AIV, while others cannot be applied in early diagnosis owing to inadequate sensitivity [23], so a rapid diagnostic method capable of detecting all avian influenza epidemic strains is needed.RAA is a novel isothermal amplification and detection assay requiring only 20 min to complete, while RT-qPCR and conventional PCR need longer time. In PCR, thermocycling is required for double-stranded DNA separation, primer binding and amplification. RT-RAA could produce a positive signal in as little as 4 min and be completed in 30 min, at half the cost of RT-qPCR. RAA can be carried out using a portable device with no complicated processes, while the instruments for RT-qPCR and conventional PCR are more expensive. RAA can also use reverse transcriptase and a fluorescent probe system to detect RNA amplicons in real time [17]. Until now, RAA has widely been used for detecting human pathogens, including Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, respiratory syncytial virus, coxsackievirus, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, hepatitis B virus and Schistosoma japonicum-specific gene fragments and there have been no previous reports of the use of RAA for detecting H5 subtype AIV [24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31]. RAA has also been used in the detection of Staphylococcus aureus in milk, African swine fever virus and animal derived ingredients in exported food, such as pigs, cows and chickens [32,33,34,35,36]. However, compared with fluorescence and ordinary PCR, the cost of RT-RAA is relatively high at present.In this study, an H5 RT-RAA assay was created, which indicated the potential value of our method for early detection and rapid diagnosis of the H5 subtype AIV. In the detection of experimental and clinical samples, this method showed higher sensitivity along with high efficiency. RT-qPCR detected 73 of the 420 samples as positive (17.38%), while RT-RAA correctly identified 71 positive samples, with a sensitivity of 97.26% (95% CI, 89.56–99.52%) and 100% specificity (95% CI, 98.64–100%) (Table 4). The κ value for RT-RAA and RT-qPCR was 0.983 (p < 0.001). Moreover, the clinical swab samples detected as positive in RT-RAA were also certified as positive by PCR detection and sequencing. According to the primer/exo-probe design method and the sample detection results, the RT-RAA method was considered to be suitable for detecting almost all H5 subtypes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RT-RAA method for the detection of multiple H5 clades in AIV.In conclusion, the RT-RAA method established in our study quickly and accurately identified H5 subtype AIV, including the current epidemic strains, which meets the need for H5 subtype AIV testing. This RT-RAA is expected to detect emerging H5 subtype AIV rapidly and provide a powerful and valuable tool for the control of H5 subtype AIV.

An understanding of viruses in wild reservoir species across time and space is important to informing surveillance programs, risk models, and potential population impacts for vulnerable species. Although it is recognized that influenza A virus prevalence peaks in reservoir waterfowl in late summer through autumn, temporal and spatial variation across species has not been fully characterized. We combined two large influenza databases for North America and applied spatiotemporal models to explore patterns in prevalence throughout the annual cycle and across the continental United States for 30 waterfowl species. Peaks in prevalence in late summer through autumn were pronounced for dabbling ducks in the genera Anas and Spatula, but not Mareca. Spatially, areas of high prevalence appeared to be related to regional duck density, with highest predicted prevalence found across the upper Midwest during early fall, though further study is needed. We documented elevated prevalence in late winter and early spring, particularly in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. Our results suggest that spatiotemporal variation in prevalence outside autumn staging areas may also represent a dynamic parameter to be considered in IAV ecology and associated risks.

Of particular concern are the financial impacts of IAV to domestic poultry production associated with direct losses, culling and response efforts, and trade restrictions2. There may also be health risks associated with exposure and subsequent spillover of IAV from poultry into humans by direct contact with infected birds and virus-contaminated environments3. Finally, IAV can pose risks to some susceptible wild populations, when highly pathogenic viruses escape from poultry facilities1. Wild waterfowl act as the primary reservoir host of precursor viruses spread to poultry farms and these viruses can ultimately lead to poultry outbreaks4; the distribution and timing of which can be, at least partially, explained by wild duck movements5. Therefore, understanding spatiotemporal as well as taxonomic variation in the prevalence of IAV in wild waterfowl is useful for assessing risk posed to wild birds, the poultry industry, and human health1,6,7, developing effective response strategies4, and better understanding the viral ecology of this agriculturally important pathogen. Extensive research has sought to understand temporal fluctuations in IAV prevalence in wild birds; however, sampling strategies may be hampered by temporal biases in field-collected samples. Numerous studies have shown that prevalence is greatest during the autumn as immunologically naïve juveniles become infected8. Comparatively less work exists outside of this season despite evidence that winter and spring may be important to the underlying viral ecology9,10. Additionally, past work has documented the potential for strong spatial variation11. Specifically, a broad seasonal latitudinal shift is well documented, with areas of comparatively high IAV prevalence shifting to northern latitudes as ducks migrate north during spring migration and occurring at more southern latitudes as ducks migrate back to the southern states during the winter11,12. Less work has examined longitudinal trends, though it is well established that viruses move among both global and North American flyways13,14. Although several studies have examined multiple waterfowl species, and it is generally supported both from field and host challenge studies that dabbling ducks are more susceptible to a wide diversity of IAV compared to other waterfowl taxa15,16, species-specific temporal variation in IAV prevalence remains understudied.The primary objectives for this study were to better understand species-specific and spatiotemporal patterns of IAV prevalence. Here, we combined the two largest North American surveillance datasets, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), National Wild Bird Avian Influenza Surveillance Program (hereafter “USDA”) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Influenza Research Database (hereafter “IRD”), to quantify taxonomic and spatiotemporal trends in IAV prevalence in wild waterfowl. In doing so, we seek to further our understanding of the broad risks posed by this virus, including to domestic poultry production and public health. Such information could be useful to managers seeking to optimize surveillance and improve biosecurity relative to the ecology of IAV in natural reservoir hosts.ResultsOverall, 11.8% of all birds included in the analysis tested positive for IAV (see Table 1 for species summaries). Predicted proportion of birds testing positive for IAV for each species at weekly intervals for each county centroid in the continental United States are available at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) ScienceBase repository17 and are viewable in Supplementary Material 2. As an example, a subset of weekly spatiotemporal predictions for mallard are shown (Fig. 1). The model explained much of the variance in the training dataset (Supplementary Fig. S1 online, R2 = 0.58) and made reasonable predictions for the testing data (Spearman’s rho = 0.57, AUC = 0.77). We found a consistent pattern of elevated IAV detection in the USDA data compared to IRD and some modest variation by biological year (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S2 online).Table 1 Sample sizes for species included in the analysis from the IRD and USDA datasets and raw positivity rates not accounting for seasonal or spatial biases in sampling effort addressed in the provided predictions.Full size tableFigure 1Example of spatiotemporal predictions of IAV prevalence in mallards. The listed weeks roughly correspond to the first week of March and September, highlighting the low levels of IAV prevalence in Spring outside of a relative hot-spot in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, as well as the wide-spread elevated prevalence in fall across the northern latitudes.

Overall, most species show an increase in IAV positivity beginning in late June (~ week 25). For dabbling ducks in the genus Spatula (e.g., northern shoveler) and Anas (e.g., mallard), this peak reaches a maximum in late summer or early autumn (~ weeks 30–35) before declining into the winter. However, dabblers in the genus Mareca (gadwall and American wigeon) exhibited lower peaks in prevalence more comparable to other taxa (e.g., geese and diving ducks). In addition, we inferred a second, albeit generally lower, peak in prevalence during spring in many species (particularly evident in mallard and snow goose), generally occurring around February or March (~ weeks 5–10).Figure 2Percentage of individuals predicted to test positive for IAV (± 95% CI) for each species for each week. Predictions are based on the overall prevalence values in the USDA dataset, which had a higher detection rate, and ignore the spatial component. Circles running along the x-axis indicate the number of samples for each species taken during that week. Estimates for time periods without samples for a given species should be taken with caution as predictions are primarily based on the among-species correlation. Detailed images for each species can be found in Supplementary Material 3.Full size imageWe also document clear spatial variation in IAV prevalence varying by month (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S3 online). Spatially, we found evidence for elevated levels of IAV prevalence across the north-central United States, especially around the Prairie Pothole Region, starting in August and continuing through October. During autumn, areas of elevated prevalence shifted southward as well as into the Great Lakes and Pacific Northwest. Our results also supported elevated prevalence among birds in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley in the spring, particularly in March. Regardless of time of year, we found evidence for the lowest levels of IAV prevalence among wild birds in the southeast, where prevalence appeared to reach a minimum during summer months.Figure 3Monthly realizations of the spatial random field for the continental United States. Brighter colors indicate locations within a month with relatively greater IAV prevalence. Maps were produced in ggplot268. Maps of the standard deviation can be found in Supplementary Fig. S3 online.Full size imageDiscussionIn this investigation, we provide a spatiotemporal model of IAV prevalence for 30 waterfowl species across the annual cycle and for the continental United States using two of the most comprehensive datasets available. These findings improve our understanding of variation in IAV prevalence, which may broadly be useful in assessing risks posed to wildlife, domestic poultry, and public health. This information is also useful in helping to inform management practices aiming to mitigate IAV outbreaks in the United States. Specifically, we confirmed the highest IAV prevalence in many dabbling duck species in the autumn, consistent with prior research15,18,19,20. We also elucidate broad temporal trends in prevalence. Moreover, we found evidence for additional time periods (e.g., spring) and geographic areas (e.g., the Mississippi Alluvial Valley) with increased IAV prevalence, which although lower than the autumn levels, may nevertheless play an important role in maintaining endemic circulation outside the major post-breeding pulse in North America.We found greater IAV prevalence in the USDA dataset compared to IRD, presumably driven by methodological variation. This difference may be caused by the type of laboratory screening method that is used to determine an IAV positive result or possibly by field methods used when capturing waterfowl. Of these possibilities, the most likely may be the difference in detection for real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) as compared to virus isolation (VI) in embryonated chicken eggs, which reflects methodological differences influenced by the sampling objectives for agencies and institutions contributing to the USDA21,22 and IRD23 datasets. While all positive cases in the USDA dataset represent samples that tested positive with rRT-PCR11, positive cases in the IRD dataset may be the result of various methods depending on individual laboratories, sometimes first applying rRT-PCR and sometimes only applying VI, for which the number of positive detections may be lower as this method targets only viable viruses24. Unfortunately, while the type of test used to assess positivity may be submitted to the system, the final publicly available IRD dataset does not allow access to this information, preventing inclusion in our model. It is also possible that some other methodological differences are at play, such as trapping techniques (e.g., hunter harvest vs. baited live captures). That is, sampling of hunter-harvested birds or the capture of individuals via night-lighting may result in lower and less biased prevalence estimates as compared to birds congregating at bait, which can facilitate transmission among birds with increased contact rates25. However, data on sampling technique are generally missing from both datasets and would be useful to include in future efforts.Regardless of the cause of these differences, the IRD and USDA datasets show similar spatial, temporal, and taxonomic trends, with analysis of model residuals showing little evidence of an interaction between dataset and any other explanatory variable (Supplementary Figs. S4, S5 and S6 online). As such, any difference between the two datasets may be one of detection probabilities rather than one that would shape our understanding of the underlying dynamics and thus we have merged these two datasets into one model. That is, both datasets show the same underlying trends, just with prevalence estimates from the USDA dataset being consistently higher than IRD. As differences may be primarily methodological, and the consistency of the USDA dataset leads to greater reproducibility, the predicted values provided in the main manuscript include the coefficient for the USDA dataset. We have also included predicted values using (a) the coefficient for the IRD dataset and (b) using the averaged coefficients for the IRD and USDA datasets in the data release17.We found seasonal variation both among and within species. Overall, most species showed an increase in IAV prevalence in the autumn, a pattern that is well established and consistent with past work15,18,19,20. This pattern is presumably caused by high infection rates among recently fledged, immune-naïve juvenile birds entering the population in late summer and fall8,26. We then see decreased IAV prevalence through the winter as birds, especially juveniles, gain immunity8. This pattern is most pronounced in two genera of dabbling ducks (subfamily Anatinae), Anas and Spatula, where the peak in IAV prevalence is higher and lasts over a longer period than other species. Past work has shown elevated risk and prevalence of IAV in dabbling ducks, and this pattern has been linked to differences in foraging behavior15,27,28 but could also be caused by other differences in exposure or immune response16,29,30. Notably, and potentially evidence against the foraging behavior hypothesis, this pattern was not observed in both Mareca species, which are imbedded between Anas and Spatula within the larger dabbling-duck phylogeny31,32, and is consistent with past findings of lower prevalence in gadwall33,34. As such, we recommend additional research of IAV prevalence, exposure, and immune response among birds of different genera within Anatinae to uncover drivers of infection patterns.Our results also provide evidence for a smaller peak of increased IAV prevalence for many species in late winter and early spring, typically between January and April, although the exact timing varies by species. Most past work notes only an autumn increase in prevalence11, with low levels of infection persisting year-round10,20. However, surveillance during February in a single Texas county in 2001–2002 did document an elevated prevalence of IAV35 consistent with our findings. There are several potential causes for this spring increase, including changes in circulating subtypes9,12 to which ducks may lack immunity36 or a decline in the strength of immune response after the autumn peak37. Alternatively, this pattern may be linked to spring migration either due to physical stress depressing the immune response or large congregations of ducks at staging areas increasing transmission; an explanation further bolstered by recent findings of modestly elevated prevalence rates in migrating teal along the Gulf Coast38.Though we did not find clear differences in IAV prevalence among flyways, with areas of high and low prevalence within each, we did find spatiotemporal variation. Although not tested here, these spatiotemporal trends may be related to regional duck densities and distributions. From August through October, during the period of the highest IAV prevalence, we see increased infections across the north-central United States. This is generally consistent with the areas of the greatest duck population densities within the United States during early autumn39. As autumn progresses, we see these areas of highest prevalence shift to the south, presumably with duck migration, as well as into the Pacific Northwest and Great Lakes regions where large populations of ducks congregate40. As such, it appears that patterns in IAV prevalence, at least at large spatial scales, may be related to duck density, which presumably increases viral transmission rates41. However, testing this specifically will require further work, especially to elucidate if the distributions of specific species drive this overall spatial trend.Interestingly, though reported sampling efforts and overall IAV infections are generally low during the spring, we also see recurring elevated prevalence in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley in Arkansas during this period. The exact cause of this is unclear, however we offer several potential hypotheses that may explain this observation. First, this is a region of particularly high densities of wintering ducks, especially mallards42, though this peak occurs in March after many of these birds have departed for spring migration43. It is possible that viruses shed into the water from the previous season persist44,45, causing infections in the remaining birds and/or spring migrants arriving from farther south, especially as IAV presence in sediment is closely related to waterfowl density46. The arrival of spring migrants may also be associated with the dispersal of virus strains northward from wintering grounds in the Neotropics, potentially exposing birds in this region to strains for which they lack immunity5,12,47. Regardless of the ultimate cause, this peak in viral prevalence within the Mississippi Alluvial Valley may play some role in maintaining viral diversity in the United States10,26,48. Moreover, as the geographic coverage of sampling during this period is limited (Fig. 4), increased geographic coverage may shed light on other potential areas of elevated prevalence in spring.Figure 4Sampling effort by month for both the USDA national surveillance program and the NIAID Influenza Research Database (IRD) datasets and map of the waterfowl flyways. USDA provides greater coverage across the continental United States as sampling was stratified by flyway and watershed. The majority of IRD sampling events are located either in the Mississippi (M) and Central (C) Migratory Flyways, California and Alaska in the Pacific (P) Migratory Flyway, and Maine and Delaware in the Atlantic (A) Flyway. However, IRD adds greatly to the total sample coverage during the spring lull in sampling effort. Maps were produced in ggplot268.Full size imageLarge amounts of the data in both datasets were not designed to assess prevalence. The USDA data were originally collected for early detection of potentially highly pathogenic viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes21,22. In contrast, though the overarching goal of the IRD dataset is to forecast pandemic potential and effort was spent on all 16 HA subtypes, the specific goals behind data collection varied by research group23. In general, large sections of both datasets were collected to maximize the number of detections, creating biases related to when and where samples were collected and generating temporal and spatial autocorrelation that if ignored would lead to an over estimation of IAV prevalence. We dealt with these biases within the model by including two spatiotemporal components. To handle biases at large spatial scales as well as to assess how prevalence varies across time and space, we included a spatiotemporal stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) model based on a continuous Gaussian random field. To handle smaller scale spatial variation, such as specific choices of locations to sample, we included an effect of county, accounting for a lack of independence for birds sampled from the same locations. The inclusion of county prevented the SPDE component from overfitting the data and greatly improved overall model fit. Temporal biases in data collection are also confounded with potential species differences, with some species lacking sampling data from certain time periods. As species are likely not fully independent from each other, we included both a phylogenetic random effect and a correlated temporal species effect49, which is able to pull statistical power and information for a species that is poorly sampled at a given time from other species with more samples. In short, this method both improved model fit and allowed for justifiable predictions during periods of low sampling. There was also the potential for an interaction between bird species and the spatial components; however, this appears to not be the case as during model validation we found no evidence of significant residual spatial autocorrelation by species and thus excluded this from the model.Despite our handling of spatiotemporal autocorrelations, it should be noted that there was generally less data, especially for some species, during the late winter and spring (Fig. 4). Consequently, spatial predictions are less informative during this time of year. Moreover, though our model assumes some correlation among species, it is possible that some of the under-sampled species may experience unique patterns during periods when data are missing (Fig. 2). As such, we would recommend caution when making inferences for species during times that they were not sampled. Moreover, as we document both a spring resurgence in several species and relatively high IAV rates in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley during this time, our results provide rationale for increased winter and spring sampling, especially in areas of high duck density, to both monitor outbreaks and better understand viral ecology.Additionally, several weaknesses exist from potentially important missing variables that we were unable to include in the model. First, though we know susceptibility to IAV varies by age, with immuno-naïve juveniles being more susceptible8, we lacked data on the age as well as sex for most birds. Secondly, we lack detailed data on trapping and collection methods. Many birds in both datasets were sampled from hunter harvest, while others were collected through techniques using baited sites, such as swim-in traps or rocket netting11,23. The elevated local duck densities caused by congregations of birds around bait stations may have artificially increased rates of IAV transmission when birds were collected with these methods25. As such, it is possible that we overestimated IAV prevalence in some places, particularly outside of hunting seasons. Notably, this does not appear to be the case for the samples from the Mississippi Alluvial Valley in spring. Though some birds may have been baited, the reported numbers captured at a given time were small, indicating that densities were not artificially increased from this method, and we also see an increased prevalence in some known hunter-harvested birds in this time and place.In conclusion, our modelling efforts confirmed previous reports of waterfowl species, times of year, and geographic areas with elevated IAV prevalence that may be useful in future efforts aiming to identify areas of probable viral spillover from wild birds to poultry and to ultimately mitigate the risks of IAV outbreaks among domestic birds and human populations. In addition to supporting a peak in IAV infections during the late summer and early autumn in many dabbling duck species, we also found evidence for a secondary, smaller peak in IAV infections during the spring. Furthermore, we identified potentially important geographic areas of increased prevalence during the annual cycle. As such, future research on IAV in waterfowl would benefit from including sampling throughout the full annual cycle to confirm the inferences derived from this study, as time periods outside the well-established autumn peak may be important for understanding overall viral ecology. Moreover, the underlying drivers of many of the patterns we identify remain unresolved, and future research may be helpful for clarifying their behavioral, physiological, and evolutionary origins.MethodsDatasetsData on IAV prevalence came from two national-scale surveillance datasets. The first of these is from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), National Wild Bird Surveillance Program11,21, and sought to maximize detections of positive birds for early detection of pathogenic strains. Sampling, stratified by administrative flyways and species, was conducted from 2007–2011 and 2015–2019. Birds were tested with both an oropharyngeal and a cloacal swab, which were added to a single cryovial containing brain–heart infusion media. Samples were tested at National Animal Health Laboratory Network facilities for IAV by rRT-PCR50,51.The second dataset is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Influenza Research Database23,52 (IRD; www.flubd.org), which is a publicly available database containing IAV surveillance data from many different academic labs. We downloaded all waterfowl surveillance data on June 15, 2021 that was collected from 2007 to 2019. Labs that contributed data to IRD use a variety of screening methods to detect IAV in samples, including rRT-PCR and VI. Protocols for collecting swabs also varied among labs that deposited data. Most birds were sampled with either cloacal and/or oropharyngeal swabs, though other sample types were also collected (e.g., fecal or tissue), with some birds sampled using multiple methods. We attempted to account for methodological variation by including the number of swabs taken from each bird as a variable in the model. However, we found that the effect was both negligible and insignificant, and it was removed from the final model.After observing similar trends in the raw data for both the IRD and USDA datasets (Supplementary Figs. S7, S8 and S9 online), we combined data from both databases for the continental United States. While developing models to include Canada was desired, the long-term data set did not have spatial and temporal coverage sufficient for creating robust predictions at our current model scale and thus were not included. Taxonomically, we included all Anseriformes species with more than 550 individuals sampled – excluding hybrids, captives, or domestics – leaving 30 species. In total, this included 292,230 and 114,569 samples from the USDA and IRD datasets respectively. Due to variation in spatial precision within the two datasets, we aggregated all data to county using latitude and longitude coordinates and TIGER/Line files from the U.S. Census (www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-filesime-series/geoiger-line-file.html), reassigning geographic coordinates based on county centroids (Fig. 1, Supplementary Figs. S10, S11 and S12 online).To better reflect the annual cycle, we replaced calendar year with “biological year” commencing each June 1. Previous studies have used a cutoff date of April 1 to align with the start of mallard breeding in the Prairie Pothole Region11,18,53. However, our study considered a larger geographic area encompassing the continental United States. Moreover, in examining the raw data, we found that this date falls during a period of elevated prevalence in some species, including mallard. Instead, we chose to use a cutoff of June 1, which is near the center of an extended period each year with low IAV prevalence, to prevent the year variable breaking in the middle of a period experiencing increased prevalence.Statistical analysisTo quantify the probability of a bird testing positive for IAV, we fit a Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal model with a correlated species-specific temporal latent effect using integrated nested Laplace approximation54 (INLA) with R-INLA version 20.10.12–1. This is a Bayesian approximation method for estimating latent Gaussian models that is computationally efficient, making it ideal for the analysis of large, spatiotemporal datasets. We pooled data by all prediction variables (dataset, biological year, month, week, county, species) to set up a binned-binomial regression model, with 25% of the binned data randomly withheld from model training as a testing dataset. This model estimates the probability of a bird testing positive for IAV (y) with a binomial likelihood and logit link55 that can be expressed as,$$y\sim binomial\;\left( {n,\pi } \right)$$ (1) $$logit\left( \pi \right) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \cdot Dataset + \beta_{2} \cdot f_{y} Year + \beta_{3} \cdot f_{c,m} County + \omega_{l,m} + \psi_{w,s} + \varphi_{s}$$ (2) where β0 is the intercept, β1 is a fixed effect for which dataset the data came from, and β2∙fyYear is an independent and identically distributed (iid) latent effect accounting for variation in IAV prevalence by biological year.The model contained two spatiotemporal components designed to handle spatiotemporal autocorrelation at different spatial scales. The first, β3∙fc,mCounty, is an iid effect of county (c) that varies across months (m) based off of a cyclic first-order autoregressive (ar1) model56 to account for the cyclic nature of the annual cycle and to allow for a correlation between adjacent months. This effect is intended to handle small-scale spatial autocorrelation, such as that derived from differences in methods between labs or choices of specific sampling sites. Secondly, ωl,m is a spatially structured latent effect of the correlation between location (l) and month (m) modeled as a cyclic ar1 model with the same temporal realizations using an SPDE approach57 and is intended to quantify large-scale spatial variation. The SPDE method allows for efficiently computing large spatial models and quantifies continuous spatial autocorrelations. It uses a continuous Gaussian random field constructed with a three-dimensional triangular mesh which had 8202 nodes, comparable to studies at similar spatial scales39,58, and was projected onto a three-dimensional sphere scaled to one Earth radius. The temporal effect of these spatial models is at the level of month instead of week to maintain sufficient data in each temporal realization to inform the spatial field.The model also contained a correlated species-specific latent effect (ψw,s) quantifying weekly (w) variation among species (s). The effect of week was included as a cyclic ar1 model, and was set up to generate a separate, but correlated, trend for each species. This was done as there were strong temporal biases in the data with many species missing data for certain parts of the year, leading to poor model predictions when we considered species as completely independent. However, due to similar physiology and phenology, as well as the ability to transmit IAV among each other48, we expected some level of correlation among species. To account for this, we used correlated stratum-specific smoothing priors49, which allow for better predictions when data is missing by pulling statistical power from other species based on the among-species correlation.Additionally, as more closely related species may have more similar immune responses and physiology, we included a random phylogenetic effect (\({\varphi }_{s}\)) as a precision matrix. We downloaded 10,000 samples from the posterior distribution of the phylogenetic hypothesis available at BirdTree59 (www.birdtree.org) for all Anseriformes to generate an ultrametric consensus tree60. This tree was then used to generate a variance–covariance matrix using the package ape61 using a Brownian motion model, where the diagonal represents the root-to-tip distance and the off-diagonal elements represent the shared branch length between two species. This variance–covariance matrix was subset to only include the species considered here. The matrix was then standardized by dividing it by the determinant raised to the power of 1/Nspecies62 and inverted into a precision matrix63. We also tested a model that allowed for an interaction between the phylogenetic effect and week of year; however, this model received less support (Δlog(Σ CPO) = 144), and was removed from further consideration. We used penalized complexity (pc) priors for all correlation terms, which are robust priors designed to penalize the model for any deviations from a simpler base model in support of Occam’s razor. Pc priors for the spatial effect64 were specified so that the spatial range had a 0.5 probability of falling within one half the radius of the earth (ρ0 = 1, pρ = 0.5) and reasonable standard deviation (σ0 = 1, ασ = 0.01), which was intended to be non-informative. All temporal autocorrelation terms as well as the among-species correlation used the same pc priors (μ = 0, α = 0.9) where the base model for the correlation is ρ = 156,65. All other components used INLA’s default priors54. Model checkingStatistical inference was based on means and 95% credible intervals of the posterior distributions. We measured goodness of fit using a coefficient of determination (R2) based on a regression of the posterior predictive distribution against the observed values, weighted by the number of samples in the binned data (n)58. We performed out-of-sample cross validation by computing Spearman’s correlation, again weighted by n, between the training and test datasets using the package wCorr66 and used the package PresenceAbsence67 to calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve. Finally, we generated model predictions of the probability of a bird testing positive for IAV for each species at the county level in weekly intervals. These predictions were generated by averaging the year effect across all years, and we scaled the results to the overall prevalence in the USDA dataset because of the consistency of its methods, though values for IRD and the two datasets averaged together are provided in the data release. It should be noted that as all species shared a common spatial field, we did not choose to mask the geographic regions outside of species’ ranges, and thus predictions do exist for locations beyond a species’ natural range.

Dr. Jon Enyart examines a raven at Project Wildlife. (Spectrum News/Bree Steffen) Animal rescue groups prepare for avian influenza to reach SoCal By Bree Steffen San Diego UPDATED 2:57 PM PT Jul. 29, 2022 PUBLISHED 5:00 AM PT Jul. 29, 2022 PUBLISHED 5:00 AM PDT Jul. 29, 2022 SHARE SAN DIEGO â A highly contagious disease first detected in wild birds on the East Coast has reached California, and Southern California animal organizations and rescues are now trying to protect their flocks. Justin Brackett is the curator of birds for SeaWorld San Diego. He said they are watching for any signs of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. Avian influenza (also known as âbird fluâ) occurs mainly in birds and is highly contagious. It is caused by viruses that occur naturally among wild birds. The highly pathogenic variants are potentially deadly to many species of domestic and wild birds â and sometimes mammals. Brackett said they are increasing biosecurity measures at SeaWorld to try to protect their birds, such as their beloved flamingos and their iconic penguins. Theyâre also making preparations in case they need to relocate their flamingos to an enclosed location to prevent contact with wild birds that fly into their outdoor habitat. âIf avian influenza is detected in areas closer to our park, then weâll have to move these birds into areas that are enclosed. Because you always have things, like the Igrit, that are going to come in and steal food, and thereâs really no way to prevent that other than enclosing your exhibit,â Brackett said. âOnce we get to a point where we shut down those areas, guests will no longer be able to come back and participate in penguin tours. The birds will still be visible because theyâre in a protected and controlled environment, but weâll no longer have those kind of one-on-one interactions.â The flu has not been detected in San Diego County but has been spreading across the U.S. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife confirmed the Highly Pathogenic Eurasian H5N1 Avian Influenza had been detected in three wild birds found in Colusa and Glenn counties. Dr. Jon Enyart is the director of Project Wildlife, a program that is part of the San Diego Humane Society, that helps injured, orphaned and sick wildlife.. The nearest case of avian flu might still be hundreds of miles away, but heâs already implemented strict biosecurity measures at their facility. âFor three months or so, we were just watching it fill up the Midwest and then creep toward the Rockies,â Enyart said. âItâs extremely devastating to these birds, and itâs really sad.â Enyart said Project Wildlife takes in about 14,000 wild animals a year and close to 70% are birds. âWe get goosebumps and think, âOK, whatâs going to happen here? How do we handle this?â But thatâs what the biosecurity protocols are for, thatâs why we work so hard right now,â Enyart said. âItâs not here yet, but we are diligently trying to get things in place for when it does show up, so weâre prepared. This is a very long drill that weâre doing right now.â Related Stories Beloved monarch butterflies now listed as endangered SeaWorld surpasses 40,000 animal rescues Audit: California too slow to fix contaminated water systems OC supervisors approve settlement in oil spill response Enyart encourages everyone to keep watch for any wild birds exhibiting flu-like symptoms so they can stay ahead of the sickness. âJust having people out there being sentinels for us and being just able to look out and say, âHey, I saw this duck at Lake Murray, it looked funny,â and telling someone about it,â Enyart said. âMy hope is just that our preparation is going to pay off and that we can keep it out of our building.â Brackett believes itâs a matter of âwhenâ the avian influenza reaches San Diego. He urges guests who visit SeaWorld to avoid wearing any shoes or clothing that have been worn around other fowl, like backyard chickens or other pet birds. âWe have to strike a balance between the safety concerns related to avian influenza and keeping our birds in a housing area that theyâre familiar and comfortable,â Brackett said. Sightings of sick and dead wild birds may be reported to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife through an online form. Do not handle sick or dead wildlife. If it is necessary to do so, itâs recommended to wear impermeable gloves, use an inverted plastic bag, or a shovel or other implement. Afterwards, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and change clothes before having contact with domestic or pet birds. Experts also recommend dumping out bird baths to discourage large groups of birds from congregating.

Claims to the contrary are nothing more than myths.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyThe problem, though? While science clearly says one thing about influenza vaccines, various people in your life may offer a different opinion. So, let’s talk facts about the flu shot with infectious disease expert Kristin Englund, MD.Does the flu shot contain an active flu virus?The answer is no. Flu vaccines given through a shot in the arm are made with either inactivated (or killed) viruses or with only a single protein from the flu virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Neither the inactivated virus nor the single protein will cause the flu, according to the CDC.“You can’t get the flu from a flu vaccine,” says Dr. Englund. “I know that’s always one of the big concerns. But we’re not giving you a live virus, so you can’t get the flu from it.”What about the nasal spray flu vaccine?The nasal spray flu vaccine includes a live influenza virus that has been weakened so that it won’t cause an illness, reports the CDC.Use of the nasal spray is more limited that the traditional flu shot. The spray vaccine is approved for healthy, non-pregnant people aged 2 to 49. People with weakened immune systems or chronic conditions (heart, lung or kidney disease) shouldn’t get the nasal spray flu vaccine.Why do some people feel sick after getting a flu shot?It is possible that a flu shot leaves you with flu-like symptoms. Some people may get a mild fever, a headache or feel fatigued. Consider that a sign that your body is responding to the vaccine.AdvertisementThe flu vaccine, after all, is really just a way of tricking your body into thinking it has the flu. That causes it to make the antibodies that will eventually protect you if you’re exposed to the virus, explains Dr. Englund.“So actually, a few side effects can be a good thing,” she says. “It’s a sign your body is doing exactly what it should be doing.”And the really good news? Flu shot symptoms — including soreness at the site of the shot — typically disappear within 24 hours to 48 hours. “That’s a lot less than what you’d be dealing with if you really got influenza,” notes Dr. Englund.Can the flu vaccine cause an allergic reaction?A severe allergic reaction to a flu shot is extremely rare. A 2016 study found between 1.35 and 1.83 cases of anaphylaxis (an allergy to the shot) per million influenza vaccines delivered.Does the flu shot really work?A flu shot definitely offers a layer of protection against the virus. Annual CDC studies typically show the flu vaccine to be between 40% and 60% effective at keeping influenza infections at bay.And even if you get sick from the flu, vaccination can reduce your risk of more serious complications and hospitalization.Dr. Englund advises getting your flu shot as soon as possible to offer protection during flu season, which occurs in the fall and winter in the United States. Activity typically peaks during and after the holidays.“Influenza vaccines have been around for many, many decades and are exceptionally safe,” reassures Dr. Englund. “We know that they save lives. So, it’s tremendously important to get your flu shot to protect yourself and those around you.”AdvertisementLearn more about our editorial process.AdvertisementRelated ArticlesOctober 29, 2024/Children's HealthRSV vs. Pneumonia: Sorting out Your Child’s Fever and CoughRSV can lead your child to develop pneumonia and have trouble breathingOctober 23, 2024/Cold, Flu & Respiratory IllnessesWhat Is Respiratory Season, and Are You Ready?Getting vaccinated in October can help protect you against severe illness between November and MarchOctober 8, 2024/Mental HealthHands Off!

The strain, known as Eurasian H5N1, was discovered earlier this month in a non-commercial flock of 40 domestic birds in Carson City. The affected birds were culled and did not enter the food system, but Nevadans — especially those who own or work with poultry — should stay vigilant for signs of sickness in wild and domestic birds. Avian influenzas naturally occur in wild aquatic birds around the world and can circulate among those birds, often with little or no signs of illness and low mortality rates. Dabbling ducks in particular, such as the mallard, are considered reservoirs for avian influenza because they are often asymptomatic for the illness. The issue arises when waterfowl spread the flu to more susceptible birds, like chickens, turkeys and raptors. In these vulnerable birds, highly pathogenic avian influenza can cause mortality rates of 90 to 100 percent, often within 48 hours. But because avian influenza is highly infectious and many wild birds can serve as a host for the flu without severe symptoms, managing the spread of the disease is difficult. “There’s not a lot that we can do on the wildlife side of things,” said Dr. Nate LaHue, wildlife veterinarian for the Nevada Department of Wildlife. “It would have to involve culling large amounts of waterfowl, which is not a practical response.” Birds can easily shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions and feces, so any bird that comes into contact with an infected bird is at serious risk of infection. Birds can also become infected if they come into contact with any surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus by other birds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that over 40 million domestic birds have been affected by the current outbreak, and bird flu has been detected in almost 1,900 wild birds across the U.S. since late 2021. LaHue said that migratory birds probably brought the disease to North America and that’s part of why it’s spread so quickly. Currently, there are 44 states in which the current bird flu strain has been detected in wild birds and 38 states that have had avian influenza outbreaks among poultry. Even though there have been no confirmed cases of avian influenza in wild birds thus far in Nevada, LaHue said it’s likely that the influenza is already in the state’s wildlife population. The wildlife department is investigating several suspicious raptor deaths, and LaHue said that at least one death, an owl, is likely tied to the current strain of avian influenza. The Department of Wildlife also says that even though most infections have occurred in domestic birds or wild birds like waterfowl, game birds and scavengers like crows, people should consider all birds as susceptible. LaHue said there have been large die-offs of some species of geese and cormorants as a result of outbreaks around the country. Eurasian H5N1 has also been detected in mammals such as foxes, coyotes and bobcats, and the wildlife department said that “all mammals should be considered potentially susceptible.” Humans are one of those potentially susceptible mammals. But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization say that the current strain of bird flu poses little threat to the general public. To date, there’s been only one reported case of a person contracting the current virus strain in the U.S. That individual was directly exposed to infected poultry as part of a culling operation and has fully recovered. Nevertheless, the Nevada Department of Agriculture has issued a list of biosecurity measures for people who work with birds so that they can protect themselves and their flocks from avian influenza. LaHue advised poultry owners to take steps to reduce the amount of contact between domestic and wild birds, and he cautioned the public against doing things like feeding waterfowl, which can cause the birds to artificially congregate and potentially increase transmission. Although symptoms of avian influenza can vary widely, people should be aware of any respiratory or neurologic abnormalities in birds, as well as any skin-related issues, diarrhea or discolored feces, weakness, lethargy and depression. Additionally, the state Department of Wildlife is currently tracking bird flu outbreaks. If you notice three or more wild bird deaths, any single raptor death, or any bird showing respiratory or neurologic abnormalities, you should report it to the agency at (775) 688-1500 or ndowinfo@ndow.org.

Little is known, however, about the effects of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy on noncancer immune responses in humans. To investigate this question, we examined the impact of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy on the Tfh–B cell axis responding to unrelated viral antigens. Following influenza vaccination, a subset of adults receiving anti-PD-1 had more robust circulating Tfh responses than adults not receiving immunotherapy. PD-1 pathway blockade resulted in transcriptional signatures of increased cellular proliferation in circulating Tfh and responding B cells compared with controls. These latter observations suggest an underlying change in the Tfh–B cell and germinal centre axis in a subset of immunotherapy patients. Together, these results demonstrate dynamic effects of anti-PD-1 therapy on influenza vaccine responses and highlight analytical vaccination as an approach that may reveal underlying immune predisposition to adverse events.

PD-1 (CD279) expressed on T cells during activation and exhaustion is the most common target of cancer immunotherapy1. Blockade of PD-1 signaling using anti-PD-1 or anti-Programmed Death-Ligand1 (anti-PD-L1) immunotherapy has been associated with improved survival or cure in several different types of malignancies, in part due to the reinvigoration of exhausted CD8 T cells2. However, PD-1 is expressed by other immune cells including Tfh that provide help to B cells in the germinal centre (GC), thereby enabling affinity-matured, long-lived antibody responses3,4. Indeed, Tfh cells in secondary lymphoid tissue have high PD-1 expression in humans3,5,6,7. Little is known, however, about the effects of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy on Tfh or on related events including the outcomes of Tfh–B cell interactions and GC-dependent immune responses. Moreover, approximately 50% of patients on anti-PD-1 immunotherapy develop immune-related adverse events (irAEs)8,9,10,11. At least some of these irAEs have been postulated to be linked to autoreactive humoral responses12,13,14, but precise mechanisms remain poorly defined. Thus, there is a need to better understand the immunological effects of anti-PD-1 on parts of the immune system not directly related to the on-tumor effects.The main goal of immunotherapy for cancer or other diseases is to treat the tumour or affected tissue or system. As a result, the impact of immunotherapies on immune responses unrelated to disease have received less attention. For example, the Tfh–B cell axis is central for vaccine responses, yet the effects of anti-PD-1 therapy on vaccine-induced Tfh and humoral responses have not been extensively studied in humans. Indeed, examining immune responses to vaccine antigens in the setting of PD-1 blockade may provide insights into the function of PD-1 in the ‘normal’ immune system and potentially reveal new opportunities to improve vaccination or understand the role of the PD-1 pathway in other diseases. A small number of studies have evaluated influenza vaccines, mainly for safety or serology in the setting of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy15,16,17,18,19,20. However, no information exists on how perturbing the PD-1 pathway in humans impacts Tfh responses to vaccination or the Tfh–B cell axis responsible for generating high-quality antibodies.To examine these questions, we used influenza vaccination in human patients with cancer to directly investigate the effects of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy on Tfh and B cell responses to noncancer antigens. Specifically, we examined responses of the circulating subset of PD-1+ CXCR5+ CD4 cells, termed circulating Tfh (cTfh), which share phenotypic and functional characteristics of lymphoid Tfh5,21,22,23,24,25. These studies demonstrate that anti-PD-1 treatment was associated with more robust vaccine-induced cTfh responses and increased proliferation of responding cTfh and B cells including antibody secreting cells (ASCs). Mechanistically, this increased cTfh and ASC proliferation was coupled to reduced transcriptional signatures of cytokine signaling including IL-2/STAT5 in cTfh and TNF/NFkB in ASCs. These anti-PD-1-induced changes in vaccine-responding cTfh and B cells were associated with greater increase in titer but lower affinity and lower sialylation of neutralizing influenza-specific antibodies compared with those not receiving immunotherapy. Increases in serum CXCL13 following vaccination in the presence of anti-PD-1 implicated altered GC activity. Finally, although vaccination does not provoke immunotherapy-associated complications17, a subset of participants with robust changes in cTfh were enriched for previous (or future) irAEs associated with immunotherapy, suggesting an underlying change in Tfh–B cell, humoral and/or GC activity. This latter observation points to a potential common signature or baseline immune state altered by PD-1 that impacts vaccination and autoreactivity. Moreover, these studies highlight the potential to use analytical vaccination to detect these changes, possibly identifying patients with higher likelihood for irAEs. Together, these data demonstrate that anti-PD-1 immunotherapy has broad effects on the Tfh–B cell axis with major implications for vaccination, humoral responses and changes in baseline immune health.ResultsAnti-PD-1 is associated with increased cellular responses to vaccinationAnti-PD-1 immunotherapy with nivolumab or pembrolizumab is given over months or even years1 with the intention of enhancing the immune response to cancer. The effects of long-term disruption of the PD-1 pathway on immune responses to other antigens including humoral responses to vaccines that involve PD-1-expressing Tfh remain poorly understood. To address this question, we enrolled adults with renal cell carcinoma or urothelial carcinoma who were receiving immunotherapy (Cohort 1; Supplementary Table 1) and were due to receive seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine. Participants were divided into two groups: non-anti-PD-1-based therapy (n = 10, median age = 65) or anti-PD-1-based therapy (n = 29, median age = 71.5). Given the importance of Programmed Death-Ligand 2 signaling in the humoral response26,27, we considered participants who received anti-Programmed Death-Ligand 1 as members of the non-anti-PD-1 group. In a second, independently generated cohort at a different institution, we enrolled adults with melanoma receiving immunotherapy (n = 30, median age = 61.5) and healthy adults not receiving immunotherapy (n = 27, median age = 33) (Cohort 2; Supplementary Table 2). Participants received influenza vaccination on the same day as immunotherapy infusion (median of cycle 12 of anti-PD-1 for Cohort 1 and cycle 7 for Cohort 2; Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Blood was drawn on the day of vaccination (baseline), 1 week later and again 3–6 weeks after vaccination (late) (Extended Data Fig. 1a), as has been done previously21,22,25,28.In healthy adults, CXCR5+ PD-1+ cTfh expressing the activation markers Inducible Costimulator (ICOS, CD278) and CD38 expand 1 week after influenza vaccination and this population contains influenza-specific CD4 T cells25. We therefore first asked whether anti-PD-1 immunotherapy alters the cTfh response to the vaccine. To avoid bias of using PD-1 itself in detection of cTfh due to treatment with therapeutic anti-PD-1 antibodies, we used a broader definition of non-naive CXCR5+ CD4 T cells that coexpressed ICOS and CD38 (ICOS+CD38+ cTfh) to identify responding cTfh in this study (Extended Data Fig. 1c–e). Following vaccination in Cohort 1, there was a 2.6-fold-induction of ICOS+CD38+ cTfh in patients with cancer receiving anti-PD-1 compared with a 1.1-fold-change in patients with cancer on therapies other than anti-PD-1 (P = 0.013, Wilcoxon test; Fig. 1b), demonstrating that anti-PD-1 therapy is associated with augmented cTfh responses to influenza vaccination.Fig. 1: Anti-PD-1 treatment is associated with enhanced cTfh, B cell and GC responses following influenza vaccination.a, cTfh were profiled for expression of ICOS and CD38 at baseline and at 1 week after influenza vaccine in Cohort 1. b, ICOS+CD38+ cTfh fold-change at 1 week in Cohort 1 (P = 0.01, two-sided Wilcoxon test; anti-PD-1 (n = 18) versus non-anti-PD-1 (n = 7)). c, Patients with melanoma were recruited in Cohort 2 and profiled following influenza vaccination. cTfh responses shown at baseline and 1 week. d, ICOS+CD38+ cTfh fold-change at 1 week compared with baseline in Cohort 2 (P = 0.05, two-sided Wilcoxon test; anti-PD-1 (n = 20) versus healthy (n = 27)). e, Plasmablast responses after influenza vaccination in Cohort 2. f, Kendall correlation between plasmablasts and ICOS+CD38+ cTfh at 1 week for Cohorts 1 and 2. g, Plasma CXCL13 over time (P = 2 × 10−3 for anti-PD-1 at 1 week compared with baseline, two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test).

HC, healthy controls; TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor.Source dataFull size imageWe examined an independent cohort of patients with melanoma receiving anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (Cohort 2; Supplementary Table 1). Again, anti-PD-1 therapy was associated with more robust increases in cTfh responses compared with healthy control participants 1 week after vaccination (P = 0.05, Wilcoxon test), with responses returning to baseline by the late time point (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1f–h). We also confirmed that using PD-1 in the definition of cTfh resulted in similar observations (Extended Data Fig. 1i–k). The increase in the cTfh response was not associated with more recent initiation of anti-PD-1 therapy (Extended Data Fig. 1l) and was unlikely to be due to age-related differences between participants (Extended Data Fig. 1m,n). Further subsetting based on CCR6 and CXCR3, as described previously23, did not identify differences between treatment groups (Extended Data Fig. 1o). Finally, we considered other regulators of the B cell response. In particular, T follicular regulatory cells (Tfr) phenotypically resemble Tfh but express Foxp3 and can regulate Tfh–B cell interactions29. There was a greater decrease in the frequency of circulating Tfr (cTfr) in the anti-PD-1-treated participants than in the healthy adults in Cohort 2 (Extended Data Fig. 1p–r). However, this change could reflect dilution of cTfr by the ICOS+CD38+ CXCR5+ cTfh or perhaps be due to altered kinetics. Given the structure of the study, it was not possible to assess cTfh and cTfr responses at different time points. Nonetheless, these data indicate that anti-PD-1 treatment was associated with an augmented numerical response of cTfh in a subset of patients 1 week after influenza vaccination.We next asked if the B cell response to vaccination was affected by anti-PD-1 therapy. Although the plasmablast frequency was not higher in the anti-PD-1 group following vaccination, there was a subset of anti-PD-1 participants with robust induction of plasmablasts 1 week after vaccination, (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2a–d). Correlations have been observed previously between plasmablast and cTfh responses to influenza vaccination22,25. Here, the plasmablast response correlated with ICOS+CD38+ cTfh responses 1 week after vaccination in the anti-PD-1 group in both cohorts (Fig. 1f). These data suggest that anti-PD-1 therapy alters Tfh–B cell interactions, likely in secondary lymphoid tissues, resulting in higher frequencies of both cTfh and plasmablasts in the peripheral blood following vaccination.One biomarker of GC activity in lymphoid tissue is plasma CXCL13 (ref. 30). We observed weak induction of plasma CXCL13 in healthy adults 1 week after influenza vaccination (Fig. 1g), consistent with previous studies showing that influenza vaccination induced only modest changes in this chemokine detectable in blood thought to be related to the relatively weak immune response to this vaccine30. In contrast, however, anti-PD-1-treated participants had substantial induction of plasma CXCL13 1 week after vaccine compared with baseline in both cohorts (Fig. 1g,h and Extended Data Fig. 2e–g). Although this CXCL13 in the blood did not correlate strongly with the cTfh or plasmablast response, there was a correlation with later antibody responses (Extended Data Fig. 2h). Collectively, these data reveal a robust enhancement of vaccine-induced cTfh, plasmablast and likely GC activity in the presence of anti-PD-1 therapy.Anti-PD-1 altered antibody responsesHumoral responses to influenza vaccination are typically assessed by hemagglutinin inhibitory (HAI) antibody titers, which are a correlate of protection following vaccination31. Thus, we investigated whether anti-PD-1 therapy impacted the induction of HAI titers. We focused on Cohort 2 because of the larger number of individuals available for analysis.We first examined the fold-change in the HAI antibody titer at the 3–6-week time point compared with the baseline titer. Indeed, across all three strains of influenza included in the vaccine, neutralizing antibody titers increased by a median of 4-fold in the presence of anti-PD-1 compared with 2-fold in the absence of anti-PD-1 (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Most anti-PD-1-treated adults had antibody titers of >1:40 following vaccination and were thus seroprotected, similar to healthy adults, indicating no clinical deficiency in the outcome of vaccination in this setting (Fig. 2b). The absolute HAI titer was similar between the anti-PD-1 and non-anti-PD-1 at the late time point, and the difference in fold-induction reflected slightly lower baseline HAI titers in the anti-PD-1 group than in the non-anti-PD-1 group (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3b). These data are consistent with a previous study showing increases in influenza-specific antibodies in patients vaccinated while on anti-PD-1 therapy15. In Cohort 1, there were similar trends, but these differences in HAI titers in Cohort 1 did not reach statistical significance, perhaps because of a smaller number of participants, more varied treatment regimens or the effects of previous cancer therapy (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). In this setting, correlations between cTfh or B cell responses and HAI titers were not apparent (Extended Data Fig. 3e). The differences in antibody observed in Cohort 2 were unlikely to be due to the differences in age between the two groups, since independent analyses did not reveal age-associated differences in influenza-specific neutralizing antibodies at baseline (Extended Data Fig. 3f). Together, these data show that the increases in cTfh, plasmablast and CXCL13 responses were associated with quantitatively increased antibody responses in the setting of anti-PD-1 compared with participants not receiving anti-PD-1 therapy.Fig. 2: Anti-HA antibodies were quantitatively similar but qualitatively worse with anti-PD-1.a, HAI as fold-change at the late time point compared with baseline for each strain.

Data are presented as mean value (point) ± s.e.m.

However, because the data above revealed a quantitative impact of anti-PD-1 on induction of antibody following vaccination, but endpoint HAI titers were similar, we next wanted to investigate potential qualitative effects of anti-PD-1 treatment on antibody responses. For example, antibody effector function is dictated by two important components of the antibody Fc fragment, both the amino acid sequence (for example, IgG subclass IgG1–4) and the composition of the conserved N-linked glycan at asparagine position 297 (ref. 32). We previously demonstrated that changes to anti-hemagglutinin (HA) glycoforms, in particular increased total sialylation of influenza-specific IgG, drove B cell affinity selection and determined the efficacy of influenza vaccination33. We therefore investigated how disruption of the PD-1 pathway impacted antibody glycosylation and subsequent affinity. We focused on the antibody response to hemagglutinin (H1), the primary target of the antibody response in vaccinated individuals34. IgG subclass and glycan distribution of antigen-specific IgG were evaluated using mass spectrometry33. Overall, anti-H1 antibodies were enriched for the IgG1 subclass, with less IgG2 and IgG3/4 in the setting of anti-PD-1 compared with controls (Extended Data Fig. 4a; P = 9 × 10−3, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Sidak’s post-test). We next investigated how anti-PD-1 treatment impacted antibody glycosylation. Afucosylation of antibodies results in enhanced antibody-dependent cytotoxicity32, but was not affected by anti-PD-1 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Sialylation and galactosylation are two additional Fc glycosylation events that can regulate antibody function. Sialylated antibodies conferred improved protection to influenza in vivo33 and galactosylation is a prerequisite for sialylation32. Indeed, sialylation and galactosylation of anti-H1 antibodies were correlated for both anti-PD-1-treated and nontreated groups (Extended Data Fig. 4c). However, the anti-PD-1-treated patients had lower total galactosylation (Fig. 2d,e) and sialylation (Fig. 2f,g) of anti-H1 antibodies than non-anti-PD-1-treated participants at baseline and after vaccination, and these observations were consistent across all immunoglobulin subclasses (Extended Data Fig. 4d–f). In Cohort 1, anti-PD-1-treated participants had lower galactosylation and sialylation of anti-H1 antibodies at baseline (Extended Data Fig. 4g–j). In previous studies, we found similar changes in glycosylation between antigen-specific and total antibodies33,35,36. We therefore focused here on anti-H1 antibodies because these are a major mechanism of vaccine-induced protection. However, we observed similar changes in glycosylation patterns on anti-H1 antibodies of all antibody subclasses examined, suggesting a broad impact on antibody glycosylation (Extended Data Fig. 4d,f). Altogether, these data identify an effect of anti-PD-1 therapy on sialylation of anti-H1 antibodies at baseline and after vaccination, effects that might be predicted to impact the quality of influenza-specific antibodies.To test whether altered antibody glycosylation in the setting of anti-PD-1 treatment had functional consequences, we next examined antibody affinity. Sialylation of antigen-specific IgG and immune complexes contributes to affinity maturation through FcγRIIb-mediated modulation of GC B cell selection favoring higher affinity clones33. Thus, lower sialylation in the context of anti-PD-1 was predicted to impact subsequent antibody affinity. Indeed, baseline antibody affinity was lower in patients on anti-PD-1 compared with healthy controls (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 4k). Using a second assay that estimates affinity based on binding to low- versus high-density antigen33, we confirmed that anti-PD-1-treated participants had lower affinity IgG1 at baseline (Extended Data Fig. 4l–n). Collectively, these data identify both quantitative and qualitative changes in antibody responses to influenza vaccine associated with blockade of PD-1. Because some of these changes were present before yearly vaccination, these data suggest perhaps an underlying impact of anti-PD-1 therapy on influenza-specific immune memory, in addition to the effects on the responses provoked by the vaccination studied here.Given these changes in antibody, we next investigated whether anti-PD-1 treatment was associated with changes in B cell subsets that responded to vaccination, including ASCs (gated as CD19+IgD−CD71+CD20lo) and activated B cells (ABCs; gated as CD19+IgD−CD71+CD20hi)37. Even before vaccination, anti-PD-1 therapy was associated with a higher frequency of circulating ASCs and reciprocally reduced ABC frequencies (Extended Data Fig. 4o,p). However, whereas ABCs only weakly correlated with ICOS+CD38+ cTfh, at baseline and after vaccination, ASC frequencies were positively correlated with ICOS+CD38+ Tfh in anti-PD-1 patients before and after vaccination (Extended Data Fig. 4q,r). Taken together, these data indicate that anti-PD-1 treatment is associated with alterations in B cell subsets at baseline and in vaccine-induced antibody quantity and quality. Moreover, these alterations before vaccination suggest that treatment with anti-PD-1 may alter the baseline Tfh–B cell and humoral immune set point in these individuals.Anti-PD-1 is associated with dynamic transcriptional effectsTo further interrogate the effects of anti-PD-1 on immune responses to influenza vaccination, we performed transcriptional profiling on sorted ICOS+CD38+ cTfh, ABCs, ASCs or naïve B cells (gated as CD19+IgD+CD27lo) from participants in Cohort 2. Sample distribution in t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) space was driven primarily by cell subset and minimally by treatment or timing relative to vaccination (Extended Data Fig. 5a–e). However, at 1 week post vaccination, transcriptional differences were readily apparent in ICOS+CD38+ cTfh from anti-PD-1-treated adults compared with ICOS+CD38+ cTfh from healthy adults including upregulation of genes such as MKI67 and ESPL1, indicating recent proliferation38, and lower expression of genes including IFI44L, OASL and TNFRSF1B (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 5), suggesting reduced response to interferon signaling39,40. A similar upregulation of ESPL1, MKI67 and other cell cycle genes was observed in anti-PD-1-induced ‘burned-out’ CD8 T cells in patients with cancer41. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment highlighted proliferation and cell cycle in the transcriptional signatures of ICOS+CD38+ cTfh from anti-PD-1-treated participants following vaccination compared with leukocyte activation, migration, as well as cytokine production and signaling in the control group (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5f). Indeed, Ki67 protein expression 1 week after vaccination correlated with the fold-change in the ICOS+CD38+ cTfh (Extended Data Fig. 5g), supporting the notion that anti-PD-1 therapy was associated with an enhanced proliferative cTfh response after immunization.Fig. 3: Anti-PD-1 is associated with cellular proliferation and reduced IL-2/STAT5 signaling.a, Top and bottom 50 genes from differential expression analysis of ICOS+CD38+ cTfh at 1 week after vaccination. b, GO analysis shown for genes enriched in anti-PD-1 (peach) and those enriched in healthy (blue) for ICOS+CD38+ cTfh.

FDR, false discovery rate.Source dataFull size imageSimilarly, ASCs from vaccinated anti-PD-1-treated participants upregulated genes such as AURKB, BUB1 and ESPL1, consistent with greater proliferation relative to ASCs from healthy adults (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 5h), and had terms for ‘cell cycle’ and ‘mitotic cell division’ by GO (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 5i). ASCs from the anti-PD-1 group also had higher expression of CCL2 and IL18RAP, but lower expression of IFNGR2, DUSP1 and KCNA3. Moreover, upregulation of ARID1A in ICOS+CD38+ cTfh and SMARCD1 in ASCs from the anti-PD-1 group also suggested a potential impact on SWI/SNF complex use in these cells responding to vaccination in the absence of normal PD-1 signaling. These proliferation-related genes were not observed before vaccination (Extended Data Fig. 5i,j).We next performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)42 for both cTfh and ASCs to identify pathways altered due to anti-PD-1 at 1 week after vaccination. For the ICOS+CD38+ cTfh, we identified four gene sets that were enriched in the anti-PD-1 participants, all of which were associated with proliferation, whereas 27 gene sets were enriched in the controls (Fig. 3e). Indeed, enrichments of gene sets associated with proliferation were also identified in the ASC and ABC subsets of anti-PD-1 participants 1 week after vaccination (Fig. 3f–h and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). These data indicate that anti-PD-1 drove greater activation and proliferation of cTfh and B cell populations during the vaccine response.In addition to the genes and pathways upregulated in the presence of anti-PD-1, genes and pathways downregulated or that failed to be induced following influenza vaccination in anti-PD-1 patients were also of interest. Indeed, anti-PD-1 was associated with relative reduction in several pathways of direct relevance for cTfh biology in vaccine-responding ICOS+CD38+ cTfh. First, the STAT5/Blimp-1 axis is a negative regulator of Tfh differentiation and function, in part through antagonism of the Tfh-driving transcription factor Bcl6 (refs. 43,44). Here, anti-PD-1 treatment was associated with downregulation of IL-2/STAT5 signaling in activated cTfh (Fig. 3i) consistent with the enhanced cTfh response in a subset of anti-PD-1 patients. Moreover, enrichment for the IL-2/STAT5 gene set was negatively correlated with ICOS+CD38+ cTfh frequency in anti-PD-1 patients but not healthy controls, consistent with a regulatory effect of this pathway on Tfh activation and/or expansion that is revealed by anti-PD-1 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Other Tfh-regulating pathways, such as TGF-β signaling and apoptosis, were also downregulated in the setting of anti-PD-1 treatment (Fig. 3e). Downregulation of regulatory signaling pathways such as IL-2/STAT5 signaling that normally impede Tfh activity in the setting of anti-PD-1 may help explain the greater influenza vaccine-induced cTfh and antibody responses in the setting of anti-PD-1 (Fig. 2).A second relevant transcriptional imprint of anti-PD-1 treatment was downregulation of genes involved in the TNF/NFkB pathway. These changes were of interest at least in part because TNF and NFkB signaling are regulators of cTfh biology45. In the setting of anti-PD-1 treatment, signatures of TNF/NFkB-related genes in ICOS+CD38+ cTfh were highly biased to the control participants (Fig. 3e), suggesting that anti-PD-1 treatment impaired efficient use of TNF/NFkB signaling in vaccine-responding activated cTfh. A similar picture emerged for ASCs (Fig. 3f), suggesting a coordinated set of biological pathways impacted by anti-PD-1 therapy for both cTfh and ASCs. Thus, these data indicate that anti-PD-1 may alter the humoral, cTfh and likely GC responses by dysregulating control of proliferation and altered sensing of key cytokine circuits needed for proper Tfh control of humoral immunity.cTfh responses are predictive of irAEsA major limitation of current checkpoint blockade in cancer immunotherapy is the development of irAEs12,13. Although the underlying mechanisms have been unclear, one possibility is dysregulated GC-dependent immune responses including CD4 T cells (for example, Tfh) and antibody responses46,47. Thus, we hypothesized that differences in Tfh biology during anti-PD-1 therapy may offer insights into the mechanisms of irAE.To test this idea, we focused on participants in Cohort 2 where anti-PD-1 was predominantly used as monotherapy, and considered irAEs irrespective of timing to influenza vaccination (Extended Data Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 6). We considered whether messenger RNA profiling of ICOS+CD38+ cTfh at baseline could identify characteristics of those who had an irAE versus those who did not have any irAEs. Patients with irAEs had slightly more transcripts for genes associated with cellular activation, such as PDCD1 and ICOS, relative to patients who did not have irAEs, although these differences were not statistically significant (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). However, we observed higher expression of ICOS protein and PD-1 protein, using αIgG4 as a proxy for PD-1 (ref. 2), in anti-PD-1-treated adults with irAEs compared with anti-PD-1-treated adults who did not have irAEs (Extended Data Fig. 7d–f). Transcriptional analysis of ICOS+CD38+ cTfh revealed 18 genes upregulated in activated cTfh from patients with irAEs, including KIF2C, MKI67 and BIRC5, compared with patients without irAEs (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 7g and Supplementary Table 7). Consistent with these proliferation-associated genes, GO analysis also revealed enrichment for terms related to cell cycle and cellular activation in patients with irAEs (Extended Data Fig. 7h). Other genes of potential interest were also revealed, including the cytokine IL32, the splicing factor XAB2 and CD52, the target of alemtuzumab used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukeamia and multiple sclerosis48, which were all more highly expressed in activated cTfh from anti-PD-1-treated adults with irAEs. In contrast, higher ITGA5, CD82 and FOS were found in cTfh from anti-PD-1-treated adults without irAEs. These data indicated that, before influenza vaccination, ICOS+CD38+ cTfh in anti-PD-1-treated adults with irAEs were more activated than in anti-PD-1-treated adults without irAEs and anti-PD-1 therapy may engage additional biologically relevant pathways.Fig. 4: ICOS+CD38+ cTfh activation state is associated with development of irAEs.a, Anti-PD-1 participants in Cohort 2 were subgrouped based on irAEs (Y, yes; N, no). Differential expression analysis was performed on ICOS+CD38+ cTfh at baseline, and all genes with Padj < 0.05 are shown. b, GSEA for Hallmark gene sets in the setting of irAE. c. Fold-change in cTfh responses after influenza vaccine, calculated as the frequency at 1 week relative to baseline (P = 0.06, two-sided t-test; irAE ‘Yes’ (n = 12) versus ‘No’ (n = 7)).Source dataFull size imageGSEA identified enrichment of G2M checkpoint and E2F targets in ICOS+CD38+ cTfh at baseline from participants with irAEs compared with those without irAEs (Fig. 4b), further supporting the idea that ICOS+CD38+ cTfh from patients with irAEs were more activated, even before influenza vaccination, compared with patients without irAEs. This observation is consistent with other reports that identified T cell activation as a predictor of irAEs49. In addition to proliferation-associated pathways, multiple other irAE-associated biologic pathway changes in cTfh were revealed, including downregulation of IL-2/STAT5, TNF/NFkB, IL6/JAK/STAT, IFN-γ and TGF-β signaling, consistent with the results above. Taken together, these data support the notion of an anti-PD-1-mediated rewiring of cTfh biology in patients with irAEs that includes increased activation and proliferation concomitant with blunting of cytokine pathway signaling.These observations provoked the hypothesis that the post-influenza vaccine cTfh response might distinguish anti-PD-1 patients with irAEs from those without irAEs because of an underlying change in the global set point of Tfh regulation. To test this idea, we examined the magnitude of the ICOS+CD38+ cTfh increase 1 week following influenza vaccination in patients who did, or did not, have irAEs. Indeed, in patients with irAEs, influenza vaccination had a more robust ICOS+CD38+ cTfh response compared with patients without irAEs (~2.4-fold compared with 1.3-fold; Fig. 4c). A similar trend was seen in patients in Cohort 1 who were receiving anti-PD-1 monotherapy (Extended Data Fig. 7i). No difference was observed in the frequency of ICOS+CD38+ cTfh before vaccination (Extended Data Fig. 7j), suggesting a key role for the vaccine-induced perturbation in revealing this biology. Moreover, we did not observe increases in titers of anti-nuclear or anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) autoantibodies with anti-PD-1 therapy or in the setting of irAEs (Extended Data Fig. 7k,l). Thus, these observations suggest that anti-PD-1 therapy alters Tfh–B cell and likely underlying GC biology, at least in a subset of patients, and that these changes can alter the magnitude and quality of the response to vaccination. The alteration in this Tfh–B cell and GC axis correlates with propensity for anti-PD-1-associated irAEs and perhaps points to underlying rewiring of Tfh and GC biology contributing to these outcomes which may be more sensitive than general autoantibody measurements such as anti-nuclear or anti-dsDNA antibodies. Thus, using influenza vaccination as an ‘analytical probe’ of underlying changes in immune function revealed a proliferatively enhanced, but biologically altered, response to vaccination which also identified participants predisposed to irAEs.DiscussionCheckpoint blockade therapies including anti-PD-1 antibodies are now a major tool in the arsenal for the treatment of cancer. Substantial effort has focused on the in vivo effects of anti-PD-1 therapy on the CD8 T cell response1. However, as evidenced by the global effects of PD-1 deficiency26 and the immune-related complications of anti-PD-1 therapy, better understanding of the mechanisms of anti-PD-1 therapy on additional immune cell types is needed. Here, we exploited influenza vaccine-induced immune responses to evaluate the effects of anti-PD-1 on the Tfh–B cell axis. We identified evidence of increased early germinal centre activation which was associated with proliferation in cTfh and responding B cells. Moreover, transcriptional profiling of ICOS+CD38+ cTfh following vaccination identified key altered signaling pathways including reduced IL-2/STAT5 signaling in the setting of anti-PD-1, and these changes were associated with quantitatively robust but qualitatively impaired antibody responses to vaccination. Finally, we demonstrated that cTfh from participants with irAEs had evidence of hyper-responsiveness compared with those without irAEs.Mechanistic studies of the in vivo effects of immunomodulators such as anti-PD-1 are challenging given limits on our ability to study immune mechanisms in humans. In previous studies, we established ICOS+CD38+ cTfh as a circulating cellular biosensor in the setting of aging45, given that many cTfh are recent emigrants from lymphoid tissue50,51. Thus, platforms that employ an immunologic stimulus, particularly one widely used in routine clinical care, offer a window of opportunity to elucidate the in vivo effects of therapeutics on the Tfh–B cell axis. Indeed, little is known about the protective effects of vaccines used clinically in patients with cancer receiving immunologically relevant therapies. Moreover, influenza vaccination in the presence of anti-PD-1 augmented the induction of antibody, although antibody levels achieved by the late time point were similar to healthy adults. However, the antibodies generated in anti-PD-1-treated patients had reduced sialylation, a change that has implications for regulation of germinal centre responses and antibody affinity maturation33. Although it is currently assumed that influenza vaccination offers similar efficacy in patients receiving anti-PD-1 compared with patients not receiving checkpoint inhibitors, further studies will be needed to determine whether alternative vaccination strategies, such as use of adjuvants, high-dose vaccine or perhaps mRNA-based influenza vaccines, are needed to optimally protect patients.One distinct aspect of using influenza vaccine for these studies is that the response to influenza vaccination likely mainly involves a recall response of previously primed memory CD4 T cells and B cells, with perhaps a smaller newly primed response depending on the year and strains of influenza virus in the vaccine52. Indeed, we previously observed recall responses in cTfh following successive annual vaccination25. It is worth noting that the impact of anti-PD-1 may differ for primary versus secondary responses53 and deconvolving the primary versus recall responses in humans is complex, especially at 1 week following vaccination when both primary and recall responses would both already be clonally expanded. Thus, future studies, perhaps using antigens not previously encountered (for example, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines) and high-resolution multi-modal profiling using Cellular Indexing of Transcriptoms and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq54), should help further dissect the role of anti-PD-1 on pre-existing versus newly primed CD4 T cell and B cell responses.A major gap in our knowledge is the inability to predict cancer treatment success or failure at the time of initiation of immunotherapy. Accurately predicting these responses requires better understanding of the mechanisms by which immunotherapies work. We identified increased Tfh and B cell responses to vaccination in the setting of anti-PD-1, and our findings are consistent with other reports of anti-PD-1 inducing Tfh proliferation55. Although evidence supports a major role for anti-PD-1 augmenting antitumour immunity via CD8 T cells2, recent studies have also suggested a link between the Tfh–B cell axis and efficacy of immunotherapy56,57,58,59. Here, we enrolled participants who were receiving immunotherapy in the form of single-agent anti-PD-1 therapy (for example, pembrolizumab or nivolumab). This strategy has two implications. First, the immune response to initiation of anti-PD-1 therapy is dynamic and typically occurs within the first one to two cycles2. Thus, the patients studied here were biased towards those in whom loss of PD-1 signaling was more established, allowing the setting of treatment-induced steady-state PD-1 deficiency to be assessed. Second, because these patients on average had received seven or more cycles of immunotherapy, corresponding to 4–6 months since initiation, they were likely enriched for participants who were having a successful clinical response. This latter effect was advantageous in allowing us to study reasonably healthy patients, but is also worth noting since perhaps not all patients with cancer receiving anti-PD-1 therapy will respond the same way to vaccines. Whether use of such analytical vaccination as a measure of immune fitness will aid in determining outcomes of cancer therapy is unclear, but these data suggest that immuno-monitoring of the Tfh–B cell axis during cancer therapy could provide additional insights about overall immune health.IrAEs lead to morbidity and premature discontinuation of therapy but are not well understood. Here, we found that patients with irAEs had evidence of greater sensitivity to anti-PD-1 in ICOS+CD38+ cTfh, compared with patients without irAEs, all of whom were receiving anti-PD-1. We also found that patients with irAEs had more robust influenza vaccine-induced cTfh responses relative to patients without irAEs. Indeed, there is additional evidence from other studies for enhanced T cell activation in the setting of irAEs49. Patients with irAEs following immune checkpoint blockade often have better anti-cancer responses and better survival60,61,62, suggesting broad rewiring of immunity by anti-PD-1 immunotherapy that impacts responses as diverse as those targeting tumour and self-antigens. Although the mechanisms for the increased sensitivity of cTfh and the germinal centre-dependent immune responses to anti-PD-1 identified here are not fully understood, these data are consistent with previous work identifying cTfh as sensitive readouts of underlying changes in overall immune system status45. Indeed, in the setting of immunotherapy, we hypothesize that coordination of germinal centre-dependent vaccine responses may serve as a proxy for understanding broader immune response regulation in the context of anti-PD-1 therapy. The coordinated response provoked by vaccination, however, may allow a temporally synchronized immune response and provide a high-resolution window into the anti-PD-1-dependent changes in underlying immune biology. Thus, the use of influenza vaccine as an analytical probe of broader immune function on anti-PD-1 therapy revealed insights into underlying immune set point, specifically for immune features and pathways that have a role in germinal centre-dependent immune responses which may include both responses to vaccination and autoimmunity.In summary, these studies not only reveal a role for treatment with anti-PD-1 to reset the immune landscape beyond anti-cancer responses in some patients, but also suggest the potential of PD-1 pathway manipulation in anti-vaccine responses, and point to activated cTfh including in the context of an analytical vaccine to identify patients at risk of irAEs. The data presented here demonstrate the utility of immunoprofiling studies during a vaccine-induced perturbation as a means of uncovering mechanisms of immunomodulator therapy, which will have major implications for design and use of immunomodulator therapy.MethodsHuman subjectsParticipants were recruited and underwent informed consent between 2015 and 2019 at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (Cohort 1) and at the University of Pennsylvania (Cohort 2), in accordance with the Institutional Review Boards of each institution, also described in NCT03346772 and NCT03315975. Participants were eligible if they required influenza vaccine for routine care and had not received influenza vaccine in the previous 6 months; they were excluded if they had contraindications to influenza vaccine, or needed immunosuppressive medications (that is, corticosteroids). Participants received influenza vaccine on the same day as their scheduled dose of anti-PD-1. In Cohort 1, participants under age 65 received Flulaval quadrivalent vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline), whereas participants over age 65 received Fluzone High-Dose quadrivalent vaccine (Sanofi-Pasteur). In Cohort 2, healthy adults received Fluzone quadrivalent vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline) and anti-PD-1 adults received quadrivalent vaccine (manufacturer information unavailable). Participants were compensated for their participation for visits not linked to usual care.Peripheral venous blood was drawn at baseline (day 0), at 1 week (days 7–10) and late (21–28 d) after seasonal inactivated influenza vaccination. Blood was collected into heparinized tubes. Plasma was isolated by centrifugation, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare) or Sepmate (Stem Cell) tubes. Participants in influenza vaccine studies in the setting of aging were described previously21.Flow cytometryPBMCs were stained for surface proteins for 20 min at 25 °C. Permeabilization was performed using the Intracellular Fixation/Permeabilization Concentrate and Diluent kit (ThermoFisher) for 20 min at 25 °C. Intracellular staining was performed for 60 min at 25 °C. Antibodies and clones are described in Supplementary Table 3. Cells were resuspended in 1% para-formaldehyde until acquisition on a BD Symphony A5 cytometer. Fluorescence-minus-one controls were performed in pilot studies.RNA-sequencing processingPBMCs were sorted on a BD Aria II cell sorter using FACSDiva (v.8.0), followed by total RNA extraction by RNeasy Micro Plus kit (Qiagen) into DNA LoBind tubes (Eppendorf) in randomly allocated small batches. Samples were randomly distributed throughout a 96-well skirted twin.tec PCR plate (Eppendorf), followed by polyA amplification with SMART-Seq HT kit (Clontech) according to manufacturer instructions. Libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT Library Preparation kit (Illumina) using the protocol modification recommended by the Clontech kit. Libraries were indexed with a unique dual indexing strategy (IDT for Illumina Nextera DNA Set A, Illumina) to account for index hopping. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina Novaseq 6000, using 51 + 10 + 10 + 51 run geometry. FASTQ files were trimmed with Trimmomatic (v.0.32) and assessed for quality with FastQC. Libraries were aligned using STAR (v.2.5.2a) and normalized by PORT (https://github.com/itmat/Normalization/, v.0.8.5) against the GRCh38 reference assembly of the human genome. One of the 89 resultant libraries was excluded from further analysis due to poor sequencing (tenfold fewer reads than next least sample).RNA-sequencing analysisVariance-stabilizing transformation and differential expression were performed using DESeq2 (v.1.28.1) based on genes with at least 20 counts in at least 25% of all libraries, using the R environment (v.4.0.2). Plots were made by ggplot2 (v.3.3.2). Heatmap colouring was based on the ‘inferno’ colour-scheme from the viridis library. t-SNE maps were produced using Rtsne (v.0.15) from the variance-stabilized counts data. GO was performed using Metascape (https://metascape.com). GSEAs were performed with at least 10,000 permutations of pre-ranked GSEA (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/downloads.jsp), and gene set variation analysis63 was performed with the GSVA library (v.1.36.2).Influenza-specific antibodiesThe two influenza A vaccine strains of the 2014/2015 seasonal influenza vaccine, A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus and A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like virus, were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA). Influenza B strain B/Brisbane/33/2008 was obtained from BEI Bioresources (NR-42006). Assays to detect hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) antibody titers were performed as previously described33. Infectious virus was used for neutralizing antibody assays or inactivated by β-propiolactone for H1N1/California-, H3N2/Victoria- or B/Victoria-specific binding antibody ELISA assays. Nunc MaxiSorp plates were coated with 10 mg ml−1 influenza A/H1N1/California, A/H3N2/Victoria or B/Brisbane/33/2008 virus along with isotype standards for IgG (Athens Research and Technology) in bicarbonate buffer overnight at 4 °C. Plates were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS and incubated with heat-inactivated sera of young and elderly adults. Antibodies were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG (Southern Biotechnology).ELISAsHA ELISAs were performed as described previously33. Negative control sera values were subtracted from readings given by test samples. Serum antibody 50% effective concentration (EC50) levels were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the serially diluted serum optical density (OD) values as calculated by GraphPad Prism. The EC50 takes into account both the concentration (maximum binding) and the affinity of antibodies (for example, the slope of the binding curve) and is an accurate measure of total binding which generally correlates with the endpoint titer64. For hi-lo affinity ELISAs, sera diluted 1:200 were incubated on plates coated with 1 μg ml−1 HA protein (low density) or 6 mg ml−1 HA (high density). The affinity of HA-specific IgG was expressed as a ratio of binding to low-density/high-density HA-coated plates33.Anti-nuclear antibody and dsDNA screenAnti-nuclear antibodies were detected by ELISA (BioVision). Here, diluted patient serum (1:21) was added to the ELISA plate coated with purified nuclear antigens. The enzyme conjugate was then added to all wells and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. Following removal and washing three times with wash buffer, 100 µl of TMB substrate was added and allowed to incubate for 10 min before adding 100 µl of stop solution. The OD of the plates was measured at 450 nm. Antibody indices were calculated per manufacturer recommendations and values >0.9 were considered positive. Similarly, anti-dsDNA antibodies were detected by quantitative ELISA (Eagle Biosciences). Briefly, the antibodies of the calibrators and control and diluted patient samples were incubated with dsDNA immobilized on the solid phase of microtiter plates. Following an incubation period of 60 min at 25 °C, unbound sample components were removed, and plates were washed three times. The bound IgG antibody complexes were detected using anti-human-IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 30 min at 25 °C. Then, 100 µl of TMB solution was added to each of the wells and allowed to incubate for 10 min at 25 °C before the addition of 100 µl of stop solution. The OD of the solution was measured at 450 nm. A standard curve was established by plotting the antibody concentrations of the calibrators (x axis) and their corresponding OD values (y axis) measured. The antibody concentration of each specimen was then interpolated from the standard curve.Fc glycan analysisIgGs were isolated from serum by protein G purification. HA-specific IgGs were isolated on agarose resin (Pierce) coupled to HA protein. Total anti-H1 HA IgGs were captured on Cal/09-coupled resin. IgG Fc-associated glycans were analysed by mass spectrometry following tryptic digestion of purified IgG or on-bead IgG.Protein samples (10 µg) enriched by Protein G beads either in-solution or on-beads in 50 mM Tris buffer pH 8.0 were denatured with 6 M guanidine HCl, reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol at 56 °C for 45 min and alkylated with 60 mM iodoacetamide for 1 h at 25 °C in the dark. Excess iodoacetamide was quenched with 20 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min at 25 °C. The samples were diluted to a final volume of 200 µl with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate to reduce the guanidine HCl concentration to less than 1 M. The samples were digested by adding trypsin (0.5–1 µg, Promega) at a 1:20 ratio (w/w) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. All samples were desalted using solid phase extraction on Sep-Pak Cartridges (Waters) and the eluted tryptic peptides were evaporated to dryness in a Speedvac SC110 (Thermo Savant) before analysis.Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis for characterization of glycosylation sites was performed on an UltiMate3000 RSLCnano (Dionex) coupled with a hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer, the 4000 Q Trap (AB SCIEX). The digested samples were reconstituted in 50 µl of 0.2% formic acid (FA), of which 2–3 µl was injected with an autosampler onto a PepMap C18 trap column (5 µm, 300 µm × 5 mm, Dionex) with 0.1% FA at 20 ml min−1 for 1 min, then separated on a PepMap C18 RP nano column (3 µm, 75 µm × 15 cm, Dionex) using a 60-min gradient of 10% to 35% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% FA at 300 nl min−1, followed by a 3-min ramp to 95% ACN–0.1% FA and a 5-min hold at 95% ACN–0.1% FA.Mass spectrometry data acquisition was performed using Analyst 1.4.2 software (Applied Biosystems) for precursor ion scan-triggered information-dependent acquisition (IDA) analysis and enhanced mass spectrometry-based IDA analysis65,66. The precursor ion scan of the oxonium ion (HexNAc+ at m/z 204.08) was monitored at a step size of 0.2 Da cross a mass range of m/z 400 to 1,600 for detecting glycopeptides containing N-acetylhexosamine unit. The nanospray voltage was 1.9 kV, and was used in positive ion mode for all experiments. The declustering potential was set at 50 eV and nitrogen as collision gas. In IDA analysis, after each precursor ion scan or enhanced mass spectrometry scan, and enhanced resolution scan, the two to three highest intensity ions with multiple charge states were selected for MS/MS with rolling collision energy applied for detected ions based on different charge states and m/z values. All acquired MS/MS spectra from enhanced mass spectrometry-IDA were subjected to Mascot database search. All acquired MS/MS spectra for detected glycopeptide ions by precursor ion scanning were manually inspected and interpreted with Analyst 1.4.2 and BioAnalysis 1.4 software (Applied Biosystems). The peak areas of detected precursor ions were determined by extracted chromatogram at each specific m/z representing glycopeptide isoforms. The relative quantitations of the sugar glycan isoforms of N-linked peptide ions were carried out based on precursor ion peak areas under the assumption that all sugar glycan isoforms linked to the same core peptide have identical or similar ionization efficiency.StatisticsNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications25,45. Randomization was not performed in these observational studies. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. Statistical analyses were performed with R (v.4.0.2) using the rstatix library (v.0.6.0) or Prism 9 (GraphPad). Data were compared using Student’s t-test, paired t-test, Wilcoxon test, one-way or two-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc analysis, or nonparametric ANOVA with Friedman’s or Sidak’s post-test, as indicated. Nonparametric tests were used unless data were distributed normally based on Shapiro’s test of normality. All tests throughout these studies were performed as two-tailed tests with α = 0.05. All available data were used, and no outlier analyses were performed.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

A third case was discovered in March.Deputy chief veterinary officer Caroline Terburgh said poultry owners should follow "stringent" measures to avoid the disease spreading.She said: "Now, more than ever, we ask islanders to keep their poultry away from wild birds and to discourage wild bird access to food, water and bedding intended for the captive birds."By following stringent biosecurity measures we can avoid the potential spread of avian influenza, because we do not want to have to impose mandatory housing restrictions during these hot summer months."The government enforced restrictions and biosecurity measures from March to prevent the spread of bird flu.Restrictions ended in May after no other cases were detected, until now.Ms Terburgh said: "We ask all those working in the countryside, especially those who keep poultry, to be particularly vigilant and report any unusual symptoms."We would advise the public not to handle any dead or unwell birds and to report any suspicious deaths to the natural environment team."Follow BBC Jersey on Twitter and Facebook.

This is the first confirmed case of HPAI in Coos County. Other Oregon counties with confirmed HPAI cases include Deschutes, Lane, Linn, and Polk Counties. The Coos County flock of approximately 25 birds, is a mix of chickens and ducks. The flock owners did not sell eggs or other poultry products therefore federal guidelines do no not require a quarantine.USDA in partnership with ODA, humanely euthanized the flock on the property to prevent the spread of the disease. The birds will not enter the food system. There is no immediate public concern due to the avian influenza virus detection. Avian influenza does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain safe to eat. Both wild and domestic poultry should be adequately prepared and cooked.ODA advises commercial poultry and backyard flock owners to be vigilant with biosecurity measures and surveillance. Preventing any contact between wild birds and domestic flocks is the best way to protect domestic birds from HPAI. Death or illness among domestic birds should be reported to ODA. Please report by calling 503-986-4711 (Alt phone 1-800-347-7028).To report the death of wild birds please contact the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) by calling 1-866-968-2600 or email Wildlife.Health@odfw.oregon.gov.For more tips on protecting backyard flocks please visit ODA online at Avian Influenza or en Español at Avian Influenza-Spanish.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Us© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...People in Japan urged to get flu shots ahead of winter as epidemic feared alongside COVID - The Mainichi Please view the main text area of the page by skipping the main menu.

Japan's National Daily Since 1922 Japanese Contact Us Top Latest Japan World Business Sports Science Entertainment Opinion Lifestyle Obituaries Features Photos Videos People in Japan urged to get flu shots ahead of winter as epidemic feared alongside COVID July 29, 2022 (Mainichi Japan) Japanese version (Getty Images) TOKYO -- The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases called for people to receive influenza vaccines, warning that a seasonal flu epidemic is likely to hit Japan this autumn to winter alongside the coronavirus pandemic. The academic society advised people, particularly elderly individuals, children, and those with underlying medical conditions, to get vaccinated against influenza. In its recommendation issued July 27, it cited the increasing number of reported flu cases in Australia from the latter half of April this year, in regard to the situation in the southern hemisphere, which is used as a reference for predicting the flu outbreak in the northern hemisphere. The advisory points out, "If restrictions on entry from overseas are relaxed and interactions among people increase, it is possible that a similar outbreak will occur from this autumn to winter." There have been no large-scale influenza epidemics in Japan since the coronavirus pandemic hit the country in February 2020. It is feared that herd immunity against influenza has gotten weaker in the past two years. The advisory states that a massive epidemic, centering on children, may occur if infections spread. It also pointed out the possibility that influenza A subtype H3N2 would be the predominant strain this season. The association stated that an outbreak of this strain would result in a rise of influenza deaths and hospitalizations, and warned that it is especially necessary to take precautionary measures. The advisory called on senior citizens aged 65 or older, children aged five years or younger, and people with chronic illnesses to receive flu vaccines and make sure to take basic infection countermeasures, such as washing their hands and wearing masks.

Using mixed-effects logistic regression with village as random effect, we identified crow abundance in garbage dumping places and presence of migratory wild birds within villages to be associated with higher odds of H5 and H9 seropositivity. At farm-level, garbage around poultry houses was also associated with higher odds of H5 and H9 seropositivity. In addition, specific trading practices (such as, purchase of chickens from live bird markets (LBM) and neighboring farms to raise them on their own farms, frequency of visits to LBM, purchase of poultry at LBM for consumption) and contact of backyard chickens with other animals (such as, feeding of different poultry species together, using pond water as drinking source for poultry, access of feral and wild animals to poultry houses) were associated with higher odds of H5 or H9 seropositivity. Resource-constrained small-scale poultry farmers should be able to address risk factors identified in this study without requiring large investments into poultry management, thereby reducing the likelihood of avian influenza virus transmission and ultimately occurrence of avian influenza outbreaks.

However, the low level of biosecurity in this farming system may put backyard poultry at a high risk of infection with avian influenza viruses (AIVs)4. Backyard poultry is therefore often considered to promote the spread and persistence of AIVs5,6. On the other hand, it has been hypothesized that, due to their small flock size, the risk of a viral introduction and spread may be substantially lower for backyard compared to commercial flocks7,8, and that local breeds, raised on backyard farms, are less susceptible to infection than exotic breeds reared in commercial enterprises9,10. However, there is no experimental and observational evidence supporting these hypotheses11.Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 was first reported in Bangladesh in 2007. It is now endemic in Bangladesh with multiple AIV subtypes, including Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) H9N2, circulating in the country’s poultry population, raising concerns about the emergence of a new AIV variant with significant public health concern12,13. A recent study conducted in Bangladeshi Live Bird Markets (LBM) estimated a prevalence of H5 and H9 AIVs of 1.3% and 8.3% in backyard chickens, 7.6% and 3.4% in waterfowl (ducks and geese), respectively14. In contrast, in another field study conducted by Gupta et al.15, none of the chickens and ducks sampled on backyard flocks tested positive for H5 AIV, and only 0.2% of chickens tested positive for H9 AIV15. The H5 and H9 seroprevalence in this study was 4.2% and 16.0% in unvaccinated backyard chickens, and 14.2% and 15.7% in unvaccinated ducks, respectively, indicating past exposure of backyard chicken to circulating H5 and H9 virus15.The implementation of comprehensive biosecurity practices is notoriously challenging, if at all feasible, in backyard chicken farming systems16. The lack of adherence to recommended biosecurity practices is also likely influenced by backyard farmers’ beliefs that their poultry does not play a significant role in AIV transmission5. It is therefore essential to identify risk factors contributing to AIV infection, in order to develop specific extension messages and recommendations for improved biosecurity that are low-cost and feasible for backyard poultry farmers. To our knowledge, only one case–control study was conducted in Bangladesh more than 13 years ago, that focused on the identification of farm-level factors associated with the occurrence of H5N1 outbreaks on backyard farms17. Risk factors for current H5 and H9 circulation in apparently healthy backyard poultry have not been described in Bangladesh.In this study, we focused on clinically healthy chickens to monitor their past exposure to AIV. By focusing on chickens without clinical signs, we can describe the circulation of AIV in chickens that might had occurred in these flocks and risk factors associated with this AIV exposure. We are also able to inform farmers about potential threats to their current poultry production so that they can take appropriate actions. Furthermore, as the co-infection of the HPAI virus with other viruses poses a danger for the occurrence of more severe avian influenza disease in poultry and in humans, identifying risk factors for AIV exposure in clinically health birds provides an opportunity for implementing early interventions. Focusing the data collection on clinically healthy chickens does also allow for random sampling, as targeting clinically-affected birds would have likely lead to selection bias.Therefore, this research study aimed to identify farm and village-level factors relating to the management and marketing of backyard chickens, as well as environmental or ecological conditions, village structure, poultry density, past disease outbreaks and past vaccination campaigns that might be associated with H5 and H9 seropositivity in backyard chickens. We hypothesize that risk factors do exist that can be easily addressed and modified in order to reduce the likelihood of AIV transmission and ultimately avian influenza outbreak occurrence.ResultsNone of the sampled backyard chicken flocks were vaccinated against AI. Farmers did not report any outbreaks of HPAI or unusually high mortality in their flocks within the last 12 months preceding the sampling.We used the farm-level H5 and H9 serological status as a binary outcome variable (H5/H9 seropositive or seronegative): a farm/flock was considered positive for a given AIV subtype if at least one chicken or duck on that farm/flock had a Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) titre of ≥ 2418.The proportions of H5 and H9 seropositive flocks were 27.8% (N = 40) and 60.4% (N = 87), respectively. The residual Intra-class Correlations (ICCs) were 0.11 (95% CI 0.00–0.87) and 0.18 (95% CI 0.02–0.75) for H5 and H9 seropositivity, respectively, suggesting significant clustering at the village-level.In the univariate analysis, 7 village-level and 10 farm-level risk factors associated with H5 seropositivity were identified (Table 1, Supplementary Table S1), while 7 village-level and 14 farm-level risk factors were associated with H9 seropositivity (Table 2, Supplementary Table S2). The final multi-variable model for H5 AIV exposure included one village-level and four farm-level risk factors (Table 1), while for H9 AIV exposure, it comprised of two village-level and five farm-level risk factors (Table 2).Table 1 Results of the univariate and multi-variable analysis for village and farm-level risk factors (N = 144 farms, N = 42 villages) associated with H5 flock-level seroprevalence on backyard chicken farms in Bangladesh, 2016.Full size tableTable 2 Results of the univariate and multi-variable analysis for village and farm-level risk factors (N = 144 farms, N = 42 villages) associated with H9 flock-level seroprevalence on backyard chicken farms in Bangladesh, 2016.Full size tableAt village-level, crow abundance around the garbage dumping place was associated with higher odds of both H5 and H9 seropositivity. Also, migratory wild birds visiting the village increased the odds of H9 infection. At farm-level, garbage piled up around poultry houses (or on the farms in general), was associated with higher odds of both, H5 and H9 seropositivity. Furthermore, the odds of a backyard farm being seropositive for H5 increased with the number of chickens bought from LBMs and raised on these backyard farms, with the feeding of different poultry species from the same feeder or in the same space and with the use of pond water as a drinking source for poultry. In addition, purchasing poultry from neighbouring farms to raise them on backyard farms, the frequency of visits to LBM, the purchase of poultry at LBM for consumption and the access of feral and wild animals to poultry houses increased the odds of a farm being seropositive for H9. We did not observe any confounding effect of initially eliminated variables that were added into the final multi-variable models. We also did not identify any significant 2-way interactions.DiscussionThe observed H5 seropositivity without any HPAI clinical signs or mortalities might be the result of infection of backyard chickens with LPAI H5 strains. A study conducted by Gerloff et al.19 reported the presence of LPAI H5N2 in Bangladesh, and other studies by Duan et al.20 and Nguyen et al.21 also indicated the circulation of LPAI H5 viruses (H5N2, H5N3, H5N8), in Asia. Alternatively, viral evolution might have resulted in a reduction of HPAI H5 pathogenicity22, or the chickens might have developed reduced susceptibility to clinical disease due to cell-mediated immunity23.Environmental and ecological village-level risk factorsOur study identified crow abundance in garbage dumping places within a village as a risk factor for both, H5 and H9 seropositivity. In Bangladesh, crows have often been found feeding on household scraps and garbage from LBM24. The presence of crows in villages may be indicative of locations, where poultry farming-related waste including dead birds and poultry droppings have been disposed. Backyard chickens are likely to scavenge around such locations and might be exposed to AIV-contaminated material. Indeed, rather than being vectors of infection, crows may well act as sentinels to an AIV-contaminated environment and might become infected themselves. Infection of crows by H5N125,26 and H9N227,28 viruses resulting from their exposure to garbage dump has been previously reported.The presence of migratory wild birds in villages was also associated with an increased odds of farms being positive for H9. The world’s largest delta, the Jamuna-Padma (or Brahmaputra-Ganges) covers most of Bangladesh. These waterways attract many migratory wild birds travelling along the ‘Southeastern end of the Central Asian Flyway’ and the ‘Southwestern end of the East Asian—Australasian flyway’, to overwinter in Bangladesh. Thus, a range of migratory wild bird species are visiting Bangladesh during the winter months29,30. Migratory wild birds mingle frequently with domestic waterfowls31, which may create opportunities for viruses to be introduced into village poultry populations. Contact between wild birds and backyard poultry was identified as a risk factor for H9N2 seropositivity in backyard poultry farms in Pakistan32. Similarly, in Egypt, a study33 on the circulation of HPAI and LPAI viruses in backyard chickens highlighted potential interactions of backyard chickens with waterfowl and shorebirds and recommended improved biosecurity practices to mitigate the AIV transmission between wild and domestic birds. In fact, active surveillance data collected from wild birds and backyard flocks in Northern Italy in 2004–2006 confirmed that contacts between migratory birds and free-range backyard poultry are a likely pathway for AIV transmission34.Farm-level risk factors relating to garbage disposalSimilarly, to the village-level risk factor related to garbage disposal, garbage piled up on farms was also a risk factor for both, H5 and H9 seropositivity. A survey conducted in the United States identified garbage as a possible source of HPAI virus infection for commercial poultry farms35. In this study, potentially HPAI-contaminated material (poultry carcasses, eggshells, dead wildlife) was disposed near backyard poultry farms. The study also suggested that a garbage collection service shared by commercial and backyard poultry farmers might have been one of the potential pathways for HPAI virus spread35. Considering that AIVs shed into the environment may remain infectious for weeks or months at ambient temperatures, untreated garbage in open areas can play a significant role in the AIV epidemiology36,37. However, extreme seasonal variations in rainfall, humidity and temperatures (as observed in Bangladesh) might impact the survival of AIV in farming environement38.Farm-level risk factors relating to trading practicesPurchase of poultry at LBMs for raising them in farmers’ own backyard flocks or for consumption was associated with increased H5 and H9 seropositivity. AIVs have been found to circulate with high prevalence in LBMs of countries, including Bangladesh, where live bird trading is a common practice39. Purchasing poultry from neighbouring farms was also found to increase the odds of a farm to be positive. A recent cross-sectional study conducted by Chaudhry et al.40 exploring farm-level risk factors associated with AI seropositivity across 308 villages of the Lahore district in Pakistan also found that backyard poultry farms, that purchased birds from LBM or obtained them from friends had increased odds of AI seropositivity. Similar observations were made in Thailand, further emphasizing the importance of the poultry trade in the spread of AIVs41.Farm-level risk factors relating to contact of backyard chickens with other animalsHusbandry practices such as using the same equipment to feed multiple species of poultry together, promoted inter-species contacts and thereby increased the odds of a farm being seropositive for H5. In addition, the use of pond water as a drinking source also increased the odds of both H5 and H9 seropositivity. In Bangladesh, ponds represent shared habitats for domestic and migratory waterfowls, and water may be contaminated with AIVs. Indeed, an experimental laboratory-based study reported that H5N1 virus can remain infectious in water for 12 days at 22–35 °C42. Ponds might also become contaminated with AIV through the disposal of dead poultry, which is a common feed source for farmed fish in Bangladesh. Moreover, access of feral or wild animals to poultry houses, identified here as a risk factor, has been previously described as a plausible route for H9 virus transmission43. A review study pointed out the role of wild and terrestrial animals in the potential replication and shedding of AIVs, highlighting that these animals are able to replicate and shed high-titres of multiple AIV subtypes without any prior viral adaptation44.Study limitationsThere are some limitations to our study. Firstly, as in any research involving interviews, recall bias may have affected farmers’ responses. However, as we specifically interviewed the people who actually care for the chickens, we are confident to have minimised this bias. Secondly, due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, we could not assess the impact of seasonal variations on the predictors. Thirdly, interviewees may have given socially acceptable answers to some sensitive questions, for example on questions related to cleaning and disinfection practices. This may explain why those variables were not identified as significant risk factors in the final multi-variable model. Fourthly, chickens infected by HPAI H5 are expected to die, although backyard farmers did not report any unusual mortalities or HPAI outbreaks on their farms over the year preceding the sampling. Being unable to confirm this, we trusted the farmers observations. Finally, we used seropositivity as a measure of past exposure of backyard chickens to AIV. Although, we also collected swabs from birds to assess virus shedding, virus prevalence was very low (flock-level H9 virus prevalence was 0.7% and no flocks were positive for H5) and we were not able to use it as an outcome variable in the risk factor analysis.Conclusions and recommendationsThe focus of this study was on identifying practical solutions that can be addressed by resource limited small-scale backyard chicken farmers without any large additional investments into poultry management. Thus, the results of this research lead to the following conclusions and recommendations that can reduce the risks of AIV infection in backyard poultry flocks: Garbage should be disposed as far as possible from farms by burning or burying it deep in the ground, so that scavengers, including backyard poultry, cannot access it. Backyard farmers need to be encouraged to avoid dumping of poultry droppings or even dead birds in waste areas within villages and on their farms as this might attract wild birds (e.g. crows). Backyard farmers who rear multiple poultry species within the farm should be discouraged from feeding different species of poultry using the same feeder or trough. Alternative water sources, such as tube-well water, should be used to provide water to backyard poultry. Backyard farmers should be encouraged to purchase poultry from reliable sources to supplement their own flocks. In particular, sources of live poultry with likely contact with infected birds (e.g. poultry at LBM) should be avoided, or at least newly purchased birds should be separated from the rest of the flock for a minimum of two weeks. Backyard farmers should be encouraged to hatch their own birds in a low-cost and feasible bio-secured environment. Live poultry bought from LBM for family consumption should not be slaughtered and/or processed at home, but at the LBM. As much as practical and feasible, the movement of backyard farmers or their family members to LBM should be minimized. Backyard farmers should be encouraged to restrict the scavenging of their poultry in waste areas. We believe that the risk factors identified in this study can also help policy makers to develop more specific and practical biosecurity measures aiming to mitigate the risk of AIV infection in backyard chickens.MethodsOverview of the study designA cross-sectional study was conducted in Chattogram (previously, Chittagong) and Cox’s Bazaar districts of Bangladesh in February and April 2016. Chattogram is the second largest city in Bangladesh after the capital Dhaka. About 19.7% of the country’s urban population lives in Chattogram, and the city contributes 30% of the country’s national Gross Domestic Product45,46. Most chickens sold through Chattogram City Live Bird Markets are supplied by Chattogram and Cox's Bazar districts47,48. About 0.7 and 0.3 million households in the Chattogram and Cox’s Bazar districts, respectively49,50, raise backyard poultry, which are an important subsistence income for this rural population51. Considering the significance of poultry production and trade in these two districts, we used a list of backyard chicken farms within these two districts as our target population. The study was conducted on 144 backyard chicken farms across 42 villages in these two districts. The sample size estimation and the selection of study units have been described in detail in Gupta et al.15.Questionnaire dataWe used two types of questionnaires to collect information on farm-level and village-level risk factors potentially associated with AIV circulation. Both questionnaires were developed in English and then translated into Bengali language. The questionnaires were developed based on causal diagrams constructed using the software MindMaple Lite version 1.3 (MindMaple Inc., Tustin, USA) visualising the hypothesized relationships between the flock-level serological status and potential farm (Fig. 1) and village-level risk factors (Fig. 2). The detailed causal diagrams for risk factors at farm and village-level are shown in Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2, respectively.Figure 1Hypothesized causal pathways for farm-level risk factors (green boxes) associated with avian influenza farm-level seropositivity (red box) in backyard chickens in Bangladesh. Yellow headings represent themes or categories under which risk factors can be combined. The causal pathways were used to inform the development of questions used in the interviews with backyard farmers and guided the inclusion of potential confounders and interactions in the final multi-variable model.Full size imageFigure 2Hypothesized causal pathways for village-level risk factors (green boxes) associated with avian influenza farm-level seropositivity (red box) in backyard chickens in Bangladesh. Yellow headings represent themes or categories under which risk factors can be combined. The causal pathways were used to inform the development of questions used in the interviews with backyard farmers and guided the inclusion of potential confounders and interactions in the final multi-variable model.Full size imageThe farm-level questionnaire was designed to capture information on husbandry and marketing practices, and on the farm location. The questionnaire was pilot-tested on five backyard farms that were not part of the farms recruited for the study. Twelve out of 58 questions were subsequently modified as their initial formulation was unclear for interviewed farmers. For example, farmers in the pilot study had difficulties understanding the question ‘Do you maintain any quarantine measures for newly introduced poultry into the flock?’ and we modified the question to ‘Do you keep newly introduced poultry separate from other poultry in a safe and separate place/house before introducing into the existing poultry flock?’. A total of 144 backyard chicken farmers were interviewed using the farm-level questionnaire. An interview lasted about 35 min. The interviews were conducted by one female and one male trained veterinarian.The village-level questionnaire was designed to collect information on environmental or ecological features, the village structure, types of agricultural production conducted within the village, poultry density, previous disease outbreaks and vaccination campaigns in the village. The first part of the questionnaire included 15 questions to be filled by the lead author of this paper based on observations made while walking through the village and examining environmental and agricultural village characteristics. The second part of the questionnaire included 11 questions on village demographics, poultry production and marketing within the village. The village-level questionnaire was also pilot-tested in two villages which were not included in the final study. The pilot testing resulted in the modification of five questions in the village-level questionnaire. For example, the original question, ‘Is there a live bird market in this village?’ was modified to ‘Is there any market within the village where trading of poultry is conducted?’. Answers to the second part of the village-level questionnaire were obtained through a Participatory Appraisal (PA) process. The PA was conducted as group discussions involving 5–7 key informants in each village. Key informants included the village headman, two experienced backyard chicken farmers, one Veterinary Field Assistant from the local livestock office, one school/college teacher or/and religious leader or/and a commercial poultry farmer. The key informants were contacted one week before the visit of the village. A PA lasted about 20 min.Informed consent (signaturehumb impression) was obtained from each farmer and village key informant prior to the interview, PA and sample collection.Serological samplingChickens and ducks of Deshi breed (‘indigenous’ in Bengali) raised under free-ranging or scavenging conditions were sampled on each farm. Blood samples were collected from 4 chickens (N = 144 farms), and when ducks were present (N = 102 farms), from 2 ducks on each farm. Depending on their body weight, 1–3 ml of blood were collected from the wing or jugular vein of each bird and transferred to a sterile plastic tube immediately after collection. The tube was kept in a cool box filled with ice packs and transported to the Chattogram Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (CVASU) laboratory (for samples collected in Chattogram) and to the local office of the District Livestock Services (for samples collected in Cox’s Bazaar). Samples were refrigerated overnight; the serum was then separated by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C and transferred to Eppendorf tubes.All serum samples were further processed at the CVASU laboratory, where the samples were first screened for the presence of antibodies against Influenza A virus using commercially available Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits (product code: 5004.20, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.,USA). Influenza A positive samples were then tested for the presence of H5 and H9 specific antibodies using the Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) test18. A serum sample was considered positive if there was an inhibition at a dilution of 1/16 (24) or more against 4 haemagglutinating units of antigen18.Data analysesQuestionnaire data were entered in Microsoft Access 2013 databases (Microsoft Corporation, USA). Data analysis was conducted in STATA 14.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA). Data analysis was conducted separately for H5 and H9.A total of 281 farm-level and 96 village-level dichotomous and ordinal categorical variables were derived from questionnaire data. For each AIV subtype, the proportion of positive and negative farms for each risk factor was calculated.To reduce the number of predictors, we used a correlation analysis to screen for unconditional associations52. Considering the dichotomous or ordinal nature of the predictors, pairwise correlations were examined by estimating the polychoric correlations coefficients53,54 using the -polychoric- command in STATA. If high correlation was identified (≥ 0.9 for H5/H9), only the most biologically plausible risk factor was kept.Considering that farms were clustered within villages, we used mixed-effect logistic regression55,56 with village as a random effect to explore the association between the H5 (or H9) serological status of a flock and the potential risk factors. For categorical predictors with more than two levels, p values were computed using Wald tests (-testparm- command). All farm and village-level predictors associated with a p value ≤ 0.15 in the univariate analysis were further screened for pairwise correlations. Multi-variable mixed-effects logistic regression models with village as a random effect were built for each AIV subtype using a backward stepwise elimination procedure. Farm and village-level predictors were considered together in the same models. At each step, the predictors with the highest p value were removed, until all predictors remaining in the model had p values < 0.05. We also assessed for potential confounding by subsequently adding eliminated risk factors that were considered as potential confounders based on the hypothesized casual diagrams. A change in Odds Ratio (OR) > 30%52 for any of the predictors following the inclusion of potential confounders was considered as an indication of confounding. Biologically plausible 2-way interactions of risk factors selected in the final mixed-effect model were also explored52.Furthermore, the residual Intra-class Correlation (ICC) was estimated to examine the impact of the village-level random effect, using ICC ≥ 0.05 as a ‘cutoff point’57. Finally, as there are not any standard measures to test the overall goodness of fit of mixed-effect model52, we assessed the impact of potential outliers by plotting the residuals and assessing the normality and heteroscedasticity of their distribution.Ethics approval and consent to participateEthics approval for the research was obtained from the relevant ethics committees at the University of Queensland: animal ethics approval (approval umber: SVS/465/15/RVC) and human ethcis approval (approval number: 2015001703). Informed written consent was obtained from all participants (backyard farmers and PA participants) before the interviews/PA discussions and sample collection from their birds.

O. Nguyen ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0002-9294-76931 Nature Immunology volume 23, pages 1135–1137 (2022)Cite this article 6685 Accesses 2 Citations 2 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects Follicular T-helper cellsHumoral immunityInfluenza virusVaccines Wherry and colleagues describe how anti-PD-1 immunotherapy impacts outcomes of influenza vaccination in patients with cancer, and specifically, how it increases seroconversion and affects quantitative and qualitative aspects of antibodies and follicular T helper cell responses. Discovery of the programmed death molecule 1, PD-1, on T cells was a major breakthrough that led to the development of immune checkpoint receptors for cancer treatment, and consequently the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for Tasuku Honjo. Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy is now widely used for the treatment of several cancers to boost patients’ CD8+ T cell immunity. Yet, effects of anti-PD-1 therapy on other key immune cell subsets remain understudied. Of particular interest is the effect of anti-PD-1 treatment on circulating T follicular helper (cTFH) cells, classically expressing PD-1 and playing an important part in germinal center (GC) reactions within lymphoid tissues following infection and vaccination. In this issue of Nature Immunology, Herati et al.1 defined quantitative and qualitative effects of anti-PD-1 therapy on cTFH cells and humoral responses to influenza vaccination. Robust cTFH cell responses were also observed in a subset of patients on anti-PD-1 therapy with immune-related adverse events (irAE) associated with immunotherapy.In 2008, Wrammert and colleagues2 first reported the rise and fall of plasmablasts, also called antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), in response to influenza vaccination in blood samples obtained prior to vaccination, at 1 week post-vaccination (peak of plasmablast response) and 1 month later (peak of antibody response). Since then, studies have shown that plasmablast and cTFH cell frequencies concurrently peaked at 1 week, and correlated with antibody and memory B cell responses following influenza vaccination3,4,5. The role of cTFH cells is also evident in influenza virus infection6 and more recently, SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or mRNA vaccination7,8,9,10. Herati and colleagues1 have now used the influenza vaccination model with similar blood sampling timepoints in two independent anti-PD-1 immunotherapy cohorts, including patients with renal cell or urothelial carcinoma (cohort 1 includes cancer patients with and without anti-PD-1 treatment) and melanoma patients (cohort 2 also includes cancer patients with anti-PD-1 treatment and healthy adults for comparative analyses).Activated memory CXCR5+ cTFH cells are typically characterized by their co-expression of ICOS and PD-1. Since PD-1 expression is lacking in anti-PD-1-treated patients, activated cTFH cell populations were characterized by their co-expression of ICOS and CD38; ICOS+PD-1+ and ICOS+CD38+ cTFH subsets have been used interchangeably with similar outcomes in the previous infection and/or vaccination studies mentioned above. Herati and colleagues showed that patients with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy had higher seroconversion and numerically higher fold-change increases in ICOS+CD38+ cTFH responses at 1 week post-vaccination compared to patients not treated with anti-PD-1 or to healthy control adults. Robust cTFH responses in anti-PD-1-treated patients coincided with numerical increases in plasmablasts as well as plasma concentrations of CXCL13, a biomarker of GC activity in lymphoid tissue (Fig. 1). However, functional analyses of the antibody response revealed qualitative impairments in anti-PD-1-treated patients, with lower affinity and less galactosylated/sialylated hemagglutinin-specific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibodies found at baseline compared to healthy controls. Fc glycosylation events are of importance as they can regulate antibody function.Fig. 1: Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy impacts immune responses to influenza vaccines in cancer patients.a,b, Frequencies of circulating T follicular helper (cTFH) cells, plasmablasts (also known as antibody-secreting cells (ASCs)) and plasma CXCL13 concentrations are increased in patients receiving anti-PD-1 immunotherapy 1 week after influenza vaccination (b) compared to baseline (a). Anti-PD-1 was also associated with altered antibody responses. In patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy, proliferation and cell cycle genes are upregulated in cTFH cells and plasmablasts, but cytokine signaling pathway genes are downregulated. These transcriptional profiles are enriched in anti-PD-1-treated patients with immune-related adverse events (irAE). aIgG4 MFI, aglycosylated immunoglobulin G4 median fluorescence intensity levels.Full size imageHerati and colleagues very clearly and elegantly delved further to transcriptionally profile cTFH cell and ASC populations in healthy adults and anti-PD-1-treated patients using bulk mRNA sequencing methods. Gene ontology and gene set enrichment analyses of the rich dataset revealed upregulation of proliferation and cell cycle genes in cTFH cells and ASCs at 1 week after influenza vaccination in anti-PD-1-treated patients compared to healthy controls, which aligned with the numerical fold-increases by flow cytometry. However, genes associated with leukocyte activation and cytokine signaling pathways were downregulated in anti-PD-1-treated patients but were enriched in the healthy adults, perhaps representing an “exhausted” phenotype similarly observed in CD8+ T cells of cancer patients on anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Therefore, it seems that PD-1 blockade may actually dysregulate cTFH cell and humoral responses by unblocking their proliferative response, while dampening the overall immune response such as downregulating key cTFH cytokine circuits to adequately facilitate humoral responses.Defining cellular or molecular biomarkers for predicting better or worse outcomes in clinical settings has been the holy grail for physicians, immunologists, and the like. One major drawback of PD-1 checkpoint blockade in cancer immunotherapy is the development of irAE, which leads to morbidity and discontinuation of therapy. Differentially expressed genes were indeed already identified in ICOS+CD38+ cTFH cells at baseline between anti-PD-1-treated patients who developed irAE and non-irAE patients1. Baseline cTFH cells from irAE patients were more activated and proliferative but were blunted in cytokine signaling pathways compared to non-irAE patients, with higher cell surface ICOS and aglycosylated immunoglobulin G4 (aIgG4) median fluorescence intensity levels, suggesting that a higher cTFH activation state was associated with the development of irAE. However, since only half of irAE patients had higher fold-change increases in ICOS+CD38+ cTFH cells at 1 week following influenza vaccination, questions remain about whether the other ~50% of patients were transcriptionally similar to non-irAE patients on anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, although the numbers are too small for such comparisons. Therefore, these observations need to be confirmed in larger cohorts and future studies. But for now, these highly activated cTFH cell populations in the context of influenza vaccination serve as a very promising tool for predicting development of irAE in cancer immunotherapy patients.Circulating CXCR5+ TFH cells can be further characterized by expression of CXCR3 and/or CCR6 to define type 1 cTFH1 (CXCR3+), type 2 cTFH2 (CXCR3−CCR6−) and interleukin-17-expressing cTFH17 (CCR6+) subsets. Influenza vaccination, typically with protein-based formulations, and influenza virus infection can elicit more robust cTFH1 cell responses compared to cTFH2 and cTFH17 subsets3,5,6. Enrichment of SARS-CoV-2-specific cTFH1 responses over cTFH2 and cTFH17 have also been observed following SARS-CoV-2 infection and mRNA vaccination9, as well as following COVID-19 vaccination with a protein-based Spike-clamp vaccine candidate from an earlier phase I clinical trial11. Tucked away nicely in Extended Data Fig. 1, Herati and colleagues showed that at 1 week after influenza vaccination, frequencies of CXCR3+ICOS+CD38+ cTFH1 cells were equally increased in both healthy adults and anti-PD-1-treated patients, whereas cTFH2 and cTFH17 frequencies decreased. Numerically, if ICOS+CD38+ cTFH1 cells were compared, would there have been fold-change differences between healthy and anti-PD-1-treated cohorts experiencing irAE or not? If cell numbers and sequencing costs were not an issue in this day and age, it would be tantalizing to further tease out these cTFH cell subsets transcriptionally to see whether the re-wiring effects of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy was preferentially affecting type 1 responses, particularly as the authors report downregulation of more type 1 cytokine signaling circuits in the parent cTFH populations (that is, IFNγ, IL-2/STAT5, TNF/NF-κB, IL-6/JAK/STAT3).Overall, Herati and colleagues have proven that measuring real-time human immune responses to influenza vaccination remains a highly valuable tool, not only to measure immune protection from severe influenza disease with annual influenza vaccine updates, but also to decipher key mechanisms underlying the re-wiring immunological effects of anti-PD-1 treatment in cancer immunotherapy patients. It remains to be seen whether dysregulation of high activation/proliferation and blunted cytokine pathways on cTFH cells and plasmablasts, and ultimately GC reactions, will persist long-term after anti-PD-1 treatment has ceased.

Know all about Swine Flu from the experts here. With the monsoon making its way, the recent rise in the number of Swine Flu cases have been alarming. Swine Flu, also known as H1N1, is a human respiratory infection that is caused by an influenza started in pigs. Speaking to HT Lifestyle, Dr. Sumol Ratna, MD, Medicine, Assistant Professor, Noida International Institute of Medical Sciences said, “The influenza type A viral infection known as swine flu spread widely during the 2009–2010 worldwide pandemic, which was the first flu pandemic in more than 40 years. The novel H1N1 influenza virus, which is composed of human, avian (bird), and swine genes, combined in pigs and then spread to humans, was the culprit. The H1N1 virus is currently included in the flu vaccine and is regarded as a typical seasonal flu strain.” Rise in Swine Flu cases: Doctors explain causes, symptoms, treatment(Unsplash) Dr Satish Kaul, Internal Medicine, Fortis Memorial Research Institute further noted down the causes of Swine Flu and reason for the infection. ALSO READ: Second swine flu case surfaces in Kanpur Causes: “Swine flu or Influenza is a respiratory viral disease caused by H1N1 variant of influenza virus. The spread is though air borne and droplet infection or touching surface which has been contaminated with airway secretions of a patient. The incubation period is 2 to 8 days and the illness is manifested by flu like symptoms,” said Dr Satish Kaul. Symptoms: Swine flu symptoms are similar to those of regular flu. The symptoms include a cold, cough, fever, exhaustion, headache, sore throat, cough that causes shortness of breath, decreased appetite, vomiting, or diarrhoea. There could be respiratory collapse and death in severe situations, but this is uncommon. The majority of people only experience moderate symptoms. Treatment: “Swine flu is treated with antiviral medications like Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and Zamanivir (Relenza). Relenza is a nasal spray, whereas tamiflu is a pill. If pneumonia or chest infections arise, more antibiotic treatment may be necessary. If hospital admission is not necessary, you must abide by the subsequent safety measures and maintain good hand- and respiratory hygiene,” added Dr. Sumol Ratna. Catch every big hit,...

Please refer Seasonal Influenza for regional updates Actual increase in the number of ILI cases is seen in Kiribati, Wallis & Futuna, Fiji, New Caledonia and RMI for the week. The increase seen in Fiji and New Caledonia may be due to the increased number of sites reported for the week. A reduction of ILI cases were seen in Palau, Solomon Islands, Pitcairn Islands, CNMI and Cook Islands. The decrease seen in Solomon Islands may be due to the decreased number of sites reported for the week. No ILI cases reported from Niue and Tokelau I for the week. No reports were available from French Polynesia, FSM, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Tonga and Samoa for the week. American Samoa, Guam and Nauru have not participated in the surveillance. Surveillance figures are not intended to capture all country cases but to describe trends over time and are invaluable when trends rise beyond country baselines which should then trigger alerts and timely actions to characterize the actual nature and magnitude of the disease. Palau: On 27 July 2022, the Ministry of Health updated the current influenza A outbreak through social media that the outbreak has begun to decline from last week's peak. From June 22 - July 24, 2022 a total of 145 confirmed Influenza A virus and a few coinfection with COVID -19 were reported. Most of these cases were seen among the children and elderly. The ministry continues to alert the public since the outpatient surge remains high for ILI cases. Vanuatu is experiencing a surge of ILI cases in their health facilities. Laboratory testing has confirmed Influenza A circulation in their community. Samoa for influenza A and B after increasing ILI was seen in outpatients and laboratory confirmed cases.

(Thomas Carter via AP) By UPDATED: July 27, 2022 at 11:24 AM ESTThe 1918 flu pandemic is considered one of the most deadly of all time, and although it has never been completely eradicated, the pandemic came to an end after about two years and three waves of infection.Related Articles Health | The 1918 influenza pandemic: A timeline of events The “Spanish” flu was first found in U.S. soldiers and popped up in Europe and Asia in March of 1918. It was a form of an avian flu originating in birds. While the first wave was mild, the second was extremely deadly, with nearly 200,000 American deaths in October 1918 alone.The spread was exacerbated by travel for World War I, and the same public health measures used today, such as masking and social distancing, were implemented to help stop the spread.However, the flu whipped around the world with such intensity that 500 million people were infected, which accounted for one-third of the global population at the time. Hospitals were overwhelmed, businesses shut down and morgues were overrun with the dead, according to records kept by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.A third wave triggered by the end of WWI started to subside over the summer, and by 1920, the pandemic had ended and moved into an endemic stage, meaning clusters were only found in certain regions and cases spiked seasonally just like the cold and flu does now.The 1918 pandemic ended due to public health measures and herd immunity that was achieved by the colossal amount of infection.One-third of the world was infected with the Spanish flu, and eventually, so many people either died from it or had immunity that the disease had nowhere to go.Unfortunately, coronavirus is nowhere near having sickened one-third of the globe, which would be about 2.6 billion people. Recorded COVID-19 cases currently stand at 268 million. But the 1918 pandemic never disappeared completely; it continued to survive by becoming less virulent, and today, modern flu strains still contain ancestral links to the pandemic that happened more than 100 years ago.Dr. Todd Ellerin, director of infectious disease at South Shore Health, said coronavirus will never end either, thanks to its rapid mutations. He said coronavirus will just evolve and hopefully morph into a seasonal illness to which we pay little mind, but it’s still too soon to know if that will happen.Ellerin said there’s “no prospect” of herd immunity like there was in 1918, but tools like vaccines, boosters and natural immunity will help combat the severity of coronavirus in all its forms.

BROAD CAST - Jing Castañeda - Philstar.comJuly 26, 2022 | 5:10pm Senior citizens are encouraged to get flu vaccines every year. Studies show that they are among the most vulnerable to influenza, accounting for 70% of flu-related hospitalizations and 85% of flu-related deaths annually. Muntinlupa City PIO It may be tempting to think of influenza, the common flu, as just a normal inconvenience. After all, almost all of us have endured several bouts of the flu through the years. And each time, we’ve managed to kick that bug after a few days of rest, right? But is the flu as harmless as we’ve been led to believe? That’s exactly what I wanted to find out in a recent episode of #PamilyaTalk entitled “Flu Fighter: Iligtas si Lolo’t Lola sa Flu.” Three special guests — pulmonologist Dr. Jennifer Ann Mendoza-Wi, Head, TB Assembly, Asian Pacific Society of Respirology; infectious disease expert Dr. Arthur Dessi Roman; and Mr. Jorge L. Banal Sr., known to us as Tito Jorge and current president of the Federation of Senior Citizen Association of the Philippines Inc.— joined me in this most informative discussion. Caption: Senior citizens are encouraged to get flu vaccines every year. Studies show that they are among the most vulnerable to influenza, accounting for 70% of flu-related hospitalizations and 85% of flu-related deaths annually. (Photo: Muntinlupa City PIO) Some alarming facts and figures According to the World Health Organization (WHO), up to one billion (1B) people catch the flu annually. That’s more than 12% of the world’s total population. Of those 1B, anywhere from three million (3M) to five million (5M) people come down with a severe, life-threatening case of the flu. But medical experts also call the flu a self-limiting disease, one that naturally runs its course and resolves itself over time. So everyone who comes down with it will eventually get 100% better, right? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Influenza kills up to 650,000 people each year. Clearly, this illness is as deceptive as it is deadly. Additionally, senior citizens are among the most vulnerable to influenza, accounting for 70% of flu-related hospitalizations and 85% of flu-related deaths annually. Why? According to Dr. Remedios Coronel, past president of the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, it’s because of an inevitable consequence of aging called immunosenescence. This is a naturally-occurring process that makes our immune system degrade and become less efficient over time. Thus, the more we age, the more immunocompromised we become. Complications: That which does not kill us… Some may argue that 650,000 deaths amount to just 0.065% of the population. That’s such a negligible percentage compared to the 99.935% that do survive. But the loved ones of each of those fatalities would surely beg to differ. Besides, even if the flu is considered self-limiting, Dr. Wi said that it doesn’t mean that all those who recover from it are completely out of the proverbial woods. Because contrary to Nietzche’s famous adage, when it comes to the flu, that which does not kill us won’t necessarily make us stronger. Rather, it may lead to long-term complications that can significantly decrease the quality of life and can even prove to be lethal. According to Dr. Wi, flu complications increase the risk of a heart attack by up to 10 times. They also increase the risk of pneumonia by up to eight times. Other possible complications include asthma, chronic lung disease, and even stroke, all of which can be fatal for all ages, but most especially to the elderly. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, flu vaccination programs of different LGUs are still in full swing. Tarlac City Information Office FB Page More bad news: My, my, my, my Flurona With COVID-19 infections back on the rise, it’s possible to catch the flu and the coronavirus at the same time. Both Dr. Wi and Dr. Roman emphasized that this co-infection, dubbed Flurona, puts the sick person at higher risk for the deadly complications of both the flu and the coronavirus. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the Flurona is now a worldwide concern, with incidences reported in the United States, Israel, Hungary, Brazil, and—brace yourself, dear reader—--even the Philippines. This co-infection may potentially lead to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart attack, heart or brain inflammation, stroke, organ failure and death. Finally, some good news The common flu, COVID-19, and Flurona are all preventable. Since the flu and Flurona are transmitted in pretty much the same way as COVID-19, Dr. Roman stressed the need to abide by the recommended minimum public health standards that we’re now accustomed to. This means continuing to mask up properly, observe social distancing, and practice good hand hygiene. But the most crucial step is to get vaccinated. For COVID-19, this entails the recommended first two doses and subsequent booster shots. For influenza, this means getting your flu shot every year. For more information on how the flu vaccine works to protect our dear Lolos and Lolas, please watch our Okay Doc special episode on vaccination on Pamilya Talk. Still iffy about vaccines? Here are some FAQs you should consider. Q: Is the flu shot safe? A: Yes! Health experts cannot stress this enough: Vaccines are designed to give you and your family protection against preventable yet potentially fatal diseases. Consequently, when you’re protected from such diseases, then you’re also protected from the complications that may arise from them. Q: Who should get vaccinated? A: Everyone six months old or older, including those with comorbidities. See? The flu shot is THAT safe and effective, even for babies and the elderly. Q: When’s the best time to get vaccinated against the flu? A: In the Philippines, ideally between February and June, before the start of the rainy season. But if you missed these months, it’s never too late to get vaccinated at any other time. It’s never too late to make sure you and your loved ones are protected. Q: Why is it necessary to get vaccinated against the flu every year? A: To keep your protection at optimal and updated levels. This is because the protection offered by the vaccine declines over time. Flu viruses also keep changing, thus the shots need to be updated accordingly, often depending on the strains that are more dominant in the upcoming flu season. Q: Where can I get vaccinated? A: Ask your local health center or family physician. According to Tito Jorge, senior citizens are entitled to FREE flu shots, among other vaccines, courtesy of the Department of Health (DOH) and their local government unit (LGU) by virtue of the Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010. Remember: There’s absolutely no truth that vaccines are harmful to the body. They’re carefully engineered to provide you and your family protection against preventable yet potentially fatal diseases as well as the complications that come with them. Vaccines aren't just safe, they're life-saving, especially for the elderly. -- Watch Pamilya Talk on Facebook, YouTube and Kumu (@JingCastaneda – 12:00 noon – 1:00 p.m. Monday & Wednesday).

Check out the telltale signs of this disease. Mumbai On High Alert Over Swine Flu After City Reports Surge In Deaths Written by Satata Karmakar |Updated : July 25, 2022 10:26 AM IST Mumbai, Maharashtra residents are on a high alert after the state reported seven deaths due to swine flu infections. According to the officials, the deadly flu has claimed two lives in Pune, three in Kolhapur, and two in the Thane Corporation of Maharashtra. Taking cognizance of the situation, the Mumbaikars have been asked to remain vigilant and track the symptoms of the infection carefully. Speaking to the media about the worsening situation, Dr Pradeep Awate, a state surveillance officer, said, "We are taking appropriate action to enhance surveillance. Prevention and control measures are being implemented." This comes at a time when the country is fighting a rising number of COVID re-infections and the sudden outbreak of the monkeypox virus. Just like the other outbreak, the H1N1 virus is also triggering cases in several parts of the country. Look at the current situation, the question that is hovering in the minds of the people is - can swine flu or H1N1 flu become a new pandemic in the future? According to Health experts, flu does not have very serious consequences but those who have comorbid conditions need to be careful. Let's understand more about swine flu and the symptoms it can cause.
