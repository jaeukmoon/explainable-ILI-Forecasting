However, concurrent measurement of viral load in the air is typically not a component of such studies. To address this knowledge gap, we measured the levels of virus in ferret nasal washes as well as viral RNA emitted into the air for 14 diverse influenza viruses, encompassing human-, swine-, and avian-origin strains. Here we show that transmissible viruses display robust replication and fast release into the air. In contrast, poorly- and non-transmissible viruses show significantly reduced or delayed replication along with lower detection of airborne viral RNA at early time points post inoculation. These findings indicate that efficient ferret-to-ferret transmission via the air is directly associated with fast emission of virus-laden particles; as such, quantification of viral RNA in the air represents a useful addition to established assessments of new influenza virus strains.

The virus must be antigenically distinct from human influenza viruses to which we have immunity, be able to infect and efficiently replicate in a human host, and possess molecular features facilitating sustained transmission among people. Zoonotic influenza viruses occasionally cross species barriers to cause human infection; however, despite a lack of preexisting immunity in the human population to most of these viruses, subsequent human-to-human transmission is typically not observed1. The ferret model is currently the most valuable tool to study the transmissibility of influenza viruses in a laboratory setting, in that they are naturally susceptible to influenza virus infection, can display pronounced clinical signs of infection, and can transmit virus to naïve animals2. The Respiratory Droplet Transmission (RDT) model involves housing of infected and naïve ferrets in adjacent cages, which allows for the exchange of air through perforated cage walls but eliminates direct and indirect contact between animals, facilitating airborne-only transmission (inclusive of droplet and droplet nuclei transmission). The Direct Contact Transmission (DCT) model involves housing an infected ferret in the same cage as a naïve ferret, facilitating any mode of transmission (direct, indirect, and/or via the air)3. Human adapted H1 and H3 subtype viruses typically transmit efficiently between ferrets in both models4,5. In contrast, zoonotic influenza viruses, including those isolated from humans, display a variety of transmission profiles in the ferret model. Generally, H5 subtype viruses are unable to transmit, whereas H7 and H9 viruses vary from those that are unable to transmit in direct contact setting to those that are capable of transmission in either model6. Swine-origin H1 and H3 viruses typically transmit efficiently between cohoused ferrets but less frequently via air, but in rare cases, transmission occurs as efficiently as human seasonal viruses7,8,9.Scientists undertake tremendous efforts to routinely monitor and characterize newly emerging viruses for pandemic preparedness, inclusive of research conducted to identify strain specific differences in transmission profiles and the mutations required for adaptation to a new host10. There is also significant interest in elucidating the kinetics of virus shedding following infection and quantifying viral load released into the air; an area of research that is understudied due to practical and methodological challenges. Although most bioaerosol sampling devices are suitable for collection and study of pathogens aerosolized in laboratory settings, efficient collection of virus-laden particles emitted (at much lower rate and concentration) from experimentally inoculated animals is challenging11,12,13. Range of instruments including aerosol particle counters, cyclone samplers, and cascade impactors, have been used to evaluate size-distribution and the quantity of influenza virus emitted into the air by inoculated ferrets14,15,16,17. These studies support that particle size represents an important consideration in virus transmission, with most of the viral RNA and infectious virus found in particles larger than 1.5 µm and transmission via the air largely mediated by particles in that size range14,15. While the size of virus-laden particles affects the initial site of virus deposition, transmission can only occur if the virus can bind to the epithelial cells at the deposition site18,19. Upper respiratory tract epithelium that is enriched in alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid (α2,6 SA) receptors has been recognized as a critical determinant for influenza virus transmission20,21. In agreement, human-adapted influenza viruses which preferentially bind α2,6 SA receptors are capable of efficient replication at that site, in contrast to avian-origin viruses which preferentially bind alpha 2,3-linked sialic acid (α2,3 SA) receptors22,23. Previous studies reported a link between viral gene constellations, the quantity of virus-laden particles released from infected ferrets, and airborne transmission15,16. Consistent with this observation, avian H5N1 influenza viruses, which were not capable of airborne transmission in ferrets, were detected in breath and sneeze collected from anaesthetized ferrets at lower quantities as compared to human-adapted viruses that transmitted well in this model14 highlighting the need for more extensive comparative analysis encompassing wider variety of IAV strains.In this study, we sought to expand on previous analyses by employing a wide range of human-adapted, swine-origin, and avian-origin influenza A viruses (IAVs), with diverse gene constellations and mammalian transmissibility phenotypes. Airborne particles were collected from unanesthetized ferrets using a National Institute for Occupational Health (NIOSH) bioaerosol sampler that fractions air particles into three sizes (>4, 1–4, <1 µm)24, followed by real-time RT-PCR quantification of influenza virus M segment RNA. To better understand the link between virus release into the air and airborne transmission, the majority of these experiments were performed concurrent with pathogenesis and transmission assessments. We found that for viruses capable of transmitting through the air between ferrets, significantly higher levels of viral RNA were detected in both nasal wash and air samples, and detection was typically at earlier days post-inoculation compared with viruses that were not capable of efficient airborne transmission. These data indicate that robust replication in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets and early release of virus into the air represent important factors required for efficient transmission.ResultsComparison of viral RNA shedding following inoculation of ferrets with IAVs displaying diverse transmissibility profilesThe 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza pandemic highlighted the potential of swine-origin influenza viruses to cause human disease and global spread. Since then, there has been an increased focus on IAV surveillance and mammalian transmissibility assessments using the ferret model. Swine-origin influenza viruses typically transmit easily between cohoused ferrets but differ widely in their ability to transmit between ferrets in setting where direct and indirect contact (fomites on intermediate surfaces) are eliminated, and transmission can only occur via air7,9. Unfortunately, routine ferret transmission studies do not include assessments of the kinetics and levels of virus released into the air by infected animals. To address this gap in knowledge we analyzed virus levels in nasal washes concurrent with quantification of viral RNA levels in the air. We selected three H1 subtype swine-origin influenza viruses which were previously shown to transmit between ferrets in a direct contact setting but displayed differences in transmission via air: A/Minnesota/45/2016 (MN/45) A(H1N2)v virus transmitted between 3/3 ferret pairs, A/Ohio/09/2015 (OH/09) A(H1N1)v virus transmitted between 1/3 ferret pairs, while A/Ohio/02/2007 (OH/02) A(H1N1)v virus did not transmit via air between any of the ferret pairs (Table 1)25,26,27. To evaluate airborne virus shedding three ferrets per group were inoculated with each of the 3 viruses. Nasal washes were collected from inoculated ferrets every other day for 9 days post-inoculation (p.i.) and were analyzed to determine the levels of infectious virus and viral RNA. Simultaneously, aerosols were sampled from ferret cages for 2 h/day on days 1, 2, 3, and 5 p.i. using a two-stage cyclone aerosol sampler (BC 251 model) that separates particles based on size into three fractions: >4 µm, 4–1 µm, and <1 µm24. Infectious virus was detected in nasal wash specimens for all viruses up to day 5 p.i., while viral RNA was detected through day 9 p.i. Viral RNA copy number averages were 1.9–3.7 orders of magnitude higher than average infectious virus titers detected between days 1 and 5 p.i. Comparable mean peak nasal wash titers were observed for MN/45 and OH/09 viruses (7.0 and 6.9 log10 PFU/mL, and 9.2 and 8.9 log10 RNA copies/mL, respectively), both of which were higher than observed peak titers for OH/02 virus (5.3 log10 PFU/ml and 8.1 log10 RNA copies/mL) (Fig. 1a, c, e). Despite high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract as measured in ferret nasal wash samples on day 1 p.i., negligible levels of viral RNA were detected in the air on day 1 p.i. (Fig. 1b, d. f). However, by day 2 p.i., high levels of viral RNA were detected in the air from all ferrets inoculated with MN/45 and OH/09 viruses. The viral RNA was collected primarily in the >4 µm fraction and was detectable for most ferrets through day 5 p.i. In contrast, the OH/02 virus RNA was not elevated in air samples until day 5 p.i. To determine whether the differences in replication kinetics and release of viral RNA into the air were statistically significant between the viruses tested, we compared area under the curve values for viral RNA copies detected in the nasal wash specimens and in the air collected through day 5 p.i. The results revealed that the viral RNA copy numbers in nasal washes as well as in the air samples collected from ferrets infected by OH/02 virus were significantly lower than for those infected by MN/45 virus, a highly transmissible virus (p = 0.02) (Fig. 1g, h). Collectively, these data show that collection of virus-laden aerosols shed by influenza virus-infected ferrets can provide meaningful contextual information regarding transmission capability, especially when collected early after inoculation.Table 1 Transmissibility profiles of IAVs evaluated in this study.Full size tableFig. 1: Influenza A viral RNA measured in the air following inoculation of ferrets.Nasal wash specimens from ferrets (n = 3 per virus) inoculated with A/Minnesota/45/2016 A(H1N2)v a, A/Ohio/09/2015 A(H1N1)v c, and A/Ohio/02/2007 A(H1N1)v e were collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 p.i. Infectious virus was quantified by standard plaque assay (solid lines) and viral RNA copies were quantified using real time qRT-PCR (dashed lines). Individual ferrets are shown as different symbols (ferret 1-green square, ferret 2-black circle, ferret 3-purple triangle). Limit of detection was 1 log10 PFU/ml or RNA copies/ml of nasal wash. Air samples were collected from each ferret cage for 2 hours on indicated days using a two-stage cyclone sampler which fractioned particles by size: >4 µm, 1–4 µm, <1 µm. Viral RNA in each sample was quantified using real time qRT-PCR and the data for each virus; A/Minnesota/45/2016 A(H1N2)v b, A/Ohio/09/2015 A(H1N1)v d, A/Ohio/02/2007 A(H1N1)v f, and individual ferret is shown. Limit of detection was 21 copies per 210 liters of air collected at each time point (0.1 RNA copy/L of air). Summary figures comparing viral RNA copies detected in the nasal wash specimens g and in the air h collected through day 5 p.i. The points on graphs are the data for individual ferrets, the bars represent minimum and maximum, and the lines represents the mean. Area under the curve for each of these time courses was calculated and statistical significance was evaluated using One-Way ANOVA (Tukey’s post-test [g]) and Kruskal-Wallis test (Dunn’s post-test [h]). *p < 0.05.Full size imageQuantification of airborne viral RNA following inoculation of ferrets with IAVs that transmit via airNext, we sought to quantify the levels of viral RNA released into the air by inoculated ferrets that were housed in cages adjacent to contact ferrets during experiments utilizing the RDT model. Perforated sidewalls adjoining the cages were blocked during air collection to prevent collecting air from the contact ferrets. Viruses examined included three human seasonal influenza viruses [A/Idaho/07/2018 (ID/07) A(H1N1)pdm09, A/Michigan/45/2015 (MI/45) A(H1N1)pdm09, A/Nebraska/14/2019 (NE/14) A(H1N1)pdm09], three swine-origin influenza viruses [A/Michigan/288/2019 (MI/288) A(H1N1)v, A/California/62/2018 (CA/62) A(H1N2)v, A/Ohio/24/2017 (OH/24) A(H1N2)v], and one low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus [A/Anhui-Lujiang/39/2018 (Anhui-Lujiang/39) A(H9N2)]. Detailed information about clinical signs of infection as well as transmission and pathogenesis data can be found in references provided in Table 1. ID/07, MI/45, NE/14, and MI/288 viruses transmitted efficiently through the air between 3/3 ferret pairs by day 5 post-contact, Anhui-Lujiang/39 virus transmitted by day 3 p.c. between 2/3 ferret pairs, while CA/62 and OH/24 viruses transmitted by day 3 p.c. between 1/3 ferret pairs as evidenced by detection of infectious virus in nasal wash samples5,28. Viral RNA copy levels in nasal washes from animals inoculated with viruses that transmitted efficiently through the air (ID/7, MI/45, NE/14, and MI/288 peaked on day 1 p.i. and ranged between 9.3 and 10.0 log10 RNA copies/mL, which was 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than infectious virus (Fig. 2a, c, e, g). Viruses that transmitted inefficiently via air between ferrets (CA/62, OH/24, and Anhui-Lujiang/39) peaked variably between day 1 and 5 p.i., and the mean peak titers were 8.2–8.5 log10 RNA copies/mL (Fig. 2i, k, m).Fig. 2: Influenza A viral RNA measured in the air during ferret transmission experiments.Three ferrets per group were inoculated with A/Idaho/07/2018 A(H1N1)pdm09 a, A/Michigan/45/2015 A(H1N1)pdm09 c, A/Nebraska/14/2019 A(H1N1)pdm09 e, A/Michigan/288/2019 A(H1N1)v g, A/Anhui-Lujiang/39/2018 A(H9N2) i, A/California/62/2018 A(H1N2)v k, A/Ohio/24/2017 A(H1N2)v m. The following day a naïve ferret was placed in an adjacent cage allowing for air exchange via perforated cage walls to assess airborne transmission. Infectious virus in nasal wash samples was quantified using plaque assay or by egg titration (solid lines; data source listed in Table 1; limit of detection 1 log10 PFU/ml or 1.5 log10 EID50/ml), and viral RNA copies were quantified using real time qRT-PCR (dashed lines; data generated in this study; limit of detection 1 log10 RNA copies/ml). Individual ferrets are shown as different symbols (ferret 1-green square, ferret 2-black circle, ferret 3-purple triangle). The plus sign indicates that infectious virus was detected in nasal wash samples collected from contact animals by day 5 post-contact; the negative sign indicates that transmission did not occur as confirmed by lack of the virus in nasal wash samples and by lack of seroconversion (Transmission data source listed in Table 1). Air samples were collected from each ferret cage for 2 h on indicated days using a two-stage cyclone sampler which fractioned particles by size: >4 µm, 1–4 µm, <1 µm (perforated cage side wall was blocked during air sampling). Viral RNA in each sample was quantified using real time qRT-PCR and the data for each virus; A/Idaho/07/2018 A(H1N1)pdm09 b, A/Michigan/45/2015 A(H1N1)pdm09 d, A/Nebraska/14/2019 A(H1N1)pdm09 f, A/Michigan/288/2019 A(H1N1)v h, A/Anhui-Lujiang/39/2018 A(H9N2) j, A/California/62/2018 A(H1N2)v l, A/Ohio/24/2017 A(H1N2)v n, and individual ferrets is shown (limit of detection 0.1 RNA copy/L of air).Full size imageFor most ferrets inoculated with ID/7, MI/45, NE/14 or MI/288 virus, airborne viral RNA was detected at quantities ≥2 log10 RNA copies/L of air starting on day 1 p.i. and was maintained at 2-4 log10 RNA copies/L on days 2 and 3 p.i. (Fig. 2b, d, f, h). Animals inoculated with the Anhui-Lujiang/39 virus or CA/62 virus released negligible quantities of viral RNA into the air on day 1 p.i. (Fig. 2j, l). The two ferrets (Ferret 2 and 3) inoculated with Anhui-Lujiang/39 virus that released 3–4 log10 RNA copies/L on days 2–5 p.i. transmitted virus to their respective contact ferrets. Ferret 1, which released <1 log10 RNA copies/L on days 1–3 p.i., and 5.3 log10 RNA copies/L on day 5 p.i., did not transmit virus to the contact animal. Transmission was not observed from donor ferrets 1 and 3 that were inoculated with CA/62 virus and released ≤1 log10 RNA copies/L on days 1–5, while transmission did occur for ferret 2 that released 1–2 log10 RNA copies/L on days 2–5. The OH/24-inoculated ferrets released high levels of viral RNA (up to 5.4 log10 RNA copies/L); however, transmission occurred only between one pair (Ferret 2, Fig. 2n), highlighting that other factors, in addition to the amount of airborne virus, play an important role in the transmission of zoonotic influenza viruses. Collectively, these data show that the animals releasing high quantities of viral RNA in the air at early time points post-inoculation were most frequently associated with transmission events to contact ferrets, whereas animals that released low levels of viral RNA in the air or that shed peak levels at later time points post-inoculation, were less likely to transmit virus to contact ferrets in this setting.Quantification of airborne viral RNA following inoculation of ferrets with IAVs that poorly transmitTo further expand our analysis, we next evaluated a panel of viruses that do not transmit or poorly transmit in the ferret model. As reported elsewhere (Table 1), the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/Yunnan/14563/2015 (Yunnan/14563) A(H5N6) virus did not transmit between co-housed ferrets, while the LPAI Aurkey/California/18-031151-4/2018 (tr/CA/18-031151-4) A(H7N3) and HPAI A/Sichuan/26221/2014 (Sichuan/26221) and A/duck/Bangladesh/19D770/2017 (dk/Bang/19D770) A(H5N6) viruses transmitted between 1/3 co-housed contact animals29,30. To investigate if reduced shedding of airborne viral RNA early after infection coincided with the lack of robust transmission among ferrets, we collected air from inoculated ferrets on days 1-3 p.i. (the period identified as most critical for transmission, Fig. 2). Out of the four viruses tested, ferrets inoculated with tr/CA/18-031151-4 virus displayed the lowest nasal wash RNA titers (5.9 log10 copies/mL) and released negligible levels of viral RNA into the air at ≤1.2 log10 copies/L on day 3 p.i. in the >4 µm fraction and <1 log10 copies/L in the other fractions (Fig. 3a, b). Ferrets inoculated with Sichuan/26221 virus also showed a delay in viral RNA release into the air with total titers up to 2.2 log10 RNA copies/L observed on day 3 p.i., which coincided with increased nasal wash titers observed at this later time point (mean peak of 7.9 log10 RNA copies/mL) (Fig. 3c, d). In the case of Yunnan/14563 virus-inoculated ferrets, 2/3 ferrets released 0.5–2.2 log10 RNA copies/L of air in the >4 µm fraction while the third ferret shed viral RNA in other fractions. Despite the differences in Yunnan/14563 RNA release into the air, comparable nasal wash titers were observed for the three ferrets with a mean peak at 7.4 log10 RNA copies/mL (Fig. 3e, f). Each of the three dk/Bang/19D770 virus-inoculated ferrets released detectable viral RNA into the air (≤2.0 log10 copies/L) by day 1 p.i.; however, only one of the ferrets maintained viral RNA shedding through days 2 and 3 p.i., while mean peak viral RNA levels in nasal wash were 6.4 log10 copies/ml from these ferrets (Fig. 3g, h). Unlike what was observed for the transmissible viruses, the avian strains tested here displayed less robust replication in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets, delayed replication kinetics, with low levels of viral RNA were released into the air within the first three days post-inoculation.Fig. 3: Quantification of airborne viral RNA released from ferrets inoculated with poorly transmissible influenza A viruses.Three ferrets per group were inoculated with Aurkey/California/18-031151-4/2018 A(H7N3) a, A/Sichuan/26221/2014 A(H5N6) c, A/Yunnan/14563/2015 A(H5N6) e, and A/duck/Bangladesh/19D770/2017 A(H5N6) g. Infectious virus in nasal wash samples was quantified by egg titration (solid lines; data source listed in Table 1; limit of detection 1 log10 EID50/ml), and viral RNA copies were quantified using real time qRT-PCR (dashed lines; data generated in this study; limit of detection 1 log10 RNA copies/ml). Each individual ferret is shown as a different symbol (ferret 1-green square, ferret 2-black circle, ferret 3-purple triangle). Air samples were collected from each ferret cage for 2 h on indicated days using a two-stage cyclone sampler which separated the aerosol particles based on size into three fractions: > 4 µm, 1–4 µm, <1 µm. Viral RNA in each sample was quantified using real time qRT-PCR and the data for each virus; Aurkey/California/18-031151-4/2018 A(H7N3) b, A/Sichuan/26221/2014 A(H5N6) d, A/Yunnan/14563/2015 A(H5N6) f, and A/duck/Bangladesh/19D770/2017 A(H5N6) h, and the individual ferret is shown (limit of detection 0.1 RNA copy/L of air).Full size imageComparative analysisPrevious studies have shown that the frequency of transmission through the air to a contact ferret decreases with time underscoring the importance of robust virus replication at early time points after inoculation15,31,32. To determine whether there is a significant difference in nasal wash titers collected at early times points p.i. (day 1, day 3 or peak titer) between transmissible and non-transmissible viruses we classified the viruses in three groups based on their transmissibility profile and performed statistical analyses. The results revealed that regardless of time point analyzed, viral RNA levels in nasal washes collected from ferrets inoculated with viruses that transmitted with 100% frequency though the air (transmission between 3/3 ferret pairs; ID/07, MI/45, NE/14, MI/288, MN/45) were significantly higher when compared to the titers detected from ferrets inoculated with viruses that transmitted less efficiently (Fig. 4). The levels of RNA in nasal wash samples collected on both day 1 and 3 p.i. from ferrets inoculated with viruses that transmitted with 66-33% frequency (transmission between 2/4 or 1/3 ferret pairs; Anhui-Lujiang/39, CA/62, OH/24, OH/09) were also significantly higher than titers detected from ferrets inoculated with viruses in the 0% transmission efficiency group (OH/02, tr/CA/18-031151-4, Sichuan/26221, Yunnan/14563, dk/Bang/19D770).Fig. 4: Comparison of viral RNA levels detected in nasal wash samples from ferrets inoculated with influenza A viruses displaying diverse transmission capabilities.Viral RNA copies in nasal wash samples collected from inoculated ferrets on day 1 p.i. a, day 3 p.i. b, or peak titer (either d1 or d3 p.i.) c are shown. Data were grouped by virus transmissibility profile in the ferret model (100%-transmission between all ferret pairs [A/Idaho/07/2018 A(H1N1)pdm09, A/Michigan/45/2015 A(H1N1)pdm09, A/Nebraska/14/2019 A(H1N1)pdm09, A/Michigan/288/2019 A(H1N1)v, A/Minnesota/45/2016 A(H1N2)v (3 ferrets per virus; n = 15)], 66–33% - transmission between 2/3 or 1/3 ferret pairs [A/Anhui-Lujiang/39/2018 A(H9N2), A/California/62/2018 A(H1N2)v, A/Ohio/24/2017 A(H1N2)v, A/Ohio/09/2015 A(H1N1)v (3 ferrets per virus; n = 12)], 0% - no transmission via air or inefficient direct contact transmission if airborne transmission was not tested [A/Ohio/02/2007 A(H1N1)v, Aurkey/California/18-031151-4/2018 A(H7N3), A/Sichuan/26221/2014 A(H5N6), A/Yunnan/14563/2015 A(H5N6), A/duck/Bangladesh/19D770/2017 A(H5N6) (3 ferrets per virus; n = 15)]. Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunn’s post-test were used to determine significant differences, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. Data points represent individual ferrets. Error bars represent median with interquartile range.Full size imageNext, we similarly analyzed the data obtained from air samples. Consistent with nasal wash RNA titer data, ferrets infected with transmissible viruses released significantly more viral RNA into the air than non-transmissible viruses at early timepoints p.i. (Fig. 5). The differences were more pronounced for viral particles collected in the >4 µm fraction, though some of these trends were also observed for particles 1–4 µm in size. In contrast, the viruses that displayed no or limited transmission were found at significantly higher levels in <1 µm fractions collected on day 3 p.i., indicating that this group of viruses may be aerosolized at later time points after inoculation from different parts of the ferret respiratory tract. Nonetheless, the overall levels of viral RNA in these fractions were much smaller as compared to other fractions. These data indicate that transmissible viruses have an upper respiratory tract replication advantage, thus achieving high replication peaks faster and releasing higher quantities of virus into the air, while viruses that are not capable of transmission via the air, in general, display delayed and lower nasal wash titers and peak titers in air samples.Fig. 5: Detection of influenza A virus genomic RNA in size-fractioned air samples collected from ferrets.Viral RNA copies in particle size-fractionated air samples collected from inoculated ferrets on days 1-3 and peak viral RNA copies are shown (total RNA is inclusive of all size fractions). Viruses were grouped by transmissibility profile in the ferret model (100%-transmission between all ferret pairs [A/Idaho/07/2018 A(H1N1)pdm09, A/Michigan/45/2015 A(H1N1)pdm09, A/Nebraska/14/2019 A(H1N1)pdm09, A/Michigan/288/2019 A(H1N1)v, A/Minnesota/45/2016 A(H1N2)v (3 ferrets per virus; n = 15)], 66–33%—transmission between 1/3 or 2/3 ferret pairs [A/Anhui-Lujiang/39/2018 A(H9N2), A/California/62/2018 A(H1N2)v, A/Ohio/24/2017 A(H1N2)v, A/Ohio/09/2015 A(H1N1)v (3 ferrets per virus; n = 12)], 0%—no transmission via air or inefficient direct contact transmission if airborne transmission was not tested [A/Ohio/02/2007 A(H1N1)v, Aurkey/California/18-031151-4/2018 A(H7N3), A/Sichuan/26221/2014 A(H5N6), A/Yunnan/14563/2015 A(H5N6), A/duck/Bangladesh/19D770/2017 A(H5N6) (3 ferrets per virus; n = 15)]. Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunn’s post-test was used to determine significant differences, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. Data points represent individual ferrets. Error bars represent the median with interquartile range.Full size imageDiscussionThe ferret is a valuable model of influenza virus transmission in humans and is routinely used for risk assessment of emerging strains. While it is well documented that human seasonal influenza viruses transmit more efficiently than most zoonotic viruses in this model, little is known about the kinetics of virus release into the air. To assess this parameter, we evaluated 14 divergent influenza A viruses in ferrets and measured the levels of virus shed into nasal wash samples and into the air collected from cages housing inoculated animals. As expected, human adapted A(H1N1) subtype viruses displayed robust replication in the upper respiratory tract with peak titers in nasal washes on day 1 p.i. Viral RNA released into the air from inoculated ferrets was detected as early as day 1 p.i., with transmission to respective contact animals in most cases by days 1–3 post contact. Out of the 11 zoonotic influenza viruses examined, only one swine-origin virus [A(H1N1)v MI/288] displayed high levels of replication in the upper respiratory tract concurrent with detection of viral RNA in the air by day 1 p.i. and transmission to all contacts5. These highly transmissible influenza viruses had two common traits: robust replication in the ferret upper respiratory tract as evidenced by the highest levels of viral titers detected at early times p.i., and early release of viral RNA into the air at levels sufficient for transmission to all contact animals. These traits varied for zoonotic viruses; for example, the highly transmissible MN/45 virus replicated to high levels in the ferret upper respiratory tract by day 1 p.i.; however, viral RNA was not detected in the air until day 2 p.i. Similarly, delayed release or low level of viral RNA in the air at early times p.i. was observed for most of the swine and avian-origin viruses that were evaluated in this study.Delayed replication was most apparent for influenza viruses that poorly transmit between ferrets. This group of viruses, especially the avian-origin viruses, replicated to significantly lower levels at early times p.i. and were not able to reach comparable peak titers in the air as the transmissible influenza viruses, further supporting the utility of aerobiological techniques in the identification of zoonotic viruses with increased transmission potential. Differences in the abilities of transmissible and poorly transmissible influenza viruses to replicate in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets could be in part due to differences in receptor binding preferences. While human-adapted influenza viruses that transmit well preferentially bind α2,6 SA receptors, zoonotic influenza viruses, especially avian-origin, have a binding preference to α2,3 SA receptors, which are enriched in the lower respiratory tract33. Compelling evidence supports the importance of upper respiratory tract cells in promoting the selection of viruses with α2,6 SA binding preference34 as well as facilitating virus release into the air and onward transmission20,21. Future assessments of receptor binding specificity could potentially explain the lack of efficient transmission of viruses such as the OH/24 virus, which despite robust replication in the ferret upper respiratory tract and the presence of high RNA levels in the air, was not able to transmit via the air. Since the frequency of airborne transmission between ferrets has been reported to be highest at earlier time points p.i., before the onset of clinical signs of infection,15,31,32, delayed shedding of the virus into the air may further reduce the likelihood for transmission. In addition, localized, strain-specific differences in the activation of the immune response by IAVs exhibiting diverse transmissibility profiles in ferrets have been previously shown to correlate with peak virus shedding and the frequency of transmission35 warranting further evaluation of the interplay between immunological factors that are triggered upon infection and the kinetics of virus release into the air.Influenza virus-laden particles of different sizes have been detected in human breath or cough36,37,38,39. The ferret model was subsequently employed to dissect the relative significance of droplets and fine droplet nuclei in mediating influenza transmissions. Zhou et al. (2018) showed that although 76.8% of aerosol particles released from an infected ferret were <1.54 µm, most of the viral RNA was detected in the >4 µm particle size and airborne transmission efficiency was abolished when ferret exposure was limited to ≤1.5 µm particles15. Recovery of viable virus from inoculated ferrets was also shown to be more efficient from fractions containing larger particles (>4.7 µm)14. Most of the viral RNA detected in sampled air during this study was found in the >4 µm particle fraction, which agrees with results from other influenza virus studies15,16. Our observation that particles of <1 µm contained negligible quantities of viral RNA especially for transmissible viruses further validates the role of >1 µm particles in influenza transmission in the ferret model through further investigation of the role smaller particle sizes contribute towards transmission events in this model is warranted especially when investigating diverse influenza virus subtypes.A caveat of this study is that viral nucleic acid was measured in air samples, and infectious virus titration remains to be determined. Various collection techniques and devices can help preserve infectious virus, e.g. cascade impactors, multi-stage liquid impingers, and water-based condensation samplers, and offer important contextual information; however, experimental parameters and scalability considerations precluded their use in this study11,13. Previously, low levels of infectious virus were detected from the breath of anesthetized ferrets by using a cascade impactor14. Although the quantities of infectious virus were at least 1 order of magnitude lower than the collected RNA, differences in both infectious virus and viral RNA loads in the air were observed for a representative transmissible and a non-transmissible strain used in that study. The differences in infectious virus in nasal wash samples analyzed here were also lower than viral RNA, indicating that the overall levels of infectious virus released into the air are smaller than the observed viral RNA levels. A recent study capturing virus-laden particles directly on cell monolayers followed by quantification of plaque forming units revealed that ferrets inoculated with H1N1 virus emitted as much as 138 PFU/minute during peak of infection17. Considering that inhalation of less than 5 infectious particles can initiate a productive infection in a naïve host, the low levels of infectious virus in the air are sufficient for transmission to occur40,41,42. Ultimately, studies employing a range of collection devices can collectively provide critical insight into the role aerosols contribute to transmission. Additionally, virus stability in the air, a parameter that was previously shown to differ among virus strains17,41,43, as well as the composition of respiratory secretions during infection may also affect the overall levels of infectious virus in the air44. It should also be noted that persistence of virus in the environment, such as on bedding and ferret fur, could possibly contribute to the levels of viral RNA detected in the air and influence transmission frequency. Continued research is needed to elucidate the source of airborne particles generated during animal experiments and their relative role in airborne transmission.In conclusion, quantification of airborne influenza virus RNA represents a valuable addition to established protocols used to evaluate transmission potential of newly emerging influenza viruses. The levels of influenza virus RNA collected in nasal wash and air samples from infected ferrets significantly differed between transmissible and non-transmissible viruses highlighting the utility of such assessments in quick identification of zoonotic influenza virus strains that may have enhanced transmission potential. Additional research is needed to correlate specific levels of virus (infectious and viral RNA copy numbers) in the air with airborne transmission in ferrets while taking into consideration virus- and host-specific parameters that facilitate efficient replication and emission of the virus into the air. A more comprehensive understanding of ferret-to-ferret transmission dynamics will aid in the development of predictive mathematical and statistical models to guide study designs with reduced number of animals used in accordance with the three R’s governing ethical animal research activities45.MethodsVirusesAll influenza A viruses employed in this study are described in Table 1. Virus stocks were propagated in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells or 10–11 day old embryonated chicken eggs as specified in the references and Table 1. All experiments were conducted in BSL-3/ABSL-3 laboratories, with enhancements required by the US Department of Agriculture and the Federal Select Agent Program.Ferret inoculation and transmission experimentsAll experiments were performed with the approval from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and were conducted in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited animal facility. Ferret pathogenesis and transmission data were published previously as indicated by references in Table 1 unless otherwise specified. Male Fitch ferrets (6–11 months of age), serologically negative by hemagglutination inhibition assay to currently circulating influenza A (H1, H3), and B viruses, were employed in each study. The ferrets were anesthetized [intramuscular injection of a ketamine cocktail (20 mg/kg Ketamine, 0.05 mg/kg Atropine, 2 mg/kg Xylazine)] and then inoculated intranasally with 6 log10 PFU or EID50 of virus diluted in 1 ml of PBS and observed daily for clinical signs of infection. Nasal wash specimens were collected after air sampling; briefly, following anesthesia 1 ml of PBS was introduced into the ferret nasal passages to induce sneezing and the aspirate was collected in a sterile Petri dish46. The Direct Contact Transmission model (DCT) was established by co-housing a naïve ferret with an inoculated ferret (3 ferret pairs per virus tested) and the Respiratory Droplet Transmission model (RDT) was established by housing naïve and inoculated ferrets in adjacent cages separated by a perforated wall (3 ferret pairs per virus tested)40. The ferrets were housed in stainless steel cages within a Duo-Flo BioClean mobile isolator (Lab Products, Seaford, DE; uniform air flow circulated at 150–180 air changes per hour) throughout each experiment, including air sampling.Aerosol collection procedureAerosol samples were collected using a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) BC 251 two-stage cyclone aerosol sampler24. During experimentation each inoculated ferret was housed in a separate stainless-steel cage (56 cm L × 42 cm W × 42 cm H). For the respiratory droplet transmission experiments, the inoculated ferrets were housed in cages with the same dimensions but with a perforated side wall which was blocked during air sampling. The samplers were attached to the outside of each cage (cage door) with the sampler inlet protruding 3–4 cm into the cage. The sampler position in relation to the cage was the same in each sampling experiment. The air was collected at 3.5 L/min for 2 h, at the same time each day. The first sampler stage collected particles >4 µm into a disposable 15-mL collection tube (35-2096; Falcon), the second sampler stage collected particles with a diameter of 1–4 µm into a disposable 1.5-mL tube (02-681-339; Fisher Scientific), and the 37-mm polytetrafluoroethylene filter with 3 µm pores (FSLW03700, Millipore) collected particles with a diameter <1 µm. Following collection, samplers were disassembled in a Class II biological safety cabinet and viral material was immediately collected in PBS and inactivated in AVL buffer (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers protocol for subsequent RNA extraction and quantification. Samplers were decontaminated with 70% ethanol, submerged in water, and then rinsed thoroughly with distilled water and air dried after each sampling day. For experiments depicted in Fig. 1, ferrets were transferred to a clean cage before sampling on day 2; in all subsequent experiments, each ferret remained in the same cage throughout the air sampling time course.Virus quantificationTo detect infectious virus, previously frozen ferret nasal wash specimens were titered by standard plaque assay in MDCK cells47. To detect and quantify viral RNA copy numbers, total RNA was extracted from samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Real-time RT-PCR was performed with a SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR System (Invitrogen) in duplicate reactions using an influenza A virus M1 gene primer and probe set (Influenza A Forward Primer: GAC CRA TCC TGT CAC CTC TGA C; Influenza A Reverse Primer: AGG GCA TTY TGG ACA AAK CGT CTA; Influenza A Probe FAM—TG CAG TCC TCG CTC ACT GGG CAC G—BHQ)48. Influenza virus M gene RNA copy numbers were extrapolated using a standard curve based on samples of known M gene copy number.Statistics and reproducibilityData were collected from three ferrets per virus group in each experiment. For comparative analyses, the viruses were grouped by virus transmissibility profile in the ferret model (n = 12–15). All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. The specific tests used are described in figure legends.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

(credit: Lorenzo Casalino / Amaro Lab / UC San Diego) Story by: Michelle Franklin - m1franklin@ucsd.edu Published Date January 25, 2023 Story by: Michelle Franklin - m1franklin@ucsd.edu Share This: Article Content According to the World Health Organization, each year there are an estimated 1 billion cases of influenza, between 3-5 million severe cases and up to 650,000 influenza-related respiratory deaths globally. Seasonal flu vaccines must be reformulated each year to match the predominantly circulating strains. When the vaccine matches the predominant strain, it is very effective; however, when it does not match, it may offer little protection. The main targets of the flu vaccine are two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). While the HA protein helps the virus bind to the host cell, the NA protein acts like scissors to cut the HA away from the cell membrane allowing the virus to replicate. Although the properties of both glycoproteins have been studied previously, a complete understanding of their movement does not exist. For the first time, researchers at the University of California San Diego have created an atomic-level computer model of the H1N1 virus that reveals new vulnerabilities through glycoprotein “breathing” and “tilting” movements. This work, published in ACS Central Science, suggests possible strategies for the design of future vaccines and antivirals against influenza. “When we first saw how dynamic these glycoproteins were, the large degree of breathing and tilting, we actually wondered if there was something wrong with our simulations,” stated Distinguished Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry Rommie Amaro, who is the principal investigator on the project. “Once we knew our models were correct, we realized the enormous potential this discovery held. This research could be used to develop methods of keeping the protein locked open so that it would be constantly accessible to antibodies.” Traditionally, flu vaccines have targeted the head of the HA protein based on still images that showed the protein in a tight formation with little movement. Amaro’s model showed the dynamic nature of the HA protein and revealed a breathing movement that exposed a previously unknown site of immune response, known as an epitope. This discovery complemented previous work from one of the paper’s co-authors, Ian A. Wilson, Hansen Professor of Structural Biology at The Scripps Research Institute, who had discovered an antibody that was broadly neutralizing — in other words, not strain-specific — and bound to a part of the protein that appeared unexposed. This suggested that the glycoproteins were more dynamic than previously thought, allowing the antibody an opportunity to attach. Simulating the breathing movement of the HA protein established a connection. Seen here, hemagglutinin (HA) trimers start “breathing,” (i.e., transitioning from a closed state to a partially “open” state).(credit: Lorenzo Casalino / Amaro Lab / UC San Diego) NA proteins also showed movement at the atomic level with a head-tilting movement. This provided a key insight to co-authors Julia Lederhofer and Masaru Kanekiyo at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. When they looked at convalescent plasma — that is, plasma from patients recovering from the flu — they found antibodies specifically targeting what is called the “dark side” of NA underneath the head. Without seeing the movement of NA proteins, it wasn’t clear how the antibodies were accessing the epitope. The simulations Amaro’s lab created showed an incredible range of motion that gave insight into how the epitope was exposed for antibody binding. The H1N1 simulation Amaro’s team created contains an enormous amount of detail — 160 million atoms worth. A simulation of this size and complexity can only run on a few select machines in the world. For this work, the Amaro lab used Titan at Oak Ridge National Lab, formerly one of the largest and fastest computers in the world. Seen here, the neuraminidase (NA) head undergoes an extensive tilting motion, exhibiting extraordinary flexibility (credit: Lorenzo Casalino / Amaro Lab / UC San Diego) Amaro is making the data available to other researchers who can uncover even more about how the influenza virus moves, grows and evolves. “We’re mainly interested in HA and NA, but there are other proteins, the M2 ion channel, membrane interactions, glycans, so many other possibilities,” Amaro stated. “This also paves the way for other groups to apply similar methods to other viruses. We’ve modeled SARS-CoV-2 in the past and now H1N1, but there are other flu variants, MERS, RSV, HIV — this is just the beginning.” In addition to corresponding author Rommie Amaro, other authors on the paper include Lorenzo Casalino and Christian Seitz (both UC San Diego), Julia Lederhofer and Masaru Kanekiyo (both National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/NIH), Yaroslav Tsybovsky (Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research) and Ian A.

Credit: NIAID Share Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Email The flu virus sickens people by sneaking past their immune defenses, entering cells and then replicating. Hundreds of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins cover the viral particles, helping the particles get into cells and helping new virions leave. But researchers have a limited understanding of how these proteins move in vivo — information that could assist scientists in developing a universal flu vaccine and more effective antiviral drugs. So, Rommie Amaro and colleagues at the University of California San Diego wanted to simulate the whole influenza A virion and look at the proteins’ movements and interactions for potential weaknesses. The researchers conducted detailed simulations of the 161 million atoms of the influenza A H1N1 virion, commonly referred to as swine flu, and found that both HA and NA are quite flexible. NA proteins have globular heads on top of a thin stalk, and the head can tilt down more than 90 degrees, acting like a weedwhacker on a rotating axis. From these data, the researchers realized that as the head tilts, the underside of the protein becomes accessible to a human monoclonal antibody, NDS.1. HA proteins protrude up from the viral membrane, connected by a flexible hinge, and can also tilt but not quite as much. Interestingly, some of the HA proteins seemed to “breathe” — the top of the protein shifted from a closed position to a partially open structure and back again. In the open state, the protein was accessible to a broadly protective human antibody, FluA-20, suggesting that keeping it in that position could be a way to develop more effective drugs against the flu virus. Finally, the simulations showed that the HA and NA proteins could clump together with up to five nearby HA and/or NA proteins and then form even larger aggregates involving tens of proteins. By clustering, the two proteins could contend for the same receptors on host cells, potentially affecting the virus’s entry into or exit from cells, the researchers say. They conclude that these first-of-their-kind visualizations show many new vulnerable states of flu viruses, which could improve future vaccines and antiviral drugs.

HPAI A(H5N1) is a highly contagious and deadly virus that can cause severe illness and death in birds, including chickens, ducks, geese, and turkeys. It has made a resurgence after many months of extremely low prevalence during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (COVID-19). A recent report in the journal Eurosurveillance describes an outbreak from a mink farm in Spain caused by clade 2.3.4.4b. Rapid communication: Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in farmed minks, Spain, October 2022. Image Credit: Cergios / Shutterstock The outbreak The mink farm described here is in Galicia, northwest Spain. The initial signs of the outbreak came with a sudden rise in the number of deaths in proportion to the total number of minks, with the mortality rate increasing to 0.77% from the expected rate of 0.2-0.3%. This occurred in early October 2022 and led to the collection of oropharyngeal swabs from two sick animals. These were tested at the Central Veterinary Laboratory (LCV) of Algete (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA)). While the mink samples showed no trace of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, they were positive for the HPAI virus. This was supported by the identification of pneumonia in the affected animals, which led to bleeding into the lungs. The sick animals showed signs such as anorexia, dribbling, drooling of saliva, low energy, bleeding from the snout, and tremors or loss of balance and coordination, indicating the involvement of the nervous system. The deaths increased week by week, reaching a peak by the third week of October when over 4% of animals were dying. Initially, mortality was observed among animals living near the manure storage barn. These barns displayed several hotspots of mortality, i.e., clusters of 2-4 pens with 100% mortality within a week or two. The deaths spread to adjacent barns until they were occurring in every place there were minks. As more and more samples were taken from those barns where the most significant number of animals appeared to be dying, high levels of H5N1 were detected, as assessed by a low cycle threshold (Ct) in rectal, oropharyngeal, or lung samples. Related StoriesResearch identifies respiratory transmission potential of H5N1 virusStudy reveals distinct genetic risk factors for influenza and COVID-19Unraveling the mechanism of Shufeng Jiedu Capsules in influenza treatmentIn the second week of October that year, the animal health services census showed over 51,000 minks in wire cages within roofed but not completely walled-in barns. The animals were fed raw fish, poultry by-products, blood meals, and cereals. The poultry waste came from farms and abattoirs in Galicia. How was it detected? Interestingly, no outbreaks of avian flu among farmed birds were known to have occurred so far in this region, as late as January 10, 2023. However, in the weeks before the mink outbreak, multiple wild birds were found to be sick or dead from HPAI infection, including a few seagulls and several gannets. This was a red flag for public health experts to suspect that the mink deaths were related to this virus. Along with PCR testing to rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection, this led to specific testing for HPAI, which was confirmed to be the culprit. The virus Genomic testing in the European Reference Laboratory revealed the strains belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b. This has been noted to infect wild birds, especially herring gulls, in Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, both in the past and for some weeks before the Spanish outbreak. However, it has not been reported in Spain prior to this outbreak. Clade 2.3.4.4b appears to be the result of reassortment events of several genes of H5N1 with the gull-adapted H13 subtype. The strains genotyped from the minks differed at 8-9 amino acids from the nearest genetically related H5N1 variants. Especially remarkable is the alanine substitution in the PB2 gene that causes increased viral polymerase activity following its infection of mammalian cells. So far, this substitution has been observed just once in a European polecat from the Netherlands, in March 2022. The other mutations in this clade have not yet been found anywhere else, and studies are awaited to unravel their role in the virus lifecycle. Averting further spread Following the virus's identification, mink culling began on October 18, 2022, clearing all animals on the farm's premises by November 17 of that year. The farm was cleaned up with the destruction of all the waste and carcasses. Most of the farm's 12 workers took part in the culling, having already been in contact with the animals prior to this step. They were tested on the 13th and 14th of October by nasopharyngeal swab while asymptomatic, and all tested negative for the virus. Out of caution, they were required to stay away from people for ten days from the last contact with the farm or the mink. They also self-monitored for flu-like symptoms. Only one showed symptoms on November 2 but tested negative for the virus. Notably, workers on mink farms have been required to wear face masks since April 2020, when farmed mink were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Later, more protective gear was added, along with handwashing several times a day, while work clothes were laundered and showers were taken as frequently at the farm. The workers also spent less time off-duty at the farms, reducing their period of contact. What are the implications? Mink appears to allow infection by influenza viruses, both human and avian. "This species could serve as a potential mixing vessel for the interspecies transmission among birds, mammals and human." With H5N1 being reported in birds worldwide, care must be taken to prevent mink infection on farms like this one. Importantly, though rare, human infection with avian flu has a very high mortality rate of 50-60%. Earlier concerns were raised as mink were found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, with transmission occurring bidirectionally between humans and mink. Such events could cause similar pathogens to spread from or to wild animals through farmed mink, posing a threat to human health. This underlines the need to "strengthen the culture of biosafety and biosecurity in this farming system and promote the implementation of ad hoc surveillance programs for influenza A viruses and other zoonotic pathogens at a global level."

Sherrill Davison Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Avian influenza steals the headlines, but it’s not the only respiratory disease that Pennsylvania poultry farmers need to watch for.Infectious coryza has hit four farms over the past month and more than 120 since late 2018 — mostly in Lancaster County.The disease isn’t quite as serious as avian influenza but has similar symptoms, so the two ailments are difficult to tell apart without lab testing. “These birds present as respiratory disease, and we really do want the producers to call the diagnosticians,” said Sherrill Davison, a professor of avian medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.When a farmer reports a poultry disease, staff from the state’s three animal diagnostic labs — at the Ag Department, Penn State and Penn Vet’s New Bolton Center — first want to rule out avian influenza. It’s the poultry disease of greatest concern, and a detection requires a government response including depopulation of the flock.But if avian influenza isn’t making the flock sick, lab staff will want to inspect birds to find out what is. In addition to sharing symptoms with avian influenza and mycoplasma, coryza tends to be appear with other maladies like infectious bronchitis.Identifying the disease or diseases determines the control and prevention methods that should be used, Davison said.The first sign of coryza is often a decrease in feed and water consumption. Then birds develop swollen faces.“Producers will say there’s a discharge from the nose, and either feed or bedding gets stuck to the nose,” Davison said. “They’ll see that.”In layer flocks, egg production may drop 8 to 43%, and mortality may rise to three or four times the farm’s norm.Broilers may see increased deaths too, but some of their problems only show up at the processing plant — carcass condemnations if the disease spread to the bird’s air sacs, and variability in weight because of the bird’s reduced feed and water intake.Farms that get coryza are advised to start using antibiotics, unless they are in a no-antibiotics-ever or organic system. But even after the symptoms have run their course, birds remain carriers for the rest of their lives.“Any treatment is really to just calm things down,” Davison said.To prevent coryza, the main tools are biosecurity and vaccination. Vehicles and clothing that come onto the farm should be clean, and workers should not own or be around backyard birds.Coryza vaccines can be used in long-lived chickens — breeders and layers — but not in broilers.For best protection, birds would be vaccinated twice, at 7 and 13 weeks. Companies sometimes find it difficult to work in the second dose because they have vaccines to administer for other diseases.“We think some of the increase that we see periodically is that either layer birds are not vaccinated or they’re only vaccinated once,” Davison said.A Recent ArrivalCoryza wasn’t historically a problem for Pennsylvania. But the disease appeared at a farm in December 2018, and 68 farms, mostly layer operations, were infected the following year.Cases began to fall after vaccination began in the spring of 2019. Vaccines had been hard to get earlier because of outbreaks in other states, Davison said.Since then, new cases have continued but at lower numbers than before. Some 27 farms were infected last year, Davison said.The Pennsylvania coryza outbreak has been centered in Lancaster, especially the northwestern part of the county.That could be because the region has a high density of poultry operations. And the landscape of crop farms may have few trees to block windborne pathogens, said Meghann Pierdon, a Penn Vet professor of clinical production medicine.Pierdon manages a password-protected mapping website for poultry farmers to see where infectious coryza and vaccinal laryngotracheitis have been reported.“Mostly we alert people that it’s in the area. They should up their biosecurity. They should probably vaccinate,” she said.Pierdon has noticed that, as with other respiratory diseases, coryza tends to be worst in the winter when conditions are best for pathogen survival.But based on preliminary analysis, she said, one strategy that appears to fight coryza is a bench entry.In this system, a bench extends across the anteroom of the chicken house, serving as a barrier and a place for workers to change into shoes that are only used in the poultry house.Over the past year, Pierdon said, farms may also have protected themselves from coryza through biosecurity improvements made in response to the avian influenza threat.Not only do those two diseases appear similar, but the means of prevention is also the same.

Chicken Respiratory Diseases Can Be Confusing Several common chicken diseases — including coryza, infectious bronchitis and infectious laryngotracheitis — have similar symptoms, making them hard to tell apart, but the treatment for each disease is different, so getting a laboratory diagnosis is important. Vets Talk Treatment for ‘Mother of All Head Colds’ A coryza outbreak,which peaked in March and April, affected about 14 million birds, said Sherrill Davison, a professor of avian medicine and pathology at the University of Pennsylvania.

The innovation of new treatment approaches through drug screening strategies and investigating the antiviral potential of bioactive natural-based chemicals may address the issue. Herein, we screened the anti-influenza efficacy of some biologically active indole and β-carboline (βC) indole alkaloids against two different influenza A viruses (IAV) with varied host range ranges; seasonal influenza A/Egypt/NRC098/2019(H1N1) and avian influenza A/chicken/Egypt/N12640A/2016(H5N1). All compounds were first assessed for their half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50) in MDCK cells and half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) against influenza A/H5N1. Intriguingly, Strychnine sulfate, Harmalol, Harmane, and Harmaline showed robust anti-H5N1 activities with IC50 values of 11.85, 0.02, 0.023, and 3.42 µg/ml, respectively, as compared to zanamivir and amantadine as control drugs (IC50 = 0.079 µg/ml and 17.59 µg/ml, respectively). The efficacy of the predefined phytochemicals was further confirmed against influenza A/H1N1 and they displayed potent anti-H1N1 activities compared to reference drugs. Based on SI values, the highly promising compounds were then evaluated for antiviral efficacy through plaque reduction assay and consistently they revealed high viral inhibition percentages at non-toxic concentrations. By studying the modes of antiviral action, Harmane and Harmalol could suppress viral infection via interfering mainly with the viral replication of the influenza A/H5N1 virus, whilst Harmaline exhibited a viricidal effect against the influenza A/H5N1 virus. Whereas, Strychnine sulfate elucidated its anti-influenza potency by interfering with viral adsorption into MDCK cells. Consistently, chemoinformatic studies showed that all studied phytochemicals illustrated HB formations with essential peptide cleft through the NH of indole moiety. Among active alkaloids, harmalol displayed the best lipophilicity metrics including ligand efficiency (LE) and ligand lipophilic efficiency (LLE) for both viruses. Compounds geometry and their ability to participate in HB formation are very crucial.

All reported occasional influenza pandemics and seasonal epidemics are caused mainly by IAV infections1,3. The evolution of pandemic IAV variants occurs commonly via the genetic exchange between viral RNA segments of different subtypes of IAVs in a genomic phenomenon called “antigenic shift or reassortment”. Whereas, the evolution of endemic IAV variants occurs via a continuous change in the viral RNA genome during viral replication “antigenic drift” in different hosts1,4.The innovation of antivirals has long paved the way for treating influenza in developing and developed countries. However, the future efficacy of the commercially available antivirals is somewhat suspicious because viruses are developing resistance in an inevitable way to the already established antiviral drugs. Plants are still the best choice for extracting and isolating naturally-based antiviral agents5.Alkaloids are belonging to a major chemical group that is found in microbes, plants, and animals6. These small cyclic nitrogenous compounds are alkaline in nature, hence the name, and they are found in 20% of plants7. They are categorized into indole, quinoline, isoquinoline, tropane, steroidal, pyridine, and pyrrolizidine based on their molecular structure8. Indole alkaloids class are those alkaloids with an organic structure consisting of a pyrrole linked to a benzene ring. Such compounds are produced from plants as secondary metabolites, and they exhibited antiviral activities against a wide variety of viruses such as IAV9, hepatitis C virus (HCV)10, human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)11, dengue virus (DENV)12, zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV)13 and may play a key role in combating the newly emerged coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)14,15,16. The aromatic compounds: β-carbolines (naturally and/or synthetically indole alkaloid derivatives) possess numerous biological activities including antiviral activities against different emerging and reemerging viruses such as herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-2), DENV-2, and enterovirus-71 (EV-71), HIV and Poliovirus (PV)17,18,19,20. The β-carbolines are common in Peganum harmala, this plant is common in Egypt. In folk medicine, it is used as an analgesic, antiseptic, and emmenagogue and in the treatment of asthma, colic, jaundice, and lumbago21.Herein, we investigated the antiviral potential of some purified naturally derived indole and β-carboline indole alkaloids against avian and human influenza A/H5N1 and A/H1N1viruses, respectively. The virtual mode of action for the biologically active alkaloids was also provided.Materials and methodsCell lines and virusesMadin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were kindly obtained from the cell culture collections of the Centre of Scientific Excellence for Influenza Viruses at Egyptian National Research Centre and were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (DMEM; BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD, USA) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) (10%) (Gibco-BRL; New York, USA) and penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep) antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (2%) (GIBCO-BRL; New York, USA) and cultured under the optimum growth conditions; 37 °C/ 5% CO2/humified conditions.Both the HPAIV A/chicken/Egypt/N12640A/2016(H5N1)22 and the seasonal influenza A/Egypt/NRC098/2019(H1N1) (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_12995118) were provided by the Egyptian Center of Scientific Excellence for Influenza Viruses, National Research Center, Egypt and inoculated either in MDCK cells and/or specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs to propagate them as described earlier22,23.Compounds under investigationThe tested compounds used in our investigation are listed, in detail (Table 1). Strychnine sulfate, reserpine, brucine, eserine, harmine, and norharmane were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). Harmane, harmaline, and harmalol were purchased from the Molekula group (Molekula, Germany). Methyl ergometrine was obtained from Novartis (Al-Amiria District, Cairo). Their documented biological activities/chemical nucleus served as the basis for their selection to be examined for their antiviral potential against IAVs. The molecular structures of the studied compounds are shown (Fig. 1).Table 1 The tested indole alkaloid and β-carboline indole alkaloid compounds.Full size tableFigure 1The molecular structures of the studied compounds.

Briefly, ten-fold serial viral dilutions, in triplicates, were allowed to infect MDCK cell monolayers and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 72 h.After incubation, plates were decontaminated and cells were fixed using a 10% paraformaldehyde solution. An aliquot of 100 µl crystal violet stain (0.1% in methanol) was added to each well and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 min. Plates were next thoroughly washed with water to remove excess staining material and dried overnight. Once dried, plates were assessed for cytopathic effect (CPE) in each column. The final titer was calculated using the Reed–Muench Method41.Plaque infectivity assay (PIA)To define the countable viral titer of IAVs and define their stock titers as plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml, PIA was performed as previously described42 with minor modifications. Briefly, the 80–90% confluent MDCK cell monolayers (precultured at a density of 1.2 × 106 cells/well in 6 well plate) were washed with 1X phosphate buffer saline (1xPBS) and infected with 100 µl/well of the ten-fold serial dilutions for each virus in 1xDMEM (supplemented with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Gibco-BRL; New York, USA), 2% pen/strep mixture and 1 mg/mL of L‐1‐tosyl‐ amido‐2‐phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin). The plates were incubated for 1 h in a humified condition with 5% CO2 and 37 °C to allow for viral adsorption. The plates were gently shaken during the incubation period at intervals of 15 min. The inocula were then removed and the plates were overlayed with 2% agarose/2xDMEM overlayer, then the plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified condition. The plates underwent fixation with 10% formaldehyde and were further stained with 0.1% crystal violet (CV) solution to visualize the viral plaques. The following formula was used to determine the viral titer for each virus:$$ {\text{Plaque}}\;{\text{forming}}\;{\text{unit}}\;\frac{{{\text{PFU}}}}{{{\text{ml}}}} = {\text{Number}}\;{\text{of}}\;{\text{plaques}}\;*\;{\text{Reciprocal}}\;{\text{of}}\;{\text{virus}}\;{\text{dilution}}\;*\;{\text{Dilution}}\;{\text{factor}}\;({\text{to}}\;1\;{\text{ml}}) $$Cytotoxicity and antiviral assaysThe crystal violet assay was employed as previously described to determine the half maximum cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC50) on MDCK cells and the half maximal inhibitory concentrations 50 (IC50) for each compound43,44,45. Briefly, MDCK cells were cultivated into cell culture plates (100 µl/well at a density of 3 × 105 cells/mL) and incubated for 24 h under the optimal previously described growth conditions. Next, the plates were washed with sterile 1xPBS, and successive ten-fold serial dilutions of the investigated natural-based compounds were added to the cultured wells in triplicate including untreated cell control wells. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C / 5% CO2 in humidified conditions for 3 days to assess the CC50 for each compound. After the incubation period, the cell monolayers were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and then stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The crystal violet stain in dried plates was then dissolved by adding absolute methanol. The optical density (OD) was measured using an ELISA plate reader at a wavelength of 570 nm.The IC50 was performed as previously described44. In 96-well tissue culture plates, MDCK cells were distributed in each well as described previously and incubated overnight at a humidified 37 °C incubator under 5% CO2 condition. The cell monolayers were then washed once with 1 × PBS and subjected to virus adsorption (100 TCID50/ml) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). The cell monolayers were further overlaid with 100 μl of 1xDMEM containing varying safe concentrations of the test compounds, including untreated cell control wells and virus-infected untreated cells as a virus control for normalization. Following incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 72 h, the cells were fixed with 100 μl of 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet in distilled water for 15 min at RT. The crystal violet dye was then dissolved using 100 μl absolute methanol per well and the optical density of the color is measured at 570 nm using Anthos Zenyth 200rt plate reader (Anthos Labtec Instruments, Heerhugowaard, Netherlands). The IC50 of the compound is that required to reduce the virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) by 50%, relative to the virus control.Plaque reduction assay (PRA)To further verify the anti-influenza potential of the most promising candidates based on their IC50 values, the PRA was conducted according to Mostafa and coworkers44 with minor modifications. Briefly, the MDCK cells were cultured in 6 well plate at a density of 1.2 × 106 cells/well under the optimum growth conditions; 37 °C in humified 5% CO2 conditions. The non-toxic concentrations of each compound were mixed with countable virus dilution (A/H1N1 or A/H5N1) in 1xDMEM supplemented with 4% BSA, 2% pen/strep mixture, and TPCK-treated trypsin and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. To allow viral adsorption, the mixture was added to the MDCK cell monolayer (80–90% confluency) under optimal growth conditions and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The inocula were then aspirated and 2% agarose/2 × DMEM overlayers were added. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 72 h. The cell monolayers in plates were then fixed with 10% formaldehyde and further stained with 0.1% crystal violet (CV) solution to visualize the viral plaques. The percent of viral reduction was calculated using the following equation:$$ \user2{Plaque}\;\user2{reduction}\;(\% ) = \frac{{{\mathbf{Count}}\;{\mathbf{of}}\;{\mathbf{untreated}}\;{\mathbf{virus}}\;({\mathbf{control}})\; - \;{\mathbf{Count}}\;{\mathbf{of}}\;{\mathbf{treated}}\;{\mathbf{virus}}}}{{{\mathbf{Count}}\;{\mathbf{of}}\;{\mathbf{untreated}}\;{\mathbf{virus}}\;({\mathbf{control}})}}\; \times \;{\mathbf{100}} $$Possible stage(s) of antiviral actionTo define the possible stage(s) of antiviral action for each anti-influenza candidate hitting high selectivity index, the plaque reduction assay46 was carried out with some modifications to discover the critical step at which the tested compound work against the influenza A/H5N1 virus. According to Mostafa and coworkers44, the compound exerts its antiviral effect using the following mechanisms: (1) hindering the viral multiplication inside the host cell, (2) hindering the viral adsorption onto the host cell, or (3) direct viricidal effect against the virus (a cell-free mechanism).Viral replication interferenceThe viral dilutions of influenza A/H5N1 virus were allowed to infect the MDCK cells that were previously cultured at a density of 1.2 × 106 cells/well in 6 well plate for 24 h under optimal conditions. Each plate contains cell and virus control wells to ensure the validity of the assay and to calculate the percent of viral inhibition following treatment, respectively. The plates were then then incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 1 h. The cell monolayers were then washed with 1xPBS to remove the residues of the infection process. Subsequently, the different predetermined non-cytotoxic concentrations of each compound were applied, and the plates underwent a second incubation period at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 1 h. Another washing step was applied and the 2% agarose overlayers were added then the plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 72 h. The cell monolayers were then fixed and stained, visualized using 0.1% crystal violet solution as described previously in the plaque infectivity assay.Viral adsorption interferenceA range of non-cytotoxic concentrations was applied to the precultured MDCK cells in 6 well plates (1.2 × 106 cells/well). Each plate contains cell and virus control wells to ensure the validity of the assay and to calculate the percent of viral inhibition following treatment, respectively. The plates were then incubated in the refrigerator (4 °C) for 1 h to allow chemical adsorption onto cell receptors without active penetration. The plates were then washed with 1xPBS to remove the residual compounds. Subsequently, the countable viral dilution of influenza A/H5N1 virus was applied to allow viral adsorption/infection and another incubation period was employed at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 1 h. The cell monolayers were then washed with 1xPBS to remove the residual virus and overlayed with 2%Agarose/2xDMEM overlay and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 72 h. The cell monolayers were then fixed and stained, visualized using 0.1% crystal violet solution as described previously in the plaque infectivity assay.Viricidal effectA simple plaque reduction assay was performed where effective concentrations of the compounds were mixed with concentrated influenza A/H5N1 virus (3–4 folds higher than the countable virus dilution). The virus/compound mixture was then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Subsequently, ten-fold serial dilutions of the virus/compound mixture (3 or 4 times) were performed to reach a countable viral titer. The mixture dilution with countable viral titer was then applied to the MDCK monolayers (1.2 × 106 cells/well) including cell and virus control wells. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 1 h. To remove the remains of the mixture, cell monolayers were washed with 1xPBS and overlayed with 2% agarose/2xDMEM, and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 72 h. The cell monolayers were then fixed and stained, visualized using 0.1% crystal violet solution as described previously in the plaque infectivity assay.Cheminformatics studiesMolecular dockingThe X-ray crystal structure coordinate of (PDB ID: 6hp046 and PDB: ID:6bkk47,48) were retrieved from PDB with their co-crystallized bound ligands. The study is represented in detail against PDB ID: 6hp0). The docking study was performed using openEye scientific software version 2.2.5 (SantaFe, NM (USA), http://www.eyesopen.com), academic license (The Laboratory of Yaseen A. M. Mohamed Elshaier. A virtual library of the synthesized compounds was used, and their energies were minimized using the MMFF94 force field, followed by the generation of multi-conformers using the OMEGA application. The library was compiled in one file by Omega. The target proteins were retrieved from PDB and the created receptor was operated by the OeDocking application. Both the ligand input file and the receptor input file were subjected to FRED to implement the molecular docking study. Multiple scoring functions were engaged to predict the energy profile of the ligand-receptor complex. The vida application was used as a visualization method. The dimension for created box of receptors were as follow: Box volume: 5544 Å, dimension 21.00 Å × 18.00 Å × 14.67 Å.Physiochemical parameter and lipophilicity calculationsCompound parameters, including clogP, were calculated by using the free-access website http://www.eyesopen.com).Biosafety and biosecurityAll experiments with infectious viruses were performed according to Egyptian regulations for the propagation of influenza viruses. The low pathogenic seasonal IAV and the highly pathogenic AIV were handled in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) and 3 (BSL-3) conditions in two separate laboratories, respectively, approved for such use by the local authorities.ResultsCytotoxicity and viral inhibitory activity of the screened alkaloid compoundsThe assessment of cytotoxicity of the tested indole and β-carboline indole alkaloids (Table 1) is a critical step for further evaluating their anti-influenza potential activity. The cytotoxicity of the screened alkaloid compounds was evaluated in MDCK cells (Fig. 2) and they all showed a wide range of safe, non-toxic concentrations (from 1 ng/ml to 10 mg/ml).Figure 2The cytotoxic and anti-H5N1 effects of the screened compounds in the MDCK cell line. By employing the crystal violet assay and nonlinear regression analysis of the GraphPad Prism program (version 5.01) by plotting log inhibitor versus normalized response (variable slope), the CC50 and IC50 of the examined indole and β-carboline indole alkaloids were determined.Full size imageThereafter, the anti-influenza potential activity of each compound was investigated at non-cytotoxic concentrations against HPAIV A/H5N1, compared to the reference anti-influenza neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir and the M2-proton channel blocker amantadine. Remarkably, the indole alkaloid; Strychnine sulfate demonstrated a significant effect with an IC50 value of 11.851 µg/ml, and in the same context, the β-carboline indole alkaloids; Harmalol, Harmane and Harmaline exhibited strong anti-influenza effects with the IC50 values of 0.02, 0.023 and 3.42 µg/ml, respectively, with unexpected very high selectivity indices (SIs) (Fig. 2 and Table 2). On the same hand, as compared to the drug controls, Reserpine elucidated a moderate anti-influenza activity with an IC50 value of 42.36 µg/ml. Unlikely, Brucine, Eserine, Methyl ergometrine, Harmine, and Norharmane proved poor or no antiviral potential activity against the avian influenza A/H5N1 virus.Table 2 Selectivity indices “SIs” for the tested compounds against avian influenza A/H5N1 and human influenza A/H1N1 virus in the MDCK cell line.Full size tableTo confirm that the obtained anti-influenza activities of Strychnine sulfate, Harmalol, Harmane, and Harmaline are not strain-specific, their anti-influenza activity was further investigated against human influenza A/H1N1 virus and compared to the anti-influenza zanamivir and amantadine drug controls. Consistently, Strychnine sulfate, Harmalol, Harmane, and Harmaline exerted potent anti-influenza activity against influenza A/H1N1 virus with IC50 values of 0.06, 0.035, 0.033, and 0.056 µg/ml respectively (Fig. 3).Figure 3The cytotoxic and anti-H1N1 effects of the screened compounds in the MDCK cell line. By employing the crystal violet assay and nonlinear regression analysis of the GraphPad Prism program (version 5.01) by plotting log inhibitor versus normalized response (variable slope), the CC50 and IC50 of the most promising indole and β-carboline indole alkaloids were computed.Full size imageViral plaque reduction of the investigated compoundsThe screened alkaloids with promising anti-influenza activities as indicated with low IC50 values and high SI values were subjected further to plaque reduction assay to validate their anti-influenza efficacy against HPAIV A/H5N1 and seasonal influenza A/H1N1 viruses. The tested indole and β-carboline indole alkaloids demonstrated remarkable capacity to elicit viral suppression at low doses against IAVs that were used in this study (Table 3). These viral inhibitions in plaque forming units were statistically significant among all tested concentrations for each compound when compared to compound-untreated virus control for influenza A/H5N1 (Fig. 4) and A/H1N1 viruses (Fig. 5). These data are consistent with our prior findings.Table 3 Viral reduction percentages following treatment of influenza A/H1N1 and A/H5N1 with a range of non-cytotoxic concentrations of indole and β-carboline indole alkaloids, as measured by plaque reduction assay.Full size tableFigure 4The Plaque forming units (PFU) per ml for compound-untreated influenza A/H5N1 virus control versus multiple concentrations-treated virus.

Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post hoc test.Full size imageStage(s) of antiviral actionTo investigate the possible target(s) of the studied compounds with promising anti-influenza activities, we studied three main targets by which the compounds can affect viral infectivity and replication cycle including (1) direct viricidal action, (2) hindering the viral adsorption onto host cell’s receptor, and (3) hindering the viral replication machinery. Interestingly, the tested anti-influenza alkaloids could affect the three aforementioned compartments but in varying strengths. Interestingly, Harmalol and Harmane could block influenza A/H5N1 infection via interference with the viral replication compartment. Whereas harmaline exerted a direct cell-free viricidal effect on the viral particle. Finally, Strychnine Sulfate showed the capacity to reduce the viral titer by hindering IAV adsorption to the host cell (MDCK) receptors (Table 4).Table 4 The mechanism of antiviral action for the investigated indole and β-carboline indole alkaloids represented as viral inhibition (%) in a concentration-dependent manner.Full size tableChemoinformatic studiesMolecular docking study with neuraminidase (PDB ID: 6hp0)Neuraminidase inhibitors hinder the function of the viral neuraminidase protein, preventing virus release from infected host cells to further infect new host cells and thereby freeing the virus to infect other cells in the host organism and subsequently hindering the viral replication cycle1,49. The main structural neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors are cyclohexane scaffold containing lipophilic moiety with modification in the geometry and size of this part50. Our active compounds belong to carboline skeleton in which cyclohexene ring fused with indole moiety. These similarities guided us to introduce these compounds as neuraminidase inhibitors. By comparative analysis of the docking mode and pose of our compounds to standard ligands for M2-proton channel blockers and neuraminidase inhibitors, the selected compounds revealed high similarity to the control neuraminidase inhibitors. The current antiviral drugs are likely directed to neuraminidase inhibitor analogues especially with the reported resistance of amantadine to the currently circulating IAV strains including the tested virus strain (Figs. 2 and 3). These evidences directed us to perform the docking against neuraminidase surface glycoprotein.To validate our docking protocol, the standard ligand was docked by OpenEye software and it was superimposed with its co-crystalized downloaded complex51. Both structures displayed the same binding mode and pose with consensus score 10 as the best score. They formed multiple hydrogen bonding (HB) interactions with key amino acids in the receptor active sites especially Arg: 153A, Asp:151A, Arg:293A, Arg:368A, Glu:277A, and Arg:118A. Notably, the standard ligand formed HB interactions with basic amino acids (Fig. 6a).Figure 6Snapshot of selected compounds represented by Vida application. (a) Standard ligand (grey colour) and its co-crystalized complex (green colour); (b) Harmalol docked with the receptor with the formation of HB (green colour); (c) Harmalol overlay with its methylated isomer, Harmaline; (d) Harmane showed complete overlay with its inactive derivative, Harmine.Full size imageHarmalol forms a hydrogen bond (HB) with Trp:179A (as donor) through its OH as acceptor and with Gln: 278A through NH, (Fig. 6b) with consensus score 45. The snapshot of harmalol with its methylated isomer, harmaline represented overlay. However, harmaline was not able to form HB interaction with the receptor (Fig. 6c) with a consensus score of 63. Comparing both compounds with the inactive analog, harmine highlighted the retardation effect of methylated benzene of indole moiety. Furthermore, the potent unsubstituted derivative, harmane, showed HB with Gln:278A (Fig. 6d) with a consensus score of 56.Ligand efficiency and lipophilic efficiency profile52 Evaluating the lipophilicity profile in the ligand-target interaction concept is an important aspect of the druggability of new bioactive candidates. Presently, rationalization of both molecular size, and lipophilicity (cLogP) with drug activities (PIC50) designated is essential. Ligand efficiency (LE) of bioactive compounds is assessed based on pIC50 in relation to the number of heavy atoms in a molecule known as non-hydrogen atoms (NHAs). LE estimates the affinity of drugs based on their size instead of considering the effectiveness or binding affinity of the whole structure. LE = ΔG ÷ NHA or LE = (pIC50 × 1.37) ÷ NHA; where ΔG = Gibb's free energy, IC50 = half-maximal inhibitory concentration (in terms of molar concentration), and NHA = non-hydrogen atom.The challenge in the druggability of new drug candidates is in increasing the activity while keeping lipophilicity constant to avoid any “molecular obesity” during the drug development process. The other parameter of lipophilicity is the ligand lipophilic efficiency (LLE). LLE is a way to calculate the affinity of a drug candidate’s function in its lipophilicity. LLE is the difference between the potency and ClogP according to the following equation: LLE = pIC50- CLogP. Table 5 illustrated selected physicochemical properties which controlled the rule of five. All compounds have a small molecular weight in the range of 182–200. Both harmalol and harmaline displayed the same number of HB as acceptor (value 3) while harmane has HB as an acceptor of value 2. Both harmane and harmaline have the same HB as a donor (value 1) while harmalol has One HB as a donor. Only harmaline has one rotatable bond. The polar surface area for harmalol, harmaline, and harmane are 48, 37, and 28 respectively. The naturally occurring indole alkaloids in (Table 4) showed LE values against H1N1 and H5N1 of 0.69–0.75. The acceptable LE value should be more than 0.3. However, all compounds revealed LEE values in the range of 6.43–7.32. An LLE value ≥ 5 is recommended for drug candidates.Table 5 Physicochemical parameters and lipophilicity metrics for selected carboline alkaloids.Full size tableStructure–activity relationship (SAR)Generally, carboline alkaloids revealed better antiviral activities than indole alkaloids except strychnine sulfate showed potent in vitro activity against H1N1 (IC50 = 0.06 µg/ml). Harmine and Norharmane have no effect. Harmalol, Harmane, and Harmaline illustrated equal activity against both viruses and were more potent than standard zanamivir drug. Furthermore, the free NH of the indole skeleton and low molecular weight seem important in compound activity. Among these alkaloids, harmalol has the highest PSA value and displayed the best lipophilicity metrics (LE and LEE). The compound’s geometry and aromaticity illustrated the retardation effect in compound activity especially in the case of harmaline in comparison to the inactive compound harmine.DiscussionInfluenza is a highly transmissible respiratory disease that occasionally causes pandemics as well as seasonal epidemics. The annual seasonal viral epidemics kill up to 1 million people and infect about 10% of the human population all over the world53. Despite that immunization is crucial and may help to minimize the viral infection severity, it only works when the vaccine matches the target viral strains that are already in circulation54,55,56.There are different FDA-approved and/or licensed anti-influenza agents available in the global markets, but their efficacy to control epidemic and pandemic influenza A viruses is now questionable with increased ratios of drug-resistant variants1. The viral resistance against the available anti-influenza medications is the result of the development of IAV strains under the selection pressure of “antigenic shift” and/or “antigenic drift”1,57. In this context, the decreased susceptibility to the already established antiviral medications urges the need to find new antiviral agents to combat the emerging and re-emerging flu strains.A huge number of naturally derived, biologically active compounds containing the indole nucleus serve as therapeutics for many diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and viral and microbial diseases58. Hence, we sought to examine the antiviral efficacy of some indole and β-carboline indole alkaloids against seasonal influenza A/H1N1 and highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 viruses. Intriguingly, the highly promising indole alkaloid, Strychnine Sulfate, proved its ability to combat the tested avian lAV by blocking mainly the adsorption of the virus to MDCK host cells, however no documented data available regarding the antiviral and/or anti-influenza activity of strychnine sulfate.On the same hand, the β-carboline indole alkaloids including Harmalol and Harmaline showed highly promising anti-influenza activities against influenza A/H1N1 and A/H5N1 viruses. Previous results on the total seed extract of Peganum harmala L. containing Harmalol, Harmine, Harmaline, and Harmane proved to exert anti-influenza activity against influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1; PR8) virus with an IC50 value of 9.87 µg/ml for the crude extract and 5.8 µg/ml for the total purified alkaloids59,60. However, rare or no information is available about the anti-influenza activities of Harmalol or Harmaline as purified compounds.On the other hand, Harmane was shown to elucidate its capacity to counteract both seasonal human A/H1N1 virus and avian influenza A/H5N1 virus. In addition to the diverse range of Harmane, the purified Harmane from two different Simira plants, a genus of plants in the family Rubiaceae, showed antiviral potential against two different types of herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) with EC50 (half maximal effective concentration) values of 4.90 µg/ml for HSV-1 and 71.8 µg/ml for HSV-235. Regarding the influenza viruses, no evident proof of the anti-influenza properties of pure Harmane was found in the literature. however P. harmala seeds extract undergone previous in vivo study against IAV60.As to their safety, strychnine is known to cause muscle contraction and convulsions that can lead to respiratory paralysis at high dose of 1.5 mg/kg61. In the same line, alkaloids from P. harmala seeds extract were reported to be toxic at higher doses ranging from 38 to 200 mg/kg in experimental animals62. This confirm that these studied alkaloids are highly tolerated in vivo due to previous studies, but they should be further confirmed in vivo to prove their safety and efficacy.On the contrary, Reserpine was documented to have a robust antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) with an EC50 value of 3.4 µM15 whilst in our findings, it proved moderate anti-influenza potential against the human influenza A/H1N1 virus. Similarly, an in silico study for the antiviral activity of the Eserine (or Physostigmine) derivatives against pandemic SARS-CoV-2 proved their ability to combat the coronavirus action14. However, the purified compound of the Eserine used in this study showed no antiviral activity against the human influenza A/H1N1 virus. Moreover, documented data regarding the antiviral activities of the β-carboline indole alkaloid, Harmine, proved its extensive use as an antiviral agent against HSV-2 with an EC50 value of 1.47 µM17. However, 9 N methylharmine, a Harmine derivative, proved to inhibit the DENV-2 (dengue virus-2) with an EC50 value of 3.2 ± 0.6 µM18. Furthermore, Harmine exerted an antiviral property against EV-71 (Enterovirus-71) infection with an EC50 value of and 20 µM19. Nevertheless, our study proved no anti-influenza activity of the purified β-carboline indole alkaloid, Harmine, against avian influenza A/H5N1 virus.Moreover, the four potent anti-influenza candidates can affect the viral replication cycle at multiple stages with variable inhibition levels, Strychnine Sulfate can predominately impair viral adsorption, while Harmalol and Harmane can affect mainly by interfering with the viral replication and finally Harmaline that affects the virus predominately in a cell-free status (direct virucidal effect). Nevertheless, this stage of the mechanism study is a preliminary overview to highlight the possible stage(s) in the viral replication cycle that may get affected during treatment with the investigated compound. To this point, further molecular investigations are demanded to specifically define the exact viral and cellular targets of the investigated compounds.Conclusively, this study highlighted some alkaloids with robust anti-influenza activity. By applying the chemoinformatic studies, we found that harmalol displayed the best druggability parameters, especially LE and LLE) against both viruses. We, therefore, recommend that the antiviral activities of the studied effective alkaloids have to be widely studied including in vivo studies.ConclusionAlkaloids are natural secondary metabolites of plant origin that increasingly attract attention due to their numerous pharmacological actions including antiviral activities. This study could successfully investigate the anti-influenza efficacy of some distinct biologically active indole and β-carboline (βC) indole alkaloids against seasonal human-type IAV and avian-type IAV. Interestingly, β-carboline (βC) indole alkaloids displayed robust anti-influenza activities against the predefined strains via multiple modes of action. Cheminformatics studies and lipophilicity metrics for active compounds illuminate our direction for further studies for preclinical and clinical phases as antiviral drug candidates.

The three bears, which were euthanized last fall in Montana, later tested positive for the virus, the state’s Fish, Wildlife and Parks department announced in a statement last week. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus has previously been found in a fox and a skunk in Montana, as well as in other mammals such as raccoons, black bears and coyotes in other areas of the country. These are the first recorded cases among wild grizzlies, per the department. The three infected bears were “in poor condition and exhibited disorientation and partial blindness, among other neurological issues,” per the statement. They were observed in three different locations in the northwestern part of the state. Originally, officials suspected the animals had rabies, but when those tests came back negative and reports came in of bird flu in mammals elsewhere, officials decided to test for the virus, writes Isabel Hicks for the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. “We thought, let’s test these just to be safe, thinking they would probably be negative,” Jennifer Ramsey, the department’s wildlife veterinarian, tells the publication. “Lo and behold, they were not.” The current outbreak of avian flu has been the largest in U.S. history, with more than 52 million birds either killed by or culled to contain the virus. Unlike the last large surge in 2014 to 2015, this outbreak did not die out over the summer, and it seems to be driven by wild birds rather than domesticated ones. “We don’t know exactly what it is about it, but it does seem just to be able to grow and transmit better in wild birds,” Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, tells NPR’s Bill Chappell. “Wild birds are the perfect mechanism to spread a virus because they, of course, fly everywhere.” Birds infected with avian flu shed the virus in their feces, saliva, feathers and mucus, and the virus spreads when other birds come in contact with it directly or on contaminated surfaces. In chickens, the mortality rate is up to 90 to 100 percent, with birds often dying within 48 hours. The general human population has a very low risk of infection. Only one case of this subtype of avian influenza has been reported in humans in the U.S., when a man who was involved in culling poultry was exposed on a commercial farm in Colorado last April. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered and was treated with an antiviral drug, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Still, the agency recommends avoiding direct contact with domestic birds or any surfaces that sick birds, wild or domestic, may have contaminated. And while wild mammals seem to be picking up the virus, they are also unlikely to transmit it to humans. “These mammals likely got infected from consuming carcasses of HPAI-infected birds,” Ramsey tells CNN’s Amanda Watts and Theresa Waldrop via email. “Fortunately, unlike avian cases, generally small numbers of mammal cases have been reported in North America … For now, we are continuing to test any bears that demonstrate neurologic symptoms or for which a cause of death is unknown.” Get the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.

HomeNewsSportsOpinionCommunityObituariesCalendarClassifiedsAdvertisersPhotosAboutContactAdvertiseFree TrialSubscribeSign In Three grizzly bears test positive for highly pathogenic avian influenzaJan 25, 2023 Share countHELENA – Three juvenile grizzly bears tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus this fall. The three bears, one near Augusta, one near Dupuyer, and another near Kalispell, were observed to be in poor condition and exhibited disorientation and partial blindness, among other neurological issues. They were euthanized due to their sickness and poor condition. These were the first documented cases of HPAI in grizzly bears. A fox and a skunk in Montana also tested positive for HPAI last year, and the virus has been found in raccoons, black bears and even a coyote in other states and countries. "We suspect these mammals probably get the virus from consuming infected birds," said FWP Wildlife Veterinarian Jennifer Ramsey.Avian influenza (AI) virus is a naturally occurring virus in birds. AI viruses are classified into two groups, based on the severity of disease they cause in infected poultry. Low pathogenic AI viruses generally cause no clinical illness, or only minor symptoms in birds. HPAI viruses are extremely infectious and fatal to poultry and some species of wild birds.Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers risk of HPAI spread to humans to be very low, Montanans should take precautions when handling game birds, sick or dead birds and mammals they find. Whenever possible, avoid contact with sick or dead wildlife. Even if an animal is not suspected to have died from a contagious disease, gloves should always be worn if a dead animal must be handled for disposal.FWP staff would like to know about unusual or unexplained cases of sickness and/or death of wild birds and animals by calling their local wildlife biologist or the wildlife lab in Bozeman at 406-577-7880 or 406-577-7882.

With the ongoing demand set upon the NHS post pandemic, the over-the-counter kit has been launched to help alleviate pressures on healthcare institutions. Expand The single use test kit takes ten minutes to detect the SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A and Influenza B viruses that cause COVID-19 and Influenza, giving people the option to test from home and to obtain a fast and accurate diagnosis. 2San says this diagnostic is indicative of the organisation’s continual investment in innovation and development of healthcare products to improve public health. Recent research from 2San revealed that 86% of people surveyed used lateral flow tests during the pandemic, with 87% saying using them gave them reassurance of their health status. Mark Hewlett, global CEO at 2San said: “This test is revolutionary in that it will allow people to determine the appropriate treatment pathway to take. it will alleviate pressure on primary healthcare institutions, and it will also avoid inadvertent medical use of therapeutics or drugs that aren’t necessary. “The dual test will be affordable and accessible, allowing environments like schools and workplaces to be safer and healthier places. “2San’s mission is ‘Better Care Better Life’ and we feel the news of our launch of this dual test perfectly aligns with that vision.” Back to Search Results Tags 2San Diagnostics sars-cov-2 flu COVID-19 23 January 2023 09:32 RSS Print TOP MEDTECH STORIES MEDICAL DEVICE NEWS LATEST DIGITAL IN HEALTHCARE NEWS LATEST MEDTECH REGULATORY NEWS LATEST MEDTECH DIAGNOSTICS NEWS LATEST AI & VR IN HEALTHCARE NEWS LATEST MEDTECH MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS & BUSINESS NEWS LATEST MATERIALS AND ASSEMBLY NEWS LATEST MEDTECH START-UP NEWS LATEST MEDTECH IRELAND NEWS LATEST INDUSTRY INSIGHTS MedTalk Podcast FEATURED INSIGHTS, ANALYSIS & OPINION ARRANGE A WEBINAR Home News + Latest MedTech News Medical Device News Digital Health News Sustainability News Diagnostics News Regulatory News Business & Finance News Start-Up News Materials & Manufacturing News MedTech Ireland News FemTech News NHS News Insights + Latest MedTech Insights Medical Device Insights Sustainability Insights Digital Health Insights Regulatory Insights Diagnostics Insights Materials & Manufacturing Insights FemTech Insights NHS Insights MedTalk Podcast Med-Tech Expo + Med-Tech Innovation Expo News Med-Tech Innovation Expo 2025 Magazine Resources + My Account White Papers Webinars Sponsored Articles FemTech Latest MedTech News Medical Device News Digital Health News Sustainability News Diagnostics News Regulatory News Business & Finance News Start-Up News Materials & Manufacturing News MedTech Ireland News FemTech News NHS News © Rapid Medtech Communications Ltd.

Image: Adobe23 January 2023The unique genetics of the Australian black swan leaves the species vulnerable to viral illnesses such as avian flu, University of Queensland research has revealed. The UQ-led study has generated a first-ever genome of the black swan which revealed the species lacks some immune genes which help other wild waterfowl combat infectious diseases. Associate Professor Kirsty Short from UQ’s School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences said the geographic isolation of Australia’s black swans has meant limited exposure to pathogens commonly found in other parts of the world leading to reduced immune diversity. “Unlike Mallard ducks for example, black swans are extremely sensitive highly pathogenic avian influenza – HPAI which is often referred to as bird flu - and can die from it within three days,” Dr Short said. “Our data suggests that the immune system of the black swan is such that, should any avian viral infection become established in its native habitat, their survival would be in peril. “We currently don’t have HPAI in Australia, but it has spread from Asia to North America, Europe, North Africa and South America. “When it was introduced to new locations, such as Chile and Peru, thousands of wild seabirds perished. “The risk to one of Australia’s most unique and beautiful birds is very real, and we need to be prepared if we hope to protect it.” With the knowledge from the UQ study, Dr Short said researchers and conservationists hope to be able to better protect not only the black swan, but also other susceptible species across the globe. “We want to increase awareness about how vulnerable Australia’s bird species are to avian influenza and the highly precarious situation they are in,” Dr Short said. This research was funded by the Australian Department of Agriculture and Water Resources and an Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award and was in collaboration with the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). This research was published in Genome Biology. Media: Associate Professor Kirsty Short, k.short@uq.edu.au, +61 452 374 811; Faculty of Science Media, science.media@uq.edu.au, +61 438 162 687.

NCOA is continuing to review applications on a rolling basis until March 1. Interested organizations are encouraged to apply online. Funding will support outreach, vaccine clinics, transportation, and more nationwide Contact Simona Combi Public Relations Manager 571-527-3982 simona.combi@ncoa.org Arlington, VA (January 26, 2023)—The National Council on Aging (NCOA), the national voice for every person’s right to age well, has announced the first round of grantees under its Vaccine Uptake Initiative, funded by the U.S. Administration for Community Living. The nine grantees will receive funding to conduct tailored outreach, host vaccine clinics, and offer services like transportation and appointment scheduling to enable older adults and people with disabilities to get the latest COVID-19 booster and flu vaccine. Combined, the grantees are expected to reach up to 30,000 individuals. “These local organizations are trusted messengers in their communities, and we’re proud to support their efforts to keep older adults and people with disabilities safe and healthy with the latest lifesaving vaccines,” said Ramsey Alwin, NCOA president and CEO. The grantees serve diverse racial and ethnic populations in both metropolitan and rural areas, helping us ensure that no one is left behind.” Servicios de la Raza in Colorado and Chinatown Service Center in California, will each receive Regional Collaborative Grants, and seven organizations will receive Community Action Grants to focus on specific hard-to-reach populations. Those are: Alma Family Services in California Franklin County Senior Services in Illinois Senior Friendship Centers in Florida Korean Women’s Association in Washington Mazzoni Center in Pennsylvania McDowell County Commission on Aging in West Virginia ONEGeneration in California NCOA is continuing to review applications for additional funding on a rolling basis until March 1. Interested organizations are encouraged to apply online. Nearly nine in 10 deaths from COVID are among people 65 and over, and 70-85% of seasonal flu-related deaths occur in older adults. However, the CDC reports that only 71% of older adults who received the initial COVID vaccine also received the first recommended booster, and only 44% have received the second one. A study from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 43% of people 65 and over were “not sure” or responded “no” when asked if the booster dose was for them. About NCOA The National Council on Aging (NCOA) is the national voice for every person’s right to age well. We believe that how we age should not be determined by gender, color, sexuality, income, or ZIP code. Working with thousands of national and local partners, we provide resources, tools, best practices, and advocacy to ensure every person can age with health and financial security.

Europe is going through the most devastating bird flu epidemic in its history, with more than 50 million poultry slaughtered in one year. At the beginning of autumn, seagulls and gannets killed by this virus appeared on the beaches of Spain’s northwestern Galicia region. Days later, in early October, American mink began to die of hemorrhagic pneumonia on a fur farm in Carral, a few minutes’ drive from the city of A Coruña. Mortality in this outbreak exceeded 4% in a single week.A scientific study now suggests that the avian flu virus jumped from wild birds to mink and mutated on the farm, beginning to spread from mammal to mammal but failing to infect mask-wearing farm workers. This outbreak has set off alarm bells across the planet. The Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans, who traced the origin of the Covid pandemic for the World Health Organization (WHO), has issued a warning on her social media accounts: “We are playing with fire.”The British doctor Jeremy Farrar, an expert in emerging diseases who was recently appointed chief scientist at the WHO, has also alerted about the recent outbreak in Spain on his social media. “The greatest risk of a devastating flu pandemic is avian or animal flu that infects intermediate mammals, and evolves to mammal-to-mammal and human-to-human transmission with little or no human immunity,” he said on Twitter. Farrar, who correctly alerted the world to a strange pneumonia in the Chinese city of Wuhan on December 31, 2019, is now urging authorities to prepare vaccines and treatments for each type of animal flu.A mixing vesselMink are susceptible to both bird flu and human flu, so these animals can act as a mixing vessel in which viruses mix and more lethal versions emerge, warns the study, which was led by Montserrat Agüero of the Central Veterinary Laboratory of Spain’s Ministry of Agriculture and her Italian colleague Isabella Monne, from the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe).The culprit in the Galician outbreak is a highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, with an unusual mutation called T271A, a disturbing characteristic that was already present in the swine flu virus that caused a pandemic in humans in 2009. Regional health authorities decided on October 18 to immediately cull the 52,000 mink on the farm, located outdoors and with easy access to wild animals.Virologists’ worst nightmare would be the leap to humans of a deadly flu virus. The WHO had already warned in 2019, before Covid, that “the world is not prepared for a pandemic of virulent and rapidly transmitted respiratory pathogens.” The institution then said that a pandemic such as the 1918 flu could kill 80 million people, “causing panic, destabilizing national security and seriously affecting economy and trade.”It’s pretty scary. In Europe there had never been such an outbreak in mink beforeElisa Pérez, virologistThe virologist Elisa Pérez, an expert in emerging viruses at Spain’s Animal Health Research Center (INIA-CISA), is very concerned. “It’s pretty scary. In Europe there had never been such an outbreak in mink before, there were only a few cases described in China. We had never had such a big scare,” she warns. Pérez would like for all mink farms to be shut down as soon as possible. “What else needs to happen?”Before the Covid pandemic, there were around 2,900 fur farms in the European Union, producing 27 million mink pelts each year, according to official industry figures. After the coronavirus outbreaks in hundreds of farms in 2020, some countries, such as Denmark and the Netherlands, ordered massive culls and closures. A report by European authorities estimated that there were 755 mink farms left in operation at the start of 2021, mainly in Finland, Poland, Lithuania and Greece. In Spain, that crisis caused some security measures to be implemented, such as mandatory face masks for workers.One of the mink from a Dutch farm where Covid cases were recorded.Bird flu is spreading around the world. The virus has already settled in South America, a team of scientists from Argentina and Peru warned last week. On the Peruvian coasts, 22,000 wild birds died in just one month, especially pelicans and boobies. On January 9, a nine-year-old girl from a village in Bolívar (Ecuador), admitted to intensive care after being in contact with chickens, became the first human case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Latin America. The WHO warned last Wednesday that the diversity of flu viruses that are jumping from animals to people is “alarming.”In Spain last year there were 37 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry, the last two in a farm with 150,000 laying hens in Guadalajara and in another with 1,500 geese in La Cistérniga (Valladolid), according to figures provided by the Ministry of Agriculture. Two workers at the Guadalajara farm became infected with the virus without developing symptoms. In the Carral outbreak, the 11 employees who were in contact with the mink remained in isolation for 10 days, despite having tested negative for avian flu.The virus is easily transmitted between birds, but only rarely does it pass from bird to human. Between people it has not yet managed to jump effectively, although the outbreak in mink in A Coruña suggests that the virus is capable of mutating and adapting rapidly to jumping from mammal to mammal.The epidemiologist Matthew Baylis, former director of The Pandemic Institute in Liverpool, has also reacted to the analysis of the Galician outbreak. “Two years ago I wrote about the risks of mink farming for Covid. And now we see even greater risks for avian influenza, as mink provide a wonderful opportunity for the virus to adapt to mammals. This is where the next pandemic may come from,” he tweeted. “Is anyone heeding the warning sign? Clearly not.”Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA EditionTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

Read our privacy policyA former nurse has released shocking images of her super-fit son in a 10 day coma, after he nearly died after catching the flu.Jack Hollingsworth, 19, was rushed to hospital after becoming severely unwell at home after he contracted influenza which developed into pneumonia.Mother Claire, from Llangristiolus in Anglesey, Wales, thought her son had Covid but the test came back negative.She knew something was seriously wrong when Jack’s temperature spiked and his heart rate became very fast.Terrified Claire thought she could lose Jack and rushed him to Ysbyty Gwynedd’s Emergency Department on December 15.Jack was taken to intensive care where doctors put him in a coma.RecommendedEuroMillions winner burned through £40m by spending £100K a weekCouple who flew to

all thought it was a bad cold or even Covid.“The Covid test came back negative and towards the end of the week he became more unwell, he had a very high temperature and a very fast heart rate.“I couldn’t wait any longer, I’m an ex nurse so I knew my son wasn’t very well and I felt there was a risk that we could lose him.“I drove Jack in my car to the department and ran inside to get some help.“The receptionist could see how frantic I was and immediately alerted the clinical staff who rushed him straight into Resus.“It was apparent that Jack was extremely sick as the team decided he needed ventilating straight away.“It was the worst moment of my life seeing my son like that.”open image in gallery(BCUHB / SWNS)Test results revealed Jack had contracted flu, which had developed into pneumonia.He spent ten days in a coma with his mother, father John, and girlfriend Erin by his side, but medics said there were times they feared he would die.Dr Terry Collingwood, critical care consultant, said: “When Jack arrived with us in the Intensive Care Unit his condition was life-threatening.“He needed complex medical support to survive the initial 48 hours.“During that time we received advice and guidance from the Specialist Respiratory Failure service at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester on how best to manage Jack’s condition, for which we were extremely grateful.”On Christmas Eve, Jack began to show signs of improvement and he was brought out of the coma.Claire said: “There were times we thought we were going to lose him.“A parent should never have to see their child so ill and it was just heartbreaking for us as parents to see our baby ventilated.“Jack is super fit, having just completed an advanced diploma in outdoor activities but he demonstrated how a young person can become suddenly overwhelmed by influenza once they reach a point that their immune system burns out.“At this point, he deteriorated from a boy with a flu like illness to severely unwell in the space of a couple of hours.“It was a reminder of how dangerous flu can be, even for those who are young and fit and we would continue to encourage anyone who is eligible to get their flu jab after seeing what it nearly did to our son.Jack was able to go home on Boxing Day but has been back at the hospital recently to thank staff who saved his life.He said he is now looking forward to returning to the Snowdonia mountains.Jack said: “It was great to come back and see the staff who cared for me, as I was in a coma I don’t remember what any of them looked like so it was lovely to meet them and thank them personally.“I will be forever grateful to them for saving my life.”Claire added: “We just want to thank the hospital, especially the Critical Care team and the Emergency Department staff for all the care and support they have given us.“We felt so looked after during that time and the care they provided Jack was incredible.“We are extremely grateful to them and everything they did.”Dr Collingwood said: “Helping a patient like Jack can be very challenging and requires input from many people working in multiple different specialities, including nursing, physiotherapy, radiology and laboratory services as well as the various support services such as housekeeping, administration and portering staff.“It is a huge testament to the entire team here at Ysbyty Gwynedd that someone as sick as Jack was when he arrived has been able to make such a remarkable recovery.“We were all delighted to see Jack again and we are so pleased to see him doing so well.”More

highlights inconsistent reporting and importance of the human factorA new report has unified the WHO threat prevention model, after reviewing nearly 3,000 documents issued over the 23 years leading up to the Covid-19 pandemicCholera patients in Malawi in January, amid an outbreak that has caused more than a thousand victims.Thoko Chikondi (AP)Jon Gurutz ArranzJan 26, 2023 - 16:29CETWhatsappFacebookTwitterLinkedinCopy linkUntil now, no official pandemic model had been capable of recording the health alerts that are reported around the world on a daily basis, which sometimes number tens of thousands a day. The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated a unifying process that had been underway for years but had yet to be fully developed. Now, a group of scientists has developed a database based on previously unreleased World Health Organization (WHO) Disease Outbreak News (DON) statistics, a system which allows any physician to report possible health threats from anywhere in the world. It also provides a detailed review of epidemic outbreaks over the last two decades, up to the months leading up to the global outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.The authors point out that their work with the historical record allows them to observe recurrent threats at the global level, such as influenza or cholera, and persistent epidemics, such as the Ebola virus disease in Africa or MERS-CoV in the Middle East. However, the report also highlights the issues raised by inconsistent reporting of factors such as disease names, case totals, mortality, and actions taken to curtail the spread of illnesses. “Egypt, with 115 health alerts, has the fifth-highest number of notifications and a strong yellow fever track record, while neighboring Libya has never reported anything, reflecting the collapse of its once highly effective health system after two civil wars,” says Rebecca Katz, director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University Medical Center and lead author of the review, which covers the period from 1996 to 2019.Among the information collated in the report, China stands out with the highest number of health alerts (262), most of which are related to different types of influenza. Katz notes the coincidence between the information collected and the accuracy with which epidemics have been recorded, since despite “lost protocols,” redundant information or problems with mismatching categories, there have been no “unreported” phantom pandemics.Professor Rebecca Katz, director of the Georgetown University Health Center, served as an advisor to President Joe Biden on the coronavirus task force.Expert criteria“The WHO website is the main source of health information,” explains Katz, “so we believe that the official registry should be standardized.” The researcher explains how specialists must “monitor tens of thousands of signals every day that could represent a serious global health problem, and all the time they have to decide what is relevant and what is not.” As such, she considers it vital to design a model that unifies historical criteria on health alerts. The model presented by the Georgetown University team is available online worldwide.Epidemiologist Susana Monge Corella, who did not participate in the research, highlights another key after analyzing the work: the human role in deciding the severity of an outbreak. In those vital moments, experience is an important factor, she says: “You filter according to accumulated knowledge, but there is no expert committee I have sat on where health alerts were decided without discussion, despite the decades of knowledge. Due to the complexity of decision-making, the human factor is difficult to replace.”Monge, of the National Epidemiology Center at the Carlos III Health Institute in Madrid and who served on the Spanish Health Ministry’s emergency coordination center during the Covid pandemic, points out that there are other infections where the decision on whether to report or not is made based on the unexpectedness or virulence of the event. “If a family gets botulism poisoning through a homemade product then it is a concrete problem. If a child gets botulism poisoning from a commercial milk formula that has been sold throughout Spain, then the same disease has a completely different risk and takes on another dimension. If the brand of milk formula is from overseas, then it is already an international problem,” the epidemiologist explains.The Spanish Center for the Coordination of Health Alerts and Emergencies during an evaluation of protocols against Ebola, on July 19, 2019.A case of avian influenza is “priority number one; every event is reportable” and subject to “strict surveillance over the years, hence its prevalence in the study,” Monge adds. Hence the alarm generated by an outbreak in October among mink in Spain’s northwestern region of Galicia, which has placed virologists around the world on high alert, even though it has not jumped to humans.Dangerous influenza outbreaks are the main disease reported in the 23 years analyzed, with 776 notifications. The most recent recorded case, on January 18, was a case of avian influenza in a nine-year-old girl in Ecuador. Because of its prevalence over decades and its severity, the Georgetown scientists emphasize that they have unified the different subtypes of influenza, taking into account that the WHO requires reporting of new variants in accordance with International Health Regulations. In an accompanying commentary, the researchers state that while the number of influenza cases has increased globally, due to its pandemization it is underreported, distorting certain parameters. The authors are aware of thousands of influenza A infections in Iran in 2019 and India in 2015, but over the last decade the only reports on influenza A outbreaks - beyond three isolated and minor cases in Canada, Laos and the Netherlands - have come from China.The Georgetown researchers reviewed 2,789 WHO disease outbreak news reports, recounting relevant information about unexpected epidemic outbreaks such as the 2014-2016 Ebola virus outbreaks in West Africa or the 2011 cholera outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In these can be read “high-level decision making that governs information sharing during public health emergencies,” the researchers explain in the paper. This is why the report concludes that more information transparency and the adoption of “standardized formats for sharing epidemiological metadata” would make the DON “more useful to researchers and policymakers.” Despite this, the report acknowledges a palpable improvement in the WHO health alert register due to the new normality imposed by the pandemic.In theory, all healthcare professionals should report a possible infectious outbreak to the WHO on the mere suspicion of a case. An epidemic outbreak alert is anything that could “pose a risk to public health,” says José María Arteagoitia Axpe, a specialist in preventive medicine and public health. The rapid transmission of information is essential, adds the expert, given that the objective of the epidemiological surveillance system is “the detection and control of communicable diseases”Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA EditionTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

Overall, the guidelines include recommendations on holding immunosuppressive medications and/or delaying vaccination to maximize vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy, as well as safe approaches while using the live attenuated vaccines. In addition, expanded indications for some vaccines in patients with RMDs have also been noted. The population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) format was used to formulate clinical questions. Systematic literature reviews were conducted to address each PICO question, and the quality of evidence was graded as high, moderate, low, or very low. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment and Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and adhering to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) criteria, recommendations were developed based on the best available evidence. An expert voting panel reviewed the evidence and formulated recommendations. A virtual patient panel, including 9 adult and pediatric patients with RMDs, provided patient perspectives and preferences for the voting panel to consider. Consensus on both the strong and conditional recommendations was achieved by a 70% level of agreement. The following guiding principles were implemented in the current guidelines: Patients must be administered the indicated vaccines whenever possible. The ACR guidelines complement recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Disease, disease activity, and risk for vaccine-preventable infection must be considered when deciding to hold a medication before or after vaccination. Shared decision-making with patients is an essential part of any vaccine approach. The majority of the recommendations were noted to be conditional and were supported by very low-quality evidence. Expanded Vaccination Indications for Patients With RMDs Receiving Immunosuppressive Medications Influenza Vaccination Administering high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines is conditionally recommended over regular-dose influenza vaccines for patients with RMDs aged 65 years and older, and those younger than 18 years and those younger than 65 years receiving treatment with immunosuppressive medications. Pneumococcal Vaccination The pneumococcal vaccine is strongly recommended for patients with RMDs younger than 65 years and receiving treatment with immunosuppressive medications. Recombinant Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) Vaccination The recombinant VZV vaccine is strongly recommended for patients with RMDs who are older than 18 years and receiving treatment with immunosuppressive medications. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination Vaccination against HPV is conditionally recommended for patients with RMDs who are aged between 26 and 45 years, receiving treatment with immunosuppressive medications, and have never previously received the vaccine. The ACR also noted whether holding immunosuppressive medications while receiving a nonlive attenuated vaccine will maximize vaccine immunogenicity, though holding medications may cause disease flares. Methotrexate Holding methotrexate for 2 weeks after receiving an influenza vaccine is conditionally recommended for patients with RMDs, based on disease activity. Medications Other Than Methotrexate Around the time of influenza vaccination, patients with RMDs are conditionally recommended to continue receiving immunosuppressive medications other than methotrexate. Continuing immunosuppressive medications around the time of other (non-influenza) nonlive attenuated immunizations is conditionally recommended for patients with RMDs. Vaccines to Patients Receiving Rituximab The ACR conditionally recommended that patients with RMDs receiving treatment with rituximab receive influenza vaccination on schedule rather than waiting until their next dose of rituximab. Rituximab has been conditionally recommended to be delayed for 2 weeks following vaccination for patients with RMDs, as well as to postpone nonlive attenuated vaccines (except influenza vaccination) until the next time rituximab is administered. Nonlive Attenuated Vaccines for Patients Receiving Glucocorticoids Any nonlive attenuated vaccines are strongly recommended for patients with RMDs who receive the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone daily. Administering any nonlive attenuated vaccines to patients with RMDs who receive the equivalent of prednisone of greater than 10 mg daily but less than 20 mg daily has been conditionally recommended. Influenza vaccination is conditionally recommended for patients with RMDs receiving 20 mg or more of prednisone daily. Delaying nonlive attenuated vaccines, other than the influenza vaccine, until glucocorticoids are tapered to the equivalent of prednisone less than 20 mg daily is conditionally recommended for patients with RMDs receiving the equivalent of prednisone of at least 20 mg daily. Delaying Vaccination Regardless of the severity of disease activity, administering nonlive attenuated vaccines is conditionally recommended for patients with RMDs to increase vaccine immunogenicity. Managing Immunosuppressive Treatment During Live Attenuated Vaccination The ACR has conditionally recommended to delay live attenuated vaccines in patients with RMDs receiving treatment with immunosuppressive medications. The ACR also conditionally recommended to delay using immunosuppressive medications for an appropriate amount of time before and 4 weeks after receiving a live attenuated vaccine. Administering Rotavirus Vaccine to Infants Receiving Biologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) In Utero The ACR has conditionally recommended the administration of live attenuated rotavirus vaccination within the first 6 months of life to newborns and infants who had second- and/or third-trimester prenatal exposure to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). It has been conditionally recommended to delay live attenuated rotavirus vaccination until after 6 months for newborns and infants who had second- and/or third-trimester prenatal exposure to rituximab. Administrating Multiple Vaccines to Patients With RMDs on the Same Day The ACR has conditionally recommended to administer as many vaccines as feasible on the same day rather than 1 vaccine at a time. Overall, the authors of the paper concluded, “Application of these recommendations should consider patients’ individual risk for vaccine-preventable illness and for disease flares, particularly if immunosuppressive medications are held for vaccination. Shared decision-making with patients is encouraged in clinical settings.” References: Bass AR, Chakravarty E, Akl EA, et al. 2022 American College of Rheumatology guideline for vaccinations in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases.

As of January 10, more than 10 million birds have been culled, over 90% of which were egg-laying hens, leading to a spike in egg prices. English 日本語 简体字 繁體字 Français Español العربية Русский Japan faces a major, nationwide avian influenza outbreak. During the 2022/2023 season, since the first cases confirmed at the end of October 2022 in Okayama Prefecture and Hokkaidō, a further 57 sites have been affected in 23 prefectures. The largest number of birds culled on record in a single season up to now was 9.8 million in 2020, but that has been surpassed with 10.0 million birds having been culled as of January 10, 2023. A highly pathogenic avian influenza virus is rampant in this season across Japan, as many other countries are also being hit by outbreaks. Migratory and other wild birds have been found to be more frequently infected than usual. Along with emergency disinfection at poultry farms nationwide, the government is calling for thorough quarantine measures to be implemented, including draining reservoirs near farms with outbreaks to prevent wild birds gathering there. Number of Birds Culled by Prefecture Due to Avian Influenza in the 2022/2023 Season (million) Prefecture Sites Affected Number of Birds Culled (million) Ibaraki (ranks first in Japan for egg-laying chickens) 2 2.08 Aomori 2 1.50 Niigata 2 1.45 Kagoshima 12 1.40 Okayama 3 0.73 Hiroshima 4 0.72 Created by Nippon.com based on documents published by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (as of January 10, 2023). Among the birds culled so far, more than 90% were egg-laying hens. According to market information from JA Z-Tamago, the average wholesale egg price in January 2023 rose more than ¥100 year on year, from ¥151 to ¥260 per kilogram, as of January 10.

Following COVID-19, when will the next pandemic of a highly lethal nature strike again?A chicken farm [Photo by Fot. Konrad Łoziński / CC BY 2.0]The first ever extensive global monkeypox outbreak affected multiple countries across nearly every continent. It felt like the world had dodged a bullet when cases began to subside. As well, the outbreak of the extremely deadly Ebola Sudan virus in Uganda threatened the region and beyond as it spread into the densely populated capital of Kampala. Such potential crises are appearing far more frequently in recent years, making new pandemics a risk to the world’s population which cannot be ignored.The first new pandemic after COVID-19, which is still continuing to infect billions of people, may well be already in plain sight, but overlooked or dismissed for the most part by most news outlets and given no political attention.The largest recorded outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been killing millions of birds since October 2021. From disease and related culling, in all more than 140 million poultry, including 60 million in North America and 48 million in Europe, have been killed, according to the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH).A genetic analysis of the H5N1 influenza virus in the current avian pandemic has located it in a clade (virus family) circulating among poultry and wild birds across multiple continents, but most closely related to strains among European seabirds.The first cases in North America were detected in December 2021 in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, on a bird farm. In February 2022, Florida’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission reported that the death of black vultures at the state’s Hontoon Island State Park was caused by the same virus.Over the next several months, the virus had spread into numerous wild bird species, commercial poultry, as well as mammals, including grizzly bears, red foxes, coyotes, seals and dolphins, as well as a human case confirmed on April 27 by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in an incarcerated individual in Colorado who had been involved in culling infected poultry.In February 2022, the Wall Street Journal noted that the avian flu had affected a chicken farm in Fulton, Kentucky, and a Tyson Foods chicken processing farmhouse, raising concerns about a repeat of the last major bird flu calamity in 2015.Egg prices have risen almost 60 percent by December, compared to the previous year, with egg inventories down 29 percent. At present, Nebraska has seen 6.7 million poultry deaths, up from 4.8 million in the 2015 outbreak. According to the Journal, Colorado has lost 90 percent of its egg-laying hens.As disastrous as the outbreak has been to the bird population, the fear remains that the virus will learn to efficiently use a human host to transmit itself. Until now, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), between 2003 and March 2022, there have been only 864 cases of H5N1 in humans across 18 countries worldwide. The infection in the US was the first time for this country.The fatality rate, however, is dangerously high with 456 deaths among the 864 cases, giving a 53 percent chance of dying if infected. Thus far, cases have remained sporadic, in small clusters, involving exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments.But there is growing concern among scientists that a more virulently infective form of the virus could suddenly evolve and spread rapidly into the human population as a lethal airborne pathogen. Wend Blay Puryear, a molecular virologist at Tufts University, told the Guardian, “There is concern about it having pandemic potential. Before COVID was on anybody’s radar, this was the one that we were all watching closely.”As a recent report in Think Global Health noted, “Each time one species transmits the virus to another, it constitutes a spillover event. These myriad spillovers—among wild bird species, from wild birds to domestic birds, across birds to mammals, and from animals to humans—raise serious concerns about the potential for further adaptation and evolution of this influenza lineage and the continued risk associated with avian migration. Understanding which species among these many hosts may be helping the virus adapt is crucial for targeted surveillance and mitigation efforts.”The last pandemic to cause such a significant devastation among birds began in December 2014, when more than 50 million birds died, costing farmers over $1.6 billion. However, by the summer of 2015, the virus suddenly vanished as quickly as it had appeared. Migratory birds returning to Canada were found to be virus-free.However, in the present instance, the outbreak was sustained throughout the summer and has surged again this winter. Active surveillance has identified more than 3,300 infected birds across 100 species, an immense scale of transmission compared to the outbreak in 2014–2015 when fewer than 100 wild birds tested positive for H5N1.A veterinarian with Colorado’s agricultural department, Maggie Baldwin, told the Journal, “One of the challenges is that we don’t know why it [the virus] has been able to thrive so long. We’re almost a full year into this outbreak and it is ongoing.”Mike Tincher, rehabilitation coordinator for Colorado’s Rocky Mountain Raptor Program, said, “There is no historical context for this. It’s like when COVID hit for humans … We’ve never seen this before. And it’s just not slowing down.”As the US Department of Agriculture recently noted, “Wild birds can be infected with HPAI and show no signs of illness. They can carry the disease to new areas when migrating, potentially exposing domesticated poultry to the virus.” Such asymptomatic spread of the virus poses an exceptional challenge for the international community unless surveillance systems are bolstered across animal and human sectors.A recent report by Eurosurveillance has garnered much attention on social media. It describes the outbreak of HPAI H5N1 among intensively farmed minks in the Galicia region in northwest Spain in October 2022. Oxford University professor of evolution and genomics Aris Katzourakis tweeted, “[I] don’t understand how mink farming can be defended. Viruses move easily between mink and humans, and this could play a big role in the emergence of future pandemics.”When the initial outbreak occurred, veterinarians had assumed that the disease was caused by SARS-CoV-2, as it had previously struck mink farms in Denmark in November 2020. However, laboratory testing revealed the culprit was the HPAI H5N1. More than 52,000 minks at the farm had to be culled.As the Eurosurveillance report noted, the minks were kept in open barns and fed raw fish and poultry byproducts sourced from the same region. Their detailed analysis found the virus was similar to the virus circulating among birds across multiple continents.A Science article published this week on the bird flu outbreak at the Spanish mink farm states, “The virus is not known to spread well between mammals; people almost always catch it from infected birds, not one another. But now, H5N1 appears to have spread through a densely packed mammalian population and gained at least one mutation that favors mammal-to-mammal spread. Virologists warn that H5N1, now rampaging through birds around the world, could invade other mink farms and become still more transmissible.”Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College of London, warned, “This is incredibly concerning. This is a clear mechanism for an H5 pandemic to start.”The mutation in question is uncommon and only seen once before, in a European polecat, according to CIDRAP. The mutation could have spontaneously evolved among mink in a convergent evolutionary pathway. The new variant, labeled 2.3.4.4b, emerged in Europe in late 2020 and became predominant in wild birds. It is believed to have originated in Korea through a process of reassortment between the H5N1 and the clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8.Although it appears the mutation may be less pathogenic for humans, about six people have thus far caught the virus and one has died. It also appears to be more adapted to all birds as Richard Webby, an influenza researcher, noted. It is worrisome that in this reappearance of H5N1, numerous mammalian species have become infected.Thomas Mettenleiter, head of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute, speaking to Science on the lower pathogenicity (lethality) of the new strain in humans, explained, “Of course that can be bad news, too, because it might make it easier for the virus to start spreading under the radar, giving it more opportunity to evolve.”Read moreNew study supports natural origins of COVID-19, sources close to WHO team say20 November 2021Ebola crisis in Uganda: A new public health warning from WHO 3 November 2022The same criminal “profits before lives” response by capitalism to COVID-19 and monkeypox is allowing the resurgence of polio30 August 2022Contact usRelated TopicsFind out more about these topics:Medical scienceThe coronavirus pandemicAgricultural workersLoading© 1998-2024 World Socialist Web Site.

[ MARTHA ASENCIO-RHINE | Times ]By Max ChesnesTimes staffPublished Jan. 24, 2023|Updated Jan. 24, 2023Florida’s unprecedented outbreak of a highly infectious bird flu strain among wild birds has spread to two more iconic species: sandhill cranes and American white pelicans, wildlife officials confirmed to the Tampa Bay Times Tuesday.The birds are the latest additions to a growing list of well-known species — including bald eagles and great horned owls — confirmed to have contracted highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI.The virus is now confirmed in 35 counties and has circulated among 34 wild birds species in Florida, the St. Petersburg-based Fish and Wildlife Research Institute said.“We have likely lost tens of thousands of our native birds in the past year,” Institute spokesperson Carly Jones said in a statement to the Times. “Although things do not currently seem to be as severe as this time last year, when the virus first hit Florida, we continue to see mortalities across many bird species.”A sandhill crane searches for food in a field off Lutz Lake Fern Road on Monday in Odessa. Bird flu has been confirmed for the first time in white pelicans and sandhill cranes. [ DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD | Times ]Biologists first detected the virus in January 2022, when hunters in Palm Beach County turned over two ducks, just shot and killed, for routine disease testing at a checkpoint hosted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The pair of blue-winged teal ducks were the first two animals in the state to test positive.The news of two new infected species this week underscores bird flu’s widening reach: Sandhill cranes, with their recognizable reddish heads and squawking bugle calls, are a state-designated threatened species. White pelicans are winter visitors, traveling from as far away as western Canada.Researchers at the University of Florida first reported the sandhill crane infection to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services earlier this month, Jones said. The bird was found on a private property in Gainesville during the week of Jan. 9.In late November, two white pelicans were found just offshore of Cedar Key, Jones said. One was dead and the other was sick and brought to a rehabilitation facility. The rehabber killed the bird based on ongoing bird flu protocols. State wildlife officials received the official test results on Dec. 27.“Every one of the white pelicans here in Florida has flown 2,500 miles to spend winter in a safe place. And now they catch this deadly disease. It’s quite sad,” said Ann Paul, president of the Tampa Audubon Society.One year since first infectionThe epicenter of the outbreak first emerged along Florida’s Atlantic Coast in early February, as hundreds of lesser scaup ducks, a common North American diving duck with a black head, started showing signs of neurological distress. But recently, cases in black vultures have spiked in Florida, Mark Cunningham, a fish and wildlife health subsection leader for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, told the Times in November.Keep up with Tampa Bay’s top headlinesSubscribe to our free DayStarter newsletterWe’ll deliver the latest news and information you need to know every morning.Loading...You’re all signed up!Want more of our free, weekly newsletters in your inbox? Let’s get started.Explore all your optionsInfected birds can spread the virus through saliva, nasal secretions and feces, according to the commission. An infected black vulture will often return to its roost before it dies. Then other vultures will feed on the infected carcass, spreading the disease further, Cunningham said.As of November, at least 21 backyard flocks across 11 Florida counties had been confirmed with bird flu, according to data provided by Madeline Brezin of Florida’s Department of Agriculture. That includes two flocks in Hillsborough County and one in Pasco. The infected birds were mostly chickens, but there were also domestic ducks, geese, peafowl and guineas.No commercial poultry flocks in Florida have confirmed cases of bird flu, according to Scott Richardson, the poultry veterinary program manager of the agriculture department’s division of animal industry.“As of today, there’s been none in commercial flocks,” Richardson said over the phone Tuesday. “Thank God.”The best way to prevent the spread of bird flu from wild populations to backyard flocks is to “limit their exposure,” Richardson said. That includes keeping them under cover, with protections like fencing.The wildlife commission also echoes this on a webpage devoted to the outbreak: “Do not let wild birds come into contact with domestic poultry and do not keep bird feeders in the vicinity of domestic poultry.” The backyard flock cases so far in Florida have come from infected wild birds, Richardson said.American white pelicans, which migrate south in the winter months from as far north as Canada, are pictured at Crescent Lake Park, where a small number come every year. The recent outbreak of bird flu has been detected in this species. [ MARTHA ASENCIO-RHINE | Times ]How to prevent bird fluThere is a “low risk” that bird flu spreads to humans, state wildlife experts say. In April, a human case was confirmed in Colorado after somebody became infected when handling poultry that was presumed to be carrying the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The person reported fatigue for several days before recovering.The University of Florida announced in September that a bottlenose dolphin in Dixie County contracted bird flu in the first known case in a cetacean in America. It likely came into contact with an infected bird along Florida’s Gulf Coast, according to researchers.Here are some ways to prevent bird flu, according to wildlife experts:Clean your bird feeders and bird baths with a 10% bleach solution. That’s one part bleach mixed with nine parts water.If you must handle a dead bird, follow how to remove them from the state’s bird flu guidance.Keep bird feeders away from domestic poultry.Report dead birds to the state.“We ask the public not to handle sick or dead birds unless necessary,” Jones said. “However, we strongly encourage the reporting of all sightings of dead birds.”The public can report sightings to the bird mortality database: If you see a dead bird, report it at https://app.myfwc.com/FWRI/AvianMortality/Max ChesnesEnvironment and Climate ReporterMORE FOR YOUFlorida’s iconic Key deer face an uncertain future as sea levels riseYesterday• EnvironmentSea turtle nests increased along Gulf Coast but hurricanes washed many awayNov. 8• EnvironmentAdvertisementHead of Florida environmental agency to step downNov. 7• EnvironmentFloridians approve creating a right to fish and hunt in state ConstitutionNov. 6• EnvironmentWinter is a month away in Tampa Bay.

(Getty images: Lea Scadden)abc.net.auews/black-swan-gene-study-bird-avian-flu-threat/101875874Link copiedShareShare articleThe graceful black swan is a familiar sight in waterways across Australia, but it could disappear if avian flu ever takes hold here.That's the grim conclusion of an international study that has sequenced the iconic bird's genome — and that of its white cousin — for the first time.Key points:Scientists sequenced the genome of the Australian black swan and the mute swanThe study reveals the black swan lacks immune genes found in other swans and wild birdsThe finding suggests it would be in extreme peril if highly pathogenic forms of bird flu emerged in Australia"Black swans have a similar genetic basis [to mute swans], but there are distinct differences," said Kirsty Short, study co-author and virologist at the University of Queensland.The study, published today in the journal Genome Biology, found Australian black swans (Cygnus atratus) lack some immune genes that combat viral infections found in other species of swans and waterfowl. "What it tells us is that if avian flu ever got into Australia, black swans would be really, really vulnerable," Dr Short said."And that's a really scary proposition because ... this virus is going gangbusters [overseas]."She said the finding highlighted the ongoing need to deal with global outbreaks as well as the importance of surveillance and biosecurity. "Ultimately, you can't control where birds migrate, can you?"Black and whiteThere are a number of different subtypes of avian influenzas.Most of these are low pathogenic viruses that circulate all the time in wild birds and cause little to no disease.Only certain strains of two subtypes — H5 and H7 — cause severe disease and death. Both originally appeared in poultry and spread to wild birds and back again.Black swans are more vulnerable to bird flu than other species. (Getty images: ae photos)Unlike other species of swans and wild birds such as Mallard ducks, black swans are known to be particularly susceptible to these highly pathogenic avian influenzas (HPAI), better known as "bird flu".While their paler cousins and water fowl may suffer only mild symptoms such as listlessness, black swans die so quickly there are often no signs, said Anjana Karawita of the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness."They usually die within two to three days," Dr Karawita said.In 2020, five black swans at Jerusalem Biblical Zoo died after being infected with H5N8 strain, but mute swans (Cygnus olor) and water fowl were not affected at all.Until the genomes were sequenced, no-one knew why black swans were so susceptible to avian flu.Michelle Wille of the University of Melbourne said the study was one of the first to look at the immune system of wild birds."As the virus sweeps through sub populations [of birds], we discover species that are highly susceptible," said Dr Wille, who was not involved in the study."This is one of the very few studies that is actually being proactive instead of reactive."The white plumage of the mute swan, which is native to Eurosiberia, is due to a mutation of the SLC45A2 gene. (Wikimedia: Yerko)Along with sequencing the two swan genomes — which also revealed the gene responsible for the different coloured plumage — the team led by Dr Karawita looked at how genes in cells responded to the virus.This analysis, known as a transcriptome, revealed that cells taken from black swans mounted an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction when they were infected, in much the same way as someone with severe COVID-19.Dr Short said the finding that black swans were missing key genes suggested they were probably not just susceptible to avian flu, but a whole lot of different viruses."I suspect that the isolation of Australia has probably played a role in keeping out these viruses and therefore keeping the black swan safe."'It's on our doorstep'Over the years there have been small homegrown instances of HPAI viruses in Australia.The most recent was an outbreak of H7N7 in farms Victoria in 2020, which evolved in poultry from a low pathogenic virus found in wild birds in Australia.Thousands of chickens and turkeys had be culled before the outbreak was contained.The bird flu virus of greatest concern is H5N1, which has not arrived in Australia yet.Since H5N1 first appeared in the late 1990s, it has evolved "like crazy", Dr Short said.Digitally colorised microscope image of avian influenza A H5N1 virus particles (seen in gold). (Supplied: CDC/Cynthia Goldsmith)Over the past two years, a devastating lineage of the virus known as 2.3.4.4b has spread around the globe."For the first time ever it's entered South America and it's just decimating the bird populations there," Dr Short said.It's also widespread in Europe, the UK, North America and Asia."It's on our doorstep."What are the symptoms of bird flu in poultry?Sudden deathDifficulty breathing, such as coughing, sneezing, or raspingSwelling and purple discolouration of the head, comb, wattles and neckRapid drop in eating, drinking and egg productionRuffled feathers, dopiness, closed eyesDiarrhoeaThe overseas outbreak has been devastating, said Dr Wille, who is involved with the surveillance of avian influenza in Australian wild bird populations."We have no understanding of how many how many wild birds have died [overseas] from this outbreak because most agencies are not counting."There are just so many dead birds and there is no indication that it is going to decrease any time soon."Dr Wille said screening of birds in Australia had not detected any sign of the virus here yet."I think the risk will be low probably until September when the migratory birds come back."Waterfowl, which are thought to have had a role in the spread of the H5N1 virus in Europe, Asia and Africa, don't migrate to Australia.While smaller wading birds are not considered common hosts of HPAI viruses, Dr Wille said the risk was unclear."We need to remain vigilant because even if only one shorebird migrates with HPAI onboard and arrives in Australia, this could trigger outbreaks."Several thousand poultry were culled during a local outbreak of the H7N7 bird flu virus in Victoria in 2020. (ABC News: Simon Winter)She said current surveillance programs focused on species such as ducks, which are less affected but more likely to spread the disease."This virus arriving in Australia would be catastrophic, so we should do all we can to monitor the situation for early detection and rapid response."Avian flu is not just an issue for poultry and wild bird flocks, but it could potentially be a threat to human health as well, Dr Short said."If COVID has taught us anything it's that we need to be aware of these emerging form of threats and especially viruses that can spill over into humans as well."So we really need constant vigilance against avian flu."Posted Mon 23 Jan 2023 at 1:51amMonday 23 Jan 2023 at 1:51amMon 23 Jan 2023 at 1:51amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesBarron Trump and AOC give us clues about the problems with the Democratic campaignTopic:US ElectionsPhoto shows Barron stands with his mother and father Four foreign nationals found on Croker Island say they paid money to be taken to AustraliaTopic:Indigenous (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander)Photo shows Croker IslandTeacher's aide may have saved lives of children in horror pre-school crash, police sayTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Floral tributes left outside a schoolRex given $80m lifeline, as ACCC warns Qantas controls 65pc of market and prices are upLIVEPhoto shows A Regional Express (REX) aircraft unloads at Charleville Airport in south-west Queensland.'I feel really ripped off': Artist slams Optus after alleged unconscionable sales conductTopic:Telecommunications Services IndustryPhoto shows An Aboriginal woman holding up a piece of fabric with artwork on itRelated storiesWhat's with all the bird flu outbreaks lately, and should we be worried?Topic:InfluenzaPhoto shows A close-up of a brown chicken with a red combBird flu outbreak in UK prompts all poultry to be kept indoors.

A key Food and Drug Administration panel on Thursday voted 21-0 to direct manufacturers of approved COVID vaccines to “harmonize” initial shots and the most current booster. The move paves the way for development of a single annual shot for most Americans, likely creating vaccination campaigns that mirror the nation’s approach to flu shots. For most low-risk, non-immunocompromised individuals, a single shot would be recommended each fall, and that shot would be designed to provide immunity against COVID strains predicted to be in wide circulation over the winter season. An FDA proposal unveiled earlier this week called for two annual shots for older adults and others at high risk of severe COVID-19. Though the changes are far from a done deal, some are already questioning what the major shift in public health policy could mean for healthcare workers. They are now required to receive only an initial COVID vaccination series. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has not updated its year-old rule to compel booster shots, even as the share of nursing home workers considered “up-to-date” lingers in the 20% range. “This raises questions for us, like, what does this mean for the CMS vaccine requirements?” Jodi Eyigor, director of nursing home quality and policy for LeadingAge said Wednesday. “Would it be easier in this case to mandate an annual staff vaccination? I don’t know. It would still have to go through a rule-making process to change the regulation that’s currently in place. But would CMS be doing that? And if they’re going to do that, is there a chance that they might throw the flu vaccine in there?” CMS last year added staff flu vaccination reporting to its nursing home Quality Reporting Program, using the same Centers for Disease Control and Prevention portal used to report staff members’ COVID shots. Nursing home workers have historically had the lowest flu vaccination coverage of any healthcare employee group. Still, flu shots are not federally mandated for healthcare workers, so some saw the addition of the monitoring system as a possible prelude to future agency action on the issue. “Your flu shot’s being reported on an annual basis for your QRP,” Eyigor noted Wednesday. “Does this help pave the way to move that COVID-19 vaccine reporting to become annual reporting as well?” Eyigor’s comments came during a routine coronavirus call with LeadingAge members Wednesday afternoon. At that time she also outlined concerns and opportunities about the new one-size-fits-most approach she anticipated federal officials taking. Annual vaccination questions remain As reported by Stat News Thursday afternoon, a key question for some FDA panel members was how well officials would be able to time vaccine distribution to convey powerful protection, given that coronavirus outbreaks haven’t been contained to a single season like the flu or even most common colds. In comments before the meeting, Eyigor predicted officials would create a plan B in case of new strains that evade the seasonal COVID vaccine, still allowing for unpredictability and emergency boosters. One thing she warned providers about: News of the panel’s decision today might complicate their current efforts to increase booster uptake both among staff and residents. “Even though all of these changes will benefit us in the long run, and hopefully make this a less complex process and hopefully remove some of the barriers to vaccination that we might be seeing, there is inevitably going to be some discussion about, ‘Well, if it’s going to be an annual vaccine, I might as well just wait until next fall to get vaccinated,’” she acknowledged. “That is what we need to be working very hard to address in the next couple months: the fact that these are not going to be immediate changes, that everybody needs to get boosted with the currently available bivalent boosters now, and then we will see what hopefully is available to us in September.” The final recommendations on transitioning the national vaccine strategy will come from the CDC. But before or after, there’s still plenty of time to rethink the approach should COVID change course unexpectedly. “We have to keep reminding ourselves that this is not influenza and we need to keep paying attention to that to make sure we don’t just follow that dogma because we’re used to doing it,” said Bruce Gellin, a temporary voting member of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Gellen is chief of global public health strategy for the Rockefeller Foundation’s pandemic prevention institute. “We’ll try this this time,” he added. “I don’t think we’re setting it in stone and we’ll see how it goes. We may need to adjust along the way.” COVID-19 vaccination Flu Shot vaccine mandate Top Stories View All News CMS gives nursing homes months more to complete onerous revalidation process News Advocate, collaborate for successful SNF discharges: expert News Gen Z influence on LTC workplace requires careful leadership dance Editors' Picks View All Don’t let this happen to you By John O'Connor Trust but verify, on election day … and every day By Kimberly Marselas Controlling your destiny By John O'Connor Featured Content View All Partner content The ultimate guide to increasing capital for long-term care facilities Market Leaders Podcasts Leveraging ACOs to deliver high quality primary care in senior living News Subscribe About Us Contact Us Advertise Copyright © 2024 Haymarket Media, Inc.

CBC NEWS | The COVID emergency might end after 3 long years — but the virus is still a threat But in January 2004, CBC Radio's The Current was talking to one such expert about a different type of virus — an avian influenza known as H5N1 — that had the potential to cause widespread problems if it were to begin readily spreading through human populations. (The National would provide further coverage on this same issue a few weeks later, a brief portion of which is shown in the clip at the top of this page.)"How worried should we be about the current outbreak of avian flu?" host Anna Maria Tremonti asked her guest, epidemiologist Dr. Danuta Skowronski, during the broadcast on Jan. 27, 2004.Skowronski then spent the next 10 minutes talking to Tremonti about the intricacies of the H5N1 bird flu and its specific risks from a human-health perspective. And she made it clear this was "a potential concern" and not a definitive outcome.The possibility of a pandemic, however probable, was obviously very concerning — especially given Canadians' familiarity with the deadly consequences of the then-recent SARS outbreak a year earlier.'Either overdue or it's imminent'Archives10:29Avian flu anxietyThe possibility of a bird flu pandemic has scientists hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst.From a current lens, perhaps the most interesting part of the 2004 conversation on The Current surrounded the discussion of what the world would look like if confronted by an influenza pandemic — including coping with a lack of antiviral drugs or vaccines and how hospitals would handle an influx of sick patients.There was also talk about the likelihood that the world would at some point face another major influenza pandemic, seemingly sooner rather than later."We can track, historically, pandemics — for instance there were three in the last century alone, but generally occur every 10 to 40 years," the epidemiologist said, when speaking about past influenza-related pandemics."The last was in 1968 — so, if you do the math, you can see that we're either overdue or it's imminent."Five years later, in 2009, the World Health Organization would declare a pandemic amid the spread of the H1N1 swine flu — and that was a decade before the COVID-19 crisis struck.Related StoriesAnalysis The COVID emergency might end after 3 long years — but the virus is still a threat The flu virus that was making the rounds in 1969-70 How a N.B. university tried to keep a 'nasty illness' from spreading in 2006 As seen on CBC-TV: Snapshots of cross-border life before COVID-19Add some “good” to your morning and evening.Sign up for this biweekly blast from the past, straight from the CBC Archives.Email address:SubscribeCurrent TimeIgnore this field.

M. Natarajan, Head, Department of General Medicine at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) said that around 75 patients are treated for flu like illnesses at the outpatient department while three to five patients are admitted for fever on a daily basis. The flu, caused by the influenza virus, spreads due to the wet weather, from person to person in closed and crowded areas, especially in air-conditioned spaces, said N. Dhinakaran, Head of the ENT department at the GRH. “The occurrence of such illnesses would rise until the end of February and will recede once summer kicks in. Such trends peak every year, hence we term it as seasonal influenza which tends to be more severe in infecting people than the perennial influenza,” he added.The symptoms include sore throat, fever, runny or stuffy nose, body ache, headache, diarrhoea, cough and in severe cases, even allergic bronchitis, asthma and wheezing. Meanwhile, S. Balashankar, Head, Department of Paediatrics, at the GRH said there are 100 patients being treated for respiratory infection. “There has been a 25% jump in the last two months. At least three to four serious cases of pneumonia are being treated everyday,” he noted. The doctors said that if the fever does not come down within three days, cough becomes severe and prolongs for more than 10 days, one must approach doctors for treatment. As for children, if they find it difficult to breathe, if found with chest in-drawing, have problems in intaking food or water, fatigued and found dull and inactive, they must be taken to doctors. Dr. Balashankar said parents must avoid giving cough syrups to children less than a year and to stick to giving the right dosage only after consultation with a doctor.S. Elamparithi, Associate Professor, Department of Respiratory Medicine at GRH noted that 5% to 10% of people fall under the risk category which includes children below the age of five and people above the age of 60, those with pre-existing lung diseases and those with other complications related to heart, kidney etc. Precautions Common precautions to take include, refraining from attending large events, keeping children away from school, changing fresh pillow covers and bedspreads. Otherwise, the precautions followed while COVID-19 virus was spreading applies here as well , doctors said.Dr. Elamparithi noted that people who fall into the risk category must make it a point to take the flu vaccine ideally before the winter months kick in – by October – to wade through the cold months without much worry. “Awareness on the flu shot is more in the western countries as of now. The immunity gained through the flu shot will last for a year,” he added.

This 3-with-1 respiratory virus combination testing is available with a health care provider’s order. COVID-19, RSV, and the flu present similar symptoms (fevers, cough, headaches, sore throat, muscle soreness, fatigue) and the potential for severe outcomes that may lead to hospital visits and even death. However, each virus may require different treatments. With this respiratory virus combination testing, the collection can be performed once to provide results for three different viruses. Potentially helping a patient get answers more quickly increases the possibility of using time-sensitive treatments and slows the spread to help prevent others from being sick. “Because the symptoms from these viruses are so similar, the most accurate way to determine whether you have COVID-19, RSV, or the flu, is to get tested,” said Scientific Medical Director Dr. Stacy White at Sonora Quest. “Our new respiratory combination testing helps Arizonans get those answers faster from a single swab—and with the high infection rates and hospitalizations caused by these viruses, it’s needed now more than ever.” The 2022-2023 Flu/RSV season began on October 2, 2022. Since then, the Arizona Department of Health Services has reported more than 31,000 lab-confirmed cases of influenza and more than 13,900 cases of RSV, with 35% of all cases reported in children aged one to four years old. Weekly rates for influenza cases have been as high as almost 15 times the five-season average, with weekly rates for RSV reaching almost 28 times the five-season average. Meanwhile, the new coronavirus subvariant XBB.1.5 now makes up around 43% of US COVID-19 cases, according to projections from the US Centers for Disease Control. XBB is easier to spread broadly, including among those who have been previously infected or vaccinated. Some patients have even been shown to test positive for more than one of these three viruses (COVID-19, RSV, and Influenza). “COVID-19, RSV and the flu are widespread in Arizona, and one of the best ways to slow the spread is to get tested. Knowing your status helps determine the best options for treatment and prevents you from spreading it to your loved ones,” said Dr. White. After a health care provider determines respiratory combination testing is needed, the provider will collect a sample with a nasopharyngeal swab, the same style swab as the collection for COVID-19 PCR testing. Then, the sample will be sent to be processed for testing at Sonora Quest Laboratories’ main lab. Test results are returned within an average of 2-4 days to the ordering provider and through Sonora Quest’s online patient portal. With reports of antigen/at-home COVID testing having a sensitivity as low as 60%, and requiring three tests to detect the latest variants, the PCR testing used in this respiratory testing continues to be the gold standard.

(Mainichi/Kenji Yoneda) TOKYO -- Those who regularly interact with five people or more in their neighborhood tend to have higher influenza vaccination rates than those who have fewer local contacts, according to a study in Japan. The research team from the University of Tokyo and Tokyo Healthcare University says the results suggest that people may not get flu shots just to prevent themselves from getting very sick, but may also be motivated by consideration for those around them. The team used survey data on the health awareness of some 100,000 people aged 20-79 in the Tohoku region of northeast Japan, which was conducted in 2011 after the 2009 novel influenza outbreak. From the data, the team picked a random sample of 5,002 people for analysis. The researchers found that, among the group aged 20-64, made up of 3,162 people, those who regularly interacted with at least five people in their neighborhood had influenza vaccination rates approximately 1.4 times higher than those who interacted with four or fewer neighbors. Even when considering other factors, such as the subjects' gender, occupation and access to medical institutions, the number of people they interacted with was significantly associated with higher inoculation rates. Medical ethics professor Akira Akabayashi at the University of Tokyo said the study "hints at Japanese people's altruistic character." He added, "When calling on people to get vaccinated for other infectious diseases, it may be effective to include messages like 'the vaccine will help prevent spreading the disease to others.'" The research paper has been published in the online version of international vaccinology journal Vaccine: X.
