The CDC has multiple surveillance systems in place to monitor flu activity and detect novel flu viruses, including avian influenza A(H5N1).
These surveillance systems show no indicators of unusual flu activity, including avian influenza A(H5N1), in people.
CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes information on flu activity year-round and actively monitors for the spread of avian influenza A(H5N1) to, or among, people nationwide.
The surveillance systems are being fine-tuned and expanded to detect transmission and early changes in the virus.
Some of the surveillance methods include virologic surveillance, outpatient influenza-like illness surveillance, influenza hospitalization surveillance, and mortality surveillance data.
In addition to these surveillance systems, the CDC conducts human monitoring and testing in states and plans epidemiologic studies to further understand the virus.
