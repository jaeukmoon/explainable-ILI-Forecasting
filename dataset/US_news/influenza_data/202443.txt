The first apparently originated in early March 1918, during World War I. Although it remains uncertain where the virus first emerged, it quickly spread through western Europe, and by July it had spread to Poland. The first wave of influenza was comparatively mild. However, during the summer a more lethal type of disease was recognized, and this form fully emerged in August 1918. Pneumonia often developed quickly, with death usually coming two days after the first indications of the flu. For example, at Camp Devens, Massachusetts, U.S., six days after the first case of influenza was reported, there were 6,674 cases. The third wave of the pandemic occurred in the following winter, and by the spring the virus had run its course. In the two later waves about half the deaths were among 20- to 40-year-olds, an unusual mortality age pattern for influenza. Britannica Quiz Disasters of Historic Proportion Outbreaks of the flu occurred in nearly every inhabited part of the world, first in ports, then spreading from city to city along the main transportation routes. India is believed to have suffered at least 12.5 million deaths during the pandemic, and the disease reached distant islands in the South Pacific, including New Zealand and Samoa. In the United States about 550,000 people died. Most deaths worldwide occurred during the brutal second and third waves. Other outbreaks of Spanish influenza occurred in the 1920s but with declining virulence.

Sound complicated? It is. As new strains of flu viruses emerge, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration closely coordinates with sister agencies and works with manufacturers to help the development of vaccines to protect from the flu, a disease that can cause severe illness. The FDA and other parts of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services are working to advance the development of new technologies for producing flu vaccines so we can better respond to influenza public health emergencies. All FDA-approved flu vaccines have been evaluated and determined to be safe and effective by the FDA. There is often more than one type of flu virus circulating each season. So, vaccines are made to target the most likely viruses to circulate and cause illness in the U.S. during the upcoming flu season. To find a flu vaccine near you, visit this page. FDA-approved Flu Vaccines Are Safe and Effective The flu vaccine works by triggering your immune system to produce antibodies that help prevent influenza disease. Most of the U.S. flu vaccine supply is made using an egg-based production process. In this method, manufacturers use fertilized eggs to grow the flu viruses. After about six months of laboratory work and manufacturing, those viruses are incorporated into that season’s flu vaccine. This method has been used for decades to produce safe and effective vaccines. The FDA, HHS and manufacturers continue to work on ways different technologies can help develop new flu vaccines. Having different types of flu vaccines helps ensure that safe and effective vaccines are available to respond to the ever-changing nature of flu viruses. For example, the FDA has approved adjuvanted flu vaccines and flu vaccines that do not use egg-based manufacturing, including cell-based and recombinant protein vaccines. In addition, the FDA has approved flu vaccines specifically for people ages 65 and older, who typically bear the greatest burden of severe influenza disease and account for most flu-related hospitalizations and deaths. Making the Flu Vaccine: A Year-round Effort The job of producing a new vaccine for the next flu season starts well before the current season ends. For the FDA, it’s a year-round initiative. Flu viruses are constantly evolving. The flu viruses that circulate and cause disease in people often change from one year to another, necessitating a new vaccine every year. To accomplish this, the FDA, World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other partners collaborate by collecting and reviewing data on the circulating flu strains from around the world to identify those likely to cause the most illness in the upcoming season. In late February/early March — well before the new influenza season begins, the FDA convenes its vaccines advisory committee to review data about which flu viruses have caused disease in the past year, how the viruses are changing, and disease trends so they can recommend the flu virus strains to include in the vaccines for the upcoming U.S. flu season. Once the strains are selected, vaccine manufacturers begin the manufacturing process to include the newly selected flu strains in their FDA-approved vaccines. The different virus strains are combined to formulate the vaccine into standard dosages. The vaccine is then filled into vials, syringes and, for the nasal vaccine, sprayers. Manufacturing an approved flu vaccine using either egg-based or non-egg-based manufacturing methods requires high-tech processes and FDA-inspected manufacturing facilities. Vaccine manufacturers must submit applications to the FDA to include the new flu strains in their FDA-approved vaccines and updated prescribing information. In its own laboratories, the FDA also produces materials critical for making the vaccine. These include generating candidate vaccine virus strains suitable for further vaccine manufacturing and producing the critical potency reagents, which are materials needed to test the vaccines for potency and identity (to ensure standardization) before the FDA approves the updated seasonal flu vaccines for U.S. distribution. The FDA is also responsible for ensuring that released lots of flu vaccines meet appropriate standards. Each vaccine undergoes quality control tests, including for sterility. Manufacturers submit the results of their testing, along with sample vials from each lot to the FDA for “lot release.” The FDA typically begins releasing lots of flu vaccines in late summer. Lot release can continue into early fall. Once lots are released, manufacturers distribute vaccines throughout the U.S. for use by the public. Getting a Flu Vaccine Is Your Best Prevention Flu seasons and their severity are unpredictable. The best way for most people to reduce their risk from seasonal flu and its potentially serious complications is to get a flu vaccine every year.

Vaccine Information Influenza viruses change from year to year, so influenza vaccines must be updated annually to include the viruses that will most likely circulate in the upcoming season. Once the viruses are selected for the new formulation, private manufacturers produce, test, release and distribute influenza vaccine. Flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers, so supply depends on manufacturers. Vaccine manufacturers have projected that they will supply the United States with 148 million doses of influenza vaccines for the 2024-2025 season. These projections may change as the season progresses. All flu vaccines for the 2024-2025 season will be trivalent (three component). Most will be thimerosal-free, and most will be egg-based.

Influenza remains a global health concern, causing significant morbidity and mortality annually, especially among vulnerable populations like the elderly, young children, pregnant women, and those with underlying conditions. The guidelines are designed primarily for health care providers who manage patients with influenza virus infection, and will also serve as a reference source for policymakers and others in efforts towards epidemic and pandemic preparedness.The WHO Clinical practice guideline for influenza has been updated and expanded to apply to patients with seasonal influenza viruses, pandemic influenza viruses and novel influenza A viruses known to cause severe illness in infected humans. It provides recommendations on the management of both severe and non-severe influenza and also includes recommendations on the use of antiviral medications to prevent influenza virus infection in individuals exposed to the virus . The objective of this webinar is to explain the evidence for the recommendations of the updated WHO Clinical practice guideline for influenza.

The virus’s rapid evolution allows the virus to evade the host defense, and then seasonal vaccines need to be reformulated nearly annually. However, it takes almost half a year for the influenza vaccine to become accessible. This delay is especially concerning in the event of a pandemic breakout. By producing the vaccine through reverse vaccinology and phage display vaccines, this time can be reduced. In this study, epitopes of B lymphocytes, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and helper T lymphocytes of HA, NA, NP, and M2 proteins from two strains of Influenza A were anticipated. We found two proper epitopes (ASFIYNGRL and LHLILWITDRLFFKC) in Influenza virus proteins for CTL and HTL cells, respectively. Optimal epitopes and linkers in silico were cloned into the N-terminal end of M13 protein III (pIII) to create a multi-epitope-pIII construct, i.e., phage display vaccine. Also, prediction of tertiary structure, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and immune simulation were performed and showed that the designed multi-epitope vaccine can bind to the receptors and stimulate the immune system response.

In addition to yearly epidemics, novel variations have the potential to cause global pandemics 1. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that up to 3–5 million instances of intensive disease and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths happen globally through an annual epidemic 2. Vaccination is the best (economically) efficient method of inhibiting influenza virus contamination and serious disease 2,3. The ongoing antigenic evolution of influenza viruses is a significant obstacle to influenza vaccination 4.Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) viral surface proteins undergo small amino acid changes, or “antigenic drifts,” which necessitate an annual update to the seasonal vaccination 1,3,5. The genetic mutations during viral replication cause antigenic drifts, which develop gradually over time and ultimately consequent to the unexpected advent of novel virus strains that the immune system might not be able to recognize 5. Nonetheless, the influenza A virus can occasionally undergo a sudden and significant alteration known as “antigenic shift,” in which two distinct influenza strains exchange parts of their segmented RNA genome to produce a novel viral strain against which humans may not have much or any protection 6,7. It may be extremely virulent and contagious, causing a pandemic marked by a large number of instances of severe sickness 1,5.There are four (A-D) types of influenza viruses. Seasonal illness outbreaks, also referred to as the flu season, are triggered by types A and B. The only type identified to trigger flu pandemics are influenza A viruses. HA and NA, two surface proteins, are used to categorize influenza A viruses into subtypes. Subtypes of influenza A viruses currently circulated in the human population are strains of H1N1 and H3N2 2,8. The influenza virus is a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family including enveloped, segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses 6. At least 11 viral proteins, including nucleoprotein (NP) that is linked to the gene segments, glycoproteins HA, NA, and M2, which form homotrimeric and tetrameric structures and cross the viral lipidic membrane, are encoded by the RNA of viruses 9.The WHO makes recommendations for the types of viruses that should be contained within the seasonal influenza vaccine every year 1,2,3. It then takes around half a year for the first quantities of the licensed vaccine to become accessible 10. In the event of a pandemic breakout, this delay is especially concerning since, due to their lack of prior immunity, the majority of individuals would be extremely susceptible to infection by the pandemic virus 11. This rather long period might be greatly shortened by the production of a vaccine with wide protection in advance 12, or by using reverse vaccinology, which is the process of finding epitopes in pathogen genomes that are most likely to trigger robust immune responses 13, along with phage display vaccine to produce bulky capacities of vaccine quickly.Adjuvants are frequently used by researchers to boost immunogenicity. Examples of such adjuvants include β-defensin 14,15, virus-like particles 16,17, 50 S ribosomal protein L7/L12 18,19, cholera toxin A1 subunit 20,21, mycobacterial lipoprotein LprG 22, Lactococcus lactis23, T7 bacteriophage nanoparticles 24 and filamentous phages as a phage display vaccine 25.Phage display vaccine is one kind of phage-based vaccine 26. Phage display enables the insertion of external DNA, including DNA-coding antigenic peptides, into the coat protein genes 27, resulting in the presentation of peptides with natural structure on the phage coat proteins surface 28,29.Bacteriophages, also known as phages, are a particular class of viruses that are often regarded as safe for use in humans since they only infect and multiply in bacteria and archaea and are incapable of contaminating eukaryotic cells 30,31; therefore, do not have pathogenic effects in humans 32,33. The host bacteria can continually produce and secrete filamentous phages without being killed by them. This offers a chance to create phages continuously and quickly, which may be useful for producing vaccines against emerging threats as they arise 34. The filamentous phages, which include M13, f1, and fd, are the most repeatedly used bacteriophages in phage display; their genome is made of ssDNA and encircled by surface coat proteins 27,28. The coat proteins pIII and pVIII have been widely employed in the phage capsid display of heterologous peptides 34,35. Because of their intrinsic qualities, which include their strong adjuvant capabilities, ease of storage and transportation, great constancy in challenging environments, and low cost of massive production, phages are a good fit for vaccine design 36. The immunogenicity of epitopes is heightened when they are exposed on the phages 37; this makes phages an effective immunogenic carrier for the improvement of vaccines 31,38,39.In this study, using bioinformatics approach, we aim to create a multi-epitope vaccine for influenza that is capable of bulk production in a short time in the experimental phase. To achieve this aim, the HA, NA, NP, and M2 from two strains of Influenza A were picked as the objective antigens for epitopes prediction, and then multi-epitope-pIII was created by in silico cloning of multi-epitope to the N-terminal end of M13 coat protein III.MethodsA summary of the steps involved in creating the multi-epitope-pIII vaccine is presented in Fig. 1.Figure 1Procedure for creating the multi-epitope-pIII vaccine. The plot was created by drawio server (https://www.drawio.com/).Full size imageProtein sequence retrievalSequences of the proteins HA, NA, NP, and M2 from two strains of influenza A: A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1) and A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus were obtained from NCBI and GISAID (https://gisaid.org/), respectively. Protein sequences are shown in Supplementary File 1.BCL epitopes predictionSince antibody is a significant component in specific immunity, the determination of BCL epitopes is imperative. The two types of BCL epitopes are conformational and linear. Several tools, such as ABCPred (https://webs.iiitd.edu.inaghava/abcpred/ABC_submission.html) 40, BCEPRED (https://webs.iiitd.edu.inaghava/bcepred/index.html) 41, BepiPred (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred-2.0/), and VaxiJen 2.0 (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html), were employed to identify potential linear BCL epitopes. First, the antigenicity of high-rank epitopes in ABCPred was examined in VaxiJen 2.0 tool. If confirmed, then were evaluated in BCEPRED and Bepipred. Finally, epitopes with the greatest ratings were considered for allergenicity and toxicity via AllerTOP v. 2.0 (https://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP/method.html) 42 and ToxinPred (https://webs.iiitd.edu.inaghavaoxinpred/multi_submit.php), respectively. All servers and tools were used here and in subsequent sections, applied with default parameters, and in summary, we will only provide a basic explanation of some of them. BCEPRED defines BCL epitopes based on a set of physicochemical attributes including turns, exposed surface area, polarity, accessibility, flexibility, and hydrophilicity.CTL epitopes identificationWe used different methods such as Propred1 (http://crdd.osdd.netaghava/propred1/) 43, EpiJen (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/epijen/EpiJen/EpiJen.htm) 44, VaxiJen 2.0, NetMHC − 4.0 (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/NetMHC-4.0/) 45,46, IEDB class-1 Immunogenicity (http:/ools.iedb.org/immunogenicity/) and NetCTL − 1.2 (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/NetCTL-1.2/) 47 tools. Epitopes were selected in numerous steps. Initially, we identified CTL epitopes in propred1 in 17 human and mouse alleles. It should be mentioned that although this vaccine is intended for humans, since conducting animal experiments before clinical trials is necessary, mouse MHCs were selected alongside human MHCs. Epitopes that were capable of binding to more human and mouse HLA diversity were examined in VaxiJen 2.0 and EpiJen for antigenic propensity analysis with the same human HLA (EpiJen presents only human HLA). Further, these epitopes were subjected to NetMHC − 4.0, IEDB class-1 Immunogenicity for immunogenicity analysis, and NetCTL − 1.2 tools. Allergenicity and toxicity of selected top-scoring epitopes were checked in Allertop and ToxinPred, respectively. EpiJen predicts T cell epitope considering proteasome cleavage and TAP binding. IEDB class-1 Immunogenicity determines the immunogenicity of the peptide based on its characteristics and its location in the protein.HTL epitopes identificationWe used different methods, such as IEDB MHC II (http:/ools.iedb.org/mhcii/) aligned with 7 human HLA-DRB reference alleles, NetMHCII 2.3 (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCII-2.3/) 48, and VaxiJen 2.0. Among the potential epitope candidates ranked by IEDB, those epitopes were also confirmed in NetMHCII 2.3, and VaxiJen v2.0 tools were identified for subsequent analysis. IL4pred (https://webs.iiitd.edu.inaghava/il4pred/design.php) 49 and IFNepitope (https://webs.iiitd.edu.inaghava/ifnepitope/design.php) 50 were employed for prediction of the HTL epitopes causing the generation of IL-4 and IFN-γ, respectively. Any vaccine that has epitopes with the capacity to trigger IFN-γ production may augment the immune response. IFN-γ serves as the hallmark cytokine for both arms of the immune system—innate and adaptive—and effectively inhibits viral replication 14,15. Allergenicity and toxicity of selected top-scoring epitopes checked in Allertop and ToxinPred, respectively.Developing the multi-epitopeUsing epitopes from the earlier stages a multi-epitope vaccine was created. The AYY linkers connected the CTL epitopes. The GPGPG linkers connected the HTL epitopes, and the KK linkers connected the BCL epitopes.Antigenicity and allergenicity assessmentThe antigenic behavior of the multi-epitope was anticipated via ANTIGENpro (http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/) 51 and VaxiJen v2.0. The allergenicity prediction was carried out via AlgPred (https://webs.iiitd.edu.inaghava/algpred/submission.html) 52 and AllerTOP v. 2 servers.Analysis of solubility and physicochemical propertiesThe multi-epitope’s solubility was assessed by Protein-Sol (https://protein-sol.manchester.ac.uk/), whereas physicochemical characteristics were assessed by Expasy ProtParam (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/).Assessment of the secondary structureTo estimate the proportion of secondary structural elements in the multi-epitope, the Prabi (https:/psa-prabi.ibcp.fr/cgi-binpsa_automat.pl?page=/NPSApsa_gor4.html) server was employed.Optimization of codon and in silico cloningThe multi-epitope codons were optimized by the Java Codon Adaptation Tool (JCat) (http://www.jcat.de/). The host, E.coli K12, was chosen to express the vaccine construct. Two important parameters for assessing protein expression levels are computed by this server: the GC content and the codon adaptive index (CAI). Instead of incorporating adjuvants like β-defensin 14 or 50 S ribosomal protein L7/L12 18, filamentous bacteriophage was employed to produce phage display vaccines because of its strong adjuvant properties 26,36. To this aim, the multi-epitope was inserted into the N-terminal end of M13 protein III in the FADL-1e phage vector, applying the SnapGene software to create the multi-epitope-pIII, i.e., phage display vaccine.Tertiary structure prediction, modeling refinement, and validationThe 3D model of the multi-epitope-pIII was predicted by applying the I-TASSER (https://zhanggroup.org/I-TASSER/). This server computes the C-score, which falls between [-5-2], and shows how well the predicted models. A greater score designates a model with a significant level of assurance, and on the contrary. The GalaxyRefine (https://galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi?type=REFINE) server was employed to refine the selected model and improve its structural quality. GalaxyRefine executes frequent structural perturbation and consequent global structural relaxation by molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). Validation is necessary to assess stability and identify any inherent faults in the anticipated 3D protein models. The ProSA-web (https://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php)53,54 and the SAVES (https://saves.mbi.ucla.edu/) servers were utilized for model validation. The Z-score for the overall quality of the protein structure is considered by the ProSA-web. The Ramachandran plot is created by the SAVES v6.0 PROCHECK tool.Identification of discontinuous BCL epitopesThe discontinuous BCL epitopes were anticipated after 100 ns MDS, on the refined tertiary construction of the multi-epitope-pIII by applying Ellipro (http:/ools.iedb.org/ellipro/). The concept behind this tool is that by considering the protein like an ellipsoid, it is possible to identify the swelled residues on the surface of the protein and increases their availability for antibody recognition.Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulationTo identify component interactions of vaccine with their related receptors, molecular docking was executed. Phage-displaying antigen is recognized as a foreign particle and can be internalized via APCs 55. The MHC I and MHC II molecules present processed antigen that may activate CTL and antibody responses 56,57,58. Additionally, phages may be able to interact with a variety of TLRs. For instance, research showed that the fd class of filamentous bacteriophages induced type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokines. This induction was dependent on TLR9 and mediated by MYD88 59. TLR9 identifies ssDNA comprising the CpG motif, and the active form of TLR9 is the TLR9 dimer 60,61,62,63. Based on these findings, docking between 8 CTL and 6 HTL epitopes of vaccine with MHC I and MHC II, respectively, as well as between one of the CpG sites of phage DNA, as long as 10 nucleotides, and TLR9 dimer, was executed. The selected CpG site of phage DNA was 10 nucleotides in length and recognized by CpG island Finder (http://dbcat.cgm.ntu.edu.tw/). For docking at first, molecular dynamics simulation of free receptors via GROMACS 2019 64 was done. To this aim, the MHC I, MHC II, and dimer of TLR9 structures with the PDB IDs of 5wli (resolution = 2.2 Å), 1iak (resolution = 1.9 Å), and 5zln (resolution = 2.3) (chains A and B), respectively, were extracted from RCSB server. All structures were placed in the center of a triclinic box filled with SPC216 water model and 1 nm far from the box edges. Suitable ions were changed with water molecules to neutralize the total charge of the system, resulting in a 150 mM concentration. After energy minimization via steepest descent and the conjugate gradient algorithms, the systems were equilibrated at the constant volume and temperature (NVT) and constant pressure and temperature (NPT) ensembles for 500 ps and 1000 ps at 100 K, respectively, in which the original structural conformation was kept immovable. In the production step, 20 ns MDS at 310 K with a time step of 0.001 ps was done at the NPT ensemble. Periodic boundary conditions were used for all systems. Electrostatic contacts with the particle mesh Ewald (PME) technique were calculated, and the cut-off of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions was 1 nm. The production step time in this part was 20 ns. The analyses for MHC I, MHC II, and TLR9 dimer were performed during the last 5 ns of MDS 65. In next part, 3D models of 14 T cell epitopes separately, also a portion of phage DNA, were made using PEP-FOLD 2.0 (https://mobyle.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/cgi-bin/portal.py#forms::PEP-FOLD) 66,67 and Web 3DNA 2.0 (http://web.x3dna.org/fibermodelegseq) 68 servers, respectively. Finally, 14 dockings between these ligands and the final receptor structures obtained from MDS in the previous section were executed by HADDOCK (https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4/) 69,70 server. Active residues of receptors presented to HADDOCK as residues directly involved in molecular docking include residues 57–84, 138–175 in MHC I and 47–78, 232–269 in MHC II that were the alpha-helix residues of MHCs cleft, and residues 602–612, 626–636, 651–659, 674–682, 700–709, 728–751, 791–799, 821–836, 856–860, 876–880, 899–913, 931–938, 951–960 in TLR9 dimer. The molecular docking results were visualized using Discovery Studio 4.0, and LigPlot software was used to identify residues participating in the docked molecules interactions.The best poses, i.e., the most negative HADDOCK scores, for CTL epitope-MHC I, HTL epitope-MHC II, and phage DNA-TLR9 complexes obtained from the docking section, also all B cell and T cell epitopes together linked to M13 pIII, i.e., the multi-epitope-pIII, after creating their 3D model, were subjected to 100 ns MDS for further investigation with the same mentioned condition in the Molecular docking section. The analysis for complex simulations was done during the last 20 ns MDS. Finally, mm/pbsa binding free energies of the mentioned complexes during 100 ns MDS were calculated via g_mmpbsa script 71.Evaluation of immunological characteristicsApplying the C-ImmSim immune simulator (http://150.146.2.1/C-IMMSIM/index.php) (78), the immune system’s reaction to the final vaccine construct was simulated. The program was run in one step without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and with the default settings.ResultsIn bioinformatics studies, we found some linear BCL epitopes, CTL epitopes, and HTL epitopes of two strains of the Influenza virus proteins for humans and mice receptors by a lot of famous servers and also checked toxicity, allergenicity and used them for multi-epitope vaccine design. Then, we studied the stability of the vaccine and the binding power of some epitopes of the vaccine to their receptor.Linear BCL epitopes predictionWe chose the top-scoring epitopes concurrently predicted by several servers, such as VaxiJen 2.0, BCEPRED, ABCPred, and BepiPred. They were not toxic or allergic. Six 16-mer linear BCL epitopes were predicted. Within the NP in both influenza virus strains, no epitope with such criteria was found.CTL epitopes predictionPredicted epitopes by Propred1 that could bind to a wider variety of human and mouse HLA and were also concurrently validated in EpiJen and VaxiJen 2.0 were chosen. Though these epitopes were also examined by NETMHC, IEDB class-1 Immunogenicity, and NetCTL, in the event of their existence, and optimal epitopes that were confirmed by all the aforementioned tools were selected. The final 8 CTL epitopes with these criteria were chosen that were also not toxic or allergic. In NP in A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2), no epitope that was concurrently validated in Propred1 and VaxiJen 2.0 was found.HTL epitopes predictionFrom the list of epitopes that the IEDB tool identified with the maximum affinity to the 7 human HLA-DRB reference allele, those that were also confirmed by the NetMHCII 2.3 and VaxiJen v2.0 tools, were not toxic or allergic, and had the potential to release IFN-γ and, ideally, IL-4, were chosen for use in the vaccine construct. In NP and M2 of A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2), no epitope was identified.Assembly of the multi-epitopeThe AAY, GPGPG, and KK linkers were used for the connection of CTL, HTL, and BCL epitopes, respectively (Fig. 2).Figure 2Construction of the multi-epitope. AAY (violet) linkers are inserted between the CTL epitopes. GPGPG (orange) linkers are inserted between the HTL epitopes. KK (green) linkers are inserted between the BCL epitopes.Full size imageAssessment of allergenicity and antigenicityThe predicted multi-epitope was classified as non-allergic by AlgPred and AllerTop tools. The antigenicity values were estimated 0.6089 and 0.8027, respectively, by Vaxijen 2.0 and ANTIGENpro.Evaluation of physicochemical characteristics and solubilityThe theoretical molecular weight of the multi-epitope was determined to be 34.48 kDa using ProtParam. The pI (isoelectric point) was determined to be 9.41. The multi-epitope’s instability index [II] was 24.06 (II < 40 signifies stability). It was predicted that the construct would be thermostable (Aliphatic index: 88.16). Also, it was predicted that the construct would be hydrophilic (the expected GRAVY, or hydropathicity, was − 0.042). The estimated half-lives were 4.4 h in mammalian reticulocytes in vitro, > 20 h in yeast, and > 10 h in E. coli. Additionally, as anticipated by the Protein-Sol tool, the solubility value of construct is 0.425, with a threshold value of 0.45.Analysis of secondary structuresWe found that the multi-epitope is made up of 26.48% alpha-helix, 25.86% β-sheet (extended strand), and 47.66% random coil using Prabi (Fig. 3).Figure 3Secondary structure. The multi-epitope was made up of 26.48% alpha-helix, 25.86% β-sheet, and 47.66% coil.Full size imageCodon optimization and in silico cloningThe optimized sequence has a GC content of 50.88% and a CAI (Codon Adaptation Index) of 1. In silico, cloning of the multi-epitope construct into the N-terminal end of M13 protein III in the FADL-1 phage vector was performed, so the final vaccine construct, i.e., multi-epitope-pIII, namely the phage display vaccine, was generated (Fig. 4).Figure 4In silico cloning of the multi-epitope. The multi-epitope was inserted into the N-terminal end of M13 protein III in the FADL-1e phage vector using the SnapGene software to create the multi-epitope-pIII construct, i.e., phage display vaccine. The multi-epitope is represented in the cyan area, while M13 pIII is represented in the purple portion afterward.Full size imageEvaluation of the tertiary structureThe first model, with − 1.16 C-score value, was chosen for the next refinement phase. The topological similarity between the two protein models is evaluated using the TM-score. Our vaccine design has an RMSD value of 11 ± 4.6 Å and a TM-Score of 0.57 ± 0.15. If the TM score of a model is more than 0.5, it is considered accurate topology, and if it is less than 0.17, it is considered nonspecific similarity.Tertiary structure refinementFive refined models were produced by the server. Based on reduced RMSD, MolProbity, clash score, and poor rotamers values, as well as higher GDT-HA and Rama favored values, the refined model 1 was chosen.Validation of model stabilityThe original and refined models have Z-scores of -2.09 and − 2.74, respectively. According to the Ramachandran plot, the residues in the favored, additional allowed, generously-allowed, and disallowed regions, respectively, comprised 49.5%, 40.2%, 6.9%, and 3.4% of the residues in the primary model. Within the refined model, these values changed to 69.2%, 24.7%, 2.7%, and 3.3%, respectively (Fig. 5a-d).Figure 5An assessment of 3D model of the vaccine construct prior to and subsequent refinement. (a) The primary model’s Z-score was − 2.09, while (b) the refined model’s Z-score was − 2.74. (c) In the Ramachandran plot, the residues in the favored, additional allowed, generously allowed, and disallowed regions, respectively, were 49.5%, 40.2%, 6.9%, and 3.4% of the residues of the primary model (d), whereas in the refined model, these values changed to 69.2%, 24.7%, 2.7%, and 3.3%, respectively.Full size imagePrediction of conformational BCL epitopesIn the 3D model of the multi-epitope-pIII after 100 ns MDS (Fig. 6), Ellipro assessed 3 conformational (discontinuous) BCL epitopes (Fig. 7).Figure 63D model of the multi-epitope-pIII.

The majority of the protein is represented as gray sticks, while epitopes are displayed as yellow surfaces.Full size imageMolecular docking and molecular dynamics simulationThe average backbone RMSD, radius of gyration (Rg), temperatures, and potential energies of free MHC I, II, TLR9 dimer, and multi-epitope-pIII during the last 5 ns of 20 ns MDS are shown in Table 1. The backbone RMSD plot of these structures during MDS is presented in Fig. 8. All structures reach equilibrium after about 5 ns MDS. The trivial standard deviation of the backbone RMSD, radius of gyration, temperature, and potential energy revealed that all systems reach structural and thermal equilibration. Then these final simulated receptors, i.e., free MHCs and TLR9, were used for dockings with their ligands, i.e., epitopes and phage DNA, respectively.Table 1 The results of free MHCs, TLR9 dimer, and multi-epitope-pIII also CTL epitope 1-MHC I, HTL epitope 4-MHC II, DNA-TLR9 complexes, and free multi-epitope-pIII in the last 5 ns or 20 ns, respectively, of MDS for all structures.Full size tableFigure 8The backbone RMSD of all free receptors. The backbone RMSD of MHC I, II, and TLR9 dimer during 20 ns MDS.Full size imageThe HADDOCK scores of all 8 CTL epitopes and 6 HTL epitopes with simulated structures of MHC I and II, respectively, were negative (Table 2), which indicates that all epitopes and DNA can bind to their receptors properly, and therefore these epitopes can be used for vaccine design. The most negative scores of CTL epitope-MHC I and HTL epitope-MHC II complexes were − 31.9 ± 1.7 and − 85.9 +/- 4.7, which belong to CTL epitope 1 and HTL epitope 4, respectively.Table 2 The haddock scores of 14 epitope-MHCs and phage DNA-TLR9 dimer.Full size tableFor brevity, among 14 epitope-MHC docking complexes, only images of CTL epitope 1-MHC I and HTL epitope 4-MHC II complexes and the residues involved in their interaction have been shown in Fig. 9a-d. The HADDOCK score of a portion of phage DNA genome with the TLR9 dimer, was − 12.6 +/- 6.6. Docking complex and the residues and nucleotides involved in interaction have been shown in Fig. 9e-f.Figure 9Docking complexes and molecular interactions after 100 ns MDS. (a) Molecular docking of CTL epitope 1 (red) and MHC I (green). (b) Molecular docking of HTL epitope 4 (magenta) and MHC II (green). (c) DIMPLOT diagram shows residues involved in CTL epitope 1(A)-MHC I (B) interactions. (d) The DIMPLOT diagram shows residues involved in HTL epitope 4 (A)-MHC II (B) interactions. (e) Molecular docking of a portion of the phage DNA genome (pink) and TLR9 dimer (green). (f) The DIMPLOT diagram shows the nucleotides (A) and residues (B) involved in the DNA-TLR9 dimer interaction. The horizontal dashed line represents the interface. In all cases, docking complexes and the interaction diagrams are after 100 ns MDS and include hydrogen bonds and non-bonded contacts.Full size imageAmong 14 docking complexes, only CTL epitope 1-MHC I, HTL epitope 4-MHC II, DNA-TLR9 complexes, also free multi-epitope-pIII were subjected to 100 ns MDS. The average backbone RMSD, radius of gyration, temperatures, and potential energy of all complexes during the last 20 ns of 100 ns MDS are shown in Table 1. Also, the backbone RMSD plot of receptors in complexes and free multi-epitope-pIII during simulation was presented in Fig. 10. Again, the small standard deviation of MD parameters indicated that all systems reach structural and thermal equilibration. The number of contacts between epitopes and MHC I, II, and between phage DNA and TLR9 dimer during the last 20 ns of MDS was 96.5 ± 4.6, 148.7 ± 5, and 152.5 ± 5.5, respectively, and none of the epitopes and phage DNA were apart from their receptors during 100 ns MDS. The decrease in the backbone RMSD and radius of gyration of almost all receptors after binding ligands to them (Table 1) indicated these interactions lead to a reduction in flexibility and protein volume because of creation of bonds between them and epitopes. Then these epitopes induce structural changes in their receptor.Figure 10The backbone RMSD of all complexes (receptors-ligand) also multi-epitope-pIII. Complexes of CTL epitope 1-MHC I, HTL epitope 4-MHC II, and phage DNA-TLR9 dimer also free multi-epitope-pIII during 100 ns MDS. Com: complex.Full size imageMM/PBSA binding free energies of all epitopes to their receptors during the 100 ns MDS calculated via g_mmpbsa script were presented in Fig. 11.Figure 11MM/PBSA binding energies of complexes. MM/PBSA binding energies of CTL epitope 1, HTL epitope 4, and phage DNA with their receptors during 100 MDS.Full size imageThe averages mm/pbsa binding energies of CTL epitope 1-MHC I, HTL epitope 4-MHC II, and phage DNA-TLR9 dimer during the last 20 ns of MDS (Table 1) also confirmed docking results (Table 2) and proper binding of CTL epitope 1, HTL epitope 4, and phage DNA to their receptors. In addition, the more negative binding energy of HTL epitope 4 relative to CTL epitope 1 (Table 1) is compatible with its greater number of contacts and docking results (Table 2).Evaluation of immunological characteristicsThe simulated immune response outcomes indicated that the induction of immune responses was increasing. It was predicted that IgM and IgG1 levels would rise. Moreover, the development of plasma cells and a rise in the populations of active CTL and HTL cells were predicted (Fig. 12).Figure 12Chimeric vaccine molecular simulations. (A) Injection of antigens that produce immunoglobulins and their subclasses. (B) Development of plasma cell population following a single dose of vaccine injection. (C) CTL population. (D) HTL population (i.e., active, resting, anergic, and duplicating). Anergy state indicates cells that are tolerant of antigen, suggesting a lack of immunological reactivity, while resting phase indicates cells that have not been exposed to the antigen.Full size imageDiscussionThe human population is still at risk from influenza A virus infection 72. Because of the small changes in influenza surface proteins (antigenic drifts), the seasonal vaccine needs to be updated annually 1,3,5. Additionally, an unexpected and significant alteration (antigenic shift) in the influenza A virus can happen at random intervals, causing influenza pandemics with extremely high attack rates and serious illness 4.The best defense against influenza virus infection is immunization 12. However, it is crucial to produce large quantities of vaccines quickly (like within 1–2 months) to halt an epidemic or pandemic. This problem can be solved in two ways: either by creating a vaccine that is more widely protective to reduce the likelihood of a pandemic outbreak, as demonstrated by Paules et al. 73, Raymond et al. 74, and Joyce et al. 75, or by creating new, quick, and scalable technologies for the production of vaccines 12.In this work, we incorporated reverse vaccinology into the phage display vaccine, which causes vaccine production on a large scale to be affordable, environmentally stable, and have uniform replication 76.Reverse vaccinology has been extensively employed in the development of multi-epitope vaccines targeting a range of pathogens, comprising Campylobacter jejuni 77, Trypanosoma cruzi 14, Mycobacterium ulcerans 22, Toxoplasma gondii 78, Staphylococcus aureus 79, and SARS-CoV-2 19,80,81.The antigen displayed on the phage surface is called phage-displayed vaccine 26. This method has some advantages over conventional vaccines that let them overcome their drawbacks 76,82. Phages have been employed as adjuvants because of their capacity to stimulate the innate and adaptive immune systems 36,83. For example, van Houten et al. demonstrate that the B2.1 peptide-displaying f1 phage induces more immunological responses in mice than attaching the peptide to conventional carriers such as ovalbumin 38. Or according to research by Hashemi et al., vaccination of mice with T7-M2e and without adjuvant elicited an M2e-specific serum antibody response, the efficacy of which was equivalent to that produced by M2e peptide administered within Freund’s adjuvant 24. Phages have been studied for use in the treatment of cancer, including melanoma 58 and liver cancer 84, as well as for immunization against a variety of infectious illnesses, including Taenia solium cysticercosis 85, human respiratory syncytial virus 86, and hepatitis B virus 87.Many scientific studies have focused on the creation of flu vaccines containing multiple epitopes. While Stoloff et al. employed epitopes obtained from M1, M2, NP, and PB1 88, Deng et al. and Hashemi et al. utilized the extracellular domain of M2 (M2e) 24,25.While internal antigens, like NP, stimulate cellular immune responses, causing viral clearance and a quick recovery, surface antigens trigger humoral responses that neutralize influenza viruses. Consequently, in the current investigation, the surface antigens HA, NA, and M2, as well as the internal antigen NP, were selected for epitope identification with the aim of simultaneously provoking humoral and cellular immune responses 89.The structure of the construct determines its physicochemical characteristics. In this work, similar to the research by Maleki et al. 90, Kanse et al. 91, and Jiang et al. 92, AAY linkers were inserted between the CTL epitopes, GPGPG linkers were inserted between the HTL epitopes, and KK linkers were inserted between the BCL epitopes. In an additional study by Khamjan et al. 93, GPGPG linkers were inserted between the BCL and CTL epitopes, and AAY linkers were inserted between the HTL epitopes.The proposed vaccine design displayed both non-allergic and antigenic properties, representing its capacity to stimulate the immune system without causing an allergic reaction. The vaccine’s instability index [II] was estimated 24.06; as this number is less than 40, it is regarded as a steady vaccine 94. The half-life of our vaccine was 4.4 h, whereas Sarkar et al.‘s construct half-life was one hour 95. This difference suggests that our vaccine is represented bythe immune system for an extended duration. If the GRAVY value is negative, the protein is hydrophilic. The GRAVY value was − 0.042. However, GRAVY was found to be 0.381 in the work of Ashfaq et al. 96, and given the hydrophobic nature of the vaccine, it appears that the usage of micelles is necessary to enhance vaccine interaction inside the body’s polar environment.Because filamentous bacteriophages induce type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokines through MYD88-mediated and TLR9-dependent mechanisms 59, TLR9 was used in the molecular docking study of phage DNA in the phage display vaccine. Furthermore, since phage display antigen is processed and presented on MHC molecules, epitopes of construct were used in the molecular docking study with these molecules, while Rawal et al. reasoned that since they used adjuvants such as β-defensin or L7/L12 50s ribosomal protein in vaccine construct and these microbial components identified as PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) are recognized by TLR4, they applied this molecule in docking with the whole vaccine molecule. They also used MHC molecules in docking.ConclusionBecause the influenza virus causes substantial morbidity and mortality in seasonal epidemics and random pandemics, influenza virus research stays to be at the forefront of public health research. The main tool available to lessen the impact of influenza on people worldwide is influenza vaccination.In our work, reverse vaccinology and phage display vaccine were applied to create a multi-epitope influenza vaccine. Epitopes of the HA, NA, NP, and M2 proteins of two circulating influenza A strains were examined. To increase immunogenicity, the multi-epitope was joined into the N-terminal end of M13 protein III to create a phage display vaccine. It was found that the developed vaccine had acceptable physicochemical characteristics. Moreover, to verify the vaccine construct’s binding affinity with MHC I, II, and TLR9, molecular docking was done. MDS and immune simulation were executed to verify the stability and immune system response of vaccine construct, respectively. Despite the positive results of this investigation, animal models and wet lab validation are still needed. Data availability Data is provided within the manuscript or supplementary information files.

Symptoms, like a fever, body aches, and sore throat, typically go away on their own within one week. Flu season, or when the flu is most contagious, occurs from October to May. Nearly one in five people in the United States get the flu each year. Most people recover from the flu, and symptoms last about seven to 10 days. There's no cure for the flu, but getting an annual flu shot can lower your risk. Types It's more accurate to say you are sick with a strain of the flu virus, but people often say they're sick with "the" flu. There are hundreds of strains of the flu virus. Like all viruses, flu viruses need new hosts to survive. These viruses constantly change to evade immunity and continue to spread. There are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D. Only strains from the A and B types cause annual flu outbreaks, and the D type does not infect humans. Influenza A Two strains of influenza A, H1N1 and H3N2, affect people. Scientists always include these strains in the annual flu vaccine. Influenza A viruses are the ones that have been responsible for global flu pandemics. Influenza B This type is less likely to make you severely ill than influenza A. Scientists always include one strain of influenza B in the annual flu vaccine. Influenza C You may have only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all if you are infected with an influenza C virus. This category of viruses is less common than A and B types. Influenza D This type only affects cattle and may spill over into other animals. There have been no reported cases of influenza D infecting humans. Flu Symptoms Cold symptoms usually come on gradually, whereas the flu can develop without much warning. Flu symptoms often develop within two to three days after infection. Flu symptoms often go away within one week and include: Aches and pains (i.e., body aches, headache, and sore throat) Dizziness Dry cough Fatigue Fever (i.e., between 102 and 106 degrees) and chills Flushed face Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Runny nose Sneezing Some symptoms, such as a cough and fatigue, might persist for weeks after others subside. You may have a fever that goes away and then returns. The flu can cause trouble breathing, especially in people with asthma, breathing problems, and chronic (long-lasting) diseases. Causes The flu causes inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. Flu viruses spread through tiny respiratory droplets that escape a person's mouth or nose when they sneeze, cough, talk, or laugh. You may become infected if a droplet ends up in your nose or mouth. Most people with the flu can infect others the day before they develop symptoms. The infectious period continues up to a week after your symptoms begin. Children and people with a weak immune system can be contagious for even longer than this. Not everyone has visible flu symptoms, but they can still infect others. The flu virus can live on some surfaces for up to 48 hours. You might develop the flu if you touch an infected surface and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Most people do not catch the flu from infected surfaces. Risk Factors Anyone can develop the flu, but some people are likelier than others. Risk factors include: Asthma Being younger than 5 or older than 65 Diabetes Heart disease Pregnancy Diagnosis Most people do not need to visit a healthcare provider to diagnose the flu. You might need to consult a healthcare provider if you are at risk of complications or severe illness. A healthcare provider may only need to examine you and ask about your symptoms to diagnose you with the flu, especially if there's an outbreak where you live. They might order tests to confirm the flu, such as: Rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT): This looks for parts of the flu virus in mucus from your nose or throat. You get results within 10 to 15 minutes. A RIDT is not highly accurate.Rapid molecular assay: This takes slightly longer than an RIDT, but the results are more precise. A healthcare provider will swab your nose or throat to check for genetic material from the virus.Other tests: These include immunofluorescence assays, reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and viral cultures. A healthcare provider will swab your nose or throat. Results are usually available within several hours. A cold causes symptoms similar to those of the flu. Some symptoms are more common with a cold than the flu, and vice versa. Here's a look at what symptoms are most common with what infection: Cold Symptoms Flu Symptoms Cough Chest pain Mild or moderate chest pain Fatigue persists up to three weeks Runny and stuffy nose Fever (i.e., 102 to 106 degrees) Sneezing Headache Sore throat Severe body aches and headache How Do I Know if I Have the Flu or COVID-19? The flu also causes similar symptoms to COVID, such as a fever, cough, body aches, and headaches. COVID symptoms develop gradually, usually within five days of infection. Flu symptoms come on more quickly, within one to four days. A COVID test is the only way to definitively know whether you have the infection. Treatments for the Flu The goal of treatment is to reduce flu symptoms and avoid complications. Most people do not need treatment for the flu. Your immune system typically fights off the virus without help. You might need medication if you are high-risk or develop severe symptoms. A healthcare provider may prescribe antiviral drugs like Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Zanamivir (Relenza) to shorten the length of infection. Keep in mind that timing is important. These medications are most effective if you start taking them within 48 hours of symptom onset. Home Remedies It's essential to stay home to take care of yourself and not infect others if you have mild symptoms. Home remedies include: Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol Get a lot of rest Stay hydrated Take Advil (ibuprofen) or Tylenol (acetaminophen) to lower a fever Use over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, such as cough drops and throat sprays, to manage your symptoms Prevention An annual flu vaccine is one of the best ways to prevent the flu. Experts look at data from different countries at the start of the year. They see what three A and B influenza strains are most common and build the flu vaccine that comes out in the fall, either as a shot or a nasal spray. The flu vaccine is not perfect. You can still catch a different flu strain that is not included in the vaccine, but it's worth getting. Every shot you get bolsters your immunity to a few different strains. Other ways to prevent the flu include: Frequently wash your hands: Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are unavailable. Keep your distance: Stay socially distanced from anyone who has flu-like symptoms. Take good care of yourself: Getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, managing stress, staying hydrated, and finding time to be active can support your immune system. Try not to touch your face: You do not want germs on your fingers to get into your nose or mouth. Complications Some people with the flu, especially those in high-risk groups, can develop complications. Flu complications may include: Encephalitis: This is inflammation of the brain. A viral infection like the flu may cause encephalitis, but it's rare. Myocarditis: This rare complication causes inflammation of the heart. Your body produces immune cells that help fight off the flu. These cells release chemicals that might damage your heart muscle. Myositis: This is typically an acute but rare infection that causes inflammation of the muscle tissues. An infection is one of the most common causes of myositis. Pneumonia: The flu might result in this infection if viral particles spread to your lungs. Rhabdomyolysis (rhabdo): This happens when your muscle tissue breaks down and releases harmful proteins into your blood. Rhabdo might occur if you develop myositis as a result of the flu. Sepsis: Your body might have a severe inflammatory response to the flu that causes this medical emergency. Sepsis might result in multi-organ failure, such as respiratory and kidney failure, if it's untreated. Sinus and ear infections: Viruses, including the flu virus, are among the most common causes of these infections. The flu virus causes swelling and inflammation in the sinuses or middle ear space. When To Contact a Healthcare Provider The flu usually goes away on its own within one week. You do not need to contact a healthcare provider unless you have a high risk of complications or severe symptoms. Consult a healthcare provider if your symptoms do not respond to home remedies or worsen. When To Get Immediate Medical Attention You do not need to go to the emergency room if you have mild symptoms. Only seek emergency medical attention if you or your child have: Abdominal, chest, or muscle pain Bluish lips or face (in children) A chronic disease that worsens with flu symptoms Confusion, dizziness, or weakness Dehydration (in children) or a lack of urination A fever or cough that goes away and then comes back or worsens Lack of alertness Ribs that pull in when breathing (in children) Seizures Shortness of breath or trouble breathing Seek immediate medical attention if your child has the flu and a fever higher than 104 degrees. Any fever in children younger than 3 months may be dangerous. A Quick Review The flu is a contagious viral infection that causes inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. Some of the most common flu symptoms include fever, body aches, and sore throat. The flu can closely resemble a cold or COVID. Symptoms typically come on more quickly than other infections. Most people recover from the flu. Some may develop complications like pneumonia. See a healthcare provider if your symptoms do not get better with home remedies or worsen. You can help prevent the flu by getting an annual flu vaccine, regularly washing your hands, and staying home if you are sick. Frequently Asked Questions How long does flu last? Flu symptoms usually develop within two to three days of infection. A fever and body aches typically subside from days two to four of infection. Other symptoms, such as a dry cough, runny nose, sneezing, and sore throat, go away within four to seven days. When is flu season? People get the flu year-round, but cases typically increase during the fall and winter months. Flu season starts in October, usually peaks between December and February, and may last as long as May.The COVID pandemic changed when flu cases increased and peaked between 2020 and 2023. The CDC found that the timing and severity of the flu returned to pre-pandemic levels during the 2023–2024 flu season. How long is the isolation period for the flu? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises you stay home for four to five days after your symptoms begin, even if you do not have a fever. You can end isolation after your symptoms improve and you do not have a fever for 24 hours. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

Newsletter Sign Up Newsletter Sign UpThe Projected Impact of Immunization This Influenza Season | International Vaccine Access Center Skip to main content IVAC International Vaccine Access Center Connect With Us Search Who We AreOur WorkResourcesNews & Media Skip Section Navigation Breadcrumb Home The Projected Impact of Immunization This Influenza Season The Projected Impact of Immunization This Influenza Season Published October 24, 2024 As the United States enters influenza season, there has been a huge push to encourage members of the public to protect themselves and their loved ones by getting vaccinated. But with last year's flu vaccination coverage estimated to be just 44.6% for adults and 55.4% among children over 6 months, questions remain about how effective vaccination efforts will be at reducing flu-related deaths and hospitalizations. The Flu Scenario Modeling Hub (SMH) convenes modeling teams to generate long-term projections under various scenarios that can guide immunization decision-making and provide situational awareness across different axes of future uncertainty. In the most recent round of projections, SMH combined projections from nine teams representing institutions across the country, with several IVAC faculty members working to coordinate the project.Earlier this month, the Flu Scenario Modeling Hub released its first round of projections for the 2024-25 flu season, covering the time period from August 11, 2024, to June 7, 2025. These ensemble projections pool contributions from nine teams and consider six scenarios across two axes of uncertainty: vaccination coverage 20% higher, 20% lower, or similar to the 2022-23 reference season, and seasons dominated by one of two different subtypes (influenza A/H3N2 or A/H1N1). Projected influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths under various scenarios. Although the dominant subtype is expected to drive differences in hospitalizations and deaths in the upcoming flu season, immunization can have a substantial impact. If we could achieve national vaccination coverage of approximately 58%, a 20% relative increase from the 49% coverage during the 2022-23 season, we expect a reduction in influenza-related hospitalizations of 11% or 12%, depending on the dominant subtype; that represents an estimated 25,000 to 32,000 hospitalizations averted, which would significantly ease the burden on already overloaded health systems. Conversely, a 20% drop in vaccination (approximately 39% national coverage) is projected to generate an 11–12% increase in hospitalizations. In addition to hospitalizations averted, higher vaccination coverage is projected to result in 9–14% fewer influenza-related deaths, while lower vaccination coverage is projected to result in 9–13% more deaths, depending on the scenario; this is equal to 1,400–1,900 deaths that could be averted with higher vaccination coverage.“Despite the bad rap the influenza vaccine gets sometimes, we see with our results how impactful it is and can be,” said Dr. Shaun Truelove, an Associate Scientist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and an IVAC faculty member. “With just small increases in vaccination coverage–only 9% more of the population–we avert thousands of hospitalizations and deaths. And this does not even account for all the milder illnesses averted, including kids home from school and missed work.

This flu season, seeking out reliable sources of health information will help individuals make the best decisions to protect themselves.Back in 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) deemed vaccine hesitancy—the outright refusal or reluctance to get vaccinated regardless of the availability of vaccines—as a top-10 threat to global health.1 At the time, WHO estimated that vaccinations prevented up to 3 million deaths each year; furthermore, an additional 1.5 million deaths could be prevented if global vaccine awareness, coverage, and efforts were enhanced. The topic of vaccine hesitancy has been studied dating back to the 1960s; however, in the wake of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns and residual anxiety, these research endeavors have more than tripled. A systematic literature review published in Vaccines found that there were 1160 scientific publications concerned with the subject in the pre–COVID-19 era (1968-2021), and this number jumped to a striking 4563 publications post COVID-19 (2021 onwards).2Vaccine hesitancy presents a major public health risk | image credit: Mia B/peopleimages.com - stock.adobe.comWhile there are a variety of factors that feed into vaccine hesitancy, the fact of the matter is that uncertainties about vaccinations—their safety, efficacy, etc—remain a major public health concern that has affected immunization rates ranging from polio and Ebola to COVID-19 and the flu. As flu season sits right around the corner, post–COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy remains a pertinent issue and a challenge worth exploring to ensure patients remain informed and able to protect their health to the best of their ability.Elements of COVID-19 Vaccine HesitancyA 2023 publication in BMJ Open evaluated the perspectives of self-described vaccine-hesitant adults from Black and Latinx communities and found that these groups shared similar anxieties about receiving their COVID-19 vaccination.3 Participants were not outright opposed to the vaccine but were undecided due to safety concerns. The authors focused on these communities due to data indicating that COVID-19 vaccination rates were lower in Black and Latinx vs White communities. While this gap has been shrinking, they added that Black and Latinx patients also endure worse clinical outcomes when diagnosed with COVID-19. This reality brought into question the role of social determinants of health and structural racism; however, these issues were not cited as reasons that put them more at risk for infection or to forego their vaccination.Two online forums were conducted, 1 for each group, featuring 30 participants in each. Responses highlighted 5 major factors that contribute to individuals’ reluctance to get the COVID-19 vaccine:Safety concerns: participants believed there are a lot of unknowns about the vaccine, undisclosed ingredients, lacking information about the short- or long-term effects, and the belief that it can be directly responsible for one’s death.Skepticism about efficacy: reports on surges in cases and new variants led respondents to question how well the vaccine works to prevent infection or transmission, or if vaccination is truly enough to protect public health.Risks outweigh the benefits: this perception was accompanied by the belief that infections would be mild, there are other means for protecting oneself (masking), or vaccines are only for the most vulnerable people (the elderly, immunocompromised, etc).Mistrust: lacking confidence in medical expertise on the new vaccine, lacking trust in government spokespeople as credible and reliable messengers, and limited trust for public health authorities, like the CDC, whose advice and guidelines changed often.How outcomes vary by race/ethnicity: participants reported differing views on whether COVID-19 affects people differently due to ethnicity and, if so, whether that disparity is due to structural factors.Other analyses on this phenomenon cite similar concerns from health care workers and the public at large, with hesitancies largely stemming from lacking or misguided information, distrust in medical or governmental institutions, preferences for physiological immunity, and a desire for personal autonomy and freedom of choice.4,5Post–COVID-19 Influenza Vaccine Hesitancy“The roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines has highlighted the need to comprehensively understand adult vaccine hesitancy and its manifestation within the population,” wrote Victoria Zhang and colleagues in their 2023 article published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.6 Their cross-sectional study gathered data on US adults to explore the prevalence of COVID-19 and flu vaccine hesitancy, as well as the patterns and demographic features that play into one’s hesitation or refusal. Their findings emphasized the continued influence of medical mistrust, especially in communities of color. Notably, political affiliation was also highlighted as an influencer of vaccine hesitancy, with the odds of hesitancy being 2.3 times greater for Republicans than Democrats (95% CI, 1.3-4.1). “The hesitant attitudes could be explained by right-leaning media coverage of the virus and, thus, different partisan responses regarding vaccines,” the authors wrote, pointing out the skeptical and dismissive narratives perpetuated by some right-leaning news sources during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results underscore the importance of the information people receive alongside cultural factors when it comes to vaccine hesitancy.The CDC reports that flu vaccine coverage throughout the US has continually declined in the post–COVID-19 era, a stark contrast from prepandemic trends that showed flu coverage on the rise year after year.7 In the case of children, the CDC harkens to a 2023 study that discovered over 30% of children in the US have a parent who is hesitant about the flu vaccine; a 2024 pool revealed the proportion of parents who believed “it is extremely important for parents to have their children vaccinated” decreased by 18% since 2019. Similarly to COVID-19 vaccine reluctance, parents have reported concerns about the efficacy and safety of flu vaccines, disbelief that they or their child will get sick, and access or cost issues that prevented vaccination in some cases (these incidents were far less common).For more information about flu vaccination coverage and its variability across different demographics and states over the years, please visit the CDC website.Vaccine Hesitancy Threatens Public Health“Hesitancy around vaccination is now causing people to refuse or delay vaccination even before vaccines become available. Before the highly anticipated rollout of the COVID vaccines—described as the largest vaccination campaign in history—many didn’t plan to get a COVID vaccine,” wrote Flu.com, citing polls from the early phases of the pandemic that indicated around half of Americans already decided not to get a vaccine when it becomes available.8 The flu has not been exempt from this phenomenon—despite vaccines’ proven benefits for preventing infection or mitigating more severe symptoms—dating all the back to 2009 when swine flu swept through the US. In a prior study conducted during the 2019-2020 flu season, over 35% of 264 patients who were hospitalized after developing a severe case of acute respiratory illness reported being worried about the flu vaccine’s efficacy, and nearly an additional 15% cited concerns about its safety. As aforementioned data demonstrate, as well as a 2022 article published in The New York Times, these elements of mistrust were exacerbated in the wake of COVID-19.Amidst the varying degrees of vaccine hesitancy, receiving the flu shot ahead of each flu season remains the surest way to prevent and mitigate the severity of infection. If the literature on vaccine hesitancy conveys any lesson, it is that seeking out reliable, evidence-based sources of health information should remain a priority for patients and health workers alike.For more information on how to spot health misinformation, follow this link.References1.

A case of avian influenza was reported in Clackamas County this week, after which about 150,000 chickens were euthanized.Charlie Neibergall / APA case of avian influenza has been confirmed at a Clackamas County commercial egg farm, according to the Oregon Department of Agriculture.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorThe case was confirmed by the U.S Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratory on Monday, according to an ODA public document. Officials said Thursday that about 150,000 chickens were euthanized using carbon dioxide poisoning – an authorized method to cull poultry infected with the virus.Agriculture officials say the eggs from the affected birds did not enter the food supply. The same bird flu strain, the H5N1 virus, has affected over 100 million poultry birds across the U.S. since 2022, including nearly 800,000 commercial chickens in Oregon and several backyard flocks. Chickens were so affected in recent years that the virus was blamed in part for skyrocketing egg and meat prices.Unlike the name suggests, avian flu can jump to other animals, including wild mammals. Earlier this year, scientists discovered the virus can jump to dairy cattle – no cases have been reported in Oregon.This recent case comes after four farm workers in southeast Washington preliminarily tested positive for bird flu earlier this month. Health officials do emphasize the risk of bird flu in humans is low, although it is more likely to affect people who are in close contact with a sick bird – some scientists warn that public health officials need to ramp up testing on farm workers exposed to sick animals or risk cases going undetected.ODA officials say they’re working with Oregon Health Authority and Clackamas County Public Health to ensure the farm workers at the site in Clackamas County have proper personal protective equipment and access to public health resources.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a Sponsor📨 Stay informed after Election DayLearn what the election results will mean for the Pacific Northwest.

They pose potential threats to public health and agriculture. Methods: This study collected cases of H5N1, H5N6, H9N2, and H7N9 in China, along with data on ecoclimatic, environmental, social and demographic factors at the provincial level. Boosted regression tree (BRT) models, a popular approach to ecological studies, has been commonly used for risk mapping of infectious diseases, therefore, it was used to investigate the association between these variables and the occurrence of human cases for each subtype, as well as to map the probabilities of human infections. Results: A total of 1,123 H5N1, H5N6, H9N2, and H7N9 human cases have been collected in China from 2011 to 2024. Factors including density of pig and density of human population emerged as common significant predictors for H5N1 (relative contributions: 5.3, 5.8%), H5N6 (10.8, 6.4%), H9N2 (11.2, 7.3%), and H7N9 (9.4, 8.0%) infection. Overall, each virus has its own ecological and social drivers. The predicted distribution probabilities for H5N1, H5N6, H9N2, and H7N9 presence are highest in Guangxi, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Jiangsu, respectively, with values of 0.86, 0.96, 0.93 and 0.99. Conclusion: This study highlighted the important role of social and demographic factors in the infection of different avian influenza, and suggested that monitoring and control of predicted high-risk areas should be prioritized. Introduction Human infections with avian influenza viruses pose a persistent threat to public health. The first human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, with 18 individuals infected, six of whom died (1). In 2013, China firstly detected cases of human infection with H7N9 viruses in Shanghai and experienced several waves of H7N9 epidemics (2). It was confirmed that the low pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 virus has evolved into HPAI viruses in February 2017, which may lead to wider spread and higher of risk for human or poultry (3). H9N2 virus has spread more extensively, since it first isolated from turkeys in Wisconsin, USA in 1966 (4), causing constant infections in various countries. In 2021, H9N2 viruses were observed in Sub-Saharan Africa, historically considered a cold spot for animal influenza A virus (5). H9N2 virus could cause outbreaks in poultry, wild waterfowl and infect human directly despite of its low pathogenicity (6). It achieves cross host transmission through contributing partial or even whole set of internal protein functional segments to other subtypes of avian influenza viruses such as H5N1, H7N9, H10N8 and H5N6. In May 2014, the world’s first human infection with H5N6 virus was identified in Sichuan, China (7). H5N6 virus is also a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and a reassortment virus, with both H5N1 and H9N2 viruses involved in the reassortment (8). Countries around the world have reported cases of human infection with avian influenza virus through their national surveillance systems (9). Currently, few researches have explored what factors and how have contributed to the spatial distribution of human infections with avian influenza virus, especially H9N2 and H5N6. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics and distribution of global human avian influenza cases, and explore the role of ecoclimatic, environmental, social and demographic factors which favor the occurrence of human infections in China, and thus to optimize resources allocated to controlling the disease and reducing the risk for human infection with avian influenza infection. Materials and methods Data on human cases with avian influenza virus infections The data on human cases infected H5N1, H5N6, H9N2 and H7N9 from 2011 to 2024 were collected from the World Health Organization, including the WHO’s Disease Outbreak News of the Global Alert and Response (GAR), the WHO’s Weekly Epidemiological Record and the WHO Western Pacific Region’s Avian Influenza Weekly Update and ProMed-mail.1 Age, gender, outcome, symptom, the date of onset, the date of hospitalization, the date of death, location (country and province) of each confirmed patient, and poultry exposure was extracted and used in this study. The definitions of human infections with avian influenza viruses (H5N1, H5N6, H9N2 and H7N9) have been described according to WHO and previous studies (10–12). Data on ecoclimatic, environmental, social and demographic factors A wide range of environmental and social factors that are commonly used in ecological studies on the spatial distribution of human infection with avian influenza virus were collected. The selection of factors was primarily based on empirical ecological evidence in published literature. The province-level ecoclimatic, environmental and social data were collected: 19 cross-sectional ecoclimatic variables (BIO01–19) (13), the density of human population, the number of live poultry markets, the density of pig, land cover variables including the percentage coverage of irrigation and wetland. In China, the provincial level is the key administrative unit to formulate public health policies and allocate health resources. In addition, data from provincial units are more complete and systematic, providing a relatively complete surveillance. Details on these variables and their estimates in the modeling analysis were described in Supplementary Table 1. Ecological modeling For each of 4 major human infection with avian influenza subtypes in China reported by WHO, predictive machine learning models were developed at the provincial level using case–control study design. In brief, for each subtype, provinces with at least one reported case were recognized as “cases,” while those did not report any cases were considered as “controls.” BRT models is an efficient and popular approach for ecological studies to map infectious diseases such as tick-borne pathogens disease (14), anthrax (15), and helminth (16), identify risk determiners, and predict distributions of organisms, which has an obvious advantage is that allowing nonlinear covariate-outcome relationships and multicollinearity among covariates (14). In this study, all provinces reporting cases were considered as “cases,” and five-fold “controls” were randomly chosen from the remaining provinces without reported cases for each model, and the case–control ratio is according to previous research (case–control ratio was 1: 5) to compose a balanced bootstrap set. For the establishment of BRT model, a bootstrapping procedure was used to provide a robust estimation of model parameters. In BRT model, tree complexity determines the maximum split depth of each regression tree and thus controls the ability of the model to capture non-linear relationships. We chose a moderate tree complexity to ensure that the model could capture the interaction between features without resulting in over-fitting. The learning rate controls the weight of each tree’s contribution to the overall model prediction. A lower learning rate usually improves the predictive performance of the model, but more iterations are required to achieve optimal performance. We used a smaller learning rate (0.005) to ensure that each update had less impact on the final model, to avoid overfitting, and to improve the robustness of the model. Bagging fraction controls the proportion of training samples used to build the tree in each iteration. We selected an out-of-pocket sampling ratio of less than 1 (0.7) to introduce randomness, reduce the variance of the model, and improve the generalizability of the model. Therefore, a tree complexity of 4, a learning rate of 0.005 and a bagging fraction of 75% were used for the primary analysis to identify the optimal tree as previous studies (11, 17). A training set with 70% of the points were randomly selected from the current bootstrap data and the remaining 30% served as a test set. The ROC curves and areas under the curve (AUC) based on the test sets and train sets were averaged separately to represent the final predictive performance. ROC curve is a common tool to evaluate the performance of classification model. It evaluates the discriminant ability of the model by showing the relationship between true positive rate and false positive rate under different decision thresholds. And AUC indicates the ability of the model to correctly distinguish between positive and negative samples, ranging from 0 to 1. Finally, the mean value and standard deviation of estimated weights over 50 resampled datasets were reported. The relative contributions of included variables were estimated from the identified trees and served as an indicator of each variable’s importance for predicting human infection with H5N1, H5N6, H9N2 or H7N9 presence or absence. Variables that had a high contribution to the occurrence of the human infection avian influenza virus disease (weight > 2%) were included in the final model. BRT models also reported the predicted probabilities of occurrence of human infection. R packages dismo and gbm was to conduct models, and predictive power was evaluated using pROC (R v4.3.3 environment). Results Spatial and temporal distribution of avian influenza A total of 1,123 H5N1, H5N6, H7N9, and H9N2 human cases are collected from January 2011 to March 2024 in China. The total number of H7N9 cases was greater than other subtypes (Table 1). The male-to-female ratio varied across subtypes, with a higher proportion of males for H5N1 and H7N9. The human infection with different subtypes also shows a very different age-specific epidemiology. The median age of H5N1 cases was 38.5 years, with an inter quartile range (IQR) from 20 to 49.3 years. The median age of H5N6 and H7N9 cases is similar (52 years and 58 years). And H9N2 cases is the youngest (median and IQR: 5 and 2–9 years). The proportion of recovery is greater than deaths for all subtypes, and most of the cases had history of poultry exposure. Compared to other subtypes, H7N9 cases are more likely to be severe. Median time from illness onset to hospital admission of H5N1 cases was longer than other subtypes. For H7N9 cases, the median time from hospital admission to death was longer than for other subtypes. Median time from illness onset to death of H5N6 cases was longer than other subtypes. Table 1 Table 1. The characteristics of human case with H5N1, H5N6, H7N9, and H9N2 virus infection, January 2011 to March 2024. The human infections with avian influenza virus (H5N1, H5N6, H7N9, and H9N2) from 2011 to 2024 displayed distinct spatial distribution in China (Figure 1). It exhibited the spatial distribution of human H5N1 cases in 11 provinces, H5N6 cases in 15 provinces and one municipality in China, H9N2 cases in 15 provinces and one municipality, and the distribution of human H7N9 cases in 26 provinces and four municipality. Intuitively, H5N1 and H5N6 cases are mainly concentrated in Eastern and Southwest China, while H9N2 and H7N9 infection is more widely distributed even penetrates into the northwest China. The annual number of human cases also shows significant variations (Figure 2A). The largest number of H5N1 and H9N2 cases were reported in 2022, with 12 and 36 patients, respectively, and the largest number of H5N6 cases was reported in the 2021, with a total of 59 patients, while the majority of H7N9 cases were reported in 2017, with a total of 598 patients. Human H7N9 and H5N1 infections exhibited seasonality, with more cases occurring in the cool/cold season, while there are sporadic H5N6 and H9N2 cases were reported throughout the year (Figure 2B). Figure 1 Figure 1. Spatial distribution of human infections with H5N1 (A), H5N6 (B), H9N2 (C), and H7N9 (D) in China from January 2011 to March 2024. Figure 2 Figure 2.

Distribution by years of avian influenza cases (A); distribution by season of avian influenza cases (B). Risk factors for avian influenza Further, the results revealed that, for all 4 viruses infection, a higher risk of human infection was associated with density of pig and density of human population (relative contributions >5%) (Table 2). In addition, the relative contribution of the number of live poultry markets, precipitation of warmest quarter, precipitation of wettest quarter, percentage coverage of wetland, mean temperature of coldest quarter, and precipitation of wettest month for H5N1 are 15.4% (−2.04–32.84%), 15.0% (1.28–28.72%), 14.7% (−2.55–31.9%), 13.8% (−3.45–31.05%), 8.4% (−4.928–21.728%), and 7.1% (−3.68–17.88%). The occurrence of human infection with H5N6 were found to be significantly associated with the number of live poultry markets, the percentage coverage of irrigation, density of pig, precipitation of wettest quarter, precipitation of coldest quarter, with relative contributions of 42.9% (33.10–52.70%), 14.4% (9.90–18.91%), 10.8% (7.08–14.52%),8.9% (0.08–17.72%), and 5.3% (2.16%-8.44). The number of live poultry markets (relative contribution 22.3%) was found to be the most important variable in predicting the risk of human infection with H9N2 in the model, followed by percentage coverage of wetland (17.5%), the percentage coverage of irrigation (15.6%), mean temperature of warmest quarter (11.5%), precipitation of wettest quarter (9.5%), and mean temperature of wettest quarter (5.3%). In particular, the percentage coverage of irrigation played important roles in the occurrence of human infection with H7N9 (BRT mean weights are 68.5%), followed by density of pig (9.4%) and density of human population (8.0%). Table 2 Table 2. Results of the boosted regression trees applied to the occurrence of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1, H5N6, H9N2 and H7N9) virus data. Although the four viruses share several variables as common risk factors, the effect patterns differ among them. The fitted functions plotted based on the BRT model showed that the occurrence of human H5N1 infection increased with the number of live poultry markets, precipitation of warmest quarter, precipitation of wettest quarter, mean temperature of coldest quarter, and precipitation of wettest month, whereas the percentage coverage of wetland manifested an opposite trend (relative contributions >5%) (Figure 3A). Specifically, the risk associated with live poultry markets clearly escalates once the number of such markets reaches 30, and it increases even further when this number reaches 80, highlighting the importance of regulating and monitoring such markets to control virus spread. Similar risk patterns are observed in relation to the density of the human population, precipitation levels in the warmest and wettest quarters, mean temperature during the coldest quarter, and precipitation in the wettest month. In these cases, the risk intensifies swiftly after surpassing a specific threshold before stabilizing. These results emphasizes the need for targeted surveillance and intervention efforts during high-risk periods, such as the wettest and warmest months. Furthermore, the inverse relationship with the percentage coverage of wetland might point to natural ecosystem services provided by wetlands that reduce the likelihood of human exposure to the virus, perhaps by maintaining ecological balance and reducing interactions between wild birds and humans. Therefore, preserving wetlands could serve as an indirect but valuable public health strategy. Figure 3 Figure 3. Relationship between risk factors and human infection with avian influenza H5N1 (A), H5N6 (B), H9N2 (C), H7N9 (D) risk. LMP, the number of live poultry markets; irrigate, the percentage coverage of irrigation; population, density of human population; pig, density of pig; wetland, the percentage coverage of wetland.

The fitted functions for human infection with H5N6, as depicted based on the BRT model, indicated that the occurrence of human infection increased with the number of live poultry markets, precipitation of the wettest quarter, and precipitation of the coldest quarter (Figure 3B). The risk of the number of live poultry markets exhibited a stepwise increase, stabilizing after reaching 110, underscoring the critical need for stricter biosecurity measures and regulation in areas with a high concentration of such markets. Policies aimed at reducing market density might be recommended to mitigate infection risk. When the precipitation of the wettest quarter is below 400 mm, the risk is minimal. It then gradually increases as the precipitation levels rise, reaching a stabilization point after surpassing 600 mm. Similarly, lower risk is observed when the precipitation of coldest quarter is lower than 130 mm, with risk escalating as precipitation levels rise, peaking at 135 mm before stabilizing. These implied that surveillance efforts should be intensified during periods of heavy rainfall. However, the effect of the percentage coverage of irrigation, density of pig, and density of human population on the risk of H5N6 infection appears to be non-monotone (Figure 3B), indicating a more complex relationship between these variables and the risk of infection, which may be associated with local ecological and socio-economic contexts. For human infection with H9N2 viruses, the number of live poultry markets, mean temperature of warmest quarter, precipitation of wettest quarter, density of human population, and mean temperature of wettest quarter share a similar risk pattern with increasing trend, while the percentage coverage of wetland showed a totally opposite trend (Figure 3C). Specifically, when the number of live poultry markets exceeds 40, the risk increases significantly. The mean temperature of warmest quarter exceeds 27°C, the risk increases evidently; similarly, mean temperature of wettest quarter exceeds 27°C, the risk also increases evidently. And precipitation of wettest quarter reaches 400 mm, the risk elevated. In addition, density of human population, reaches 500 person per km2, the risk was higher than those lower 500 person per km2. The risk is high when the percentage coverage of wetland is lower than 10% and dropped thereafter. The percentage coverage of irrigation and density of pig also shows non-monotone risk curve, with the peak risk reached at 85 and 14%, respectively. In contrast, there are fewer risk factors for H7N9. Generally, a higher the percentage coverage of irrigation, density of pig, and density of human population were associated with a higher risk of H7N9 infection, also in a non-monotone manner, with the peak risk reached at 70, 15%, and 1,250 person per km2, respectively (Figure 3D). The risk is high when the number of live poultry markets is more than 20, although the relative contributionsis only 4.6%, lower than 5%, which also indicated its role in H7N9 infection. Overall, each virus has its own ecological and social drivers for human infection. The number of live poultry markets and precipitation of warmest quarter contributed the most to H5N1 infection. For H5N6 infection, the key factors were precipitation of wettest quarter and the number of live poultry markets. H9N2 infection was most influenced by the number of live poultry markets and the percentage coverage of wetlands, while the percentage coverage of irrigation and pig density were the most significant contributors to H7N9 infection. To acquire the model-fitted probability of occurrence of human infection with H5N1, H5N6, H9N2, and H7N9, a bootstrapping procedure for the BRT model was performed to create robust estimates. The spatial distribution of the model-predicted risk areas of occurrence of human infections was demonstrated in Figure 4. The distributions of model-predicted risk resembled the regions where are currently collected. The predicted distribution probabilities for H5N1 presence in southwestern China including Guangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan is very high, with values of 0.86, 0.82, 0.80 and 0.60, respectively. The predicted map of H5N6 showed that the highest risk areas were southeastern China, extending from the Pearl River delta near Guangzhou to the Yangtze River delta near Shanghai and covering most areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Guizhou, Yunnan, Henan Provinces, even Beijing. Notably, hot spots for human infections with H5N6 were found in Sichuan, Hunan, Guangdong Province and Guangxi Autonomous Region. The distributions of high-risk areas of H9N2 were similar with H5N6. Compared to H5N6 and H9N2, the high-risk areas of H7N9 are more geographically extensive, and might occur even in the most northwestern part of China such as Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Figure 4 Figure 4. Predictive risk maps of probability of occurrence of human infections with H5N1 (A), H5N6 (B), H9N2 (C), and H7N9 (D) in China, and darker red indicating a higher risk. To evaluate the discriminatory power, the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted for the BRT model and area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. The accuracy metrics of the predictions produced by the BRT models are excellent, with mean AUC values estimated using the evaluation dataset ranging from 0.986 to 0.997 (Supplementary Figure 1). As expected, the AUC estimated based on the training data is always better than that estimated using the evaluation dataset. Discussion The cases in China were collected from January 2011 to March 2024. Individual-level characteristics vary between subtypes as previous study (18). The spatial distribution of H5N1, H5N6, H9N2, and H7N9 indicated some differences. The density of pig and density of human population were identified potential warning factors for the incidence of H5N1, H5N6, H9N2 and H7N9 subtype infections. Furthermore, the distributions of BRT model-predicted risk are similar with the areas where are currently collected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to predict the geographic distribution of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N6) and (H9N2) by boosted regression tree model in China. Prior to the emergence of the highly pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza at the end of December 2016, the subtype had mild or even no symptoms in poultry, making surveillance difficult. But the highly pathogenic strain of H7N9 virus was found in 2017, spreading rapidly through poultry in the following months. As for H5N6, the number of reported cases suddenly increased significantly in 2021, and 4 new genotypes detected in 2021 were the major causes of increased H5N6 virus infections (19). Previous studies have indicated that environmental factors also affect the spread of avian influenza, such temperature and relative humidity (20). In addition, BRT model has been employed in predicting the potential geographic distribution of H7N9 and H5N1, identifying suitable areas for disease occurrence and assessing risk factors. Martin et al. found that HPAI H5N1 clinical disease outbreak occurrence in domestic poultry was primarily linked to chicken density, human population density, and elevation (17). Fang et al. discovered that live poultry markets, human population density, irrigated croplands, built-up land, relative humidity and temperature significantly contributed to the occurrence of human infection with H7N9 virus (11). In addition, Li et al. reported that live poultry markets, density of human, coverage of built-up land, relative humidity and precipitation were significant predictors for both viruses (21). As noted by previous studies, live poultry markets serve as critical places for avian influenza transmission due to the high density of animal–animal and human-animal interactions. The present results reinforced critical role of the number of live poultry markets in human infection risk across multiple avian influenza viruses. The consistent findings likely stem from the fact that these markets provide ideal conditions for virus transmission, including direct contact between humans and infected birds, as well as the potential for virus persistence in contaminated environments. In the present study, it is interesting to note that human infections with H5N1, H5N6, H9N2 and H7N9 share similar social demographic factors (density of pig and density of human population). High density of human population and density of pig lead to a high risk of H5N1, H5N6, H9N2 and H7N9 infections. One interpretation is that densely populated areas are more likely to be associated with poultry-related trading or farming, which may promote the spread of pathogens in animal hosts and increase the chances of human infection with avian influenza. Another possible reason is that patients are more likely to be observed in areas with more people and timely medical facilities. When the population density reaches a certain threshold, the risk of infection tends to level out, which may be explained by virus’s adaption to man. The ability of a virus to spread from one species to another is determined by many factors such as the availability of an intermediate host, most commonly pigs, which plays a genetic mixing vessel role between birds and humans (22, 23). Therefore, the important role of the density of pig for the four subtypes is not surprising. The relationship between occurrence of human cases and the percentage coverage of irrigation suggests that waterfowl would act as hosts in the transmission of avian influenza viruses. It has been known that domestic ducks could excrete large numbers of virus through salivary and nasal secretions and feces although seems to be healthy (24), thus water is considered as a mediator to facilitate the transmission of viruses from waterfowl to human without direct contacts. Avian influenza virus has been tested to remain infective for up to 207 days at 17°C and up to 102 days at 28°C (25), which increases the probability of human infection. From a historical perspective, China has developed agriculture from the need to feed the people as efficiently as possible, using limited resources. Domestic ducks were first migrated from rivers to cultivated rice paddies in the mid-17th century during the early Qing Dynasty (26). This practice helps to protect the growing rice from pests and reduces usage of chemical insecticides. However, it provides a closer proximity for ducks, water, food and people. The live poultry market has always been recognized as the reservoir and amplifier of avian influenza viruses, where highly crowded environments and frequent poultry exposure are common (27–29). In the present study, live poultry markets had a lower influence on the occurrence of human H7N9 infection than other subtypes infection based on BRT model. This difference might due to the different transmissibilities from animal hosts to human across viruses but requires further investigation. Human infection with H5N1 and H9N2 was both affected by the percentage coverage of wetland. As mentioned above, domestic ducks moved from natural rivers to farmland, the number of important hosts in wetland decreased between viruses and human, which may partly explain the negative association between occurrence of H5N1, H9N2 and the percentage coverage of wetland. In the context of continuing the implementation of “return of farmland to lakes” policies, attention should be paid to the ecological impact of the migration of wild birds in wetlands. Precipitation is the principal climatic variables contributing to human infections for H5N1, H5N6, H9N2 and H7N9 viruses, while mean temperature of warmest quarter only affected the human H9N2 infections risk. Similar with previous results of the association between H5N1 infection and relative humidity (21), BRT models showed that higher precipitation created a higher risk of H5N1 and H5N6. Higher precipitation always indicates the rainy day. In that case, people prefer to stay indoors and increase the physically person-to-person and animal-to-person distance. Consistent with the finding of precipitation, a higher mean temperature of warmest quarter and mean temperature of wettest quarter (after 26°C) was associated with a higher risk of H5N1 and H9N2 infection. Global ecosystem is susceptible to impacts from changing climate (30). Current evidence suggests that groundwater and lake temperatures have been increasing over the past 40 years, causing water temperature variation up to 3°C. Warming temperatures are considered significant for wildlife disease dynamics and may lead to increased avian influenza virus pathogenicity or transmissibility through influencing bird migration patterns or other ways (31). Furthermore, the risk maps provided valuable reference for decision-makers and public health officials. For example, the Pearl River and Yangtze River deltas, identified as having a high probability of H5N6 infection, which was consistent with previous studies (32), should be prioritized for enhanced surveillance, stricter biosecurity measures in live poultry markets. In areas like southwestern China, where H5N1 infection risks are elevated, public health authorities can implement targeted vaccination programs for poultry, monitor potential outbreaks more closely, and ensure rapid response capabilities. Notably, the identification of hot spots for multiple virus strains, such as in Guangxi, Sichuan, and Guangdong, suggests that these regions may require multi-faceted strategies to address the risks of different avian influenza viruses. Understanding these spatial patterns facilitates more efficient deployment of diagnostic resources, the establishment of quarantine zones if necessary, and the timely dissemination of health advice to high-risk populations. The maps can also be used by policymakers to assess the need for cross-provincial coordination and international collaboration, especially in areas near provincial borders or regions with significant poultry trade. The advantage of this study was that BRT model was used to examine the association between ecoclimatic, environmental, social and demographic factors and several predominant human infections with avian influenza from 2011 to 2024 in China. This study also has some limitations. First, the sample of human infection with avian influenza viruses was collected from reporting system. It is possible that many mild cases have already occurred but were not detected due to the incomplete coverage of the sentinel surveillance network in several less developed areas of China or not seeking medical care, and thus are subject to reporting bias. Second, the relatively smaller cases of human H5N6 and H9N2 infections reported in China may limit the discriminating power of the BRT models, as demonstrated by the lower AUCs compared to H7N9. Third, live poultry movements with broiler and layer poultry supply chains (such as breeding, hatching, slaughter, wholesale and retail markets) are considered to be too complex to be described on provincial scales (33). So, the number of live poultry markets included in the BRT model is not precise. In addition, human cases infected with four subtypes were collected the provincial level in China during 2011–2024, which may be crude scale. And other environmental and socio-economic factors that could influence infection risk such as elevation, coverage of built-up land and public awareness were not included in the analysis. Finally, it should be noted that the BRT model was employed to predict the probability of occurrence of human infection with avian influenza instead of making causal inferences. Conclusion In conclusion, targeted interventions such as continuous monitoring of pig density and population density is necessary. In addition, mapping predictive risk of various avian influenza viruses based on models offers a valuable approach to identify the areas where surveillance efforts should be targeted.

"Vaccines with novel adjuvants are more reactogenic than vaccines without adjuvants, and there is a theoretical possibility that novel adjuvants could activate immune mediated disease in some individuals."The findings were published today in JAMA Network Open.Vaccines given in each armThe team vaccinated 130 community-dwelling adults 65 years and older with one dose each of RZV and allV4 in opposite arms and gave the RSV and HD-IIV4 vaccines to 137 during the 2021-22 and 2022-23 flu seasons at two US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Project sites at Duke and Johns Hopkins universities. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was evaluated for 7 days postvaccination.The second RZV dose was given alone on day 60. The median participant age was 71 years, 51.3% were men, and follow-up was roughly 3 months.Outcomes of interest were the proportion of vaccinees with at least one severe solicited local or systemic reaction in the 8 days after vaccination and serious adverse events and adverse events of clinical interest in the 43 days after vaccination.Slightly fewer severe reactions after adjuvanted flu vaccineThe percentage of participants who reported one or more severe reactions after simultaneous vaccination with RZV and allV4 (11.5%) was noninferior compared with simultaneous vaccination with RZV and HD-IIV4 (12.5) (absolute difference, -1.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], -8.9% to 7.1%). From a safety standpoint, this study supports the simultaneous administration of RZV and allV4 among older adults.The proportion of participants with at least one severe local reaction was noninferior in the RZV and allV4 group (6.2%) compared with the RZV and HD-IIV4 group (4.4%) (absolute difference, 1.7%; 95% CI, -4.0% to 7.8%). And the percentage reporting one or more severe systemic reactions was noninferior in the RZV and allV4 group (5.4%) compared with the RZV and HD-IIV4 group (9.6%) (absolute difference, -4.2%; 95% CI, -10.9% to 2.5%).Throughout the study period, nine serious adverse events were reported (3.1% in the RZV and allV4 group and 3.7% in the RZV and HD-IIV4 group).No participant sought medical care for a local or systemic reaction in the 8 days after dose 1 or 2 of RZV, and patterns of severe reactions among participants aged 65 to 69 years were similar to those of participants aged 70 and older.In the 43 days postvaccination, 0.8% of participants in the RZV and allV4 group had a serious adverse event, compared with 3.7% in the RZV and HD-IIV4 group (difference between the allV4 and HD-IIV4 groups, –2.9%; 95% CI, -6.4% to 0.6%). There were minimal changes to HRQoL scores in the 8 days after vaccination."Overall safety findings were similar between groups," the study authors wrote. "From a safety standpoint, this study supports the simultaneous administration of RZV and allV4 among older adults."

Investigators have hypothesized major lifetime health impacts from periconceptual, prenatal, and early extrauterine environmental stressors.Certain neurological sequelae in offspring are impacted by maternal bacterial infections in pregnancy, with prenatal influenza exposure indicated as a potential risk factor of childhood seizures. However, this association has only been reported in Western countries, with data in East Asian countries lacking.Influenza vaccination during pregnancy has been associated with increased infant protection, based on the results of a prospective test-negative study.2 Infants of mothers who received influenza vaccination also had improved protection against the disease, with only 26.8% of positive influenza cases being reported among infants of mothers who were vaccinated.Of infants who tested negative, 35.6% had mothers who were vaccinated during pregnancy. Rates of vaccination among mothers testing positive and negative for influenza were 28.6% and 38.3%, respectively, highlighting the benefits of maternal influenza protection.To evaluate the link between maternal influenza infection and childhood seizures, investigators conducted a nationwide cohort study.1 Data was obtained from Taiwan’s Maternal and Child Health Database, which linked multiple relevant datasets to provide comprehensive data about parents and offspring.Participants included mother-offspring pairs from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2013, with follow-up occurring until December 31, 2020. Mothers with a history of epilepsy were excluded from the analysis. Mothers were primiparous and had an outpatient visit, emergency department visit, hospitalization with a primary influenza diagnosis.Influenza diagnosis was determined based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) or ICD-10-CM codes, and patients without influenza during pregnancy were matched 1:4 to those with influenza. Any seizure diagnosis was reported as the primary outcome of the analysis.Seizure types included epilepsy and febrile seizures. Covariates included gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia or eclampsia, placenta previa or abruption, and anemia.There were 1,316,107 mother-offspring pairs included in the analysis, with a predominant maternal age of 25 to 29 years. Of offspring, 48.1% of female offspring and 51.9% of male offspring were in the influenza group. The rate of placenta previa was slightly increased in the influenza group vs the control group, at 1.6% vs 1.4%, respectively.Higher rates of seizures were reported in the influenza group vs the control group, with 3.2% of infants in the influenza group developing seizures during follow-up. When evaluating this risk based on seizure type, an elevated risk did not remain for epilepsy, but the risk of febrile convulsions was significantly increased.When controlling for confounders, the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) in the influenza group were 1.09 for seizures, 1.11 for febrile convulsions, and 1.04 for epilepsy. Significant covariates included maternal age, gestational hypertension, cesarean delivery, male offspring sex, birth weight, and gestational age, with aHRs of 0.90, 1.78, 1.09, 1.28, 1.27, and 1.23, respectively.These results indicated an association between maternal influenza infection during pregnancy and an increased risk of febrile seizures in offspring. Investigators recommended additional research evaluating the mechanisms underlying childhood neurological development.References:This article was first published by our sister publication, Contemporary OB/GYN.

The flu is a viral infection of the respiratory tract (the lungs, voice box, throat, nose, mouth, and airways). It's a highly contagious disease mostly caused by the viruses influenza A and B, both of which share similar symptoms. The flu typically sets on rapidly. Not everyone with the flu will experience all, or even any, of the same symptoms. It's possible to have the flu and spread it to others without realizing you have it. The flu can cause more severe symptoms or even be fatal in adults older than 65, infants, or people with certain health conditions. Body Aches A characteristic sign of the flu is pain in the muscles and joints, or myalgia. These aches occur due to your body's immune reaction to flu viruses, which causes inflammation. Cough A need to cough is another common sign of the flu. Your lungs form mucus to trap the virus. Coughing helps to rid your body of this infected mucus. Fatigue Feeling very tired and needing more sleep is also a sign of infection. Your body expends more energy to fight off the disease. Other symptoms, such as coughing, can affect your sleep. Fever or Chills Feeling feverish and experiencing chills are signs of your body fighting off an infection. You may have sweats and fluctuations in temperature, with body temperatures climbing to between 100 to 104 degrees. Headache Another symptom often distinguishing the flu from a cold is headache, which is caused by cytokines. Your body releases these molecules as part of its natural immune reaction to the infection. Runny or Stuffy Nose A runny nose (rhinitis) or stuffy nose (nasal congestion) are common symptoms of respiratory infections like the flu. The soft tissues of your nasal passages can sometimes become inflamed due to infection. Sore Throat Not everyone who has the flu experiences a sore throat, but a dry, painful throat can sometimes be a sign of infection. It arises as the virus enters your body through soft tissues in the nasal passages and airways, causing irritation. Less Common Symptoms The flu can spread from the respiratory tract to other parts of the body in some more severe cases—especially if the body is not able to fight off the infection. This response can lead to several symptoms, including an ear infection, pneumonia, and sinus infection. Ear Infection The flu virus can spread to the passages of the middle ear and cause inflammation and an ear infection, or otitis media. Ear pain and pressure, fever, and fussiness (in infants and children) are the most common signs. Pneumonia Pneumonia is a severe infection characterized by fluid or pus (a viscous fluid) build-up in the air sacs, or alveoli, of the lungs. It ranges in severity and can be fatal. Pneumonia causes symptoms like: Chest pain when coughing or breathingChillsCough with or without mucusFeverLow oxygen levels in the blood (hypoxemia)Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Sinus Infection Sinus infections (sinusitis) affect the pockets of air in your forehead, nasal passages, and cheeks. They are a moderate complication of the flu. This causes fluid build-up in these spaces, leading to symptoms like: Bad breathCoughHeadachePain or pressure in the facePost-nasal drip (mucus in the throat)Runny or stuffy noseSore throat Rare Symptoms The flu can lead to life-threatening complications in rare, severe cases. Certain populations are at increased risk of these, including infants or children younger than 5, people older than 65, pregnant people, and those with health conditions like asthma, diabetes, or heart disease. Encephalitis The flu can cause a severe infection called encephalitis if it spreads to the tissues of the brain. This causes many symptoms, including: Difficulties understanding speech or speakingDouble visionFlu-like symptomsHallucinationsLoss of consciousnessLoss of touch sensation in parts of the bodyMemory lossMuscle weaknessPartial paralysis of arms or limbsSeizures Multiple Organ Failure Multiple organ failure is one of the most common causes of death in people who experience flu complications. It's characterized by multiple organs, such as the lungs or kidneys, failing to operate. Symptoms of multiple organ failure include: Fatigue Headaches Itchiness Loss of appetite Memory or cognitive problems Pain and stiffness in the joints Sleep difficulties Swelling in the limbs Weight loss Muscle Infections Other rare complications of the flu affect the muscles. This can lead to myositis, or a cluster of conditions that cause muscle weakness, fatigue, and pain. Myositis can lead to rhabdomyolysis (rhabdo), or a potentially fatal breakdown of the muscles. Rhabdo can cause kidney or heart failure. Myocarditis Myocarditis occurs when the flu spreads to the muscles of the heart. This very serious condition causes symptoms like: Cardiac arrest (the heart stopping) Chest pain Fatigue and loss of energy Irregular heartbeat Persistent cough Swelling in the arms or legs Thick mucus, sometimes with spots of blood Wheezing Sepsis Sepsis is a blood infection that occurs due to an extreme immune reaction in your body. It's a dangerous medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. Signs and symptoms of sepsis include: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breathDisorientation or confusionElevated heart rateFever, chills, or shiversRapid breathingSevere pain or discomfortSweating or clammy skin Symptoms in Children Children, especially those younger than 2, are at a higher risk of the flu and its complications. About 9.3% of those younger than 18 develop the flu, which is more than twice the rate of adults older than 65. It's important to know the signs and symptoms of the flu in infants and children, such as: Body aches Diarrhea Earaches Fatigue Fever or chills Nausea or vomiting Runny nose Sore throat Is Influenza Contagious? The flu is a highly contagious respiratory infection. It's spread from person to person through infectious droplets. An infected person can spread these droplets when they cough, sneeze, or talk near you. The droplets can land in your mouth or nose. It's less common, but you may pick up flu germs when you touch an infected surface and then touch your face. When To Contact a Healthcare Provider Any sign of severe illness warrants medical attention, which is critical given how severe the flu can be. Certain signs and symptoms in adults warrant emergency help, such as: Chronic pain or pressure in the chestDizziness, lightheadedness, and confusion that doesn’t go awayA fever or cough that gets better but then returns and gets worseLack of urinationSeizuresSevere muscle pain, weakness, or loss of balanceShortness of breath or breathing difficultiesWorsening symptoms of other conditions, such as asthma Get medical attention right away if your child or infant has: Any fever in infants younger than 12 weeks or a fever above 104 degrees in children older than 3 months Bluish tint to the face or lips Chest or muscular pain No alertness when awake, a lack of interaction with others Rapid or difficult breathing Ribs retracting with every breath Seizure Signs of dehydration, such as dry mouth, lack of urination for eight hours or more, and no tears when crying Worsening fever or cough Worsening symptoms of other conditions Questions To Ask Your Provider You may ask a healthcare provider the following question if you seek further care:How can I prevent severe complications from the flu?How can I tell if I have an ear or sinus infection or pneumonia?Should I get tested for COVID-19?What should I eat or drink to feel better? A Quick Review The flu is a viral infection that primarily affects the respiratory system. Typical symptoms include cough, runny nose, fever, body aches, fatigue, and headache. It's rare, but complications may occur, ranging in severity from a sinus or ear infection to pneumonia, endocarditis, and encephalitis. It's important to seek out treatment, especially if your or your child's symptoms are severe. Frequently Asked Questions How long does influenza last? Flu symptoms typically occur within 48 hours of exposure to the virus. You will likely experience symptoms for seven to 10 days. Some people may feel sick for two weeks or longer. Most often—and especially in the absence of other health conditions or risks—the flu is a self-limiting disease. Symptoms resolve on their own. How are symptoms of the flu different than a common cold? There are many similarities between the symptoms of colds and the flu, but there are also key differences. The flu has a more rapid onset and is more likely to cause fever, body aches, fatigue or muscular weakness, and headache. A stuffy nose, sneezing, and sore throat can arise in both but are more common if you have a cold. Can you still have the flu if you do not have a fever? A fever is often a hallmark of influenza, arising as your immune system tries to fight off the infection. It's important to note that some people develop the flu without a fever or chills. This is especially the case if you are older than 65 or have a weak immune system due to other conditions. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential use of Peyssonnelia caulifera (PC), a marine alga, as a natural adjuvant for an inactivated split A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 influenza vaccine (sPR8) in a murine model. We administered PC-adjuvanted vaccines to a murine model via intramuscular prime and boost vaccinations, and subsequently analyzed the induced immunological responses, particularly the production of antigen-specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies, memory T and B cell responses, and the protective efficacy against a lethal viral infection. PC extract significantly bolstered the vaccine efficacy, demonstrating balanced Th1/Th2 responses, increased memory T and B cell activities, and improved protection against viral infection. Notably, within 3 days post-vaccination, the PC adjuvant stimulated activation markers on dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages at the inguinal lymph nodes (ILN), emphasizing its immunostimulatory capabilities. Furthermore, the safety profile of PC was confirmed, showing minimal local inflammation and no significant adverse effects post-vaccination. These findings contribute to our understanding of the immunomodulatory properties of natural adjuvants and suggest the promising roles of natural adjuvants in the development of more effective vaccines for infectious diseases.

These viruses predominantly affect respiratory epithelial cells, leading to symptoms varying from mild, such as fever, cough, and malaise, to severe that lead to pneumonia, secondary bacterial infections, and even death in vulnerable groups3. Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure against influenza virus infection; however, the rapid antigenic drift and shift of these viruses can compromise the efficacy of vaccines4,5. This necessitates the continual development of innovative vaccination strategies and discovery of new antiviral drugs.The use of potent adjuvants significantly enhances the efficacy of influenza vaccines6. Several adjuvants have been approved by the FDA for use in human vaccines, including aluminum salts (alum), monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), AS01B, CpG1018, Matrix-M, and MF59 7,8. Alum has a long history of enhancing antibody responses by activating humoral immunity9,10. On the other hand, MPL, which stimulates the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway, is used alongside alum in some GlaxoSmithKline vaccines to improve antibody production11. The supplementary use of a suitable adjuvant in a vaccine regimen is crucial because it can induce the desired type of immune response and provide optimal protection against diverse infections. An ideal adjuvant, which is integral to the successful immunization of individuals, should stimulate suitable Th1 or Th2 responses12 and demonstrate high safety, stability, biodegradability, and biocompatibility13,14. A delicate balance between Th1/Th2 is often required to provide effective protection against disease, which should be supported by an ideal adjuvant15,16. Hence, discovering and developing a new adjuvant that not only enhances the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine but is also safer, more powerful, and cost-effective represents a significant step forward in vaccination technology.One promising area of research that has been gaining attention in the field of vaccine immunology is the use of natural substances as vaccine adjuvants. One subsequent standout is marine algae, with more than one million species on Earth, which have become a focal point of interest17. Marine algae, known for their rich and biodiverse metabolic products18, have surfaced as potential sources of novel adjuvants19, as they produce various bioactive compounds, including polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins, which have demonstrated potential immunostimulatory properties20. In recent years, extracts from specific algae species have been found to evoke considerable immune responses when used as adjuvants21,22,23, augmenting both humoral and cell-mediated immune reactions24. Therefore, the utilization of algae extract as a natural and potentially more effective adjuvant could represent a significant step forward in improving vaccine efficiency.We have shown that the extract from Peyssonnelia caulifera (PC), a marine algae species, shows immunostimulatory effects on antigen-presenting cell activation in vitro25. We, therefore, aimed to assess the effect of PC as an adjuvant in influenza vaccines to boost the immune response, investigate the immunostimulatory effects of PC on the seasonal influenza vaccine, and present evidence of enhanced humoral and cellular responses in mice following intramuscular injection of the PC-adjuvant vaccine. These findings provide a crucial foundation for the development of a superior influenza vaccine adjuvant against seasonal and pandemic influenza.ResultsEffects of PC on antigen-specific antibody production by immunizationTo determine whether PC could enhance IgG antibody responses in sera after vaccination, we vaccinated mice and collected immune sera 14 days post-vaccination. Alum was used as a positive adjuvant control. Antigen-specific IgG responses and antibody subtypes in all serum samples were determined by ELISA. Two weeks after prime vaccination, the alum group displayed the highest IgG and IgG1 levels, and PC-induced IgG production was significantly increased compared to that in the sPR8 group. We observed that the PC group exhibited significantly higher IgG2a levels compared to the sPR8 group at a 1:100 dilution (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, consistent with the trend observed in IgG levels following the prime vaccination, the addition of PC resulted in significantly elevated IgG2a antibody levels compared to both the sPR8 and alum groups two weeks after the boost vaccination (Fig. 1b).The data showed PC could enhance Th1 immune responses. All the immunized sera post boost vaccination exhibited protective efficacy against 1×LD50 of A/PR8 (Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 1Antigen-specific antibody levels in sera after immunizations. Mice (n = 4) were immunized with sPR8 vaccine only or sPR8 in the presence of adjuvants (Alum or PC). Immune sera were taken 2 weeks post prime (a) and boost (b) immunizations and A/PR8 virus antigen-specific IgG antibody levels were measured by ELISA. Means ± standard errors were shown with individual dots. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s multiple comparison test were performed for statistical analysis. *p < 0.0332; **p < 0.0021; ***p < 0.0002, ****p < 0.0001 PC compared to sPR8 group. ###p < 0.0002 PC compared to Alum group.Full size imageEffects of PC on antigen-specific T cell responses induced by vaccinationNext, we assessed the effects of PC on T cell proliferation in the lungs and spleen 7 days after the booster vaccination to explore whether PC could stimulate cellular immunity. Lung and spleen cells were harvested, stained with CFSE (carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester), cultured in vitro with antigen stimulation for 5 days, and subsequently analyzed using FACS (Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting). The PC-adjuvant group demonstrated the highest proliferation rates of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from the lungs, and a significant difference was observed between the PC and alum groups in the lung cell proliferation (Fig. 2a). Vaccination without an adjuvant slightly increased the levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell antigen-specific proliferation. Spleen CD4+ T and CD8+ cell proliferation was highest in the PC-adjuvant group (Fig. 2b). The alum group showed slightly increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation. Taken together, the PC-adjuvant vaccine significantly increased the antigen-specific proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from both the lungs and spleen compared to that in the vaccine-only and alum groups. Overall, PC acts as a potent inducer of T cell activation.Fig. 2Antigen-specific T cell responses induced by vaccination. Lung (a) and spleen (b) cells were harvested from the immunized mice 2 weeks post-boost immunization. CFSE-labeled cells were stimulated with 10 µg/ml sPR8 for 5 days and T cell proliferation was determined by flow cytometry. Means ± standard error are shown with individual dots. One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test were performed for statistical analysis. *p < 0.0332; **p < 0.0021; ***p < 0.0002; ****p < 0.0001 compared between the indicated groups.Full size imageEffect of PC on improving protective efficacy of influenza vaccines after lethal virus infectionFollowing viral infection, the naïve infection group suffered from a rapid loss of weight, peaking at a 24.17% decrease at 7 days post-infection (Fig. 3a, b). Additionally, only a 50% survival rate was observed on the seventh day post-infection (Fig. 3c). Conversely, all vaccinated groups prevented weight loss and showed markedly superior protective efficiency. Specifically, 7 days after the viral challenge, the PC-adjuvant group significantly bolstered protection against the PR8 virus, evidenced by a minimal body weight loss of just 2.14% and a 100% survival rate. This group outperformed both the alum group, which suffered a 4% body weight loss but maintained a 100% survival rate, and sPR8 group, which endured a 17.36% body weight loss and a 100% survival rate.Furthermore, we conducted histological examinations of the lungs at 7 days post A/PR8 challenge. The naïve group exhibited severe inflammation, marked tissue damage, and intense infiltration of inflammatory cells. In contrast, the PC group showed reduced immune cell infiltration and inflammation compared to naïve infection group (Fig. 3e). In line with the histological findings, the groups immunized with different vaccines demonstrated a significant reduction in lung viral titers (Fig. 3d).Fig. 3Protective efficacy of vaccination against a lethal influenza infection. Sixteen weeks after the boost immunization, naïve and immunized mice were infected with a lethal dose of A/PR8 virus (1 × LD50). Sixteen weeks after the booster immunization, naïve and immunized mice were infected with a lethal dose of the A/PR8 virus (1 × LD50). Body weight (a) was monitored for 14 days after infection. Body weight loss on day 7 post-infection (b), survival rates over 14 days (c), viral titration in lung samples harvested 7 days post-infection (d), and lung histopathology using hematoxylin and eosin staining (e) were assessed. Means ± standard errors were shown with individual dots. One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test were performed for statistical analysis. *p < 0.0332; **p < 0.0021; ***p < 0.0002; ****p < 0.0001 compared between the indicated groups.Full size imageEffects of PC on lung inflammation after a lethal A/PR8 influenza virus infectionSixteen weeks after the booster vaccination, the mice were challenged with a lethal dose of the virus. Lung samples were collected 7 days post-infection. Lung cells were used for flow cytometry analysis, and lung supernatant was used for cytokine measurement using ELISA. The highest populations of monocytes, neutrophils, and DCs were observed in the naïve infected group after viral infection (Fig. 4a). The PC-adjuvant group showed a significantly decreased percentage of monocytes and DCs, matching the rate observed in the alum-adjuvant group. However, it presented higher levels of neutrophils than the alum-adjuvant group. A significantly enhanced number of eosinophils was detected in the lungs of the alum-adjuvant group. Both the PC-adjuvant and sPR8 groups showed a moderate population of eosinophils. No significant eosinophil recruitment was observed in the naïve infection group.The cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p40, IFN-γ, and CCL2 were specifically chosen for measurement due to their critical roles in the immune response and inflammatory processes during influenza infection 26,27. Elevated levels of these cytokines are directly associated with increased lung pathology and have been linked to poor outcomes, including death, in severe cases of influenza 28,29. Therefore, their measurement provides essential insights into the inflammatory processes and enables us to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different vaccine strategies in modulating this response. We next measured the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-12p40, interferon-alpha (IFN-γ), and CCL2 in the lungs. Figure 4b shows that naïve infected mice exhibited the highest levels of all measured cytokines and chemokines (including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p40, IFN-γ, and CCL2) following virus infection. These elevated levels indicate robust inflammatory reactions in the lungs against the virus, which are detrimental and not desirable in the context of vaccine-induced immunity. Conversely, vaccinated mice demonstrated a reduction in these inflammatory cytokine levels indicating better protection against the virus. Among these, the PC-adjuvant group showed a significant decrease in IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-12p40, and CCL2 production compared to the naïve infected group. Additionally, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p40, and CCL2 were lower in the PC-adjuvant group compared to the Alum group.Overall, these results indicated that PC supplemented vaccination significantly reduced the inflammatory reaction against the influenza virus challenge in the lungs, as evidenced by significantly decreased infiltration of inflammatory cells and lower levels of inflammatory cytokines.Fig. 4Cellular infiltration and cytokine production in the lungs after the lethal virus challenge. The immunized mice (n = 4) were infected with A/PR8 virus (1 x LD50) after 16 weeks of boost immunization. Lung samples were harvested at 7 days post-infection and cell phenotypes were determined by flow cytometry and cytokine levels of each sample were measured by ELISA. Means ± standard errors were shown with individual dots. One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test were performed for statistical analysis. *p < 0.0332; **p < 0.0021; ***p < 0.0002; ****p < 0.0001 compared to naïve infected group.Full size imageEffects of PC on memory T and B cell responsesMemory T and B cells play pivotal roles in the immune response against the influenza virus30. Using FACS, we analyzed the presence of antigen-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lungs and spleen 7 days after a lethal virus challenge. The group vaccinated with PC adjuvant significantly prompted antigen-specific T cell proliferation in the lungs following in vitro stimulation, in both CD4+ and CD8+T cells population (Fig. 5a). In the spleen, the PC-adjuvant vaccine resulted in the highest population of antigen-specific CD8+ memory T cells. The alum group induced a moderate level of CD8+T cell proliferation and showed the highest CD4+T cell in the spleen.Additionally, PC-adjuvant group generated significantly higher levels of antibody-producing cells in the bone marrow and spleen than the other groups. The alum-adjuvant group exerted a moderate effect on IgG antibody production originating from bone marrow cells, whereas the sPR8 group triggered higher antibody concentrations in spleen cells than the alum group. These findings suggest that the PC adjuvant can effectively stimulate responses from memory T, memory B, and antibody-producing cells.Fig. 5Antigen-specific memory T and B cell responses induced by the vaccination. Lung, spleen, and bone marrow cells were harvested at day 7 post-infection from the immunized and infected mice. Lung and spleen cells were labeled with CFSE and cultured for 5 days in the presence of sPR8 (10 µg/ml) stimulation. T cell proliferation was then determined via flow cytometry (a). Bone marrow cells and spleen cells were also harvested, then incubated with sPR8 (10 µg/ml) for 1 day and 7 days, respectively. Subsequently, antigen-specific IgG production was measured by ELISA (b). Means ± standard errors were shown with individual dots. One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test were performed for statistical analysis. *p < 0.0332; **p < 0.0021; ***p < 0.0002; ****p < 0.0001 compared between the indicated groups.Full size imageEffect of PC on DCs and macrophages maturation in vivoActivation of DCs and macrophages is important to initiate immune responses and immunoregulation31,32. We investigated the effect of the PC adjuvant on DC and macrophage maturation at the site of injection and draining lymph nodes. The mice were administered the sPR8 vaccine alone or in combination with either PC or Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) via prime and boost immunization. Three days after the booster vaccination, we harvested cells from the injection area, including the muscle tissue and inguinal lymph node (ILN). These cells were then stained for activation markers of DCs and macrophages.In muscle cells (Fig. 6a, b), MPL vaccination resulted in the highest levels of CD40, CD86, and MHC II in DCs and macrophages. The PC-adjuvant group showed higher levels of MHC IIhigh than the other groups. In contrast, in the ILN (Fig. 6c, d), we observed a significant increase in the expression of all surface molecules on DCs and macrophages from PC-immunized mice, indicating that PC could stimulate DC and macrophage maturation in vivo effectively.Fig. 6Activation marker expressions in DCs and macrophages at the site of injection after vaccination. Mice were vaccinated with sPR8 vaccine alone or adjuvanted (PC, MPL). Muscles (a, b) and ILN (c, d) samples were harvested at 3 days post-boost vaccination and the activation marker expressions on DCs and macrophages were acquired by flow cytometry. DCs and macrophages were gated by CD11c and CD11b surface markers, respectively. Means ± standard errors are shown with individual dots. One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test were performed for statistical analysis. *p < 0.0332; **p < 0.0021; ***p < 0.0002; ****p < 0.0001 compared to between the indicated groups.Full size imageFurthermore, 3 days after the boost vaccination, we isolated DCs from the spleen and co-cultured them with CFSE-labeled naïve lymphocytes (from C57BL/6 mice) to investigate the antigen presentation and activation ability of the stimulated DCs towards T cells. After 5 days of incubation, T cell proliferation was measured using flow cytometry. The PC-adjuvant group showed a significant increase in the percentage of CD4+ T cell proliferation compared to the other groups (Fig. 6e). CD8+ T cells were induced by PC vaccination but showed lower levels than those in the MPL-adjuvant and sPR8 groups. These data revealed that the PC-adjuvant group effectively promoted DC-induced T cell proliferation.Effect of PC on local inflammation responses at the injection siteTo better understand the local inflammatory response associated with vaccine injection, we performed a muscle histology examination. Mice (n = 3) were intramuscularly injected with different vaccine formulations including sPR8 vaccine (0.5 µg/mouse) alone or combined with either PC (200 µg/mouse) or alum (100 µg/mouse) via prime and boost immunizations. Three days after the boost vaccination, muscle tissues were harvested from the injection sites and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). As shown in Fig. 7, the alum-adjuvant group induced a more severe inflammatory response than the sPR8- and PC-adjuvant groups at 3 days post-boost vaccination. Moderate levels of inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in the muscles of the PC-adjuvant group.Fig. 7Inflammation induced by the vaccination at the site of injection. Mice (n = 3/group) were given different vaccine regimens through intramuscular injections. Three days after the boost vaccination, the muscle tissues from the injection sites were collected, processed, and stained with H&E. The representative data are shown. Scale bars indicate 50 μm.Full size imagePC-adjuvant vaccine enhances immune responses via the TLR4 signaling pathwaySome marine algae extracts have been shown to induce the activation of TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) signaling33,34. Natural extracts containing polysaccharides have been shown to promote DC activation via the TLR4 pathway35,36. PC, a type of marine algae, also contains large amounts of polysaccharides37,38. Therefore, we conducted an in vitro experiment to evaluate whether PC enhances the immune response through the TLR4 pathway. BM-DCs were pre-treated for 1 h with 1 µM of TAK-242, a TLR4 pathway inhibitor. Then, BM-DCs were co-cultured for 2 days with either 0.1 µg/mL of MPL or various concentrations (4, 20, 100 µg/mL) of PC. The levels of CD40, CD86, and MHCII were analyzed by flow cytometry, and an ELISA was performed to measure the production of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12p40, and IL-12p70. Increased levels of CD40 induced by either MPL or PC were significantly inhibited by TAK-242 (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, the enhanced production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12p70, triggered by either MPL or PC, was markedly reduced by TAK-242 (Fig. 8b).Fig. 8TLR4 signaling pathway as a potential adjuvant mechanism of PC. (a, b) Effects of PC on BM-DCs function through the TLR4-mediated pathway were evaluated. After pre-treatment with 1 µM of TAK-242 for 1 h, BM-DCs were treated with different concentrations of PC (4, 20, 100 µg/mL) and 0.1 µg/mL MPL, incubated for 2 days. Activation marker expressions (a) and cytokine production (b) were then measured. (c, d) TLR4 expression levels in the spleen at day 3 post-boost vaccination were measured by western blot (n = 3). β-Actin was used as a loading control. Representative western blot images (c) and densitometry based quantitative analysis of TLR4 (d) are shown. Means ± standard error are shown with individual dots. One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test were performed for statistical analysis. *p < 0.0332; **p < 0.0021; ***p < 0.0002; ****p < 0.0001 compared between the indicated groups.Full size imageWe investigated the ability of PC to induce TLR4 expression in vivo. Mice were administered either sPR8 (0.5 µg/mouse) alone, or in combination with PC (200 µg/mouse), or MPL (1 µg/mouse) during prime and boost vaccinations. Three days post-boost vaccination, we isolated proteins from the spleen and measured TLR4 expression using western blotting. MPL, a TLR4 ligand, was used as the positive control. According to the results, PC increased TLR4 expression, matching the levels observed with MPL; however, the difference was not significant (Fig. 8c, d). Overall, these findings suggest that PC stimulates BM-DC maturation and cytokine production via the TLR4 pathway.DiscussionIn recent years, there has been growing interest in the utilization and development of natural extracts as novel, safe, and efficacious vaccine adjuvants. The incorporation of adjuvants into vaccines is a strategy to improve vaccine-mediated protection, especially against influenza viruses. In this report, we investigated PC, an extract derived from marine algae, as a potential adjuvant in split influenza vaccines. In this research, we examined the effects of administering prime and boost vaccinations intramuscularly to mice and found promising results using PC as an adjuvant for influenza vaccines. We mainly assessed the impact of PC based on specific IgG1 and IgG2a serum antibodies, memory T and B cell responses, and protection against viral infections. Our findings indicate that the inclusion of PC significantly enhanced the efficacy of an inactivated split A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 influenza vaccine (sPR8). When compared to sPR8 group, the vaccine with PC showed an improved Th1/Th2 response and elicited significantly robust memory T and B cell reactions. Furthermore, mice that were administered PC exhibited better protection against severe infections, which was evident from the reduced lung inflammation, decreased viral loads, and prevention of weight loss caused by the viral infection.The maturation and activation of DCs and macrophages not only play an important role in initiating antigen-specific immune responses, but also provide protective immunity against invading pathogens39. To understand the mechanism of PC-enhanced influenza vaccine-induced immunity, we investigated the maturation of DCs and macrophages in the muscle and ILN at the site of immunization 3 days post-boost vaccination. In this experiment, we selected MPL as a positive control due to its well-established role as a TLR4 agonist, known to effectively stimulate the activation of DCs and macrophages 40,41. Our findings demonstrate that PC promotes the expression of CD40, CD86, and MHC II in DCs and macrophages in the ILN. Moreover, DCs activated by PC stimulated CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation (Fig. 6e). These findings are consistent with those of our previous in vitro study25, indicating that PC, as an adjuvant for the influenza vaccine, can improve immune responses by promoting DCs and macrophage maturation.The effectiveness of an influenza vaccine is linked to its ability to stimulate both humoral- and cell-mediated immune responses. The humoral immune system produces antibodies to neutralize influenza antigens42. Our study found that using PC as an adjuvant enhanced the levels of antigen-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a following both prime and boost vaccinations. The PC-adjuvant group showed elevated IgG2a levels compared to the alum group. Furthermore, consistent with prior reports on alum43,44,45, our study showed its limited capability to induce IgG2a. Alum induces IgG1 but not IgG2a, highlighting its potential to initiate only a humoral immune response that correlates with the Th2-type immune response46. These data suggest that PC is a promising adjuvant for both cellular and humoral immunity. Cell-mediated immunity, primarily driven by T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, has the potential to inhibit viral replication and expedite recovery following influenza virus infection47. In this study, we investigated the influence of PC-adjuvant vaccination on T cell proliferation. Our findings indicated that the PC-adjuvant vaccines notably enhanced the proliferation of antigen-stimulated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, outperforming alum in both the lungs and spleen 2 weeks after boost immunization (Fig. 2). Moreover, 7 days after influenza virus infection, PC showed increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations in both the spleen and lungs (Fig. 5a). These data suggest that PC-adjuvant vaccines have the potential to improve T cell immunity in split influenza vaccines. However, our data had limitations regarding antigen-specific T cell activation. Therefore, for further investigation, we plan to use tetramers to more thoroughly detect and identify antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with particular attention to the potential for bystander activation.Interestingly, we found differing patterns between the spleen and lungs in the memory T cell responses (Fig. 5a), which can be attributed to the distinct roles these organs play in the immune system and their involvement in local versus systemic immune responses. The lungs, as the primary site of infection in respiratory diseases like influenza, focused the immune response on local pathogen control 48,49. This was demonstrated by the recruitment and activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lungs, which were crucial for clearing the virus. Our data showed a relatively lower percentage of proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lungs compared to the spleen, likely because, by day 7 post-infection, the immune response in the lungs had begun to resolve. In contrast, the spleen, a key organ for systemic immune responses 50,51, exhibited a higher percentage of proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, reflecting its role in generating and maintaining memory immune cells that circulated throughout the body.Cytokine storms and cell infiltration are key features of lung inflammation following influenza virus infection28. In the vaccinated group, we observed a significant reduction in inflammatory cytokine levels and cellular infiltration in the lungs on day 7 after a challenge with a lethal dose of the virus, compared to the naïve infected group, which had elevated levels (Fig. 4). Mice vaccinated with the PC adjuvant demonstrated significantly better control over viral replication upon infection compared to unvaccinated controls. This was evident in several key outcomes, including the prevention of weight loss (Fig. 3a, b), significantly reduced viral load in the lungs (Fig. 3d), and a marked decrease in cytokine secretion and inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs (Fig. 4). This protective efficacy was not only superior to the non-immunized group but also highlighted the enhanced immune response provided by the PC adjuvant. The protective effects observed with the PC adjuvant are attributable to both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Specifically, the PC adjuvant induced elevated levels of antigen-specific IgG antibodies (Fig. 1), contributing to humoral immunity, and significantly enhanced the antigen-specific proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Figs. 2 and 5a), which play critical roles in cell-mediated immunity. Together, these immune mechanisms facilitated a more robust defense against the viral infection, demonstrating the PC adjuvant’s potential as an effective component in vaccine formulations.Alum is well known as a potent inducer of a Th2 immune response52. Interestingly, we observed a significantly increased number of eosinophils in the lungs of the alum-adjuvanted group at day 7 post-infection (Fig. 4). This can be attributed to alum’s role in enhancing the Th2 response during vaccination, which leads to elevated eosinophil production and their migration to the site of antigen exposure, such as the lungs53. Furthermore, this eosinophilic response is a hallmark of a Th2-skewed immune reaction, aligning with the expected immunological outcome when alum is used as an adjuvant54.Innate immune cells are indispensable for the host defense against infectious pathogens55,56. This protective function is initiated when the immune system detects pathogen-associated molecular patterns through pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs)57,58. These include toll-like receptors (TLRs), nod-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs)59. Among these, TLRs are the most well-characterized class of PRRs60,61. Ligation of specific ligands to TLRs, particularly on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells, induces APCs activation62. This activation event triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and primes naïve T cells, setting the stage for the initiation of the adaptive immune response63. We assessed the enhancement of the immune response mediated by PC via the TLR4 signaling pathway. Our data indicate that PC enhanced the expression of the costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86 on the surface of DCs (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, TLR4 signaling is known to skew towards Th1-type responses, typically characterized by increased production of IL-12p70 and IFN-α by APCs64. Consistent with this, our results demonstrated that PC treatment elevated IL-12p70 expression in DCs (Fig. 8a). Additionally, the expression of TLR4 in the spleen after boost vaccination in the PC-adjuvant group exhibited a higher level than the control group and showed the same level as the MPL-adjuvant group (Fig. 8b). This explains why PC-adjuvant mice showed heightened effectiveness in antigen-specific T cell responses induced by vaccination (Fig. 2).We used alum as the positive control for the immunization and challenge studies but switched to MPL for the DC and macrophage activation experiments (Fig. 8) due to their distinct immunological pathways. Alum has been used more than 80 years with human vaccines as an adjuvant due to its immune-stimulatory and safety profile. It was used as a comparable control for the immunization in our study to evaluate adjuvant effects of PC in inducing general antigen-specific immune responses. However, it does not engage TLR465,66, making it not suitable for assessing TLR-associated mechanisms of PC. Since PC is thought to enhance immune responses via TLR4, we chose MPL, a well-known TLR4 agonist, as a control for the DC and macrophage activation. This switch allowed for a more accurate evaluation of PC’s effects on TLR4-dependent immune responses, crucial for both innate and adaptive immunity. Our data show the PC-adjuvant vaccine enhanced immune responses via the TLR4 signaling pathway, and the activation of TLR4 effectively promoted both innate inflammatory responses and the induction of adaptive immunity. In this study, we utilized a total extract that likely contains multiple active compounds capable of engaging various PRR pathways, including TLR4. Although our primary focus was on the TLR4 pathway, we acknowledge that other PRRs may also be contributing to the observed immune response. In future studies, we plan to investigate the effects of the total PC extract and its individual compounds on distinct PRR pathways to better understand their specific impacts.An ideal adjuvant should not only potentiate a targeted immune response, but also exhibit a safety profile characterized by minimal side effects67. Conventional adjuvants, such as Freund’s Complete Adjuvant, QS21, and Quil A often show high inflammatory activity68,69. In the present study, we conducted toxicity assays in mice to evaluate the safety profile of PC. Throughout the experimental period, the mice exhibited no adverse behaviors, and there was no significant variation in body weight after vaccination (Supplementary Fig. 2). One objective of vaccine development is to minimize local inflammation at the injection site. Alum, MF59 (a squalene oil-in-water emulsion), and ASO4 (monophosphoryl lipid A and alum) have been employed as adjuvants in human vaccines; however, they can cause minor toxicities, leading to pain, redness, rash, swelling at the injection site, and even fever70,71,72. In this study, histological examination of the muscle containing the injection site revealed that the PC adjuvant elicited reduced inflammation at the injection site compared to the alum adjuvant (Fig. 7), corroborating findings from previous research73,74. These findings suggest that PC demonstrates a favorable safety profile as a potential adjuvant, serving as an initial step in evaluating its toxicity in vivo.Our study reveals the potential of PC, a marine alga extract, as an effective adjuvant for split influenza vaccines. Our investigation underscores the ability of PC to enhance both humoral- and cell-mediated immune responses against influenza. Notably, PC not only augmented the activation of DCs and macrophages but also demonstrated a favorable safety profile in toxicity tests. Compared with traditional adjuvants, such as alum, PC exhibited reduced local inflammatory responses. Modulation of the TLR4 signaling pathway further illuminates the mechanism underlying the enhanced efficacy of PC, providing pivotal insights into its role in bolstering both innate and adaptive immune responses. In future studies, we plan to incorporate a TLR4 genetic knockdown model and investigate downstream signaling events, such as NF-κB activation, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how PC interacts with TLR4 to enhance immune responses. Collectively, our findings indicate that PC is a promising adjuvant for the development of influenza vaccines.Materials and methodsAnimalsFemale BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old) were purchased from SamTako Bio Korea (Gyeonggi, Korea) and housed in an animal facility at the Jeju National University. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Jeju National University (protocol number: 2021-0051). All procedures involving animals were performed following the appropriate regulations and standards, and the reporting adhered to the ARRIVE guidelines.Chemicals and reagentsAn inactivated split A/PR8 vaccine (sPR8) was produced using the Influenza A virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 [A/PR8]. The A/PR8 virus was first grown in the allantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs, next inactivated with 1% neutral formalin overnight at 4 °C, then concentrated by ultracentrifugation (30,000 round per minute (rpm), 1 h). The resulting inactivated virus pellet (iPR8) was resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and treated with 1% Triton X-100 to break down the virus particles. After dialysis against PBS three times overnight to remove triton X-100 from the sPR8, the protein concentration of sPR8 was measured using the EZ-BCA protein quantification kit from DoGenBio (Seoul, Korea), and the vaccine was stored at -80 °C.PC extract was provided by the Marine Biobank in Korea (Chungcheongnam-do, Korea, http://www.mabik.re.kr). Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and alum were purchased from InvivoGen. All reagents were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Animal immunization and viral infectionBALB/c mice (N = 8/group) were intramuscularly injected with either the sPR8 vaccine alone (0.5 µg/mouse), or adjuvanted with alum (100 µg/mouse) or PC (200 µg/mouse) in 100 µL of PBS. The mice injected with PBS alone were used as controls. The immunization was administered twice—prime and boost—two weeks apart. Sera were collected 2 weeks after the prime vaccination and at 2, 4, 12, and 16-weeks post-boost. Sixteen weeks after booster immunization, the mice were intranasally challenged with a lethal dose (1 × LD50) of the A/PR8 virus. Following infection, four mice from each group were monitored daily for 14 days to examine weight loss and survival rates. The other four mice were sacrificed 7 days post-challenge, and lung and spleen tissues were collected for subsequent experiments.Memory B cell response assayTo investigate memory B cell and antibody-producing cell responses from the immunized mice, the cell culture plates were coated with 400 ng/well iPR8 overnight and blocked with 10% complete media (200 µL/well), which was RPMI media with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco), for 1 h at room temperature. The spleen and bone marrow cells from 7 days post-infection mice were harvested, seeded at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/mL onto the plates, and incubated at 37 °C for 7 days and 1 day, respectively. Antigen-specific antibodies produced by the cells were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulin IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibodies.ELISA for antibody, cytokine, and chemokine levelsTwo weeks after prime and boost immunizations, immune sera were collected, and the levels of antigen-specific antibodies were determined using ELISA. To perform the ELISA, inactivated A/PR8 virus (400 ng/well) was coated onto ELISA plates and then blocked using 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% TWEEN20 in PBS. The immune sera were serially diluted and added to ELISA plates, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies to detect antigen-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibodies. Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was used as the substrate, and the optical density was measured at 450 nm using an ELISA reader.To measure cytokine and chemokine in the lung extracts. Briefly, the lung tissues were homogenized in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Fisher Scientific, Corning, NY, USA) using a 70 μm cell strainer, centrifuged at 1500 round per minute (rpm) for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant was collected for ELISA analysis. Interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-1β and IL-12p40 ELISA kits (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and Interferon (IFN)-γ, and CCL2 ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were used according to the manufacturer guidelines.Lung viral titersSixteen weeks post-boost immunization, the mice were challenged with a lethal dose of the virus. Seven days after infection, lung tissues were collected from the challenged mice. These tissues were subsequently homogenized and centrifuged, and the resulting extracts were collected to assess the lung viral titer. The lung extracts were serially diluted and introduced into 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Following an incubation period of 3 days, the allantoic fluid was harvested and examined for hemagglutination activity. The Reed and Muench method75 was employed to calculate the concentration of infectious virus present in the lungs, expressed as the egg infectious dose 50 (EID50).Evaluation of lung histopathologyFor the histopathological analysis of the lung tissues after the lethal virus challenge, the left lower lobes were harvested from the mice at day 7 post infection. The tissue samples were preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin, prepared, and then encased in paraffin. Thin sections of 1 μm were made and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). These lung sections underwent a blind evaluation, receiving scores between 0 and 4 for both peribronchial infiltrates and alveolar involvement. This assessment was based on a previously established histological scoring system76.Preparation of single cell suspension from tissuesThe injected muscle tissues were processed and digested with Liberase TL as described in detail77. Briefly, skeletal muscle tissue from the site of vaccination was collected and digested with Liberase TL (0.25 mg/ml, Roche, Indianapolis, IN) plus DNase (0.25 mg/ml, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 37 °C for 2 h under agitation, and Liberase activity was inactivated with complete media; RPMI media with 10% heat-inactivated FBS; and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco). Muscle digestions were filtered through 40 nm cell strainers (SPL Life Sciences, Korea), washed with FACs buffer, and prepared for staining for flow cytometry.ILN, spleen, and lung tissues were cut by scissors and mechanically disrupted in 70 nm cell strainers using a plunger, centrifuged, and the pelleted cell blood was removed by ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysing buffer (Gibco) for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were filtered through 40 nm cell strainers, washed, and stained.DCs and macrophages activation in vivoCells from muscle and ILN were collected 3 days after boost vaccination with PBS (Control group), sPR8 (0.5 µg/mouse) alone, or in combination with PC (200 µg/mouse), or MPL (1 µg/mouse) through intramuscular injection. The mice were divided into four groups of three mice each. To analyze DCs and macrophage maturation, the cells were stained with CD11c-PE, CD11b-APC Cy7, MHC II-FITC, CD40-Qdot605, and CD86-APC. Stained cells were detected using FACs, and FlowJo (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR) was used for data analysis.The mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assayBALB/c mice (n = 3) were intramuscularly vaccinated with PBS (Control group), sPR8 (0.5 µg/mouse) alone, or in combination with PC (200 µg/mouse) or MPL (1 µg/mouse) through a prime-boost immunization regimen, with a 2-week interval between the prime and boost. Three days after the boost vaccination, dendritic cells (DCs) were isolated from the spleen using the EasySep™ Mouse Pan-DC Enrichment Kit II (STEMCELL Technologies, Canada) and co-cultured with CFSE-labeled naïve lymphocytes (LPC) from C57BL/6 mice. The lymphocytes were first stained with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE), and the CFSE-labeled lymphocytes (10⁶ cells/mL) were then co-cultured with DCs (10⁵ cells/mL) in a 96-well U-bottom plate. After 5 days of incubation, the cells were harvested, and T-cell proliferation was evaluated using flow cytometry.Inhibition experiments of TLR4 pathwayImmature DCs were prepared from bone marrow according to a previously reported method78. In brief, bone marrow from naïve BALB/c mice was isolated and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS, antibiotics, and 20 ng/mL of mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (mGM-CSF). After 6 days of culture, BM-DCs (1 × 106 cell/mL) were seeded in six-well plates (3 mL/well) and then treated with various concentrations of PC (4, 20, 100 µg/mL) for 12 h after the pre-treatment with 1 µM TAK-242 (TLR4 signaling inhibitor, CALBIOCHEM, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) for 1 h at 37 °C. In the positive control, 0.1 µg/mL MPL was added. The expression levels of CD86, CD40, and MHC II were analyzed using flow cytometry. ELISA detected the yield of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12p40, and IL-12p70.Flow cytometrySixteen weeks post-boost immunization, the mice were challenged with a lethal virus. At day 7 post-infection, lung samples were collected to examine inflammatory cell infiltration. Single cells were extracted from lung samples and stained with specific antibodies for markers, including anti-mouse CD45 (clone 30-F11), anti-mouse F4/80 (clone BM8), anti-mouse MHC II (clone M5/114.15.2), anti-mouse CD11c (clone N418), anti-mouse CD11b (clone M1/70), anti-mouse CD170 (Siglec-F) (clone S17007L), anti-mouse Ly6c (clone AL-21) antibodies and LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Aqua Dead Cell (Invitrogen™). First, lung cells were washed with FACs buffer (1x PBS contaning 2% FBS), and Fc receptors on their surfaces were blocked using anti-CD16/32 antibodies (Biosciences). Next, the antibody cocktail was added to the cells and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing, the stained cells were acquired using a High-end Performance Flow Cytometer, Beckman CytoFLEX, USA in the Bio-Health Materials Core Facility, Jeju National University. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo, and the phenotype of inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs was determined using the gating strategies outlined in Supplementary Fig. S3.Western blot analysisTotal proteins were isolated from spleen tissues 3 days post-boost vaccination using RIPA protein lysis buffer (Biosesang, Korea) mixed with Xpert Duo Inhibitor Cocktail solution (100:1; GeDEPOT, Korea). Three mice from each group were used for the western blot analysis.The total protein concentration was quantified using the EZ-BCA protein quantification kit (DoGenBio, Seoul, Korea). The proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Transferred membranes were blocked using 5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-mouse TLR4 antibody (1:1,000, Santa Cruz, CA). The same membrane was probed with anti-β-actin (1:1,000; Santa Cruz, CA) as house-keeping protein. Next, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) at room temperature for 1 h after washing with TBST three times. Finally, the blots were developed using an EZ-Western Lumi Pico alpha kit (DoGenBio, Seoul, Korea).Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using one-way or two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test at P < 0.05. All data are presented as means ± standard error with individual dots. GraphPad Prism software version 9.2.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) was used to analyze all data.

The influenza A H1N1 virus is a member of the family Orthomyxoviridae (a group of RNA viruses). Type A is one of the three major types of influenza viruses (the other two being types B and C). Type A is divided into subtypes, which are differentiated mainly on the basis of two surface antigens (foreign proteins)—hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Therefore, H1N1 represents a subtype of influenza A. This subtype is further differentiated into strains based on minor variations in RNA sequence.Influenza A H1N1 is subject to antigenic drift—constant, rapid viral evolution driven by mutations in the genes that encode the H and N antigen proteins. Antigenic drift produces new strains of H1N1. Viral evolution is facilitated by animals such as pigs and birds, which serve as reservoirs of various subtypes and strains of influenza A viruses. When a pig is simultaneously infected with different influenza A viruses, such as human, swine, and avian strains, genetic reassortment can occur. Reassortment represents another process by which new strains of influenza A H1N1 can be generated.Strains of the H1N1 influenza subtype circulate constantly in human populations worldwide and thus are continually evolving and evading the human immune system. As a result, H1N1 is a major cause of seasonal influenza, which affects approximately 15 percent of the global population annually. In addition, since the early 20th century, H1N1 has caused several major epidemics and pandemics. The influenza pandemic of 1918–19, the most destructive influenza outbreak in history and one of the most severe disease pandemics ever encountered, was caused by an H1N1 virus. This outbreak is estimated to have killed some 25 million people. Other notable H1N1 outbreaks occurred in 1977 and in 2009. The 1977 H1N1 virus emerged in China and then spread worldwide. This particular outbreak primarily affected individuals born after the late 1950s. Older persons were believed to carry antibodies against a nearly identical H1N1 virus that had circulated in the 1950s; these antibodies appeared to cross-react to antigens on the 1977 virus, thereby providing immunity against the new strain. The 2009 H1N1 virus, called swine flu because the virus likely originated in pigs and contained genes from multiple strains of swine influenza viruses, first broke out in Mexico and subsequently spread to the United States and other countries around the world. In addition to the genes from different swine influenza viruses, the H1N1 virus that caused the outbreak was found to contain genetic material from human and avian influenza viruses as well. Thus, the virus is believed to have evolved through genetic reassortment that was presumed to have occurred in pigs.

We have found that IBV infection resulted in a weaker innate and adaptive immune response than influenza A viruses (IAV) in ferrets. To understand and overcome the weak immune responses to IBV in ferrets, we administered type-I or type-III interferon (IFN) to ferrets following infection or vaccination and evaluated their effects on the immune response. IFN signaling following viral infection plays an important role in the initial innate immune response and affects subsequent adaptive immune responses. In the respiratory tract, IFN lambda (IFNL) has regulatory effects on adaptive immunity indirectly through thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which then acts on immune cells to stimulate the adaptive response. Following IBV infection or vaccination, IFN treatment (IFN-Tx) upregulated gene expression of early inflammatory responses in the upper respiratory tract and robust IFN, TSLP, and inflammatory responses in peripheral blood cells. These responses were sustained following challenge or vaccination in IFN-Tx animals. Serum IFNL and TSLP levels were enhanced in IFN-Tx animals following challengeechallenge over mock-Tx; however, this difference was not observed following vaccination. Antibody responses in serum of IFN-Tx animals following IBV infection or vaccination increased more quickly and to higher titers and were sustained longer than mock-Tx animals over 3 months. Following rechallenge of infected animals 3 months post treatment, antibody levels remained higher than mock-Tx. However, IFN-Tx did not have an effect on antibody responses following challenge of vaccinated animals. A strong direct correlation was found between TSLP levels and antibody responses following challenge-rechallenge and vaccination-challenge indicating it as a useful tool for predicting adaptive immune responses following IBV infection or vaccination. The effects of IFN on strengthening both innate and adaptive responses to IBV may aid in development of more effective treatments following infection and improved influenza vaccines.

Even though IBV co-circulate with IAV, much less is known about the innate and adaptive responses following IBV infection and vaccination2,3. IBV are not divided into subtypes as IAV, but instead are classified into two antigenically distinct lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria4. Some differences between IBV demographics in humans indicate that patients with Victoria lineage are generally younger (0–4 years, 60% versus 40% in adults; 5–14 years, 72% versus 28% in adults) compared to patients infected with Yamagata lineage; however, clinical presentation is equal5. The average vaccine effectiveness for IBV is 54%6, however, during the 2014/2015 influenza season vaccine, it was 57%. During this period fewer than 20% of older children (9–17 years) had a 4-fold rise in antibody titer to the IBV component following vaccination7.Ferrets are the primary animal model for influenza research and vaccine studies8,9,10,11. Therefore, ferrets were either vaccinated or infected with IBV to assess immune responses. In studies comparing multiple circulating IAV and IBV strains in ferrets, IBV induced weaker immune responses even though IBV strains replicated as well as IAV strains in the upper respiratory tract (URT)12,13. In addition, live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccines elicited weaker antibodies generated to the IBV components (B-Victoria and B-Yamagata) than to the IAV components (A/H1N1pdm09 and A/H3N2)14.Following infection of respiratory epithelial cells, influenza viruses are recognized by the innate immune system using pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of which three classes of PRRs can recognize influenza virus infection and initiate an inflammatory response. The PRRs that recognize and activate innate signaling pathways to IAV include the toll-like receptors (TLRs), nod-like receptors and Retinoic acid Induced Gene 1 like receptor (RIG-I)15. TLR-3 is expressed in endosomes and recognizes viral double-stranded RNA which is produced during viral replication, while endosomal TLR-7 and cytoplasmic RIG-I recognize single-stranded RNA. These PAMP-PRR interactions lead to activation of several signaling pathways and to the production of type I and type-III interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory cytokines16. IFN signaling rapidly promotes an antiviral state by inducing IFN-stimulating genes to limit viral replication and spread and induces immune responses in neighboring cells to protect them from infection17. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of IAV is able to avoid the IFN response. NS1 has shown to be an IFN-antagonist to dampen host IFN response and facilitate virus replication18. In general, viruses avoid elements of the innate immune response, such as the IFN response, thereby allowing for increased virus replication and spread before the initiation of the adaptive immune response. The IAV NS1 inhibits type-I IFN release and can also inhibit dendritic cell (DC) maturation and function, which is important in adaptive immune responses19. Type-III IFN lambda (IFNL) can recruit DCs, regulate IL-10 production, and enhance type-I helper T cell responses20. IFNL is non-inflammatory and primarily activated in the mucosal tract and does not have the inflammatory effects seen with type-I IFNs. IFNL acts indirectly on DCs through the induction of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in the respiratory tract21, thus inducing a mucosal immune response. Upon induction TSLP regulates germinal center function and antigen-specific antibody responses22, thus having an important effect on the magnitude of the adaptive immune response.Infection with IBV results in a delay in both innate and antibody responses in ferrets compared to IAV infection13. In this study, IFN was examined as an immunoadjuvant to enhance the immune responses in infected or vaccinated animals and assess protection following rechallenge with influenza. We used PEGylated ferret IFNs as potential immunoadjuvants following IBV infection or vaccination. Effects of IFNs as an alternative method to stimulate robust immune responses may be important to understanding reduced immune responses following IBV infection as well as a way to improve vaccine efficacy.MethodsInterferon PEGylation and testingPolyethylene glycol (PEG) attachment to molecules, PEGylation, is considered one of the most successful techniques to enhance the therapeutic and biotechnological potential of peptides and proteins23,24,25. Recombinant ferret type-I interferon alpha (IFNA) and type-III interferon lambda 3 (IFNL3) were purchased from Kingfisher Biotech, Inc. (Saint Paul, MN, USA). IFNA and IFNL3 were PEGylated with Hydroxyl-PEG-NHS ester 5000Da (HO-PEG5K-NHS; PEG5K; Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA) and m-PEG-Lys-NHS ester 20000Da (mPEG-Lys-NHS 20000; PEG20K; BroadPharm, San Diego, CA, USA). One microgram per microliter solutions of IFNA and IFNL3 were prepared in 100 mM pH 7.2 sodium phosphate buffer. Fifteen-fold molar excess of PEGs over the molar concentration of proteins were added to protein solutions. PEGs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The DMSO volume did not exceed 20% of total reaction volume. The mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. One microgram aliquots of each sample were taken and electrophoresed on 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels and stained with Imperial Protein Stain to determine the extent of protein modification. Activity of PEGylated-IFNs was determined using an IFN bioassay. The modified proteins were stored at −80 °C prior to use in animal experiments.VirusesInfluenza B-Yamagata lineage virus (B/Phuket/3073/2013, “PH”) was used for infection and vaccination studies. For infection studies PH was passaged in Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, to retain antigenic similarity to the original human isolate and to avoid structural changes in the hemagglutinin which could occur from passage in eggs26,27,28. The virus was passaged in MDCK cells “C#” according to established procedures29. PH passage C4 was used for all challenge and rechallenge experiments. For the vaccine study, live-attenuated influenza virus B-Yamagata lineage strain B/Phuket/3073/2013-CDC-LV11B (LAIV) was developed according to established procedures30 and passaged in embryonated chicken eggs29. All Viral titers, challengeechallenge and vaccine strain, were determined by focus-forming assay (FFA) and given as log focus forming units per milliliter (FFU/mL). Viral titers for challengeechallenge virus (PH) and vaccine strain (LAIV) used in this study were 107.54 FFU/mL and 108.93 FFU/mL respectively.Ferrets and study designAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International accredited facility. Male fitch ferrets (Triple F Farms, Sayre, PA), between 1.2 and 2 years of age and seronegative for currently circulating influenza viruses were used for all experiments.A pilot experiment (Experiment A) to determine the optimal time of addition of interferon followed by two separate experiments were conducted using 18 ferrets for each: (B) challenge-rechallenge experiment and (C) vaccination-challenge experiment (Table 1).Table 1 Pilot study—timing of PEGylated-IFN administrationFull size tablePegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) time of addition—pilot studyIn this pilot study, we performed a small study of 2 ferrets/group to determine the optimal time of addition of PEGylated-IFN so as to not affect virus replication. All ferrets (N = 15) were challenged intranasally with 4 × 105 FFU of B/Phuket/3073/2013 and treated intranasally with PEG-IFN or PEG-IFNL at 8 h, 24 h or 48 h post challenge (N = 2 ferrets/group). An untreated (Mock) group (N = 3 ferrets) was included as a mock control as a baseline group. Nasal wash (NW) samples were collected prechallenge and Days 1, 3, 5, and 7 post challenge and assessed for viral load by FFA.Prior to challenge, the ferrets were first anesthetized with an intramuscular cocktail of ketamine (15–30 mG/kG) plus xylazine (1–2 mG/kG) “KX” and challenged intranasally with 1 mL of virus (4 × 105 FFU/mL) or PBS. At various timepoints post challenge, ferrets were anesthetized and 1 μG/kG PEGylated-IFN (IFNA or IFNL) was introduced intranasally to the appropriate groups.Challenge-rechallenge studyIn this study, we chose a representative virus (B/Phuket/3073/2013, “PH”), which in previous experiments typified the delayed and low immune responses of IBVs, for a challengeechallenge study. Six groups of three ferrets per group were used: Mock-challenged/mock-treated (UN-MOCK), mock-challenged/IFNA-treated (UN-IFNA), mock-challenged/IFNL3-treated (UN-IFNL), PH-challenged/mock-treated (PH-MOCK), PH-challenged/IFNA-treated (PH-IFNA), and PH-challenged/IFNL3-treated (PH-IFNL). The ferrets were first anesthetized with an intramuscular cocktail of ketamine (15–30 mG/kG) plus xylazine (1–2 mG/kG) “KX” and challenged intranasally with 1 mL of virus (4 × 105 FFU/mL) or PBS. Twenty-four hours post-challenge ferrets were anesthetized and 1 μG/kG PEGylated-IFN (IFNA or IFNL) or PBS was introduced intranasally to the appropriate groups. The animals were monitored over 28 days post challenge for weight loss, fever, and other clinical signs (lethargy, sneezing, and dyspnea) of infection. The animals were weighed on day 0 prior to PH challenge to establish a baseline weight and then daily for the first 10 days post challenge followed by weekly thereafter through day 28. Changes in weight were calculated as percentage loss or gain from day 0 weight. For fever calculation, a temperature transponder [IPTT-300; Bio Medic Data Systems (BMDS), Waterford, WI, USA] was programmed to identify each ferret and implanted subcutaneously between the shoulder blades of each animal and read with a scanner (DAS-6007 IPTT Scanner System, BMDS). A baseline temperature (°F) was determined by the average temperature over 3 days prior to challenge. Temperatures were assessed over the first 10 days post challenge, then weekly and fever was determined as any temperature greater or equal to 2 °F above baseline. Ferrets were assessed daily for clinical signs within a 2-h window between 9 AM and 11 AM during peak normal activity and to reduce variation due to circadian rhythms31. Lethargy was determined by the relative inactivity index (RII) from day 0 through day 7 post challenge; this period allowed for lethargy calculation throughout the period of active replication in the ferret respiratory tract. RII, sneezing and dyspnea were assessed each day prior to handling and sedation of the animals. Clinical signs assessment was consistent with previously established methods32,33. Ferrets were monitored for 12 weeks post challenge and either challenged (UN-MOCK, UN-IFNA, and UN-IFNL groups) or rechallenged (PH-MOCK, PH-IFNA, and PH-IFNL groups) intranasally with 1 mL PH (4 × 105 FFU/mL). Ferrets were monitored for 7 days post challengeechallenge as listed above. Study design illustrated in Table 1B.Vaccination-challenge studyThe live-attenuated B-Yamagata lineage strain B/Phuket/3073/2013-CDC-LV11B (LAIV) was used as the vaccine for this study. Six groups of three ferrets per group were used for the vaccination-challenge study: Mock-vaccinated/mock-treated (UN-MOCK), mock-vaccinated/IFNA-treated (UN-IFNA), mock-vaccinated/IFNL3-treated (UN-IFNL), vaccinated/mock-treated (LAIV-MOCK), vaccinated/IFNA-treated (LAIV-IFNA), and vaccinated/IFNL3-treated (LAIV-IFNL). The ferrets were first anesthetized with KX and vaccinated intranasally with 1 mL LAIV (4 × 105 FFU/mL) or PBS. Twenty-four hours post-vaccination ferrets were anesthetized and 1 μG/kG PEGylated-IFN (IFNA or IFNL) or PBS was introduced intranasally to the appropriate groups. Animals were monitored as in challenge-rechallenge study. At 12 weeks post vaccination, all animals were challenged intranasally with 1 mL PH (4 × 105 FFU/mL). Ferrets were monitored for 7 days post challenge as described previously. Study design illustrated in Table 1C.Ferret sample collection and processingPre-challenge and on days (D) 1, 3, 5, and 7 post challenge or vaccination, NW was collected from ferrets for virologic and gene expression. Additional NW samples (D0, D1, D3, D5, and D7) were collected after 3 months for the challenge-rechallenge study or the vaccination-challenge study. These collection timepoints correspond to typical viral kinetics observed in the URT of ferrets infected with seasonal influenza viruses34,35. Animals were sedated with KX followed by flushing the nares by instillation of 2 mL NW solution (PBS, 1% BSA, antibiotics), inside a class-II biosafety cabinet, and collected when expelled in a Petri dish. NW was centrifuged (5 min, 2500 × g at 4 °C), supernatant was stored at −80 °C for virus titration. One hundred microliters (μL) PBS was added to NW pellets followed by 280 μL of AVL lysis buffer. Samples were mixed 3–4 times and lysate was frozen at −80 °C until RNA extraction. Carrier RNA was added to each sample and RNA was extracted using EZ1 DSP kit on a Qiagen EZ1 Advanced XL extractor according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). RNA was eluted in 120 μL RNase-free water and stored at −80 °C until evaluated for gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).Blood samples were collected for gene expression (pre-challenge, D3 and D5; re-challenge D0, D1, D3, and D5) and antibody/cytokine analysis (Pre-challenge, weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and D7 post-rechallenge). Blood was collected from the cranial vena cava and transferred to an SST tube (serum for antibody and cytokine analysis) and a K2/EDTA tube (cells for gene expression). Serum was separated from SST tubes by centrifugation for 10 min at 1500 × g at room temperature. For purification of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), an equal volume of PBS was added to blood in K2/EDTA tubes and overlayed onto Histopaque®-1077 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Samples were centrifuged with no brake at 900 × g for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were collected from the Histopaque® interface, washed with cell culture media (RPMI-1640, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS)) and treated with ammonium chloride to lyse any remaining red blood cells. The final cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL cell culture medium. Two hundred eighty microliters of AVL lysis buffer was added to 200 μL PBMC samples in cell culture medium obtained by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque. Samples were mixed 3–4 times and lysate was frozen at −80 °C until RNA extraction. Carrier RNA was added to each sample and RNA was extracted using EZ1 DSP kit on a Qiagen EZ1 Advanced XL extractor according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). RNA was eluted in 120 μL RNase-free water and stored at −80 °C until evaluated for gene expression by qRT-PCR. The remaining PBMC sample was cryopreserved in FBS, 10% DMSO and stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen.Virus kinetics assessment by focus forming assayNW samples collected from influenza virus-infected and vaccinated ferrets were tested for virus with an FFA, as previously described36. Briefly, ½-log serially diluted influenza viruses in virus growth medium plus trypsin (DMEM, 0.1% BSA, 1 μG/mL TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA)) were added to confluent monolayers of MDCK-SIAT1 cells37 in 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates in quadruplicate. Following a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, and overlay of 1.2% Avicel RC/CL38 (Type: RC581 NF; FMC Health and Nutrition, Philadelphia, PA, USA) in 2X MEM containing 1 μG/mL TPCK-treated trypsin, 0.1% BSA, and antibiotics] was added. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2, fixed, permeabilized, and stained with a monoclonal antibody pool to influenza B nucleoprotein (International Reagent Resource; www.internationalreagentresource.org). Infectious foci (spots) were visualized using TrueBlue substrate (Sera Care, Inc., Milford, MA, USA). The foci enumerated using a CTL Bio Spot Analyser with ImmunoCapture 6.4.87 software (CTL, Shaker Heights, OH, USA). The FFA titer was determined by multiplying sample dilution which gave between one hundred and three hundred spots by the spot number at that dilution, to obtain the Focus Forming Units per milliliter (FFU/mL). The foci in the cell control (CC) were subtracted and number of foci remaining was multiplied by twenty to give FFU/mL. The limit of detection was 101.3 FFU/mL.Neutralizing antibody responses by focus reduction assayThe focus reduction assay (FRA), initially developed by the WHO Collaborating Centre in London, United Kingdom, was modified and utilized in this study as previously described13. Two-fold serially diluted Receptor Destroying Enzyme—treated sera29 from vaccinated or infected ferrets was added to 96-well plates containing confluent MDCK-SIAT1 cells37. Afterwards, standardized B/Phuket/3073/2013 virus was added to each plate or media to CC wells. The virus was standardized by FFA36 to determine the FFU/mL. Following a 2 h incubation, an overlay containing Avicel38 and 1 μG/mL TPCK-treated trypsin, 0.1% BSA, and antibiotics was added to each well. Plates were incubated for overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The overlays were removed, washed with PBS, fixed with ice-cold 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS (10% formalin), and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS/glycine. An incubation with primary antibody pool against influenza B nucleoprotein39 (www.internationalreagentresource.org) was performed, washed, followed by an incubation with secondary goat anti-mouse peroxidase-labeled IgG (Sera Care, Inc., Milford, MA, USA). Plates were washed and infectious foci (spots) were visualized using TrueBlue substrate (Sera Care, Inc., Milford, MA, USA) containing 0.03% H2O2. Plates were rinsed with deionized water, dried, and foci enumerated using a CTL Bio Spot Analyser with ImmunoCapture 6.4.87 software (Cellular Technology Ltd., Shaker Heights, OH, USA). The FRA titer was reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum corresponding to 50% foci reduction compared to the virus control (VC) minus the CC.Gene expression in ferret cellsFerret primers generated to pro-inflammatory (MCP1, IL-1B, and IL-6), TH1 (CXCL10), TH2 directed (IL-2), T-regulatory (TGFB1), T-effector (IL-4, IL-12p40, and IL-17), apoptosis (Granzyme A), Type-I/II/III interferons (IFNA, IFNB, IFNG, and IFNL3), interferon responses (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, RIG-I, SOCS3, and TSLP) and housekeeping (GAPDH) genes were used. For genes using TaqMan, probes were modified with 6-FAM, fluorescein amidites (FAM) fluorophore on the 5′ end and a non-fluorescent Black Hole Quencher®-1 (BHQ-1) on the 3′ end. Additionally, a locked nucleic acid at adenine <LNA A> was incorporated in all probes in order to increase template binding strength for real-time PCR40. Primers and probes for all ferret genes were generated from published ferret sequences36,41,42,43. All primers and probes used in these experiments were generated in a previous study36; listed in Supplementary Table S1.qRT-PCR was performed using an ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). PCR reactions were performed in a 5 μL RNA reaction volume using SYBR™GreenER™ qPCR SuperMix (Applied Biosystems) or SuperScript™ III Platinum™ One-Step qRT-PCR Kit for TaqMan reactions (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA). An RT reaction for 30 min at 50 °C, inactivation for 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 amplification cycles at an annealing temperature of 50 °C. Reactions were performed on three ferrets for each virus and timepoint and the values were normalized by subtracting the mean value of the cycle threshold (CT) from that of the CT for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) housekeeping gene (ΔCT). The relative levels of gene expression for infected cells were determined by subtracting the individual ΔCT values from that of average ΔCT values of pre-infection cells (ΔΔCT) and expressing the final quantification values (2−ΔΔCT) as relative fold changes. Genes upregulated >104-fold (>10,000) were given a value of 10,000 and genes downregulated <10−4-fold (<0.0001) were given a value of 0.0001.Assessment of cytokines and chemokines in ferret seraSera were collected from ferrets on day 0 (pre-challenge/vaccination) and weekly (1, 2, 4, 8, and 12) post challenge/vaccination as well as one week following 3-month re-challenge, challenge, or vaccination (R7). Samples were stored at −80 °C until testing by multiplex, bioassay, or ELISA as described below. All cytokine/chemokine values were normalized to pre-challenge/vaccination (day 0) to account for basal levels of each analyte and to observe effects of IBV and adjuvants.Type-I/II IFN (IFNB and IFNG), TH1/TH2 (IP-10 and IL-2), pro-inflammatory (MCP-1, MIP-1B, TNFA, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-23) and T-effector (IL-4, IL-17, IL-12p40, and IL-12p70) levels in ferret sera were tested using a multiplex Luminex Assay kit [Ampersand Biosciences (www.ampersandbio.com) Lake Clear, NY, USA] containing ferret-specific antibodies and proteins in a microsphere-based assay and consisting of antigen-specific antibodies covalently coupled to magnetic Luminex beads and biotinylated detection antibodies in a capture-sandwich format as previously described36.The assay was analyzed using a Luminex 200 Analyzer [Luminex Corporation (www.luminexcorp.com), Austin, TX, USA]. The cytokine/chemokine results were determined by extrapolating the analyte concentration from the measured mean fluorescence intensity value using the standard curve. Results were generated and extracted using the RBM Plate Reader and Plate Viewer analysis software, respectively. The limit of detection was 10 pg/mL. Data were exported with values represented to two significant figures and analyzed in GraphPad Prism 10 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).Ferret Type-III IFN (IFNL) was detected in serum using a HEK-Lambda reporter cell assay (HEK-Blue™ cells, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) and calculated from a standard curve using recombinant ferret IFNL3 [Kingfisher Biotech (www.kingfisherbiotech.com), St. Paul, MN, USA]. This assay was modified and tested for detection of ferret IFNL36. The limit of detection was 100 pg/mL.TSLP was detected in ferret sera using a commercially available human TSLP Quantikine® ELISA Kit [R&D Systems (www.rndsytems.com), Minneapolis, MN, USA] according to manufacturer’s instructions. The limit of detection was 10 pg/mL. Ferret TSLP protein sequence available (NCBI BLAST Accession number XP_044943037.1) showed a 62.7% sequence homology to human TSLP protein (NCBI BLAST Accession number AAH40592.1); however, the homology may be greater since the ferret sequence was of low quality.Statistical analysisGraphPad Prism 10 was used for all statistical analyses (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). One-way ANOVA was used to determine differences over time between groups and significance between groups was determined by 2-way ANOVA analysis. Gene expression analysis was performed from three ferrets per group. Spearman (1-tailed, 95% confidence) correlation method used for comparison of protein concentration (multiplex, bioassay, or ELISA) and antibody levels (FRA) for each treatment group to observe an increase or decrease in association. Multiple student’s t tests were used to assess the statistical differences between timepoints and treatment groups. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.ResultsVirus replication kinetics is affected by timing of PEGylated-IFN administration following IBV infection in ferretsRecombinant ferret IFNA and IFNL3 were PEGylated and used as immunoadjuvants in challenge-rechallenge and vaccination-challenge studies. PEGylation of the proteins was successful as demonstrated by bonding patterns of PEG to ferret IFNs, as visualized by imperial and silver staining, and retained activity following storage at 4 °C or freezehaw following storage at −80 °C (Supplementary Fig. 1). Even though PEG-IFNL3 activity was determined (Supplementary Fig. 1D), PEG-IFNA activity could not be determined using HEK-Blue™ Type I interferon reporter cells in a bioassay due to inability to detect Type I ferret IFN, as well as cross-reactivity of type-III IFNs in the assay (Supplementary Fig. 1C).A preliminary study was performed to determine the optimal time to add PEG-IFN post IBV challenge, 12 adult ferrets were intranasally challenged with PH followed by intranasal treatment with PEGylated-IFNA or -IFNL at 8 h, 24 h, or 48 h post-infection. Administration of IFNA at 8 h post infection resulted in a significant reduction in influenza virus kinetics compared to addition at 24 h (p = 0.047) or 48 h (p = 0.0154) post-infection (Fig. 1). Significant differences in virus titers were also observed at 48 h after IFNA and IFNL addition following IBV infection (p = 0.013). Overall, administration of IFNs at 24 h post-infection was the optimal time to treat ferrets and minimize the effects on virus replication (Tables 2 and 3).Fig. 1: PEGylated IFN optimal time of addition following IBV challenge.Kinetics of virus replication following IBV challenge and addition of PEGylated IFN. PEGylated IFNA added at 8 h (IFNA-8), 24 h (IFNA-24), or 48 h (IFNA-48) post B/Phuket/3073/2013 challenge and compared to Mock treated group. PEGylated IFNL3 added at 8 h (IFNL-8), 24 h (IFNL-24) or 48 h (IFNL-48) post challenge. NW titers determined on D1, D3, D5, and D7 post challenge (bar color indicating time of NW collection) and tested for virus Log FFU/mL by FFA. Significance between groups tested by 2-way ANOVA. Significant differences between IFNA-8 and IFNA-24 (p = 0.0470) and IFNA-8 to IFNA-48 (p = 0.0154) as well as IFNA-48 to IFNL-48 (p = 0.0130). No significant differences noted between any groups with IFN added at 24 h and no significance compared to Mock-treated group.Full size imageTable 2 Challenge-rechallenge studyFull size tableTable 3 Vaccination-challenge studyFull size tableIFN treatment reduced morbidity in ferrets following IBV challenge and re-challengeThe addition of PEGylated-IFN as an immunoadjuvant following influenza virus infection stimulates both innate and adaptive immune responses. IFN-treated ferrets showed reduced clinical signs (RII and or detectable virus in the URT over 7 days of observation (Table 4A). Three months post challenge, animals were either rechallenged (PH groups) or challenged (UN groups) with PH and assessed for 7 days (Table 4B). The mock-challenged animals (UN-MOCK/IFNA/IFNL) did not have any detectable lethargy, fever, or weight loss, regardless of treatment. Following virus challenge, IFN (PH-MOCK) had signs of severe morbidity. The untreated ferrets were lethargic (RII = 1.18) compared to IFNA-treated (RII = 1.14) and IFNL-treated (RII = 1.01) ferrets. Additionally, PH-MOCK ferrets were observed sneezing on D2 and D3 post challenge. However, although PH-IFNL-treated ferrets had no observable clinical signs (RII = 1.01), both the IFNL- and mock-treated ferrets developed fever at D2 post-challenge. Additionally, the IFNL-treated ferrets had the greatest weight loss (3.2%) post-challenge, even though the animal activity was normal. Interestingly, no fever was observed in the IFNA-treated animals. Following challenge, IFNA-treated ferrets had significantly higher viral NW titers in the URT than un-treated ferrets (p = 0.0223). In contrast, there was no significant difference in viral titers between PEG-IFNA and PEG-IFNL-treated animals (Table 4A). Following rechallenge there were no significant differences in viral titers between ferrets any group (Table 4B). Ferrets, previously treated with IFNs, and subsequently challenged had no differences in observed clinical signs, except in MOCK-treated ferrets that had fever (Table 4B; UN-Tx groups). Both untreated (UN-MOCK) and IFNA treated (UN-IFNA) developed fever on D2, however, no fever was observed following IFNL treatment (UN-IFNL) (Supplementary Fig. 2A–D). Taken together, IFN-treated ferrets had overall fewer signs of lethargy and had more rapid recovery from infection than untreated animals.Table 4 Clinical signs and virus replication in IFN-treated ferrets following IBV challenge-rechallengeFull size tableIFN treatment induced an early inflammatory response in ferret URT and a robust, sustained IFN and inflammatory responses in PBMC following IBV challengeDifferential gene expression by qRT-PCR was performed on cells of the URT (NW cells) and PBMC following IBV challenge and treatment with IFNs (Fig. 2). For samples collected from the URT following challenge or rechallenge, all groups showed high levels of TH1 (CXCL10) gene expression following challenge; however, only Mock and IFNL treated animals showed upregulation following rechallenge. Interestingly, following rechallenge, Mock treated animals had the highest gene expression of interferon response (SOCS3) early on D1 and D3 whereas IFNL treated animals demonstrated later late expression on D5. Only IFNL treated animals showed and upregulation of IFNL3 gene expression following rechallenge (Fig. 2A). No detectable IFN genes (IFNA, IFNB, IFNG, and IFNL3) were upregulated in any ferrets in the URT at D3 or D5 post-challenge. Concurrently, SOCS3 was upregulated in all ferrets. Upon rechallenge at 3 months an early upregulation of TH1 (CXCL10), TH2-directed response44 (IL-2), T-effector (IL-17), apoptosis (Granzyme A), pro-inflammatory (IL-1B), and IFN (IFNL3) genes was detected in IFN-treated ferrets and was sustained through D5 post rechallenge. IFNL-treated ferrets had, in general, strong upregulation of all genes examined following rechallenge.Fig. 2: Gene expression in IFN-treated ferret URT and PBMC following IBV challenge-rechallenge.Heatmap of average fold gene expression in IBV-challenged and re-challenged ferrets following IFN-treatment.

B Average fold gene expression in PBMC following IBV challenge (Dx) or re-challenge (DxR).Full size imageThere was upregulation of type-I/II IFNs at D3 and type-I/II/III IFNs at D5 in PBMC collected from IFN-treated ferrets (Fig. 2B). Type-I IFN expression levels at D3 and D5 were lower in mock-treated ferrets. There were equal levels of type-II IFN at D3 and type-III IFN at D5 in IFNL-treated animals. For inflammatory (MCP-1) and pro-inflammatory (IL-1B) genes, the responses were upregulated early (D3) in IFN-treated ferrets and peaked late (D5) in mock-treated ferrets. Following rechallenge at 3 months post-treatment, inflammatory, TH1, TH2 directed, IFN, and TSLP genes were all upregulated early (D1) in IFN-treated ferrets and sustained through D5. In contrast, upregulation of the same responses in mock-treated ferrets occurred at (D3), which was only transiently expressed and down-regulated by D5. IFN (IFNL3) gene was only upregulated at D5 (1.3-fold) in mock-treated ferrets. IFN-treated ferrets had the highest overall gene upregulation post challenge and D3/D5 post rechallenge. This overall expression was sustained following rechallenge in IFN-treated ferrets, whereas in mock-treated ferrets, overall gene expression was only transiently upregulated (D3) following rechallenge.Serum cytokines and chemokines levels are elevated in IBV-infected ferrets following IFN treatmentFerrets challenged with IBV or treated with IFNA or IFNL had elevated serum cytokine and chemokine levels (Fig. 3). Type-III IFN (IFNL) levels were significantly higher in IFNL-treated animals following IBV challenge. Concurrently, TSLP was also significantly higher in IFN-L-treated animals. Type-I and Type-II IFNs were higher following IFN-treatment; however, they were not significantly different from mock-treated (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3: Cytokine and chemokine levels in sera of IFN-treated ferrets following IBV challenge.Serum cytokine and chemokine levels in IBV-infected ferrets following IFN-treatment.

Average range ±SD of cytokines are presented over 12 weeks post challenge/mock-challenge with average indicated by black line within each bar. Average pG/mL levels of analytes are shown from the following functional groups: A Interferon responses. Type-I (IFNB), Type-II (IFNG) and Type-III* (IFNL) and Type-III IFN response cytokine (TSLP). B TH1 (IP-10) and TH2 (IL-2) directed responses. C Pro-inflammatory chemokines (MCP-1 and MIP-1B). D T-effector response (IL-4, IL-17, IL-12p40 & IL-12p70). E Pro-inflammatory cytokine response (TNFA, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-23). Significant differences indicated between each group by 2-way ANOVA.Full size imageTH1 response (IP-10), TH2 directed response (IL-2) and chemokines (MCP-1 and MIP1B) were also elevated in IFN-treated ferrets compared to untreated animals (Fig. 3B). However, TH1 (IP-10) levels were highest in untreated ferrets compared IFN-treated animals in both unchallenged and challenged animals (Fig. 3B) and rechallenged animals (Supplementary Fig. 4: 7R, dotted blue line). These ferrets had inflammatory responses, such as a fever of +3.2 °F temperature over baseline. T-effector responses were higher for IL-4 following IBV-challenge and IFN-treatment early at 1 week post-challenge (Supplementary Fig. 4C). In contrast, these responses were suppressed in untreated Ferrets although the levels were generally low. Cytokines, IP-10 and IL-12p40, associated with influenza severity45,46 were only observed in untreated ferrets challenged at 3 months (Supplementary Fig. 4: 7R, dotted blue line). Pro-inflammatory levels were generally suppressed in collected sera following IBV challenge (Fig. 3D) or rechallenge (Supplementary Fig. 4D) except for IL-8 and IL-23, which were highest following IFNA-treatment. Serum IFNs and other cytokines and chemokines were highest in IFN-treated animals, which were consistent with gene expression observed in IFN-treated ferrets.IFN treatment did not affect IBV-LAIV vaccine replication, but reduced morbidity in ferrets following IBV challengeFerrets were either vaccinated intranasally with live-attenuated influenza vaccine, B/Phuket/3073/2013-CDC-LV11B (LAIV) or mock vaccinated (UN). One day post vaccination, PEG-IFNA, PEG-IFNL or PBS (mock) was administered intranasally (3 ferrets per group). For mock-vaccinated (UN-Tx) ferrets (Table 5A), there was no lethargy or adverse effects of IFN treatment. Following vaccination (LAIV-Tx), there was no lethargy or fever observed, regardless of treatment. Ferrets administered IFNL (LAIV-IFNL) had little weight loss. IFN treatment did not affect LAIV replication in the URT or the virus kinetics following infection between these two sets of ferrets (p = ns, 2-way ANOVA).Table 5 Clinical signs and virus replication in ferrets following IBV vaccination and challengeFull size tableIFNL treated animals showed modest weight loss following influenza virus challenge at 3 months post-vaccination. No ferrets had clinical signs of infection (Supplementary Fig. 2E, F) and little virus was detected in the NWs post challenge (Supplementary Fig. 2G, H). No differences in virus kinetics were observed between the two sets of ferrets (ns, 2-way ANOVA).IFN treatment induced early IFN and inflammatory responses in ferret URT, but not in PBMC following IBV-LAIV vaccination, but IFNL response was sustained following challengeDifferential gene expression by qRT-PCR was performed on cells of the URT (NW cells) and PBMC following IBV-LAIV vaccination and treatment with IFNs (Fig. 4). IFNA-treated ferrets had the highest expression of TH1 (CXCL10 gene) and interferon response (SOCS3 gene) in NW cells from the URT following vaccination and challenge compared to ferrets administered IFNL- or mock ferret groups (Fig. 4A). These results were similar to the gene expression profiles in ferrets infected with B/Phuket/3073/2013 (PH) in the challenge-rechallenge ferret groups. Type-I/II IFN genes were all downregulated, however, type-II(IFNG) and type-III (IFNL3) were upregulated in IFNL-treated and IFNA-treated ferrets at D3 and D5 post-vaccination. The SOCS3 gene was upregulated in all ferrets following vaccination and challenge. IFN-treated ferrets showed persistent, highly upregulated TH1 (CXCL10) and IFN-response (SOCS3) genes following challenge. Pro-inflammatory (MCP1) was upregulated by D5 post vaccination and D3 post challenge in IFNA-treated ferrets but sustained in mock-treated ferrets throughout vaccination and challenge.Fig. 4: Gene expression in ferret URT and PBMC following IBV vaccination and challenge.Heatmap of average fold gene expression in IBV-vaccinated and challenged ferrets following IFN-treatment.

B Average fold gene expression in PBMC following IBV vaccination (pVax) or challenge (pCh).Full size imageUnlike the challenge-rechallenge study, there is an upregulation of only type-I IFNs at D3 in the PBMC collected from IFNA-treated ferrets and following vaccination (Fig. 4B). Type-III IFN (IFNL3) and IFN response (TSLP) genes were upregulated only in IFNL-treated and mock-treated ferrets post vaccination. Other inflammatory, such as TH1/TH2 directed and IFN (IFNB, IFNG) genes, were expressed at the highest levels in mock-treated ferrets. Following challenge at 3 months post-vaccination, IFN-treated ferrets had high and sustained expression of inflammatory (MCP1), type-III IFN (IFNL3), IFN response (RIG-I and TSLP) compared to mock-treated ferrets that had sustained expression of TH1/TH2, T-effector, and IFN (IFNA) genes. Unlike the sustained upregulated expression of inflammatory and IFN genes in IFN-treated animals following IBV challenge-rechallenge, responses following LAIV-vaccination and challenge had a weaker inflammatory response in IFN-treated ferrets. However, type-III IFN (IFNL3) and inflammatory (MCP1) genes were sustained in IFN-treated animals. Interestingly, mock-treated vaccinated ferrets exhibited earlier inflammatory responses post-challenge compared to mock-treated rechallenged ferrets in the challenge-rechallenge study. In the previous study, mock-treated rechallenged ferrets had a transient inflammatory response on D3.IFN treatment did not enhance serum cytokine and chemokine levels following IBV-LAIV vaccination and challenge in ferretsSerum cytokine and chemokine levels were evaluated in ferrets following IBV-LAIV vaccination and treatment with IFNA or IFNL3 for 12Wk and 1Wk following challenge (Fig. 5). Analyte levels were normalized to pre-vaccination (D0) levels to determine whether cytokine and chemokines were either increased or decreased from pre-vaccination levels. IFN levels were similar to levels detected over a 12-week period following vaccination in all ferrets regardless of treatment (Fig. 5A). However, TSLP levels were consistently higher in IFNA- and IFNL-treated animals. TH1 (IP-10) responses were consistently higher in IFNA-treated ferrets following LAIV-vaccination than IFNL- or mock (PBS)-treated animals (Fig. 5B) that was consistent with the TH1 (CXCL10) gene expression responses observed in ferret NW cells. The kinetics of T-effector cytokines in IFN-treated ferrets were similar to mock (Fig. 5C). IFNA- and mock-treated animals had increases in IL-4 and IL-17 within the first 1–2 weeks post-treatment and showed similar increases post challenge, whereas IFNL-treated ferrets had lower levels of both IL-4 and IL-17. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were similar for all ferrets (Fig. 5D). Overall, IFN-treatment did not have an enhanced effect on cytokine and chemokine levels indicated following IBV-challenge.Fig. 5: Cytokine/chemokine levels in sera of IFN-treated ferrets following IBV vaccination.Serum cytokine and chemokine levels in IBV-vaccinated ferrets following IFN-treatment. Unvaccinated groups (UN-X) are represented by hatched colored bars and IBV-vaccinated groups (LAIV-X) are indicated by solid colored bars. Treatment groups are Mock (PBS, blue), IFNA (red) and IFNL (green). Average range ±SD of cytokines are presented over 12 weeks post vaccination with average indicated by black line within each bar. Average pG/mL levels of analytes are shown from the following functional groups: A Interferon responses. Type-I (IFNB), Type-II (IFNG) and Type-III* (IFNL) and Type-III IFN response cytokine (TSLP).

Significant differences indicated between each group by 2-way ANOVA.Full size imageIFN treatment following IBV challenge generated higher neutralizing antibody titers compared to IBV alone in ferrets following challenge and rechallengeFerrets were infected with IBV (PH) followed by intranasal treatment with PEGylated type-I (IFNA), type-III (IFNL) IFN, or Mock (UN) and assessed for serum neutralizing antibodies to IBV by FRA (Table 6). For challenge-rechallenge study, all ferrets reached geometric mean titers (GMT) of >1:160 (bold) by week 4 that fell below 1:160 threshold by 12 weeks (Table 6A). IFNA- and IFNL-treated animals had higher titers than mock-treated ferrets at week 4 (IFNA/IFNL3 = 296, Mock = 235) and week 8 (IFNA = 296, IFNL = 235, Mock = 202) post-challenge. At 1 week post rechallenge, neutralizing titers in IFNA-Tx ferrets were 1.2 times higher (GMT = 1016) and in IFNL3-treated ferrets it was 1.7 times higher (GMT = 1493) than mock-treated animals (GMT = 871). The effects of IFN-treatment on unchallenged animals were only slightly higher than mock-treated animals following challenge 12 weeks later, however, this did not result in neutralizing titers reaching the 1:160 threshold. IFN-treatment clearly showed higher neutralizing antibody levels for 4–8 weeks following IBV challenge compared to mock. IFN-treatment resulted in significantly higher antibody responses following rechallenge over mock-treatment which may indicate a more robust adaptive immune response.Table 6 Neutralizing antibody responses following IBV challenge or vaccination in ferrets treated with IFNFull size tableIFN treatment following LAIV vaccination generated higher neutralizing antibodies compared to mock treatment but did not result in higher antibody levels following challengeFerrets were vaccinated with LAIV-IBV (LAIV) followed by intranasal treatment with PEGylated type-I (IFNA), type-III (IFNL3) IFN, or Mock (UN) and assessed for serum neutralizing antibodies to IBV by FRA (Table 6). For the vaccination study (Table 6B), ferrets treated with IFN had a geometric mean neutralizing titers (GMT) of >1:160 by 8 weeks post vaccination (IFNA-Tx = 218, IFNL-Tx = 187). Interestingly, in the absence of vaccination (UN-PH), IFN-treated animals had neutralizing antibody titers >1:160 at 1-week post-challenge, even though these animals were treated with IFN 12 weeks earlier. IFN-treated ferrets failed to attain antibody titers greater than mock-treated animals following challenge of vaccinated ferrets. IFN-treatment did not result in higher neutralizing antibodies than mock-treatment following LAIV vaccination.Serum TSLP directly correlated and IFN inversely correlated to neutralizing Ab responses in ferrets following IBV challenge-rechallenge or LAIV vaccination-challengeNext, serum cytokine levels were compared to neutralizing antibody responses in ferrets following IBV challenge or IBV vaccination (Table 7). Correlations, that include 3Mo rechallenge or post vaccination challenge are shown in Supplementary Table 2. There was a direct correlation between TSLP and neutralizing antibody response in both mock-treated (r = 0.77) and IFNL-treated (r = 0.71) ferrets following IBV challenge-rechallenge (Supplementary Table 2A). There was an inverse correlation between IFNG and neutralizing antibody response following IBV challenge and IFNA-treatment (Table 7A). Additionally, T-effector (IL-12p40) levels, inversely correlated with antibody responses following IBV challenge, regardless of treatment. Only mock-treated and IFNL-treated ferrets had an indirect correlation to antibody levels and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFA and IL-6) post-challenge and rechallenge. However, IL-8 was indirectly correlated with antibody responses, regardless of treatment (Supplementary Table 2A).Table 7 Correlations between antibody levels and protein levels in IFN-treated ferrets following IBV challenge and vaccinationFull size tableCorrelations of cytokines to neutralizing antibodies are shown in Table 7B that include both 3 months rechallenge or 3 months post-vaccination challenge (Supplementary Table 2B). Only TSLP had a strong direct correlation to neutralizing antibody in IFN-treated ferrets either post vaccination or 3 months post-challenge (Table 7 and Supplementary Table 2B). There was a correlation between neutralizing antibody and IFNL and a strong inverse correlation (r = −0.8) to the IFNA-treated ferrets both post-vaccination and vaccination-challenge.DiscussionWhen characterizing the innate immune responses of IAV and IBV infection of ferret primary respiratory tract cells, the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and IFNs was delayed and downregulated by IBV strains compared to IAV strains36. Subsequent studies of IAV and IBV infections of ferrets confirmed that a delay in initial innate responses resulted in weak antibody responses to IBV13. Due to these observations, the goal of this study was to determine whether addition of IFNs, as potential immunoadjuvants, could overcome the delay in the initial innate immune responses to IBV and boost the antibody response following infection or vaccination.To boost the immune responses to IBV, PEGylated ferret IFNA and IFNL3 were chosen in both challenge-rechallenge and vaccination-challenge studies. Intramuscular treatment of ferrets with seasonal influenza vaccine plus human PEGylated IFNA2b stimulated innate interferon stimulating genes compared to vaccine alone41. A previous study, using intra-muscular treatment of ferrets with influenza vaccine plus PEGylated human IFNA2b (Unitron PEG, Schering-Plough), found that 1 μG/Kg was sufficient to stimulate innate interferon stimulating gene responses to IAV compared to vaccine alone41. Previously, the innate immune responses in the URT of ferrets were characterized. In this study, ferret IFNs were introduced intranasally in order to assess the effects directly on cells in the URT and determine the impact on virus replication, as well as downstream adaptive immune responses. Since, live-attenuated influenza vaccines were administered intranasally, IFN was also administered intranasally. By administering both virus and vaccine mucosally, coupled with the fact that IFNL is highly expressed on epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract, the immune responses could be assessed at the site of infection47,48. Since IFNs are activated following influenza virus infection and affect influenza virus replication in mice and ferrets49,50,51, initially ferrets were treated with IFN at various times in order to determine the minimal effect on virus replication, while still stimulating innate immune responses. Virus replication was reduced if PEG-IFNs were added within 8 h post-challenge. However, if PEG-IFN was added 24 h or later post-challenge, virus replication was not affected. In this study, following IBV infection in ferrets, IFN treatment resulted in reduced morbidity compared to untreated animals. Although animals treated with IFNL had greater weight loss than untreated ferrets, a clear difference in ferret activity post-challenge and vaccination was observed even in IFNA-treated animals. Human studies with IFN-treatment indicate that weight loss of 12–29% has been observed in 90% of HCV patients52. A possible mechanism of underlying weight loss may be due to suppression of appetite due to the induction of TNF by IFN. In our study, IFN-treated animals did show higher levels of weight loss than mock-treated animals; however, there were no differences in TNF levels in sera between IFN-treated and mock-treated animals. For animals challenged with IBV 3 months following IFN treatment, only mock and IFNA-treated ferrets developed fever. This was an interesting observation since animals were only treated once with IFNs more than 3 months prior to challenge; however, some residual effect on the inflammatory response by IFNL may be evident. In fact, Type-III IFN has been shown to be anti-inflammatory53; however, the long-term effects of a single treatment have not been shown.In the URT of IBV challenged animals, IFN-treatment induced early inflammatory responses and increased IFNL expression following rechallenge, but PBMC had high and sustained upregulation of type-I/II/III IFNs following IBV challenge and rechallenge in IFN-treated animals. In the URT, SOCS3 was upregulated in all ferrets and has been shown to down-modulate IFN signaling in a RIG-I-dependent pathway to inhibit antiviral responses and suppress the inflammatory response54,55,56. Concurrently with IFN responses, only IFN-treated animals had elevated levels of type-I/II/III IFNs throughout infection and following rechallenge. This indicates that IFN-treatment can influence both IFN gene expression and serum cytokines levels following IBV infection that are otherwise suppressed and delayed. Viral infection in the respiratory tract IFNL is required for production of virus-specific IgG1, IgA, as well as generation of antiviral CD8+ T cells21. The mechanism behind this response affects IFNL triggering the synthesis of TSLP in upper airway M cells, which in turn influences germinal center responses by migrating DCs, thus allowing for enhancement of mucosal immunity and IAV resistance. Following IFNL-treatment of ferrets following IBV challenge or vaccination, there were increased IFNL3 gene expression and protein levels that correlated to an increase in TSLP gene expression and protein levels in PBMC. Interestingly, IFNA-treatment also increased IFNL3 expression and TSLP protein following rechallenge. This induction may be due to an alternate, unknown mechanism of TSLP activation. Innate immune responses were activated following IFN-treatment that resulted in a strong sustained antibody response for 4–8 weeks following challenge. By week 12 post-vaccination, these ferrets had neutralizing antibody activity less than 1:160 and animals were rechallenged with IBV to observe antibody recall responses and enhancement. For untreated ferrets, antibody titers to IBV increased 8.6-fold from 12-week levels (GMT from 1:101 to 1:871), which was 1 week after re-challenge. IFNA-treated animals had higher antibody titers following rechallenge, however, these levels only increased 6.9-fold (GMT from 1:148 to 1:1016) from 12-week levels. IFNL-treated ferrets had the greatest increase in antibody responses (17.4-fold), from a GMT of 1:86 to 1:1493) following rechallenge. Both IFNA and IFNL-treated animals demonstrated significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers compared to untreated animals.For the vaccine-challenge study in ferrets, as in the challenge-rechallenge study, vaccine replication was not affected by IFN treatment. All ferrets were protected from challenge at 12 weeks post-vaccination, regardless of treatment during the time of vaccination. However, mock-vaccinated animals treated with IFN did show less morbidity than untreated ferrets, even though a single IFN treatment was given 12 weeks prior to challenge. Unfortunately, no differences in virus replication were observed in any of the ferrets. This indicates IFN may be used prophylactically to prevent increased morbidity following influenza infection. Prophylactic treatment of people with type-I or type-III IFN reduced the severity of influenza virus and other respiratory virus-induced disease57,58,59. Following viral challenge, IFN-treated ferrets had high and sustained gene expression of IFNL3 and TSLP in collected PBMC. However, IFN-treatment did not enhance cytokine effects that may be due, in part, to the protective responses elicited by the vaccine. Further exploration of the residual effects of IFN-treatment need to be determined in challenge studies at time points beyond 12 weeks post-vaccination. Since the vaccine efficacy to IBV has been shown to be lower in children than adults, it would be of interest to determine whether different localized immune responses and cytokine profiling in adults and children contribute to these responses. It has been shown in the ferret model to influenza that there are differences in inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (iBALT) in adult and newly-weaned young ferrets following IAV infection60. Both CCL19 (T-cell activation)61 and CXCL13 (B-cell recruitment and germinal center formation following influenza infection)62 were significantly upregulated in the lungs of young ferrets following IAV-infection and may result in regulation of both T and B cells in these animals. Future studies to determine whether IFN-treatment could enhance iBALT formation and chemokine expression in these sites following IBV infection or vaccination of ferrets would further support immune differences observed in this study.There was a strong correlation between TSLP levels and antibody responses following IFN-treatment of ferrets in both challenge-rechallenge and vaccination-challenge studies. This indicates a possible biomarker for assessment of antibody responses following influenza infection or vaccination. Since TSLP responses are upregulated in conjunction with IFNL at D3–D5 in PBMC following IBV infection, TSLP responses could be used as a tool in predicting antibody outcome. Further analysis with different influenza vaccines is necessary to determine whether these markers could be used to assess vaccine efficacy.Even though there was a benefit of IFN treatment of 1 μG/kG on the immune responses in ferrets, additional treatments, as well as testing different concentrations and routes, may result in a greater benefit of IFN and generation of a more robust immune response. The development and availability of additional ferret immune reagents, especially antibodies to ferret IgA and ferret cell surface markers, will allow for a more in-depth analysis of the immune responses in the ferret model and aid in the development of improved vaccines and therapeutics.The initial innate responses, especially the IFN response, following influenza virus infection or vaccination are important in the development of robust adaptive immune responses to protect from subsequent infection or lessen severity of disease. As with influenza viruses, other viruses are impaired by IFN signaling, and IFN treatment is a powerful therapeutic63,64,65,66. Since one of the strongest predictors of a robust antibody response following influenza vaccination is the upregulation of IFN signaling genes (reviewed in ref. 67), the importance of this study cannot be understated. While we have shown that IFN-treatment does significantly enhance the neutralizing antibody titers to IBV following infection and vaccination, we have not shown whether this effect can protect from cross-lineage infection by increasing the breadth of the antibody response. Further investigations on the effects of interferon treatment on antibody breadth and cross-lineage protection are warranted and could expand the use of IFN as an immunoadjuvant to future influenza vaccines. Due to the anti-inflammatory characteristics of type-III IFNs and lower toxicity in humans68, IFNL may be advantageous over IFNA, which is inflammatory and shows greater adverse effects in humans69,70. SARS-CoV-2 studies indicated that lower antiviral type-I and type-III expression and elevated IL-6 expression contributed to development of COVID-19 disease65, suggesting the use of IFNA/B and IFNL71 or JAK/STAT inhibitors72 as potential therapeutics. Consequently, IFN-treatment, especially IFNL, may be an important consideration for use following influenza virus infection or as a potential immunoadjuvant to increase immunity to influenza (especially for IBV) and other viral infections.

Study found hospitalization is threat for old and young. • Nov. 1, 2024, 1:19 AM ET (USA Today) Show less Because influenza epidemics and pandemics can devastate large regions of the world very quickly, WHO constantly monitors influenza disease activity on a global scale. This monitoring is useful for gathering information that can be used to prepare vaccines and that can be disseminated to health centres in countries where seasonal influenza outbreaks are likely to occur. Monitoring by WHO also plays an important role in preventing and preparing for potential epidemics and pandemics. In the event that a potentially pandemic influenza virus emerges, WHO adheres to its influenza pandemic preparedness plan. This plan consists of six phases of pandemic alert. Phases 1–3, which are the early stages in pandemic preparedness, are designed to prevent or contain small outbreaks. In these early phases, isolated incidences of animal-to-human transmission of an influenza virus are observed and provide warning that a virus has pandemic potential. Later, small outbreaks of disease may occur, generally resulting from multiple cases of animal-to-human transmission. Phase 3 signals to affected countries that the implementation of efforts to control the outbreak is needed to prevent a pandemic. Phases 4 and 5 are characterized by increasing urgency in mitigating the outbreak. Confirmed human-to-human viral transmission, with sustained disease in human communities which subsequently spread so that disease transmission between humans occurred in two countries, indicates that a pandemic is imminent. Phase 6, the highest level of pandemic alert, is characterized by widespread disease and sustained transmission of the virus between humans. Influenza pandemics sometimes occur in waves. Thus, a post-pandemic phase, when disease activity decreases, may be followed by another period of high prevalence of disease. As a result, influenza pandemics may last for a period of months (see pandemic). Transmission and symptoms The flu may affect individuals of all ages, though the highest incidence of the disease is among children and young adults. Influenza is generally more frequent during the colder months of the year. Infection is transmitted from person to person through the respiratory tract, by such means as inhalation of infected droplets resulting from coughing and sneezing. As the virus particles gain entrance to the body, they selectively attack and destroy the ciliated epithelial cells that line the upper respiratory tract, bronchial tubes, and trachea. The incubation period of the disease is one to two days, after which the onset of symptoms is abrupt, with sudden and distinct chills, fatigue, and muscle aches. The temperature rises rapidly to 38–40 °C (101–104 °F). A diffuse headache and severe muscular aches throughout the body are experienced, often accompanied by irritation or a sense of rawness in the throat. In three to four days the temperature begins to fall, and the person begins to recover. Symptoms associated with respiratory tract infection, such as coughing and nasal discharge, become more prominent and may be accompanied by lingering feelings of weakness. Death may occur, usually among older people already weakened by other debilitating disorders, and is caused in most of those cases by complications such as pneumonia or bronchitis. Treatment and prevention The antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine have beneficial effects on cases of influenza involving the type A virus. However, viral resistance to these agents has been observed, thereby reducing their effectiveness. A newer category of drugs, the neuraminidase inhibitors, which includes oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza), was introduced in the late 1990s; these drugs inhibit both the influenza A and B viruses. Other than this, the standard treatment remains bed rest, ingestion of fluids, and the use of analgesics to control fever. It is recommended that children and teenagers with the flu not be given aspirin, as treatment of viral infections with aspirin is associated with Reye syndrome, a very serious illness. Why don't flu shots always work?Learn about the search for a universal flu vaccine.(more)See all videos for this articleIndividual protection against the flu may be bolstered by injection of a vaccine containing two or more circulating influenza viruses. These viruses are produced in chick embryos and rendered noninfective; standard commercial preparations ordinarily include the type B influenza virus and several of the A subtypes. Protection from one vaccination seldom lasts more than a year, and yearly vaccination may be recommended, particularly for those individuals who are unusually susceptible to influenza or whose weak condition could lead to serious complications in case of infection. However, routine immunization in healthy people is also recommended. Advances in scientific understanding of influenza and vaccine technologies enabled the development of a so-called universal influenza vaccine, capable of protecting individuals against a broad range of different influenza subtypes; the vaccine was scheduled for initial testing in clinical trials involving human subjects in 2019. In order to prevent human-infecting bird flu viruses from mutating into more dangerous subtypes, public health authorities try to limit the viral “reservoir” where antigenic shift may take place by ordering the destruction of infected poultry flocks.The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica This article was most recently revised and updated by Kara Rogers.Influenza pandemic (H1N1) of 2009 - Vaccines, Antivirals, Hygiene | Britannica Search Britannica Click here to search Search Britannica Click here to search Subscribe Subscribe Login Home History & Society Science & Tech Biographies Animals & Nature Geography & Travel Arts & Culture Money Games & Quizzes Videos On This Day One Good Fact Dictionary New Articles History & Society Lifestyles & Social Issues Philosophy & Religion Politics, Law & Government World History Science & Tech Health & Medicine Science Technology Biographies Browse Biographies Animals & Nature Birds, Reptiles & Other Vertebrates Bugs, Mollusks & Other Invertebrates Environment Fossils & Geologic Time Mammals Plants Geography & Travel Geography & Travel Arts & Culture Entertainment & Pop Culture Literature Sports & Recreation Visual Arts Companions Demystified Image Galleries Lists Podcasts Spotlight Summaries The Forum Top Questions #WTFact Britannica Kids Ask the Chatbot Games & Quizzes History & Society Science & Tech Biographies Animals & Nature Geography & Travel Arts & Culture Money Videos influenza pandemic (H1N1) of 2009 Table of Contents IntroductionSymptoms and transmissionEarly stages of the outbreakPandemic status and responseThe H1N1 virusTreatment and prevention References & Edit History Quick Facts & Related Topics Images Quizzes Disasters of Historic Proportion Related Questions What is the difference between influenza epidemics and influenza pandemics?

However, there is some evidence that H1N1 viruses can develop resistance to oseltamivir, which commonly is used as first-line treatment for infection. In October 2009 an intravenously administered antiviral known as peramivir, though not formally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was given emergency-use authorization for the treatment of hospitalized H1N1 patients who had not responded to oral or inhaled antivirals or who had life-threatening illness. The spread of the virus can be controlled through basic sanitary practices, including washing hands, wearing face masks, and disinfecting potentially contaminated surfaces. However, the most effective method of prevention for high-risk persons, including young children, women who are pregnant, and individuals with compromised immune systems, is vaccination. When the H1N1 virus emerged, there were no vaccines available that could provide immunity against infection. However, the severity of the outbreak prompted the rapid development of a novel vaccine, which was tested in clinical trials beginning in early August 2009. Because the first vaccine tested required two doses, there was immediate concern that not enough vaccine could be manufactured before a potential second wave of illness arrived in the fall in the Northern Hemisphere. The vaccine also required a three-week wait between doses, introducing the possibility that it would not have time to take effect prior to the emergence of another period of high disease activity. By September, pilot tests of novel single-dose vaccines—developed independently by Chinese biotechnology company Sinovac and Swiss pharmaceutical manufacturer Novartis AG—indicated that sufficient protection could be provided by one injection. Sinovac received approval from the Chinese government in early September to begin mass production of the vaccine, with the goal of generating enough of the agent to vaccinate 5 percent of the Chinese population by 2010. Efforts to increase the global supply of single-dose vaccines being developed by pharmaceutical companies around the world, as well as efforts to distribute these vaccines to countries affected by the pandemic, were considered vitally important to successfully stemming the spread of illness. To aid these efforts, WHO set a goal of obtaining some 200 million donated doses for allocation to 95 low- and middle-income countries. The first stocks of donated vaccine were scheduled for delivery to those countries between November 2009 and February 2010. In late 2009 two types of H1N1 vaccines were made available: one that could be injected and one that could be inhaled. Whereas a single dose of vaccine was presumed to be sufficient for adolescents and adults, two doses were recommended for children between the ages of six months and nine years. An example of an injectable vaccine that was used against H1N1 was Pandemrix, which was developed by GlaxoSmithKline and was approved for use in September 2009 by the European Commission. Pandemrix was used widely, with doses administered in 47 countries worldwide and with some 30 million doses used in Europe alone. In the postpandemic period, which began on Aug. 10, 2010, vaccination remained an important means of protection against H1N1 infection for high-risk populations, which included young children, pregnant women, and persons affected by underlying respiratory diseases or chronic illness. Many people, however, were wary of vaccination, primarily because of concerns of side effects. Such concerns were reinforced in 2011 when the Pandemrix vaccine was linked to an increase in incidence of narcolepsy, a disorder characterized by sudden uncontrollable spells of sleep. In Finland, for example, the risk of narcolepsy was found to be nine times higher in Pandemrix-vaccinated persons aged 4 to 19 compared with unvaccinated persons of the same age group. A review of Finland’s cases revealed that the Pandemrix vaccine increased the risk of narcolepsy primarily in persons who carried a genetic variation predisposing them to the disorder. Similar outbreaks of vaccine-associated narcolepsy in 11 other countries were under investigation. Despite the link to narcolepsy, health officials maintained that the benefits of H1N1 vaccination outweighed the risks of possible side effects.

The polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) of the influenza virus plays a crucial role in the viral replication process, making the CAP-binding domain of PB2 an attractive target for antiviral drug development. This study aimed to identify and evaluate potential inhibitors of the influenza polymerase PB2 CAP-binding domain using computational drug discovery methods. We employed a comprehensive computational approach involving virtual screening, molecular docking, and 500 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Compounds were selected from the Diverse lib database and assessed for their binding affinity and stability in interaction with the PB2 CAP-binding domain. The study utilized the generalized amber force field (GAFF) for MD simulations to further evaluate the dynamic behaviour and stability of the interactions. Among the screened compounds, compounds 1, 3, and 4 showed promising binding affinities. Compound 4 demonstrated the highest binding stability and the most favourable free energy profile, indicating strong and consistent interaction with the target domain. Compound 3 displayed moderate stability with dynamic conformational changes, while Compound 1 maintained robust interactions throughout the simulations. Comparative analyses of these compounds against a control compound highlighted their potential efficacy. Compound 4 emerged as the most promising inhibitor, with substantial stability and strong binding affinity to the PB2 CAP-binding domain. These findings suggest that compound 4, along with compounds 1 and 3, holds the potential for further development into effective antiviral agents against influenza. Future studies should focus on experimental validation of these compounds and exploration of resistance mechanisms to enhance their therapeutic utility.

The disease mainly results from the influenza virus, which targets the respiratory tract and can cause severe respiratory illness or even death, particularly in high-risk groups such as the elderly, young children, and people with chronic health conditions2. Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and are categorized into types A, B, and C, with type A viruses being the most virulent in humans3. One of the key proteins involved in the replication and transcription of the influenza virus is the polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) of the viral RNA polymerase complex4. The segmented genomes of these viruses facilitate frequent reassortment, leading to antigenic variations and drifts. This genetic shuffling can produce new strains that occasionally evade pre-existing immune responses, resulting in seasonal epidemics and pandemics3. PB2 is crucial for recognizing and binding to the cap structure of pre-mRNAs, a process essential for viral RNA synthesis and transcription5. It is primarily responsible for recognizing and binding to the cap structure of pre-mRNAs, which is crucial for the viral RNA synthesis process5. This cap-snatching mechanism is essential for viral transcription and replication, making the CAP-binding domain of PB2 an attractive target for antiviral drug development6. Historically, influenza outbreaks such as the infamous 1918 Spanish flu, 1957 Asian flu, 1968 Hong Kong flu, and the more recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic have underscored the need for effective antiviral agents7. The 1918 H1N1 pandemic, for instance, caused unprecedented mortality and morbidity, largely due to the lack of effective antiviral treatments and vaccines. This pandemic provided early evidence of the virus’s potential for widespread devastation, thus marking the inception of the urgent need for antiviral research. Subsequent outbreaks have continued to reflect this pattern, where the appearance of novel influenza strains outpaced the effectiveness of existing treatments, compelling the scientific community to innovate and develop new antiviral strategies8. Furthermore, the recent H1N1 outbreak in 2009 illustrated the rapidity with which influenza viruses can disseminate globally, challenging public health systems and antiviral stockpiles. This event emphasized the importance of having a diverse arsenal of antiviral agents that can be deployed promptly in response to new strains7. These events highlight the potential global health crises that can arise from new influenza strains, emphasizing the importance of continued surveillance, vaccine development, and therapeutic interventions9.Despite the availability of vaccines and existing antiviral drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir, there is a persistent need for new therapeutic options, particularly those that can target different stages of the viral life cycle or offer treatment alternatives resistant to current therapies10. The PB2 CAP-binding domain, due to its essential role in viral replication, represents a potent target for such interventions11 Currently, the inhibitor landscape for targeting the PB2 CAP-binding domain is still in its developmental stages. The inhibitors aim to disrupt the cap-snatching activity of the PB2 protein, thereby inhibiting the replication of the influenza virus. However, the development of PB2 inhibitors has been challenging due to the need for high specificity and the potential for rapid development of resistance by the virus12. The exploration of potential inhibitors has been significantly advanced by computational approaches, particularly through the use of diverse chemical libraries. The Diverse lib database is an expansive collection of molecular entities that provides a broad range of chemical diversity, enhancing the likelihood of identifying unique structures with potential inhibitory activity against specific viral targets13. Our research leverages computational drug discovery methodologies to screen the Diverse lib database for potential inhibitors of the Influenza Polymerase PB2 CAP-Binding Domain14. By applying a combination of virtual screening with Lipinski rule of five as a filter, followed by re-docking procedures, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and free energy calculations, we aim to identify promising candidates for further experimental validation. Additionally, RG-RMSD-based free energy landscapes provide insights into the dynamic stability and binding affinities of the interactions between potential inhibitors and the PB2 CAP-binding domain. This comprehensive approach not only enhances our understanding of the interaction mechanisms but also accelerates the discovery process for efficacious and safe antiviral agents.MethodologyData collection and high-throughput virtual screeningIn this study, we adopted a computational approach to identify potential inhibitors of the Influenza Polymerase Pb2 CAP-Binding Domain. Initially, protein and ligand datasets were collected. Protein data was obtained from the PDB (ID: 4CB5) and ligand data from the Diverse lib database13,15,16. Protein preparation involved cleaning the structure and optimizing geometry using Chimera's Dock Prep tool17,18. This step involved cleaning the protein structure by removing water molecules and any bound ligands or ions, followed by the addition of hydrogen atoms to correct the protonation state and optimize the overall geometry of the protein.This step involved cleaning the protein structure by removing water molecules and any bound ligands or ions, followed by the addition of hydrogen atoms to correct the protonation state and optimize the overall geometry of the protein. For the virtual screening, we utilized the MtiOpenScreen web server13, which integrates a Lipinski filter to ensure that the screened compounds adhered to basic pharmacokinetic principles19. This screening process resulted in the identification of several candidate compounds, from which four were selected based on superior docking scores indicating potential high-affinity binding to the target domain. Re-docking was performed using the Autodock Vina Chimera plugin20. This step served to validate the initial docking results through a more refined computational model. Both the candidate compounds and a reference molecule were docked into the binding site of the target protein. This re-docking process helped in comparing the binding affinities and conformations of the candidates relative to the known inhibitor, thereby affirming their potential efficacy.MD simulationIn this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to investigate the dynamic behaviour of Influenza Polymerase Pb2 CAP-Binding Domain in a complex with four potential inhibitors sourced from the Diverse lib database, alongside a control compound. MD simulations were performed using the generalized amber force field (GAFF) in AMBER21. Ligand preparation included assigning force field parameters and charges. Each complex was solvated in TIP3P water, equilibrated, and subjected to a 500 ns production run22. The preparation of the ligand molecules began with the antechamber tool within AMBER23, which facilitated the assignment of force field parameters and atomic charges suitable for non-standard residues in the ligands. This preparation is essential for ensuring accurate interactions within the simulated system. Following the ligand preparation, the complex assembly and system configuration were accomplished using the leap tool from AMBER24. The simulation protocol initiated with a comprehensive energy minimization Energy minimization was performed by PMEMD.cuda module24. This was succeeded by a temperature equilibration phase where each system was heated progressively from 0 to 300 K across a span of 100 ps, utilizing the NVT ensemble (constant volume and temperature). Following temperature equilibration, the systems were further equilibrated under NPT conditions (constant pressure and temperature) for 1 ns to ensure stable density and thermal conditions, setting the stage for the production MD simulations. For each complex, including the control, a 500 ns production run was carried out under constant pressure (1 atm) and temperature (300 K). The Langevin thermostat was employed for temperature regulation25, while pressure was managed using the Berendsen barostat26. Trajectory analysis included RMSD, RMSF, and the number of hydrogen bonds to assess stability and dynamics. The RG-RMSD-based free energy landscape provided insights into the collective movements and binding efficacy. Additionally, free energy calculations were performed to delineate the binding efficacy and identify favorable conformational states, offering a detailed portrayal of the interaction landscape and energetics.Free binding energyEntropy effects are crucial in drug–target interactions, yet the contribution of entropy to ligand-binding affinity is frequently overlooked by end-point binding free energy calculation methods, like MM/GBSA27. In this study, the free binding energy of selected inhibitor complexes was quantified to assess their potential efficacy. The analysis was conducted on the last 50 ns of molecular dynamics simulation trajectories. We employed the MMPBSA.py tool from the AMBER software suite to calculate these energies28. The methodology involved three primary steps, simulation preparation, trajectory analysis, and energy calculation. Initially, the system comprising the protein–ligand complex was stabilized using a standard equilibration protocol in AMBER24. This protocol adjusted the system to a suitable temperature and pressure, ensuring realistic physiological conditions. Following stabilization, the production phase of molecular dynamics simulations was executed. During this phase, data on the atomic positions and velocities were recorded, providing detailed insights into the dynamic interactions within the complex. For the analysis, the MMPBSA.py module was utilized to compute the free binding energy from these simulations. This computation was based on the (MM-GBSA) method, a widely recognized approach for this purpose29. The module calculates the energy by considering the difference between the total free energy of the protein–ligand complex and the sum of the free energies of the unbound protein and ligand. This difference represents the binding energy, which is crucial for understanding the binding efficacy of the compounds. This detailed analysis allows for the evaluation of the thermodynamic stability of the inhibitor complexes under investigation, providing valuable insights into their potential as therapeutic agents against influenza.RG-RMSD-based free energy landscapeThe study investigated the dynamic conformational changes and stability of four lead compounds bound to a target protein using the RG-RMSD-based free energy landscape approach30. This method calculates Radius of Gyration (RG) and Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) values for each protein–ligand complex to understand their interaction dynamics during molecular dynamics simulations using the Geo-Measure plugin in PyMOL31. The RG measures the compactness of the molecule, while RMSD indicates the average distance between atoms of the complex compared to a control structure over time. By plotting these values, a free energy landscape was created, illustrating energetically favorable conformations and transitional states. This analysis is crucial for predicting the stability and effectiveness of potential inhibitors.ResultsVirtual screeningVirtual screening is a valuable computational technique for discovering bioactive molecules within extensive chemical libraries, aiming to identify those that can bind to specific biological targets. In our research, we employed virtual screening to pinpoint compounds from the Diverse lib database on the MTIopen web server. The selection process for these compounds was guided by their binding energy values obtained during the screening. We carried out a thorough analysis of 1500 compounds from the diverse lib Database on the MTIopen web server13. The binding energies of these molecules ranged from − 10.5 to − 7.8 kcal/mol (Supplementary Table S1). Based on their notable binding energies, four compounds—compound 1 (81066370), compound 2 (24334311), compound 3 (85303482) and compound 4 (85176812) as shown in Table 2 (Table 1).Table 1 List of 4 selected compound.Full size tableFor the safely and toxicity prediction of these compound we have also performed the ADMET analysis by using ADMETLAB 2.0 webserver.

The compound demonstrates robust metabolic stability through significant interactions with CYP enzymes. It meets Lipinski's rule of five and the Golden Triangle rule, highlighting its potential as a viable drug candidate as ashown in Table S2.Redockin and Intermolecular AnalysisRe-docking is a crucial step in drug development, involving a rigorous reevaluation of the interactions between ligand molecules and receptor proteins. In our study, we employed specific parameters for the re-docking process: the docking grid's center was set at coordinates (X = − 50.0, Y = 4.48, Z = − 3.14) with grid dimensions of 20 Å for each axis (X, Y, Z). This approach is vital for validating initial docking results and clarifying key interactions at the receptor's binding site with the ligand. During the re-docking, each ligand was systematically aligned with the target protein and evaluated against a benchmark molecule, generating at least nine distinct poses per ligand-receptor pair. The pose with the most favorable docking energy, indicated by the lowest negative value, was chosen for in-depth analysis. This step was critical for further investigations into the stability of the complex and the affinity between the ligand and the target protein. Simultaneously, a virtual screening was conducted to explore a vast library of medicinal compounds. This screening highlighted four compounds with notably significant binding energies, recorded as − 10.4 kcal/mol, − 10.1 kcal/mol, − 9.9 kcal/mol, and − 9.8 kcal/mol. These compounds, referred to as compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4, showed promising potential and were selected for additional research. A control molecule, “93G”, with a binding energy of -7.8 kcal/mol, was used for comparative purposes. The three-dimensional structures of these molecules, including the control, were visualized using PyMOL software32, and two-dimensional figures were generated by Biodiscovery Studio33, enhancing our understanding of their spatial conformations and interactions within the binding site as illustrated in Fig. 1.Figure 1The 3D and 2D structure of the selected compound in complex with the protein (a, b) compound 1, (c, d) compound 2, (e, f) compound 3, (g, h) compound 4 and (i, j) control.Full size imageAs shown in Table 2, the current study involved a thorough examination of the molecular interactions that occurred between the selected compound and a target protein Compound 1 exhibited a singular hydrogen bond with Arginine 355 (Arg355) and engaged in eight hydrophobic interactions involving Phenylalanine 404 (Phe404), Arginine 332 (Arg332), Asparagine 429 (Asn429), Methionine 431 (Met431), Serine 324 (Ser324), Histidine 432 (His432), Serine 337 (Ser337), and Phenylalanine 363 (Phe363). Additionally, two π-π stacking interactions were identified with Phenylalanine 323 (Phe323) and Histidine 357 (His357). Compound 2 was formed eight hydrophobic interactions with Serine 337 (Ser337), Glutamate 361 (Glu361), Phenylalanine 363 (Phe363), Phenylalanine 404 (Phe404), Methionine 431 (Met431), Glutamate 341 (Glu341), Asparagine 429 (Asn429), and Arginine 332 (Arg332). This compound also formed two π–π stacking interactions with protein residue Phe323 and His357. Compound 3 formed seven hydrophobic interactions with Glutamate 361 (Glu361), Arginine 332 (Arg332), Serine 337 (Ser337), Phenylalanine 363 (Phe363), Phenylalanine 404 (Phe404), Asparagine 429 (Asn429), and Serine 324 (Ser324). Furthermore, three π-π stacking interactions were observed with Phenylalanine 323 (Phe323), Histidine 357 (His357), and Phenylalanine 325 (Phe325). Compound 4 exhibited one hydrogen bond with Histidine 357 (His357) and engaged in nine hydrophobic interactions with Glutamate 341 (Glu341), Lysine 353 (Lys353), Isoleucine 354 (Ile354), Glutamine 406 (Gln406), Glutamate 361 (Glu361), Lysine 376 (Lys376), Serine 337 (Ser337), Arginine 332 (Arg332), and Histidine 432 (His432). Additionally, a single π-π stacking interaction was noted with Phenylalanine 323 (Phe323). The control compound exhibited two hydrogen bonds with Serine 324 (Ser324) and Glutamate 361 (Glu361), alongside seven hydrophobic interactions with Histidine 432 (His432), Phenylalanine 325 (Phe325), Arginine 332 (Arg332), Serine 337 (Ser337), Phenylalanine 363 (Phe363), Lysine 376 (Lys376), and Phenylalanine 404 (Phe404), as well as a π-π stacking interaction.Table 2 Intermolecular interaction of four complexes in complex with the protein (a) compound 1, (b) compound 2, (c) compound 3, (d) compound 4 and (e) control compound.Full size tableMD simulationMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role in elucidating the dynamic stability of protein–ligand complexes, offering detailed insights into temporal molecular interactions34,35,36,37. To advance our comprehension of the binding interactions and mechanistic behaviors of four selected compounds with a target protein, we conducted an extensive 500-ns MD simulation. A well-characterized control compound was used for comparative analysis purposes. Throughout the simulation, the trajectories of each molecule were meticulously recorded, enabling the observation of conformational changes during the binding process. Analysis of the simulation data allowed for the assessment of key interaction parameters, including binding affinity, conformational alterations within the protein, and shifts in the energy landscape that impact the stability and functionality of the protein–ligand complex. However, Compound 2 exhibited suboptimal performance in the MD simulation; therefore, subsequent studies focused solely on Compounds 1, 3, and 4, excluding Compound 2 from further analysis. This targeted approach facilitates a more refined investigation into the structural dynamics and interaction efficiency of the remaining compounds. The last pose and first pose before and after the MD simulation is illustrated in Fig. 2.Figure 2The 2D structure of the selected compound in complex with the protein (a, b) compound 1, (c, d) compound 2, (e, f) compound 3, (g, h) compound 4 and (i, j) control.Full size imageRMSD analysisIn our molecular dynamics simulations, Compounds 1 and 3 exhibited the protein root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values below 2 Å, indicative of stable protein conformations. Notably, Compound 3 exhibited a protein RMSD of 2.5 Å during the interval from 150 to 250 ns. In contrast, both Compound 4 and the control compound maintained protein RMSD values below 3 Å throughout the simulation period. Regarding ligand stability, Compound 1 exhibited a ligand RMSD of 2 Å until 210 ns, followed by an increase to less than 4 Å for the remainder of the simulation. Compound 3 showed a ligand RMSD of 3.5 Å, with minor fluctuations observable up to 200 ns, likely due to conformational changes within the ligand. Meanwhile, Compound 4 maintained a ligand RMSD of less than 4 Å throughout the entire 500 ns simulation. Similarly, the control complex exhibited consistent ligand RMSD values below 3 Å during the 500 ns simulation, suggesting a relatively stable interaction between the ligand and the protein over time. These findings provide crucial insights into the dynamic stability and conformational integrity of the ligand–protein interactions for each compound assessed as illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4.Figure 3RMSD analysis of protein in complex with three selected compounds protein (a) compound 1, (b) compound 3, (c) compound 4 and the (d) control.Full size imageFigure 4RMSD analysis of three selected ligand (a) compound 1, (b) compound 3, (c) compound 4 and the (d) control in complex with protein.Full size imageRMSF analysisProtein in complex with compound 1 exhibited notable stability in its interaction with the protein, as indicated by a root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) value of less than 3 angstroms (Å) across the amino acid residues numbered 90 to 110. Such low RMSF values suggest minimal deviation in the positions of these residues when bound with Compound 1, indicating a tight and stable interaction within this specific segment of the protein. While Protein in complex with compound 3 exhibited the protein RMSF value below 5 Å for the residues between 90 and 110. While this value is slightly higher than that observed for Protein in complex with compound 1, it still represents a relatively stable interaction within this region of the protein–ligand complex, albeit with slightly more flexibility or movement compared to the protein interaction in compound 1. On other hand protein in complex with compound 4 exhibited a different pattern where the protein RMSF exceeded 3 Å for residues 130 to 140. This indicates a higher degree of fluctuation or movement in this region, suggesting less stability in the protein structure when interacting with Compound 4. The increase in RMSF suggests that these residues experience more dynamic movements, which might affect the efficacy or stability of the compound-protein interaction. For the same residue range of 130 to 140, it was also noted that in control, the protein RMSF was less than 3 Å. The RMSF analysis of all the compounds is illustrated in Fig. 5.Figure 5RMSF analysis of protein in complex with three selected compounds (a) compound 1, (b) compound 3, (c) compound 4 and the (d) control.Full size imageRadius of gyration analysisThe radius of gyration (RG) serves as a quantitative measure of the compactness of a protein's tertiary structure and provides insight into its structural stability within biological systems38. An elevated RG value signifies a looser packing configuration, which may correlate with reduced stability due to increased vulnerability to environmental perturbations. Conversely, a lower RG is indicative of a tightly packed, more stable conformation. This relationship is visually elucidated in Figure S1, where varying RG values are correlated with distinct structural transformations in proteins, thereby underscoring their consequential effects on protein stability.Hydrogen bond analysisIn the initial stages of the simulation, Compound 1 formed one to two hydrogen bonds. However, as the simulation progressed, the stability of these hydrogen bonds varied, with bonding becoming confined to specific areas. This observation suggests a possible alteration in the molecular conformation of its binding sites. Compound 3 demonstrated a more stable yet minimal hydrogen bonding pattern. It started the simulation with a single hydrogen bond, which remained consistent throughout the duration of the simulation. The persistence of only one hydrogen bond suggests a rigid molecular structure or a constrained environment, potentially limiting further bonding opportunities. Compound 4 displayed a consistent hydrogen bonding pattern, maintaining one to two hydrogen bonds throughout the simulation. This consistent bonding indicates a balanced and flexible molecular configuration, which allows for stable interactions without significant changes in bonding patterns. This flexibility could be crucial for its functionality in specific environments or applications. The control compound exhibited a more complex and sustained hydrogen bonding pattern, consistently forming two to three hydrogen bonds up to the 500 ns mark of the simulation. This robust bonding behavior underscores a strong and stable interaction capability, with multiple bonding sites actively engaged over an extended period. This could reflect a complex molecular structure designed to engage more extensively with its surroundings, potentially making it a useful standard for comparison in studies of molecular interaction dynamics as illustrated in Fig. 6.Figure 6Hydrogen bond analysis of three compounds in complex with protein (a) compound 1, (b) compound 3, (c) compound 4 and the (d) control.Full size imageBinding free energy analysisThe binding free energies of multiple complexes were quantitatively evaluated using the molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) approach. This technique facilitates the breakdown of the overall binding energy (ΔG) into its constituent energy components, thereby enabling a detailed analysis of the energetic contributions from the interactions between the ligand and the target protein, as delineated in Table 3. Specifically, Compound 1 exhibited a ΔG of − 48.46 ± 8.48 kcal/mol, while Compound 3 and Compound 4 exhibited ΔGs of − 52.95 ± 8.14 kcal/mol and − 53.30 ± 11.57 kcal/mol, respectively. The control complex showed a ΔG of − 52.14 ± 45.08 kcal/mol. Notably, the ΔG values of these complexes aligned closely with those of the control complex, indicating consistent and robust binding interactions with the target protein. This high degree of agreement with the control complex highlights the effective and stable binding dynamics of these compounds. Additionally, the small standard deviations associated with these values suggest a high level of reliability and reproducibility in the binding energy estimations. Collectively, these data suggest that the compounds under study exhibit a strong affinity for the target protein, classifying them as robust and effective ligands with the potential to modulate protein activity. These results emphasize the potential of these molecules as potent inhibitors within their respective biological pathways.Table 3 MMGBSA analysis of three compounds in complex with protein (a) compound 1, (b) compound 3, (c) compound 4 and the (d) control.Full size tableRG-RMSD and PCA based free energy landscapeThe free energy landscape is a fundamental concept in molecular dynamics simulations, offering insights into the energy distribution within biomolecular systems and their conformational behaviour. This landscape is crucial for understanding the thermodynamic and kinetic properties that influence the actions of complex biomolecular structures. It outlines the energy barriers, stable states, and transition pathways among different molecular conformations. Gaining a deep knowledge of thermodynamics and kinetics over this landscape is vital for understanding the complex interactions, structural changes, and stability of biomolecular complexes. The radius of gyration (RG) analysis provides information on the protein folding process, indicating how much the protein compacts or expands as it folds. On the other hand, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) analysis gives insights into the dynamic stability of the complex by monitoring deviations from a reference conformation over time. To illustrate the 2D (Fig. 7) and 3D (Figure S2) free energy landscapes, graphical representations were created using the geo-measure plugin in pymol, mapping RG against RMSD values. These visuals help in understanding the energy distribution and the structural transitions of the biomolecular complex. For the comparative study we have also performed the PCA based FEL through PCA. The PCA-based free energy landscapes in compound (a), (b), (c), and (d) provide insights into the system's conformational stability. Compound (a) displays a distinct low Gibbs free energy basin, indicating highly stable conformations, while higher energy regions suggest less stable states. Compound (b) similarly highlights stable conformations but also reveals additional metastable states, suggesting the system can occupy several less stable configurations. Compound (c) extends the range of PC1, broadening the low energy basin and indicating greater conformational flexibility and overall stability. Compound (d) adjusts the scale for PC2, reinforcing the stability of the central basin and highlighting energy barriers around it, which represent transitions to less stable states. These landscapes collectively emphasize the stability of the system's conformations and provide a detailed view of its thermodynamic properties as shown in Figure S6.Figure 7RG-RMSD based free energy landscape analysis of three compounds in complex with protein (a) compound 1, (b) compound 3, (c) compound 4 and the (d) control.Full size imageWe employed the methodical framework to analyze ligand-bound complexes along with a control group. The employment of graphical representations enhances the comprehension of energy consequences arising from conformational alterations within the chemical systems studied. Moreover, two-dimensional (Fig. 7) and three-dimensional (Figure S2) visualizations effectively illustrate the dynamic shifts in conformation occurring throughout the simulation process. This visual approach facilitated the identification of a low-energy conformation, unveiling an emergent structural form that provides essential insights into the energetically favorable states of the chemical system. The observation of a deep blue region within the extensive free energy landscape signifies the presence of localized energy minima, consistently observed as the protein structures transitioned into their lowest energy configurations. These localized minima, distinctly indicated by dark blue zones, elucidate the assembly of chemical group structures within minimal energy states. It was noted repeatedly that these complexes preserved localized energy minima within a broader free energy framework, as denoted by the dark blue areas. Further examination of the free energy landscape, in both two and three dimensions, unveils the thermodynamic properties of the studied chemical complexes, including a control compound. These analyses furnish comprehensive insights into their molecular dynamics and stability profiles. A notable characteristic of this landscape is the consistent presence of a relative maximal energy state among these complexes, sustained within an energy range of 14 to 16 kJ/mol. This uniformity across the complexes suggests a potential homogeneity in structural or functional traits, such as molecular interactions or stability. Additionally, all complexes demonstrated a stable conformation at energy levels below 2 kJ/mol, as depicted by the dark blue area on the landscape, corroborating their thermodynamic stability.In this study, we focused on extracting three distinct poses from each biomolecular complex identified within lower energy states, which are typically associated with more stable and energetically favorable conformations. These poses were superimposed on the initial pose of their respective complex, which served as a control to facilitate a direct comparison of structural deviations that occurred during the simulation as illustrated in the Fig. 8. The initial pose acts as a reference point, providing a baseline against which the structural integrity and deviations of subsequent poses can be assessed. To quantify these deviations, we calculated the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for each superimposed structure. RMSD is a statistical measure used extensively in structural biology to calculate the average distance between the backbone atoms of superimposed proteins. It is an indicator of the conformational differences between compared structures, providing insights into the degree of similarity or variance from the initial pose. The Compound 1 exhibited an RMSD of 1.179 Å, indicating minimal deviation from the control and suggesting high structural stability under the simulation conditions. Compound 3 had an RMSD of 1.364 Å, pointing to more significant conformational changes and suggesting a potentially more dynamic behavior within the simulation environment. Compound 4 showed the smallest RMSD of 1.067 Å, implying the greatest conformational stability among the compounds tested. Lastly, the control complex, which is crucial for comparative analysis, showed an RMSD of 1.206 Å. This value establishes a baseline for understanding the degree of structural fluctuations that might be considered normal within this specific experimental setup. These RMSD values are crucial in providing a clear, quantitative view of how each compound's conformation varies from the initial structure, offering essential insights into the dynamic stability and conformational behaviours of the complexes under study. Through this analysis, we can better understand the structural dynamics that underpin the behaviour of these complexes in their respective lower energy states.Figure 8Superimposed representation of three selected compounds in complex with the target protein (a) compound 1 (b) compound 3 (c) compound 4 and (d) control.Full size imageDiscussionThis study has rigorously evaluated the potential of specific compounds as inhibitors of the influenza polymerase PB2 CAP-binding domain, a critical target for antiviral strategies against the influenza virus. The comprehensive use of virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provided a detailed comparative analysis of compounds 1, 3, and 4, alongside a control compound39,40. Our findings offer valuable insights into their respective binding affinities, dynamic stability, and molecular interactions, facilitating a nuanced understanding of their potential as therapeutic agents41. Each compound demonstrated unique properties in terms of binding affinity and stability within the binding domain of PB2, as revealed through our computational analyses42. Compound 1 consistently showed a high binding affinity, underscored by its low RMSD values throughout the simulation, indicating a stable interaction with the target. It was noted for engaging in extensive hydrophobic interactions and crucial π–π stacking interactions, contributing significantly to its strong binding profile. Compound 3 exhibited moderate RMSD values, indicating relatively less stability compared to Compounds 1 and 4. The dynamic nature observed through the simulation suggests that while it is an effective binder, its fluctuating conformation could impact its functional efficacy under varying physiological conditions. Compound 4 stood out with the lowest RMSD values among the compounds tested, implying superior stability and potentially the most effective inhibition of the PB2 domain. It also demonstrated a robust interaction profile similar to Compound 1, characterized by multiple effective hydrophobic and π–π stacking interactions. Another work conducted on the PB2 domain also discovered some common interactions, such as Phe363, Lys376, Arg332, Asn429, Glu361, and Phe404which support our findings43. Simmilarly research conducted by lei zhao in 2020 is also supports are finding. The control compound provided a standard for comparison, exhibiting RMSD values that help benchmark the novel compounds. Its performance was instrumental in establishing a context for evaluating the novel compounds' relative effectiveness and stability. Through MD simulations, we gained deeper insights into the structural dynamics of the interactions34,39, Both Compound 1 and Compound 4 displayed substantial stability, suggesting that they maintain consistent interactions with the PB2 domain over time. Compound 3, while effective, showed potential variability in its binding, which could be explored further to understand any implications for its therapeutic use. The binding free energies calculated for the compounds provided a quantitative measure of their binding efficacy. Compound 4 exhibited the most favourable free energy profile, indicating the strongest and most stable binding among the compounds tested. Compound 3 and Compound 1 followed, with Compound 3 slightly outperforming Compound 1 in terms of energy favorability, although with less stability as noted in the RMSD and dynamic observations44.In addition the excluded compound 2 demonstrated a protein root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value of 10 Å, indicating the degree of structural deviation from the initial conformation over the course of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. For the ligand associated with Compound 2, the RMSD value remained below 7.5 Å during the initial 100 ns (ns) of the simulation, suggesting a relatively stable interaction and minimal deviation from its original binding position. However, as the simulation progressed from 100 to 500 ns, the ligand RMSD increased to values less than 20 Å (Figure S3 (a)). This rise in RMSD indicates greater fluctuations and possibly a less stable interaction between the ligand and the protein over this period. The protein's root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) analysis showed a value of 2.5 Å for the region encompassing amino acid residues 100 to 110 (Figure S3 (b)). RMSF values reflect the flexibility of specific regions of the protein, and a value of 2.5 Å in this segment suggests moderate flexibility in this region. Throughout the MD simulation, the formation of two hydrogen bonds was detected shortly after the simulation began. Hydrogen bond formation is crucial for maintaining the stability of the protein–ligand complex and influences the binding affinity (Figure S3 (e)). Furthermore, radius of gyration (Rg) and RMSD-based analysis of the free energy landscape (FEL) revealed a less stable energy transition (Figure S3 (c-d)) and PCA based FEL (Figure S4). This analysis provides insights into the stability and conformational states of the protein–ligand complex, suggesting that the system experiences transitions between less stable states over the course of the simulation. The examination of the superimposed structural poses, obtained by aligning the structures at different time points, indicated an overall RMSD value of 1.705 Å as shown in (Figure S5). This value represents the average deviation of the backbone atoms from the reference structure, reflecting the overall structural stability and conformational changes of the protein–ligand complex throughout the simulation.Our approach resonates with contemporary antiviral research methodologies, particularly those targeting essential viral proteins. Research methodologies similar to ours have been pivotal in advancing inhibitors for other critical viral targets, such as the HIV reverse transcriptase and hepatitis C virus polymerase. These studies emphasize the importance of understanding molecular interactions and dynamics, which are crucial for optimizing compound efficacy and developing effective therapeutic agents.ConclusionThis study systematically explored the inhibitory potential of compounds targeting the influenza polymerase PB2 CAP-binding domain, utilizing a combination of virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings provide a detailed comparative analysis of three novel compounds—compounds 1, 3, and 4—against a control, revealing critical insights into their binding affinities, stability, and interaction dynamics. Compound 4 emerged as the most promising candidate, demonstrating superior binding stability and the lowest root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values, suggesting it maintains the most consistent interaction with the target protein. This compound also exhibited the most favorable free energy profile, indicating strong and stable binding, which is crucial for effective inhibition. Compound 3, while displaying slightly higher RMSD values, also showed potential with its considerable binding affinity, although its dynamic fluctuations suggest further investigation is needed to fully understand its therapeutic potential. Compound 1, though slightly less effective in binding energy compared to Compound 4, still maintained robust interactions and stability, marking it as a viable candidate. These computational insights lay a strong foundation for future experimental validation. The next steps should involve in vitro and in vivo studies to confirm the inhibitory effects observed in silico and to assess the pharmacological properties of these compounds. Additionally, exploring resistance mechanisms and potential combination therapies could enhance the therapeutic utility and lifespan of these inhibitors.

Molina, MD, is a board-certified allergist with her own private practice, Corpus Christi Allergy Associates. learn more Close Cheryl Chan / Getty Images Cold and flu season may leave you wary about touching bus and subway poles, doorknobs, and even shaking a stranger's hand. Flu germs typically live on surfaces for 24 to 48 hours, while cold viruses last several hours. Some evidence suggests that the flu virus may live on fabric for about eight hours. Adults have an average of two to three colds per year, and children get even more. You can get a cold or the flu any time of year, but they are more common during the colder months. How Long Do Cold and Flu Germs Live on Surfaces? Flu viruses can survive on hard surfaces and infect another person for 24 to 48 hours. Cold viruses don't survive as long. Some evidence suggests they can survive and be passed on for several hours. Factors that can affect how long cold and flu germs last on surfaces include: Environment: Research has shown that high humidity and warm temperatures can decrease how long cold and flu viruses last on surfaces.Structure of viruses: Cold and flu viruses have a lipid (fat) covering that protects them from certain conditions.Type of surface: There are certain hotspots for germs. Viruses generally live longer on non-porous surfaces compared to porous surfaces. Non-porous surfaces are plastic and stainless steel counters, poles, and doorknobs. Porous surfaces include cloth, paper, and tissues. The longer the virus sits on a surface, the lower the risk of you catching a cold or flu. "People can definitely get it from touching bus poles, especially in the five to 10 minutes that elapse from a sick person getting off the bus and someone else getting on," Alison Carey, MD, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Drexel University, told Health. How Viruses Spread It's less common, but you can get sick from touching an infected surface. Someone who has a cold or the flu can sneeze into their hand and then infect a surface like doorknobs or bus poles. Anyone who opens the same door or grabs the same pole for the next few hours—and possibly up to a whole day or two—may catch the illness. Prevention Prevention comes down to good hand hygiene and proper sneezing etiquette. Regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. It's important not to touch your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. You introduce viruses to spots on your body where they can enter if you have touched an infected surface and then bring your hand up to cover a yawn, rub your eye, or scratch your nose. How To Reduce Your Risk at Home Take these steps to help prevent flu and colds: Avoid people who are sick. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or use the inside of your elbow when you sneeze or cough. Disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as counters and doorknobs. Get an annual flu vaccine. Stay home if you have a cold or flu. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available. Wash your hands frequently and for 20 seconds with soap and water. How To Reduce Your Risk in Public Places You can take these additional steps when in public: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Carry disinfecting wipes to clean hard surfaces. Carry hand sanitizer in a purse, backpack, or carrying case. Consider wearing a mask in densely populated places like buses, subways, and airplanes. A Quick Review Flu and cold viruses can survive on hard surfaces for 24 to 48 hours. It's very possible to get these viruses after touching surfaces like countertops, doorknobs, and subway poles. Just because you have touched one of these surfaces does not mean you will get infected. Keeping your hands away from your face and washing them or using hand sanitizer frequently helps prevent the virus from getting inside your body. Stay at home and away from others until your symptoms improve if you do get a cold or the flu. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

Attracting more than 887 participants globally, the webinar introduced the OFFLU AIM project, provided a technical overview, discussed its limitations, and established a feedback forum for stakeholders.Individuals signing up to the webinar were interested about vaccination schedules in different regions, vaccine effectiveness and concerns about export impacts as well as the availability and different types of vaccines. While the webinar addressed specifically the AIM project, nevertheless, this showed the interest and importance of the broader picture of vaccination of poultry against HPAI. Launched in 2022, the OFFLU AIM provides up-to-date information to the poultry sector, governments, and vaccine manufacturers on the antigenic characteristics of circulating avian influenza viruses, including comparisons with widely used vaccine antigens. This information facilitates the selection and updating of appropriate vaccines for poultry.Although not the only challenge with vaccination against avian influenza, influenza evolution and subsequent antigenic drift is significant challenge and highlights the importance of post-vaccination surveillance and surveillance in wild birds. Antigenic drift can potentially reduce vaccine effectiveness, impacting protection against disease and viral shedding. This evolution necessitates constant monitoring and updating of vaccine strains to ensure continued efficacy and sufficient protection of birds against disease.The spread of HPAI through wild bird introductions across Eurasia, Africa, and into North America has led to increased interest in vaccination in regions where it was previously not considered. Countries facing new epidemic threats are now reviewing their prevention and control strategies, with vaccination emerging as a viable tool. Effective vaccination could protect outdoor-reared flocks and enable their maintenance during high-risk periods. However, the success of such strategies hinges on the availability of well-matched vaccines.To address these challenges, through the joint WOAH-FAO network of expertise on animal influenzas, OFFLU, the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA, UK) and Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe, Italy), Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory (SEPRL, USA) and Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness (ACDP, Australia) have embarked on a collaborative initiative called Avian Influenza Matching (AIM). The goal of this initiative is to generate a panel of reagents which can be used for standardized testing of circulating avian influenza viruses against widely used poultry vaccine strains to provide countries with information on the antigenic characteristics of currently circulating avian influenza viruses and trigger an alert for the need to update poultry vaccines.The process involves producing sera panels and antigens that will serve as reference reagents for laboratories and partners within the OFFLU network. Testing of viruses will be carried out periodically and reports will be released through the OFFLU network, with the collaboration of the Royal Veterinary College (RVC, London) map the antigenic properties of these viruses. By sharing reference sera panels with international partners, the initiative seeks to enhance geographical representation and ensure comprehensive monitoring.The ongoing assessment of antigenic changes in circulating viruses will inform the continuous expansion and updating of sera panels. This approach will facilitate the timely selection of appropriate vaccines and the updating of poultry vaccine antigens, thereby maintaining the efficacy of vaccination programs.

About 800,000 birds were euthanized after test results on Oct. 15 showed that they were infected with avian influenza.The infected individuals had mild symptoms and were provided with antiviral medication. Their test samples were forwarded to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for final confirmation and analysis of the virus.Additional testing of employees at the facility is pending and officials said the number of cases under investigation may change.“Washington has monitored the spread of H5N1 closely since it was first detected in poultry in the state in 2022, and our state is prepared with the knowledge, relationships, and tools to minimize its impacts on our community,” Washington Secretary of Health Dr. Umair Shah said in the news release.RECOMMENDED•oregonlive.comMonkeys escape research facility, residents should secure doors and windows, South Carolina police sayNov. 7, 2024, 12:12 p.m.Poachers exploit demand for eagle feathers, sacred among Native AmericansNov. 7, 2024, 9:00 a.m.Officials say most cases of humans infected with the virus occur after prolonged, close contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. The CDC considers the risk to the general public from this H5N1 avian influenza to be low, but cautions that people with job-related or recreational exposure to infected birds, cattle, or other potentially impacted animals are at higher risk of infection. Health officials reminded members of the public to never handle or allow pets near dead birds.

Vaccines Next in Flu Guide Flu Stages: A Day-by-Day Guide Close Influenza, commonly called the flu, is a viral illness that causes respiratory symptoms as well as muscle aches, fever, headache, and fatigue. Rest and at-home self-care often relieve flu symptoms with time. However, people with a high risk of flu complications or extremely sick from the flu may need to take antiviral medications. Illustration by Julie Bang for Verywell Health Influenza Home Treatment to Get Over Flu If you have the flu, the most important thing to do is stay home and get plenty of rest and sleep. This will help you get better quickly and prevent you from spreading the virus to others. Other ways to take care of yourself and improve your symptoms when you have the flu include: Drinking plenty of fluids (water, broth, and tea) Avoiding alcohol Not smoking Using cough drops to relieve your sore throat Using a humidifier for nasal congestion Breathing in steam Consuming honey for cough Some people believe that natural remedies, such as echinacea, vitamin C, probiotics, elderberry, ginseng, and zinc, may help to prevent or treat viral illnesses like colds and flu. However, the evidence of their effectiveness is mixed and controversial. How Long to Stay Home With the Flu When you have the flu, it’s typically best to stay home and avoid direct contact with other people until you haven’t had a fever and your symptoms have improved for at least 24 hours. Over-the-Counter Medications for Symptoms Several over-the-counter (OTC) medications may help to alleviate influenza symptoms. Examples include: Advil (ibuprofen) or Tylenol (acetaminophen) for pain, aches, and fever Aspirin for pain and fever, but only for adults Cough and cold medicines, such as Robitussin (dextromethorphan), Sudafed (pseudoephedrine), and Mucinex (guaifenesin) Make sure to let your healthcare provider know if you’re planning on taking any of these OTC medications and are worried about side effects. It’s especially important to talk to your healthcare provider before taking any medication if you’re pregnant or nursing. When to Consider Antivirals In rare cases, the flu can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications. Examples include pneumonia, seizures, myocarditis (inflammation of the heart), and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). People who are over 65 years old, under 5 years old, pregnant, or immunocompromised (whether by a chronic health condition or a temporary situation, such as recovering from an illness) have a higher risk of developing these complications. If any of these circumstances apply to you or you have severe flu symptoms, such as an extremely high fever, your healthcare provider may recommend taking antiviral drugs. Antiviral drugs don’t “cure” the flu but can lessen its duration and severity. Four antiviral drugs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of influenza: Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) Relenza (zanamivir) Rapivab (peramivir) Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) Typically, your healthcare provider will recommend that you start taking antiviral drugs within two days of your first flu symptoms. Xofluza works in one dose, while Tamiflu and Relenza are taken for five days. Rapivab is administered intravenously. Side Effects of Antiviral Medications Antiviral drugs typically don’t cause serious side effects for most people. Some of the most common side effects from FDA-approved antiviral medications for the flu include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bronchospasms (tightening of the airways). Does Any Flu Treatment Work Best? For most people, the flu goes away on its own within two weeks. Most fevers last up to three or four days. Rest, fluids, and OTC medications (if needed) may speed up the process slightly or make you more comfortable while you recover. In terms of prescription treatments for the flu, antiviral drugs are currently the only FDA-approved option. All four have been found to be safe and effective for most people. One 2021 systematic review and network meta-analysis found that Relenza was most effective in shortening the length of the illness. Meanwhile, Xofluza had the highest chance of reducing the risk of influenza complications. Is the Flu Vaccine Treatment? According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), almost everyone over 6 months old should get the seasonal flu vaccine. The flu shot works to prevent flu and related complications, especially for people with a higher risk of getting very sick from influenza viruses. However, it doesn’t treat the flu, and you shouldn’t get the vaccine when you are seriously ill. When Is Flu Season? In the United States, flu season typically lasts from October to April. For most people, it’s best to get vaccinated fairly early in flu season (i.e., in September or October). Summary Most people can recover from the flu within two weeks with rest and self-care options, such as drinking plenty of fluids, consuming honey, avoiding drinking and smoking, breathing in warm steam, and using cough drops and a humidifier. Some people also benefit from taking over-the-counter (OTC) medications, such as pain relievers and cough and cold medicines. Your healthcare provider might prescribe antiviral drugs if you have a high risk of serious flu complications due to age, pregnancy, illness, or a chronic condition. These medications can shorten the length of your sickness and make it less likely that you’ll need to be hospitalized for complications like pneumonia. 9 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Video by Andy Savage and Kevin Lau Images blog posts New vaccinations against influenza and the virus that causes COVID-19 are available and arriving at physician offices and pharmacies. University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign microbiology professor Chris Brooke is a virologist who studies respiratory viruses. He sat down with News Bureau biomedical sciences editor Liz Ahlberg Touchstone to discuss what’s in the new vaccines, the best time to get them and why we need them at all. Why do we need yet another COVID-19 shot?Microbiology professor Chris Brooke studies respiratory viruses.Photo by Fred ZwickyDeleteEdit embedded media in the Files Tab and re-insert as needed.align image leftalign image centeralign image rightThat’s a good question. This virus is evolving much faster than we ever expected it to. As new variants emerge that are distinct from those viruses that have circulated previously, which were covered by the previous vaccines, we have to update the vaccines to make them more effective. It seems like COVID-19 shots are going to be a yearly thing, like flu shots. We see new variants emerging every few months, and unfortunately, they are evolving to look differently to our immune systems than those strains that have circulated previously. We have to update the vaccines to make sure they are protective against these new variants that are circulating. As long as we’re seeing the evolution of these new variants, we’re going to have to keep updating the COVID-19 shot.What’s in this year’s flu shot? Does it protect against bird flu?This year’s flu shot was developed like flu shots in the past. It carries three different strains of influenza virus that public health experts estimate will circulate later this year. The bird flu strains are quite different from the seasonal influenza strains that we are used to seeing circulate in humans, so the standard flu shot is not really going to offer protection against bird flu. Researchers are absolutely working on bird flu vaccines. Bird flu has been a threat that’s been out there for 20-plus years. There are vaccines already developed that target the currently circulating H5 viruses, even the ones in cows that people are concerned about. So if this virus were to jump into people, we would be better positioned to roll out a vaccine to protect us against it than we were when the COVID-19 pandemic started. We already have these vaccines developed.Who should get the new COVID-19 and flu shots? Ideally, everyone would get their flu and COVID-19 shots every year. I’d say the biggest priority is going to be people who are most susceptible to severe infection: people who are elderly or immunocompromised for various reasons, or those who are especially exposed to individuals who may be sick — if you work in a healthcare setting or in a school, for instance. You don't need to have had the previous vaccinations to make this one work.What’s the best time to get these vaccinations for maximum efficacy?For flu shots, it’s best to get it about a month or two before flu season really kicks off. It’s a little bit different every year, but flu season usually starts picking up around November. So really, starting now, you’re good to get the shot. You can get your flu shot and your COVID-19 shot at the same time. They put one in each arm and that’s usually how I do it. Do the shots really work? Is it worth the side effects, when I might not even get either virus? The main question I get is whether someone should get the vaccine. I think that is obviously a personal decision, but the vaccine absolutely decreases the severity and duration of infection.Everyone is going to be exposed, particularly to COVID-19. If you haven’t been infected or vaccinated in the last six months, getting vaccinated will definitely help. It will almost certainly decrease the severity and duration of any of any COVID-19 infection that you get — and you are going to be exposed. It’s the same for influenza virus. While there are particularly side effects with the RNA-based COVID vaccines, generally speaking, from my experience, they they're much milder than the actual virus.

Participants were categorized into persistent non-responders and persistent responders based on their hemagglutinationinhibition (HAI) antibody titers to the H1N1 component from each vaccine administered between the 2019-2020 to 2023-2024 seasons. Persistent responders had higher fold change in H1N1 HA-specific CD21 expressing B-cells, plasmablasts, and plasma cells. A significant increase in H1N1 HA-specific transitional B-cells in persistent non-responders was observed. The frequency and fold change of H1N1-specific IgM-expressing memory B-cells was higher in persistent non-responders. Dimensionality reduction analysis also demonstrated higher IgM expression for persistent nonresponders than persistent responders. Furthermore, persistent non-responders had a significant fold change increase in IgA tissue-like memory, IgG exhausted tissue-like memory, and double negative (DN) activated memory cells. In contrast, persistent responders had increased frequency of IgGactivated memory B-cells, IgG resting B-cells and DN resting B-cells. Correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between HAI titers and DN memory B-cells and a negative correlation between HAI titers and IgG-expressing memory B-cells in persistent non-responders. Conversely, persistent responders had a positive correlation between HAI titers and IgA resting memory B-cells and a negative correlation between IgG memory B-cells and DN memory B-cells. Overall, this study provided valuable insights into the differential immune memory B-cell responses following influenza virus vaccination and paves the way for future research to further unravel the complexities of vaccineinduced memory B-cells and ultimately improve vaccination strategies against influenza virus infection.

It's not clear if the case is reflected in California's latest total.In a statement, the county said the case was detected based on symptoms, with results confirmed by lab tests. All people who were exposed to the cattle have been notified and are being monitored for symptoms.The newly confirmed California cases raise the US number of human H5 infections this year to 27, which doesn't yet include four presumptive positive cases reported in poultry workers in Washington state.Meanwhile, US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed one more H5N1 outbreak in a California dairy herd, raising the state's total to 134. Quest Diagnostics to introduce H5 avian flu testIn other H5 developments, Quest Diagnostics today announced that the CDC has awarded it several contracts to support testing and lab readiness for H5 avian flu and Oropouche virus, a vectorborne illness that is expanding its reach in the Americas.The H5 molecular test is intended for use in people with suspected infections and will be available with a prescription from a healthcare provider by the end of the month. The test is designed to identify the H5 avian flu virus, but not seasonal flu strains or other respiratory viruses. The test uses respiratory or conjunctival specimens.Currently, commercial labs don't do H5 subtyping, which requires that the samples be sent to state or local public health labs or to the CDC for avian influenza identification. "With the introduction of the new Quest test this month, physicians can now order testing from a national commercial laboratory, increasing access and testing capacity, should testing need increase," the company said in its statement.

Hannah Beier / Bloomberg via Getty Images fileOct. 22, 2024, 10:40 PM UTCBy Evan BushThe SummaryFour new presumed cases of bird flu in farmworkers in Washington state bring the U.S. total to 31. The risk that the virus will mutate to spread easily between people is low, but experts say ongoing transmission in cows is worrisome.The arrival of flu season brings added risks, as viruses can swap genetic material if two infect a host at once. Four new cases of avian influenza were detected in farmworkers in Washington state this week, the latest in a drumbeat of human infections cropping up across the U.S. as the virus continues to spread among farm animals. Washington is the sixth state to report human cases of bird flu, which has spread rampantly in wild birds, poultry and cattle. Assuming the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms the state’s positive tests, they will bring the U.S. tally to at least 31.Flu experts said the risk of a broader outbreak among humans will continue to simmer if the virus remains uncontrolled in animals.“The longer this virus hangs out in the environment, the more animals it spills over into, the more it changes in ways we don’t understand or predict, the more concerned we are going to be that this becomes the next global pandemic,” said Dr. Amber Itle, the Washington state veterinarian.For now, however, health officials maintain that the virus has not made key genetic changes that would allow it to spread between people. “There is no evidence of any sustained human transmission. And that is a key milestone for all of us. It’s a key trigger for all of us. That’s when we really start to say, ‘Oh, something that’s markedly different about this virus,’” Dr. Umair Shah, Washington’s health secretary, said at a news conference Sunday. A CDC spokesperson said Tuesday morning that a federal team was being deployed to Washington and that risk to the public remained low. However, the virus is a growing concern for farmworkers on the front lines. The four latest cases were among workers who had culled birds at a commercial egg farm where an outbreak of avian influenza was reported in chickens.Shah said the workers were part of a contract crew tasked with depopulating — or euthanizing — all chickens at the farm in Franklin County, in southeastern Washington, which had more than 800,000 birds. Itle said the workers wore full protective equipment: suits made of Tyvek, goggles and respirators. “It’s hot, it’s dusty. It’s a lot of birds in close proximity, and we’re getting a lot of viral exposure,” she said.The four people who tested positive after that work reported mild respiratory symptoms and conjunctivitis, or pink eye — symptoms now understood to be common when people are infected. None of the workers were hospitalized. Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, said the Washington cases represented “more of the same” in a pattern observed across the U.S. as workers tasked with culling sick animals have fallen ill. However, one human case — in Missouri — has puzzled researchers and health officials, because that person did not have contact with animals. It is not clear how the person was exposed, and results of further tests that could offer clues are still pending, according to the CDC. Six health workers exposed to the patient reported respiratory symptoms.Webby said the virus’ spread in cows for the past 10 months has raised experts’ level of concern because cows are mammals and interact with humans frequently. That increases the likelihood the virus could mutate to pass from person to person. “Just because it hasn’t happened in 10 months … it doesn’t mean it can’t,” said Webby, an infectious disease researcher at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Research suggests that incredible amounts of virus are shed in infected cows’ mammary glands, so the virus could spread through raw milk. (Milk sold in grocery stores is pasteurized, which inactivates the virus.) At the same time, the U.S. is preparing for flu season, when circulation of common influenza viruses increases in fall and winter. If two influenza viruses share the same host, they can share genetic information and mutate more quickly.“You don’t want people affected with the seasonal flu virus to get a virus from animals and for those viruses to potentially recombine,” said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, a professor of environmental and occupational health sciences at the University of Washington and the director of its Center for One Health Research.Rabinowitz added that it is important to improve protection protocols for farmworkers and encourage them to get their flu shots. “This is a wakeup call. We need to do a better job of protecting workers,” he said.Itle said cases in poultry were not unexpected in Washington state, because migrating birds passed through during summer and early fall. Recently, owls and other birds of prey were found dead, suggesting some wild animals had been stricken with the virus. Wild birds can spread the virus to farms through direct contact with poultry or livestock or via droppings, saliva or feed. More than 103 million birds have been sickened, killed or culled in the current bird flu outbreak, according to CDC statistics. The virus has been detected in poultry in 48 states. The CDC says 330 dairy herds have been affected. Washington has not had an outbreak among dairy producers, Itle said, but dairy farms there are now testing weekly.Evan BushEvan Bush is a science reporter for NBC News.

(Scott Olson/Getty Images) Four agricultural workers in southeast Washington have preliminarily tested positive for bird flu after working around an infected poultry flock at a commercial egg farm. The cases, if confirmed, would be the first time people in Washington have contracted the virus since officials began tracking a notable rise of it in birds and other animals starting in the U.S. around 2022. Since then, upward of two dozen human cases have been detected across five other states — all but one tied to contact with infected animals. Health officials emphasized that the four positive cases in Washington are “presumptive,” pending confirmation and analysis by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We are still going through the ongoing investigation,” Dr. Umair Shah, Washington’s secretary of health, said during an online press conference on Sunday. “At this time, we believe the individuals that we have gotten the results back have been exposed to infected poultry. We do not have evidence at this time of human-to-human spread. However, that is still part of our investigation,” Shah added. The Washington farm workers who appear to have the virus have not been hospitalized, according to state and local health officials. Dr. Steven Krager, the local health officer for Benton and Franklin counties, said the workers had shown signs of mild upper respiratory illness, including runny nose, sore throat, and mild cough, as well as conjunctivitis — often referred to as “pink eye.” The outbreak at a commercial egg farm in Franklin County involves a flock of about 800,000 birds. It is the first bird flu incident at a commercial poultry farm this year. Test results on Oct. 15 showed the poultry were infected with bird flu. Testing of people showing symptoms of the virus was arranged on Friday and results indicating that they were positive came back late Saturday, Krager said. ‘Evolving situation’ The type of bird flu that has been circulating in the U.S. is known formally as an H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza. This disease has caused outbreaks across the country in poultry, dairy cows, and various wildlife, including harbor seals in northwest Washington. Risks to the general public are considered low, according to the CDC. So far, it’s people who spend time around animals that get the virus who are more likely to catch it. But health officials are on alert for indications the disease is changing in a way that could allow for sustained person-to-person spread or more severe illness in humans. A leading concern is that the virus could mutate in ways that allow it to spread easily among people. Between 2003 and April of this year, the World Health Organization recorded 889 cases and 463 deaths in 23 countries caused by the H5N1 bird flu virus. “If we were to look at all avian influenza H5 infections reported since 2003, the case fatality rate is quite high, over 50%,” noted Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett, the state Department of Health’s chief science officer. “We’re not seeing that here. But that is something that would be very worrisome, and so severity of illness is something that we’ll want to monitor closely,” he said. Shah said that 25 people had been tested so far as part of the response in Franklin County and that 12 tests had come back negative. “This is an evolving situation,” he said. “There are more individuals that we want to continue to conduct our investigation with and more individuals that we want to potentially test for. And that’s what we are in the process of doing right now.” The other five states that have had documented bird flu infections in humans include California, Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, and Texas. Cases across those states, since April, totaled 27, according to CDC figures updated Friday. Of those, a combined 23 were in either California or Colorado. Nationwide, 16 cases are confirmed to have been the H5N1 version of the virus. A single human case in Missouri is the only one that the CDC data doesn’t connect to exposure to infected poultry or cattle. ‘Not unexpected’ Bird flu can decimate poultry flocks, rapidly causing severe illness and death for fowl. Fall is a risky time of year for the disease in Washington because it is relatively common among migratory wild birds. Wild birds that travel north from the lower 48 states in summer mingle with other birds from Asia and Europe — a ripe opportunity for bird flu to spread and evolve. “We all kind of hold our breath and wait for them to come back down and see what kind of reassortment they’ve brought with them,” said the state veterinarian, Amber Itle. “This was not unexpected that we would see some additional detections of the avian influenza virus again this fall. But we were sure hoping that it would be a less pathogenic strain.” Since 2022, Washington has seen avian influenza in 47 flocks of poultry. Two of them were commercial, including the Franklin County outbreak, and the rest were domestic. The other commercial flock was about 1 million birds. The domestic flocks varied widely in size. Itle said the state and agricultural operations are monitoring for bird flu at other poultry and dairy farms in the vicinity of the one where the latest bird flu outbreak occurred. She declined to provide specifics on the number of farms in the immediate area, but said there are no signs currently that the virus has spread to dairy cattle. “This detection that we have is a poultry strain, it is not a dairy strain,” Itle said. “We’ve had no detections in dairies in Washington state.” The birds at the Franklin County farm where the outbreak occurred were almost all euthanized by Sunday, Itle said. She said that eggs from the site would be destroyed as well. “Your eggs are safe and your poultry is safe,” she said. “No birds that are infected or have been infected are entering the food chain. They’re all being disposed of, and will be undergoing composting that can deactivate this virus.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a program to compensate farmers for losses tied to bird flu. But Itle highlighted that the killing of thousands of birds can be trying for farm owners and workers, especially as risks from the virus are still present on a farm. There are recommended personal protective equipment guidelines for sites where the disease is present. And the state has protective gear it can make available upon request. People with backyard flocks of poultry need to be vigilant as well. State agriculture officials estimate about 15% of migrating waterfowl are infected with bird flu and can easily contaminate an environment by landing in a pond, entering a coop, or gathering food around bird feeders. “The most important thing you can do if you have backyard poultry is to keep your birds in and away from wild waterfowl,” Itle said. “It’s really, really important because we need to protect your birds. But also we need to protect you.” XFour farm workers in Washington appear to test positive for bird flu by Bill Lucia, Washington State Standard October 20, 2024 Four farm workers in Washington appear to test positive for bird flu by Bill Lucia, Washington State Standard October 20, 2024 Four agricultural workers in southeast Washington have preliminarily tested positive for bird flu after working around an infected poultry flock at a commercial egg farm.

However, there had not been any HPAI detections in commercial broiler flocks in the United States since February, when a commercial broiler flock in Gage County, Nebraska, and a commercial broiler breeder flock in Delta County, Colorado, were affected.This is the third commercial poultry flock in the United States to be affected by HPAI in just a two-day span. The previous two instances involved commercial table egg laying flocks in Cache County, Utah, and Franklin County, Washington, with both of those situations being confirmed on October 15. The Washington State Department of Health has also reported that four workers at that Franklin County farm have tested presumptive-positive for HPAI.H5N1 continues to plague California cattleThe Tulare County case is the sixth instance of HPAI infecting a commercial poultry operation in California in 2024.However, the virus has been much more present in dairy cattle herds this year.According to APHIS, 97 commercial dairy herds in the state have been affected by H5N1 during the past 30 days alone. It has not, however, affected any beef cattle in the state do date.View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.

Photo Details / Download Hi-Res Protect yourself from flu Published Oct. 21, 2024 By Greg Chadwick Air Force Materiel Command Health and Wellness Team WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Ohio -- Concerned about catching the flu? We are all at risk for getting and spreading the flu. There are many circumstances you and your family can be exposed to the flu virus. School, daycare, travel, work, and public places like stores, restaurants, airports, and fitness centers are germ-charged environments that facilitate the spread of flu. In the U.S,, flu season occurs in the fall and winter. While influenza viruses circulate year-round, most of the time flu activity peaks between December and February. Learn how to protect yourself from seasonal flu. How does flu make you sick? Flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. When people with the flu cough or sneeze, you can inhale droplets that contain flu viruses. The viruses infect your cells and make copies of themselves. Flu virus infection triggers inflammation in your body, which produces flu symptoms. Severe inflammation can cause lung damage and other serious problems. Your body’s immune system responds by sending proteins called antibodies to fight the infection. Some people experience serious flu complications that can lead to hospitalization and even death. What are symptoms of flu? Fever. Chills and sweats. Muscle or body aches. Cough. Headache. Sore Throat. Runny or stuffy nose. Tiredness or feeling run down. Eye pain. You may not have all these symptoms. What should you do if you get flu? Flu symptoms usually come on suddenly and are worse than the common cold. Flu spreads easily from person to person, so if you have flu-like symptoms stay home except to get medical care. Cover your coughs and sneezes with tissues and clean your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub. Most people can manage flu symptoms at home and recover in a few days to less than two weeks, but some people will develop complications, like pneumonia, which can be life-threating. Because flu can cause severe illness, it’s important to keep an eye on your symptoms and get medical attention if you need it. This is especially important if you have an underlying health condition. When should I go to the Emergency Room or seek immediate medical attention? Go to the ER or seek immediate medical attention if you have symptoms of severe illness, including: High fever (over 103 °F/40 °C). Difficulty breathing. Not urinating or urinating very little. Pain in your chest or stomach (abdomen) that doesn’t go away. Persistent dizziness. Confusion. Severe muscle pain or weakness. Seizures. Bluish skin, lips or nails (cyanosis, which can be a sign of low oxygen levels in your blood or tissues). Fever or cough that gets better or goes away but then gets worse. Worsening of other health conditions. What should I do when someone is sick? Choose only one caregiver to take care of sick family members. Keep the person with flu in a separate sick room if you can. Limit visitors other than the caregiver. If the sick person must leave the room, ask them to wear a facemask or use a tissue to cover coughs and sneezes. Keep the air clean. Open a window in the sick room or use a fan to keep fresh air flowing. Clean the sick room each day. Wash laundry with normal laundry soap and dry on a hot setting. Keep dirty laundry away from your face and body. Wash your hands right after touching dirty laundry. It’s ok to wash the sick person’s bedding or clothes with other people’s laundry. Wash the sick person’s dishes with normal dish soap or place in the dishwasher. When can I go back to work/school? To avoid spreading the flu to others, you shouldn’t go back to work or school until it has been at least 24 hours since you have had a fever (without taking fever-reducing medications). Your employer or school may have different requirements for returning. How do I know if I have the flu or COVID-19? Since they have similar symptoms, the only way to know for sure if you have the flu or COVID-19 is to get tested. They both have a risk of serious illness. But different viruses cause these infections, and providers treat them with different medications. How can I prevent the flu? “The best way to prevent the flu is to get an annual flu vaccine,” said Lt. Col. Dan Anderson, AFMC Command Public Health Officer. “While the immunization does not completely protect one from catching the flu, it will reduce the severity and duration of illness. In addition to speeding one’s recovery, this also minimizes the amount of time one is infectious and helps protect our friends and loved ones. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention utilizes many data sources, including DoD surveillance, to recommend which specific influenza viruses are included in annual flu vaccines based upon the viruses most likely to circulate during the upcoming flu season.” Anderson advises to speak with your medical provider if you have questions, are pregnant or have other underlying health conditions, and get the flu vaccine before the holidays to strengthen immunity in time to celebrate with your coworkers and family. Getting a flu vaccination in early allows for adequate time to develop enough antibodies, which can take up to two weeks, to provide protection throughout the flu season. Where can I get a flu vaccine? Influenza vaccinations for all military members are a mandatory requirement, and available through each installation’s Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) or at any participating TRICARE eligible pharmacies. To ensure records are updated accordingly, military members must provide their servicing MTF documentation of any vaccination not administered and recorded by a MTF. TRICARE beneficiaries are also eligible for flu shots through immunization clinics on base, or at no cost at TRICARE eligible pharmacies. For the civilian workforce, all Federal Employee Health Benefit plans cover flu shots at no cost for members and are available at local retail pharmacies. You can find a flu vaccine location through vaccines.gov. Go to: https://www.vaccines.gov/ -Select "Find Flu Vaccines" at the top of the page -Enter your 5-digit zip code -Check your "Vaccine Options” -Select "Search for Flu Vaccines" to find a preferred location (Click on the location for further details and contact information) In addition to getting the flu vaccine, there are many everyday preventive measures which can reduce your risk of getting the flu and other respiratory infections. These actions include: Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. Germs spread this way. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick. Flu viruses spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk. Avoid being around other people when you or they are sick with the flu or other infectious diseases. If you become ill, get tested! This can rule-in or rule-out other respiratory viruses such as COVID, pneumonia or Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with viruses that cause the flu at home and work. Avoid large crowds. If you are able to limit contact with people during flu season, you can reduce your risk of getting an infection. Strengthen your immune system. A strong immune system helps your body fight off infections. To build your immunity, sleep at least 7-9 hours per night. Also, maintain a regular physical activity routine-at least 30 minutes, three times a week. In addition, follow a healthy, nutrient-rich eating plan. Limit sugar, junk foods, and fatty foods. Instead, eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, which are full of vitamins and antioxidants, to promote good health.

FLUBLOK, a recombinant influenza vaccine, has been included in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for pregnant and expectant patients since 2016, but now has updated safety data in this population. This inclusion adds to the range of available vaccines, allowing health care providers more flexibility when recommending influenza vaccinations for this vulnerable population.There are risks associated with influenza infection during pregnancy that providers must be aware of. Pregnant women face heightened vulnerabilities caused by physiological changes, and the consequences of influenza infection can be severe. The infection can lead to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular issues, and, in the worst cases, pneumonia, hospitalization, or even death. The fetus may also be at risk because of these complications.Carrico also discussed results of the study results evaluating FLUBLOK in pregnant women, highlighting that the study showed no increased risk of adverse events, such as pregnancy complications, birth outcomes, or neonatal issues, when comparing FLUBLOK to standard influenza vaccines. This is reassuring for health care providers, as it indicates that no vaccine should be withheld when influenza prevention is indicated in this population.Carrico concluded by noting that the availability of FLUBLOK simplifies the vaccination process, particularly for patients who may have concerns, such as avoiding egg-based vaccines. Having more options allows for better patient education, encourages vaccination, and ultimately helps avoid preventable complications, particularly respiratory illnesses, in pregnant women. The broader toolkit empowers health care professionals to make stronger recommendations and ensure better patient outcomes.Recent VideosRelated Content Contemporary OB/GYN week in review: Heart health, medication abortion, and moreCeleste Krewson, Assistant EditorNovember 8th 2024ArticleReview some of the top stories from the Contemporary OB/GYN website over the last week, and catch up on anything you may have missed.Read MoreS4E3: Myfembree for moderate-to-severe endometriosis pain: Potential for adolescentsLindsey Carr, Editor;Jessica Y.

Medscape Medical NewsHow Effective Is the High-Dose Flu Vaccine in Older Adults?Stéphanie Lavaud October 22, 2024 00How can the immunogenicity and effectiveness of flu vaccines be improved in older adults? Several strategies are available, one being the addition of an adjuvant. For example, the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine has shown superior immunogenicity. However, “we do not have data from controlled and randomized clinical trials showing superior clinical effectiveness versus the standard dose,” Professor Odile Launay, an infectious disease specialist at Cochin Hospital in Paris, France, noted during a press conference. Another option is to increase the antigen dose in the vaccine, creating a high-dose (HD) flu vaccine.Why is there a need for an HD vaccine? “The elderly population bears the greatest burden from the flu,” explained Launay. “This is due to three factors: An aging immune system, a higher number of comorbidities, and increased frailty.” Standard-dose flu vaccines are seen as offering suboptimal protection for those older than 65 years, which led to the development of a quadrivalent vaccine with four times the antigen dose of standard flu vaccines. This HD vaccine was introduced in France during the 2021/2022 flu season. A real-world cohort study has since been conducted to evaluate its effectiveness in the target population — those aged 65 years or older. The results were recently published in Clinical Microbiology and Infection.Cohort StudyThe study included 405,385 noninstitutionalized people aged 65 years or older matched with 1,621,540 individuals in a 1:4 ratio. The first group received the HD vaccine, while the second group received the standard-dose vaccine. Both the groups had an average age of 77 years, with 56% women, and 51% vaccinated in pharmacies. The majority had been previously vaccinated against flu (91%), and 97% had completed a full COVID-19 vaccination schedule. More than half had at least one chronic illness.Hospitalization rates for flu — the study’s primary outcome — were 69.5 vs 90.5 per 100,000 person-years in the HD vs standard-dose group. This represented a 23.3% reduction (95% CI, 8.4-35.8; P = .003).Strengths and LimitationsAmong the strengths of the study, Launay highlighted the large number of vaccinated participants older than 65 years — more than 7 million — and the widespread use of polymerase chain reaction flu tests in cases of hospitalization for respiratory infections, which improved flu coding in the database used. Additionally, the results were consistent with those of previous studies.However, limitations included the retrospective design, which did not randomize participants and introduced potential bias. For example, the HD vaccine may have been prioritized for the oldest people or those with multiple comorbidities. Additionally, the 2021/2022 flu season was atypical, with the simultaneous circulation of the flu virus and SARS-CoV-2, as noted by Launay.ConclusionIn conclusion, this first evaluation of the HD flu vaccine’s effectiveness in France showed a 25% reduction in hospitalizations, consistent with existing data covering 12 flu seasons. The vaccine has been available for a longer period in the United States and Northern Europe.“The latest unpublished data from the 2022/23 season show a 27% reduction in hospitalizations with the HD vaccine in people over 65,” added Launay.Note: Due to a pricing disagreement with the French government, Sanofi’s HD flu vaccine Efluelda, intended for people older than 65 years, will not be available this year. (See: Withdrawal of the Efluelda Influenza Vaccine: The Academy of Medicine Reacts). However, the company has submitted a dossier for a trivalent form for a return in the 2025/2026 season and is working on developing mRNA vaccines. Additionally, a combined flu/COVID-19 vaccine is currently in development.The study was funded by Sanofi. Several authors are Sanofi employees. Odile Launay reported conflicts of interest with Sanofi, MSD, Pfizer, GSK, and Moderna.This story was translated from Medscape’s French edition using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process.

The North America influenza vaccine market size was valued at USD 3.65 billion in 2023. The growth of the influenza vaccine market is driven by an estimated 1 billion cases of seasonal influenza each year, including 3-5 million severe cases. 99% of deaths from influenza-related respiratory illnesses in children under 5 occur in developing countries. Request a Sample Copy of the Report @ https://www.precedenceresearch.com/sample/3637 The influenza vaccine market is rapidly growing because to influenza vaccine is the best way to reduce the risk of contracting influenza and its possible consequences. Getting the influenza vaccine can also reduce the likelihood of spreading the influenza to others. There are 4 types of influenza: A, B, C, and D. Influenza A and B are contagious and cause seasonal epidemics. Most people recover from fever and other symptoms within a week without needing medical attention. However, influenza can cause serious illness or death, especially in high-risk groups. Seasonal influenza spreads easily and quickly in crowded areas such as schools and nursing homes. That's why it's important to monitor for the disease and get vaccinated quickly. For Instance, · In April 2023, Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd. announced the recent commissioning of its new influenza vaccine manufacturing facility in Beijing. The factory follows China's Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) guidelines and uses green manufacturing techniques to achieve large-scale electronics production, expand Sinovac's production capacity, and meet the growing global demand for effective influenza vaccines.

However, Asia-Pacific is expected to witness the fastest CAGR from 2024 to 2034. · By vaccine type, the quadrivalent segment has captured highest revenue share of 65% in 2023. However, the trivalent segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.1% from 2024 to 2034. · By technology, the egg-based segment has accounted revenue share of 69% in 2023. · By age group, the pediatric segment has captured revenue share of 59% in 2023. · By route of administration, the nasal spray segment has accounted revenue share of 53% in 2023. Access the Complete Report ToC@ https://www.precedenceresearch.comable-of-content/3637 Buy This Research Report Study@ https://www.precedenceresearch.com/checkout/3637 Top Growth Factors in the Influenza Vaccine Market · Rising Use of seasonal Vaccine: The rising use of seasonal influenza vaccines, where the primary goal is to prevent serious illness from influenza viruses, has led to the growth of the influenza vaccine market. · Vaccination to Elderly People: Advances in effective influenza vaccination must include the development of vaccine resistance, especially in the elderly, which will lead to the growth of the influenza vaccine market dedicated to preventing influenza. · Reduce Risk of Influenza: An influenza vaccine is the paramount way to diminish the risk of getting sick with influenza, this lead growth of influenza vaccine market. Regional Stance North America has the largest market share in terms of the burden of different influenza viruses, and influenza poses a significant burden on the health of Americans each year. The CDC estimates that flu will cause 9.3 million to 41 million illnesses, 100,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations, and 4,900 to 51,000 deaths each year between 2010 and 2023. New treatments and tools are being used medically, leading to the growth of the influenza vaccine market. Asia-Pacific is expected to see the m fastest expansion as development of new influenza vaccines with better protection and increased production capacity is accelerating rapidly. However, concerns remain over the impact of seasonal flu and the low uptake of seasonal influenza vaccines in the Asia-Pacific region. The Indian pharmaceutical industry has helped support the growth of the influenza vaccine market by issuing mandates to increase vaccine manufacturing capacity in developing countries. Rising Influenza Prevalence The increasing number of influenza cases is a major factor in the growth of the influenza vaccine market. Although many people confuse the common cold with the flu due to symptoms such as headache, runny nose, and muscle aches, seasonal influenza is a serious illness that affects 650,000 people annually. The increasing awareness of severe colds, especially among vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems, has highlighted the importance of vaccination and increased the world’s need for influenza vaccines. Next-Generation Vaccines in the Influenza The development of next-generation influenza vaccines presents significant opportunities for the influenza vaccine market. This vaccine is designed to provide long-lasting protection against current and future influenza viruses, including seasonal and preexisting viruses. These next-generation immunogens utilize optimization of the cross-linked immunogen (COBRA) approach to target multiple pathogens across multiple seasons. Utilizing novel HA and NA amino acid sequences derived from multiple consensus layers across various influenza subtypes, these multivalent formulations should provide broad immunity, driving innovation and growth in the influenza vaccine market. Challenges in Production and Efficacy Vaccine The growth of the influenza vaccine market is limited by several key challenges, including the reliance on vaccines derived from embryonated eggs, which leads to long production times. The need for annual vaccination due to the rapid evolution of influenza viruses and the emergence of new antigenic strains further complicates vaccine development. There is also an urgent need to enhance immunity in the elderly and establish a strong protective association. Together, these factors hinder the expansion and effectiveness of existing influenza vaccine strategies, thereby limiting the expansion of the influenza vaccine market. Recent Breakthroughs in the Influenza Vaccine Market Partnership of Sanofi and Novavax in Influenza Vaccine Market Company Name Sanofi and Novavax Headquarter USA Recent Development In May 2024, Sanofi and Novavax announced an exclusive license agreement for the joint commercialization of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the development of a novel influenza-COVID-19 vaccine combination. Ability to accelerate the development of novel influenza-COVID-19 compounds as proven and long-term, cost-effective, approved vaccines provides patients enhanced convenience and protection. Partnership of GSK plc and CureVac N.V. in Influenza Vaccine Market Company Name GSK plc and CureVac N.V. Headquarter United States Recent Development In July 2024, GSK plc and CureVac N.V. announced that they have converted their existing partnership into a new licensing agreement that allows each company to prioritize investment and focus on mRNA development. Acquisition of AstraZeneca and Icosavax, Inc. in the Influenza Vaccine Market Company Name AstraZeneca and Icosavax, Inc. Headquarter United States Recent Development In February 2024, AstraZeneca announced the completion of the acquisition of Icosavax, Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company in the United States focused on the development of differentiated medicines utilizing its protein vaccine-like virus (VLP) platform. Following this acquisition, Icosavax becomes a subsidiary of AstraZeneca and operates in Seattle, USA. Report Highlights By Vaccine Type · The quadrivalent segment holds the largest market because it is used to prevent influenza from both influenza A and influenza B strains. · The trivalent segment is expected to expand at a significant CAGR during the forecast period as the trivalent provided greater protection against influenza and hospitalization in emergency rooms. By Technology · The egg-based segment held the largest market share as it can prompt a patient's immune system to direct antibodies at targets, or “epitopes,” on the vaccine viruses. · The cell culture segment is expected to grow the fastest during the forecast period as cell-based vaccines rapidly produce vaccine products during pandemics. By Route of Administration · The nasal spray has the highest market value because it contains weakened (attenuated) viruses and therefore does not cause flu illness. · The injection segment is anticipated to expand at the fastest rate over the projected period because it helps strengthen the immune system by producing antibodies, and vaccines contain proteins that protect against infections caused by bacteria. Recent News in the Influenza Vaccine Market · In September 2022, Pfizer announced that the first participants have been vaccinated in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the company's flu vaccine quadrivalent modified RNA (modRNA) on approximately 25,000 healthy adults in the United States. · In July 2024, Sanofi began shipping its first flu vaccine in the U.S. in preparation for the 2024/25 flu season. All of Sanofi’s flu vaccines in the U.S. are low-dose, meaning they protect against three common strains of influenza: two strains of influenza A and one strain of influenza B. · In May 2024, Novavax, Inc., a global company developing vaccines using the Matrix-M adjuvant, signed an exclusive agreement with Sanofi.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File) About 800,000 chickens tested positive for avian influenza on a Washington farm. by: Michaela Bourgeois Posted: Oct 21, 2024 / 10:18 AM PDT Updated: Oct 21, 2024 / 10:18 AM PDT SHARE PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) – Officials in Washington are investigating the state’s first-ever presumed human cases of avian influenza after four agricultural workers tested presumptively positive for the disease, the Washington Department of Health announced Sunday. The employees tested presumptively positive for avian influenza — known as bird flu — after working with infected poultry at a commercial egg farm in Franklin County, officials said – noting the workers experienced mild symptoms and were treated with antiviral medication. The farm had a bird flu outbreak in chickens, which led to about 800,000 birds being euthanized after a test from the Washington State Department of Agriculture on Oct. 15 found they all had the disease. Auditor: Gonzalez violated finance laws with Wikipedia spending As the state investigates the presumptive cases, Washington health officials forwarded test samples from the exposed workers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for final confirmation and analysis of the virus. Testing for additional cases from people on the farm is pending and the number of cases under investigation may change, the health department said.

Meteorologists agree PNW will have winter in 2024-25 Employees or contractors who may have worked on a poultry farm in Benton or Franklin counties since Oct. 7 are urged to contact BFHD if they have symptoms including respiratory infections or red eyes, the department said. These mark the first presumptive bird flu cases under investigation in Washington, which is the sixth state to identify a human infection of H5N1, or the virus that causes bird flu. The virus has caused ongoing multi-state outbreaks in poultry, dairy cattle, and wildlife. “Washington has monitored the spread of H5N1 closely since it was first detected in poultry in the state in 2022, and our state is prepared with the knowledge, relationships, and tools to minimize its impacts on our community,” said Washington Secretary of Health Dr. Umair Shah. 131K people left Oregon last year: These were their top destinations Bird flu is caused by avian influenza Type A viruses that naturally occur in wild aquatic birds. The virus can infect other bird species and mammals officials said, adding the virus can be deadly to poultry species such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese, or guinea fowl. The health department said it’s rare for the virus to infect humans and make them sick, noting most cases occur after prolonged, close contact with infected animals or environments. The CDC considers the risk to the general public to be low; however, people with exposures to infected birds, cattle, or other potentially impacted animals are at a higher risk of catching the virus and should take precautions such as wearing PPE.

testing for avian flu later this month based on one of the awards SECAUCUS, N.J., Oct. 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX), a leading provider of diagnostic information services, today announced that it has been awarded several contracts by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to support testing and sustained laboratory readiness for two emerging infectious diseases recently identified in people in the Americas. The agreements will support the nation's preparedness for avian influenza and Oropouche viruses by ensuring a national commercial laboratory provider is able to quickly supplement public health laboratories in the event there is an infectious diseases outbreak in people. The contracts also provide funding to enable the company to maintain testing readiness, such as for adequate supplies of certain equipment and chemical reagents used to perform the tests, on a sustained basis. Quest will introduce an immediate response molecular laboratory test to aid in the detection of avian influenza A H5 virus. The new multi-target molecular diagnostic test is intended for use in people suspected of being infected with influenza A H5 virus. The test will be available with a prescription from a provider for clinical purposes at the end of the month.i Quest's advanced laboratory in San Juan Capistrano, California, developed and will perform the test. With support from CDC, Quest developed the test as part of our ongoing pandemic response efforts. The test helps detect influenza A H5 virus, including A(H5N1), but does not detect seasonal influenza A subtypes, influenza B or other respiratory viruses. The test is intended to be performed using respiratory or conjunctiva specimens collected from people suspected of being infected with influenza A H5 virus, or who meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clinical and/or epidemiological criteria for testing.ii Quest's patient service centers will not provide specimen collection for the test. Avian influenza A(H5N1) virus is a subtype of influenza A virus. Quest and many other commercial laboratories provide nationwide testing for influenza A virus, including seasonal virus subtyping, and other respiratory viruses, but not the H5 subtyping needed to identify avian influenza. Today, specimens that test positive for influenza A virus by Quest or another commercial laboratory, and for which the provider has reason to suspect avian influenza, would need to be sent to state/local public health laboratories or CDC for testing to identify an avian influenza virus infection. With the introduction of the new Quest test this month, physicians can now order testing from a national commercial laboratory, increasing access and testing capacity, should testing need increase. Providers would suspect avian influenza virus infection based on the presence of certain flu-like symptoms or exposure to an infected person or animal. "Emerging diseases like avian influenza require close coordination between the commercial laboratory industry and the CDC and other federal and state agencies to monitor and mobilize a rapid response," said Yuri Fesko, MD, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Quest Diagnostics. "We appreciate CDC's commitment to improving preparedness for any potential future emergencies and the support these contracts will provide to enable us to maintain the infrastructure necessary to act quickly when needed to counteract future health threats." Avian influenza is currently widespread in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in U.S. poultry and dairy cows with recent sporadic human cases primarily among farm workers exposed to infected animals. While the current public health risk is low, CDC is monitoring the situation closely. CDC has also awarded Quest a contract to develop diagnostics to aid the detection of Oropouche virus, an emerging virus in the Americas that is spread to people by infected biting midges and some mosquito species. "While the threat of avian influenza and Oropouche virus to the public remains low, we applaud CDC for its forward-thinking approach to ensuring commercial laboratories are prepared to quickly mobilize should a serious threat to human health emerge," said Elizabeth Marlowe, PhD, Executive Scientific Director at Quest Diagnostics.

Cara Drehoff, DVM, MPH Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, assigned to Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Denver, Colorado Disclosure: Cara Drehoff, DVM, MPH, have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. | October 21, 2024 Editorial Collaboration&In September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the first human case of avian influenza A(H5) in the United States without known exposure to an infected animal. Additionally, no exposure to a sick person was reported.This followed 13 cases reported since April in 2024: four in dairy workers reported across three states (Texas, Michigan, and Colorado) and nine in poultry workers from two facilities in Colorado. An additional 13 cases of avian influenza A(H5) in dairy farm workers in California were also recently confirmed by CDC. A previous case of A(H5) was reported in Colorado in 2022. Medscape spoke with Tim Uyeki, MD, MPH, MPP, Chief Medical Officer for the Influenza Division at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases of the CDC, about the current H5N1 situation and what the CDC is doing to monitor its activity.We also spoke to Cara Drehoff, DVM, MPH, Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer at the CDC, who headed the response to a cluster of cases of poultry workers in Colorado.Text has been edited for length.What is the current state of H5N1 infections among humans in the US? Uyeki: Twenty-seven human cases of avian influenza A(H5) were identified in the US from the end of March through October 18, 2024. This includes 17 cases in dairy cattle workers in four states, nine cases in poultry workers in one state, and one case that was identified in a person without occupational exposure in another state. Nearly all received oseltamivir treatment, and all recovered. 2024 is the first time that dairy cow-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has been reported; to date, these sporadic cases have been identified in workers exposed to infected or presumably infected cows in Texas, Michigan, Colorado, and California in association with the ongoing multistate outbreak of A(H5N1) virus among dairy cattle. Sixteen of the 17 cases to date in dairy farm workers had conjunctivitis, and one case had acute respiratory illness symptoms. None of these cases required hospitalization; they all had clinically mild illness, all were treated or offered oseltamivir treatment, all recovered, and no transmission to close contacts was identified.The nine cases in poultry workers were associated with exposure to A(H5N1) virus during outbreaks among chickens at two commercial egg-laying facilities in Colorado. All of these poultry workers identified with avian influenza A(H5) virus experienced conjunctivitis, a few also had respiratory symptoms, none were hospitalized, and all recovered. No secondary transmission to close contacts was detected. The CDC also confirmed a case in Missouri who was hospitalized with atypical symptoms. Investigations did not identify any known exposures to animals or to a sick individual, and no secondary transmission to close contacts was identified. A(H5N1) virus was confirmed in a respiratory specimen after the patient had been discharged home. All of these human cases have been confirmed or are presumed to be associated with one particular genetic clade of the virus, clade 2.3.4.4b. How does this compare with cases globally?Uyeki: There continue to be human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) reported sporadically in other countries. Historically, since 1997, there have been 935 cases reported from 24 countries, with a case fatality proportion of approximately 50%. Although no severe cases have been identified in the US to date, severe disease or critical illness, including with a fatal outcome, has been reported in other countries with A(H5N1) virus, clade 2.3.4.4b, infection. There have been 10 cases reported in Cambodia this year to date. These cases have occurred in rural villagers with direct and close unprotected exposure to backyard poultry that were sick or had died. Some of these cases experienced critical illness, and two died. These cases were associated with a different but related genetic clade of A(H5N1) virus, called 2.3.2.1c.There was also a case reported earlier this year in Australia of a child who experienced critical illness but survived. The family had returned from travel to India, and the child’s illness was caused by infection with a different but related genetic clade of A(H5N1) virus called 2.3.2.1a that is circulating among poultry in India.What is the overall public health risk?Uyeki: Our assessment is that in the US, as well as globally, the public health threat of A(H5N1) viruses is currently low. However, people who work with infected animals, such as poultry and dairy cows in the US, are at increased risk for exposure to and infection with A(H5N1) virus. It would not be surprising if additional sporadic human cases are identified in persons with occupational exposure to infected animals (eg, poultry or dairy cattle) in the US if recommended personal protective equipment is not utilized. Although severe human illness associated with A(H5N1) virus infection has not been identified in the US to date, sporadic cases of severe pneumonia might be identified in the future, such as has occurred in many other countries. People who have nonoccupational exposure to infected birds, poultry, wild birds, or other infected animals may also be at higher risk for infection in the US and worldwide. Historically, many human A(H5N1) cases have occurred in rural areas in other countries after unprotected exposures to sick or dead backyard poultry. Ongoing surveillance of A(H5N1) viruses, as well as other novel influenza A viruses of animal origin, such as other avian influenza A viruses and swine influenza A viruses that have infected people, is critical to assessing the risk to public health. Because A(H5N1) viruses continue to evolve in unpredictable ways, the threat that these viruses pose to public health could increase in the future. Is H5N1 infection in mammals (in this instance, cows) a cause for concern?Uyeki: Globally, over the past 2 years, we’ve seen spillover of A(H5N1) viruses from wild birds to infect many kinds of mammals in many regions of the world. This includes A(H5N1) virus infections of a wide range of very small to very large mammals, including both wild and farmed terrestrial as well as wild marine mammals, resulting in high mortality. In contrast, dairy cows that are infected don’t tend to get very sick or might have infection without apparent signs of illness, but some can display some signs of infection, such as reduced appetite, nasal discharge, dehydration, and a substantial drop-off in milk production, but can recover. High levels of A(H5N1) virus are found in raw cow milk from acutely infected dairy cows. The concern is that if A(H5N1) viruses adapt to spread and become established among mammals, that might increase the risk to public health. A(H5N1) viruses bind to receptors present in the respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract of birds and are excreted in their feces. In humans, the receptors for these A(H5N1) viruses are not very prevalent in the upper respiratory tract but are more abundant in the lower respiratory tract and on conjunctival tissues. It is believed that one of the conditions, although not the only factor, for A(H5N1) viruses to have increased potential to spread from infected animals to people and among people is that the viruses need to be able to bind efficiently to receptors that are prevalent in the human upper respiratory tract, and this has not been observed to date. Because A(H5N1) viruses, like all influenza A viruses, are dynamic and continually evolving, ongoing surveillance of these viruses in wild birds, poultry, farmed and wild mammals (terrestrial and marine mammals), dairy cows, and any other infected animals is critical to monitoring the public health threat. In people who are infected, in addition to assessing the epidemiology and clinical characteristics, we continue to analyze and characterize these viruses to assess the risk for transmission, pathogenesis, susceptibility to antivirals, antigenic similarity to candidate vaccine viruses, and other characteristics. It is very important to be vigilant, to enhance surveillance, and for public health to work closely with our animal health partners in a One Health response to A(H5N1) viruses in the US and worldwide. Can you describe the recent H5 outbreak in poultry workers in Colorado?Drehoff: In July 2024, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment responded to two poultry facilities that had detected highly pathogenic avian influenza in their poultry. Both facilities were egg-layer facilities that had over a million birds. When we detect this virus in birds, they have to be depopulated, and a lot of these facilities will bring in large groups of contract workers to accomplish that task.We were notified that some of the workers at the first facility had some symptoms that were consistent with influenza A, which was concerning because of their potential exposure to the A(H5N1) virus. We ended up conducting a series of site visits to both facilities to screen workers for symptoms, offer clinical testing, and provide empirical treatment with oseltamivir owing to exposure. In total, we talked to over 600 workers across the two facilities and identified 109 who reported symptoms. Of those workers, nine tested positive for influenza A(H5) virus. The first facility had six cases, and the second facility had three cases. How are these infections different from previous H5 infections in the US?Drehoff: This is actually the first cluster that we’ve seen associated with an occupational poultry exposure in the US. Overall, these Colorado cases were similar in terms of animal exposure and clinical presentation, but this is really the first time that we’ve seen a group of cases present after an occupational poultry exposure to avian influenza A(H5) virus. Did any workers require hospitalizations, or were symptoms milder?Drehoff: Luckily, the disease was very mild. All nine cases reported conjunctivitis, and then some reported other systemic symptoms, such as fever or some mild respiratory symptoms. All of these workers recovered in a few days. That’s the important takeaway here: ’We’re not seeing severe disease and there were no hospitalizations required. We didn’t see any evidence of human-to-human transmission, and all of the workers who tested positive had been handling sick or dead birds.Did you find any commonalities among the workers who were infected, such as outdated or ineffective personal protective equipment (PPE)?Drehoff: We’re still looking further into exactly how these workers were exposed. We did ask workers about PPE use, such as masks and goggles. We were concerned that the heat wave in Colorado might have impacted PPE use and the ability of workers to keep that PPE on when it was so hot out. We’d like to connect with the industry and occupational health to look at that a bit further and keep these workers protected in the future.Would you call this response a success?Drehoff: I do think there are some things that we did well. First, we were really cognizant of the cultural and language needs of the workforce. A lot of these contract workers were Spanish-speaking migrants. We made sure that we had multiple bilingual responders available at each visit who really helped facilitate communication, testing, and treatment for these workers.I’ll also say that the scale and speed of the response were commendable — we did respond on the ground the day that symptoms were reported. We had a multidisciplinary team come in almost every day or every other day at these facilities to be able to organize these logistics and systematically screen workers and offer care on site where workers might not otherwise have access to that kind of care.What do you think can be done better next time?Drehoff: I think there’s a lot that we learned that we hope we can take into our next response to help inform prevention and future efforts. So much of this is about building relationships with our agriculture and industry partners and making sure that we have communication channels when we need to conduct outreach to workers. Strengthening our cultural navigation and Spanish-speaking staff to ensure that we have resources available to meet specific needs across different groups of people and communities is also important moving forward.What are the next steps?Drehoff: We are still investigating why we saw this cluster of cases. Is it the virus? Is it PPE use? We are also trying to take what we learned and remain prepared for future occurrences of this, especially as we enter migratory bird season and might expect to see additional poultry facilities affected. That really comes down to working through lots of logistics; how we can build field teams and conduct these screening visits, acquiring oseltamivir, and trying to work through decisions of when it is appropriate to do empirical treatment vs postexposure prophylaxis. We also want to build our relationships with the agricultural industry and our regulatory agricultural partners, so that we’re always on the same page and can approach these responses in a collaborative way.How has the Missouri case with no identified source affected CDC warnings and surveillance?Uyeki: As part of enhanced surveillance, the CDC recommended that any detection of influenza A virus in a respiratory specimen from a human patient across any healthcare setting in the US be subtyped. This will determine whether the virus is a seasonal influenza A virus subtype, such as A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, or A(H3N2) virus. If the respiratory specimen cannot be subtyped, then it needs to be tested further, including for A(H5) virus.That’s exactly what happened in the Missouri case. This person had chronic medical conditions and was hospitalized with gastrointestinal symptoms, chest pain, and no respiratory symptoms — atypical for seasonal influenza or A(H5N1) virus infection — and no occupational exposure to animals. Although A(H5N1) was not suspected, as part of the workup, influenza A virus was identified in a single upper respiratory tract specimen collected on admission at the hospital, oseltamivir treatment was started, droplet precautions were implemented, and the specimen was sent to the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory for influenza A virus subtyping. It was negative for A(H1) and A(H3) but was presumptively positive for A(H5). That upper respiratory tract specimen was sent to the CDC after the patient had recovered from a brief hospitalization and was discharged home, and my colleagues confirmed A(H5N1) virus. I would note that a very low level of A(H5N1) viral RNA was detected, suggesting that it was not replicating, and virus was not able to be isolated. Therefore, in that respiratory specimen, there was no evidence of infectious virus, suggesting that during the hospitalization, the patient was unlikely to be contagious to others. Only partial sequencing of A(H5N1) viral RNA from the respiratory specimen was possible, and these results suggested that the virus was a highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, clade 2.3.4.4b. This is the same clade of A(H5N1) virus that has been circulating among wild birds and infecting poultry, dairy cattle, and other animals in the US Because the patient did not have any exposure to animals or to sick individuals prior to becoming ill, the source of A(H5N1) virus infection in this patient is unknown.Since February 2024, there have been more than 53,000 respiratory specimens collected from people in the US using a protocol that would have detected an A(H5) virus, and this is the only patient who was identified through such influenza testing to date. What we can say is that we haven’t identified any other cases in hospitalized patients in the US — except for this Missouri case. [The Missouri case] raises a lot of questions, but there’s been no indication of community transmission or any secondary spread from this patient. It appears that the threat to public health is low.Are there previous cases that also had no identifiable source?Uyeki: There are some human cases of A(H5N1) that have occurred historically in other countries in which the source of the virus was not identified. That has also happened in animal-to-human transmission of other novel influenza A viruses. For example, sometimes we will identify what is referred to as a ‘”variant influenza A virus of swine ’origin” in a patient’s respiratory specimen, but the patient didn’t have any known exposure to pigs. The source of exposure and infection is not always identified for every case, but we don’t think there’s any ongoing public health risk. We will continue to work closely with our local and state health partners on enhanced surveillance for influenza A viruses and novel influenza A viruses. We will also continue to assess other components of our surveillance, including looking at emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and other illness data as well as wastewater surveillance for influenza A viruses.What do healthcare professionals need to know about H5N1?Uyeki: When a healthcare provider is evaluating a patient who might have acute respiratory symptoms or conjunctivitis, it’s important to ask about any exposure to animals in the 10 days prior to symptom onset. This includes wild birds, poultry, dairy cows, or other mammals, particularly those that were sick or died. For example, there have been cats infected with A(H5N1) virus that exhibited neurologic signs of illness and then died.Clinicians should also ask patients about consumption of raw milk, raw milk products, or uncooked poultry products.Clinicians should also ask if a patient had any exposure to someone who was a confirmed case of novel influenza A virus infection to explore the potential for human-to-human transmission. We haven’t identified any secondary transmission of A(H5N1) virus in the US, and limited, nonsustained human-to-human transmission of A(H5N1) virus has not been reported globally since 2007, but we always need to investigate this possibility because these viruses are dynamic, and they could evolve to become a greater public health threat in the future.If there is a relevant exposure to animals and clinical signs and symptoms of conjunctivitis, and/or acute respiratory symptoms are present, then influenza testing should be done. Influenza A subtyping should be done if influenza A testing is positive. If there’s high suspicion of exposure to sick or dead poultry, mammals, or dairy cattle, then the state health department should be notified. Clinical specimens should be sent to a public health laboratory for specific influenza A testing and capacity for A(H5) testing.Patients with relevant exposures and clinical signs and symptoms of influenza should be started empirically on oseltamivir treatment as soon as possible; don’t wait for the results of influenza testing. Then, if the patient tests as presumptive positive for influenza A(H5) at the state level, the patient needs to be isolated, investigations need to be done, and the specimen(s) need to be shipped to CDC for confirmatory testing. Close contacts of a case need to be identified and followed up and started on post-exposure oseltamivir prophylaxis as soon as possible, especially if A(H5N1) virus infection is confirmed at CDC. How can people prevent H5N1 infection?Uyeki: People should avoid direct and close exposure to sick or dead animals, especially wild birds or poultry, or to dairy cattle suspected or known to be infected with A(H5N1) virus, period. Avoid touching or consuming raw milk or raw milk products, especially from animals with confirmed or suspected A(H5N1) virus infection.People who might have occupational exposure to suspected or confirmed A(H5N1) virus–infected animals, such as dairy cattle or sick or dead poultry, should utilize recommended PPE, including an N95 respirator, eye protection such as goggles or a face shield, a protective gown, and gloves.Additional prevention guidance is available on the CDC website, including PPE recommendations for workers. Is there a vaccine against H5N1?H5N1 vaccine is not currently available for anyone. However, as part of routine, ongoing pandemic influenza preparedness, the CDC is always working on developing candidate vaccine viruses to match the evolution of A(H5N1) viruses of highest public health concern. Currently, we have H5 candidate vaccine viruses that are a good match for the A(H5N1) viruses circulating in poultry and in dairy cattle in the US. We believe that threat to the public is low at this time, but if the public health threat were to change and vaccines were needed to go into production, these H5 candidate vaccine viruses have already been made available to manufacturers.There are also some H5 vaccines in the Strategic National Stockpile that could potentially be used if there was indication that an influenza pandemic was starting, but again, there’s no indication that the public health threat is increased at this time.

(Jazlyn Butler, Unsplash)SALEM, Ore. — The United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) recently confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a commercial poultry operation with approximately 150,000 birds. The facility is in Clackamas County. The affected birds were euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease and did not enter the food system. Avian influenza does not affect properly cooked poultry meat or egg products, which remain safe. HPAI is also considered low risk to human health, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The confirmation at the commercial poultry operations initiated a state-federal response between the Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA) and USDA. ODA works closely with USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) on a joint incident response and action plan. State Veterinarian Dr. Ryan Scholz issued a regional quarantine around the operation to prevent the movement of poultry and poultry products from within the affected area, giving state and federal staff time to conduct surveillance to ensure no additional cases of HPAI exist. The USDA tracks the number of cases nationwide, and the most recent report says since the start of the outbreak February 8, 2022, 104 million birds have been affected by HPAI in 48 states. ODA is also working with the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and Clackamas County Public Health to ensure the farm personnel have proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and to provide public health resources. For details on the quarantine area, ODA provides an online map. In addition to the map, the online tool allows people to enter their address to determine whether their property is included in the quarantine area. ODA will lift the quarantine as regional surveillance is complete. Temporary rules establishing quarantine and movement restrictions for HIPAI. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus strains are extremely infectious, often fatal to chickens, and can spread rapidly from flock to flock. ODA continues to advise commercial poultry farmers and backyard flock owners to be vigilant with biosecurity measures and surveillance. Biosecurity measures can include: Wash your hands before and after handling your flock Cleaning vehicles tools or equipment Limiting unnecessary visitors Sanitizing shoes in clean foot baths Changing clothes upon contact with birds and more For more tips on protecting your backyard flock, please visit the ODA online at Avian Influenza or en Español at Avian Influenza – Spanish. Death or illness among domestic birds should be immediately reported to ODA. Please report by calling 503-986-4711 (Alt Phone: 1-800-347-7028). Please contact the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) for wild birds. Do not collect or handle the birds but report the incident directly to ODFW at 866-968-2600 or [email protected]. — Oregon Department of Agriculture Spread the word RECOMMENDED ARTICLES Cutting-Edge Educational Training Modules on Poultry WelfareJanuary 27, 2024TUCKER, Ga. — The International Poultry Welfare Alliance (IPWA) is pleased to announce the launch of a comprehensive set of educational training modules designed to complement its Key Welfare Indicator (KWI) […] USPOULTRY Financial Management Seminar is June 26-28May 12, 2024TUCKER, Ga. — Legislative changes, export opportunities, taxes and technological advances all play a huge role in poultry and egg companies’ financial management.

Patient Centered Medical Home The influenza vaccine is being offered at all BACH Health System family medical homes, to include Air Assault, Gold, Screaming Eagle, and Young Eagle Medical Homes. TRICARE-enrolled family members who receive care at BACH and SEMH can receive the seasonal influenza vaccine on a walk-in basis at their assigned medical home Monday-Wednesday and Friday, 8 a.m.-2:30 p.m. Patients with scheduled appointments can also receive the flu vaccine during their visit. Soldier Centered Medical Home Soldiers assigned to Fort Campbell should reach out to their units for seasonal influenza vaccination dates. Community Flu Vaccine events All TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries may receive their flu vaccine at one of the Community-wide Flu vaccine events, Oct. 28-30, 8 a.m.-3 p.m. during a walk-in Flu vaccine event at Cole Park Commons on Fort Campbell. “We encourage everyone to take advantage of receiving the flu vaccine annually, which can help prevent or lessen the severity of flu,” said BACH public health nurse, Capt. Gregory Richter. “For individuals to receive the most protection in this region, we recommended our beneficiaries get the vaccine between October and December.” TRICARE beneficiaries aged six months or older, including service members, retirees, and family members; and eligible Department of Defense and Department of the Army civilians and contractors who require vaccination for employment may receive the vaccine with no out-of-pocket expense during this event. Individuals will need to present their military ID or common access card before receiving the vaccine. Healthcare staff will provide participants with proof of vaccination for those requiring documentation for work, school, childcare, travel, etc. Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Some people, including those aged 65 years and older, young children, and people with certain health conditions, are at higher risk of serious flu complications. Complications of flu can include bacterial pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections and worsening of chronic medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure, asthma, or diabetes. Again, Richter emphasized that the best way to reduce the risk of flu and its potentially serious complications is by getting vaccinated each year.

However, currently, the use of glucocorticoids in treating VPA remains controversial. Moreover, a unified standard for the dosage and duration of glucocorticoid therapy has not been presented in published articles. A retrospective analysis was conducted in patients who were hospitalized for severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia, and they received sequential treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids and short-course oral glucocorticoids. Patients were followed up for 3 months. A total of 11 patients were included in the study (average age 56 years). There was no gender difference, but age and underlying diseases could be risk factors for severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia. The types of viruses causing pneumonia included influenza A/B. The main clinical symptoms of patients were fever, cough, sputum production, and dyspnea. Chest computed tomography showed multiple ground-glass shadows in the lobes, and the presence of bacterial and fungal infections was accompanied by consolidation shadows. After glucocorticoid therapy, the symptoms improved. None of the patients underwent tracheal intubation, and all survived. After a 3-month follow-up, lung CT absorption in all patients had reached more than 80%, and lung imaging absorption in 20% patients was complete. No serious complications occurred in any of the patients. Sequential treatment with high-dose steroids and short-course oral glucocorticoids may be helpful for reducing the tracheal intubation rate and mortality rate in patients with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia. Additionally, short-course oral glucocorticoids may reduce pulmonary fibrosis in patients with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia without any serious complications.

Therefore, they are a major risk factor for human health1,2,3. Among viral pathogens, excluding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), influenza virus has become the most important viral cause of community-acquired pneumonia in clinical practice. Other common viral pathogens include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus2,4. Seasonal outbreaks and epidemics of influenza viruses cause a large number of hospitalizations and deaths each year5,6. Most of the deaths are caused by rapidly progressive viral pneumonia (VPA), dyspnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and systemic multiple organ failure7,8. Pulmonary fibrosis in surviving patients with VPA affects their quality of life and survival (viral infection-induced pulmonary fibrosis)9. Thus, the treatment of VPA is receiving increased attention. In addition to conventional treatment, such as antiviral and symptomatic supportive therapy, glucocorticoids are used as an adjuvant therapy for VPA because of their ability to inhibit inflammatory factors.Some studies have shown that the use of glucocorticoids will increase the risk of nosocomial infection and prolong the clearance time of the virus, resulting in an increase in the mortality of patients with VPA10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. Other studies have reported that glucocorticoids, due to their anti-inflammatory effects, can rapidly decrease lung injury and improve oxygenation, thus reducing mortality, which is beneficial to the prognosis of VPA19,20,21. Some animal models have shown the same result22,23,24,25. Therefore, no conclusion can be derived regarding whether glucocorticoids can be used as adjunctive treatment for VPA. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate the benefits of high-dose steroids combined with short-course oral glucocorticoids for survival and improved prognosis in patients with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia.MethodsStudy design and patientsA retrospective study was performed in patients who were diagnosed with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia (severe pneumonia as defined by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America criteria)26 and treated with glucocorticoids at the Second Hospital of Jilin University from November 2023 to January 2024. Patients were followed up for three months.Eligibility criteriaPatients who were hospitalized for severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia were included in the study. Patients with any other viral infections were excluded.ImagingAll patients received chest imaging examination upon admission; nine of them received lung comprehensive computed tomography (CT) examination, and the other two patients were critically ill and received bedside chest X-ray examination.Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS)All patients received mNGS in the sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) before receiving glucocorticoid therapy.Patient data collectionClinical data and basic information, such as sex and age, were collected. The results of laboratory tests, such as routine blood, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), CT or chest X-ray, and arterial blood gas analysis, were also collected.TreatmentsAfter admission, all patients were given supportive care. Among them, nine patients received high-flow nasal cannula treatment, and two patients received non-invasive ventilator assisted ventilation. After diagnosis, all patients were given an initial dose of methylprednisolone (80–320 mg/day) based on the clinical symptoms (such as respiratory rate), oxygenation, lung imaging, and body weight (following the recommendation of Chinese scholars (methylprednisolone 80 mg, 2–3 times/day27). In one patient, the disease still progressed after initial treatment, and it manifested as increased dyspnea and progressive decrease in the oxygenation index. After ruling out acute aggravation caused by pulmonary embolism, infection, cardiac insufficiency, and other diseases, the dose of hormone was increased to 320 mg/day considering acute respiratory distress syndrome after viral infection. Patients were also treated with oseltamivir. Those infected with bacteria or fungi were given β-lactam antibiotics or targeted therapy, including fluconazole, micafungin, or sulfamethoxazole. The dose of methylprednisolone was reduced by 40 mg/day every 3–5 days according to the clinical symptoms, oxygenation, and imaging conditions of the patients, until the dose of methylprednisolone was reduced to 40 mg/day. The discharge indication was that the patient did not have any fever or resting state breathing difficulty, had low flow oxygen inhalation through the nasal cannula (below 3L/min), with finger pulse oxygen reaching above 95%. After discharge, the patient was asked to take prednisone tablets orally at a dose of 20–30 mg/day, with one tablet being reduced every 3–5 days until discontinuation. The total course of treatment was approximately 1–2 months.Ethics approval and informed consentThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Hospital of Jilin University. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. All the patients gave their written consent for the personal and clinical details along with any identifying images to be published in this study.Statistical analysesWe used SPSS for all analyses (version 21.0, USA). Normally distributed variables were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation, and statistical analysis was performed using a T-test. Categorical variables are presented as counts and percentages. P-values below 0.05 were defined as statistically significant.ResultsPatientsA total of 11 patients, comprising six males and five females, were included in the study, and their ages ranged from 26 to 72 years (mean age 56 years). Furthermore, 81% of the patients had chronic diseases (such as rheumatological and immunological diseases or hypertension (Table 1).Table 1 Basic characteristics of patients at admission.Full size tableRisk factors and patient signs and symptomsAge and underlying diseases could be risk factors for severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia. All patients had at least one respiratory symptom, such as fever, cough, phlegm, or dyspnea. Fever (10 cases, 90.9%) was the most common symptom, followed by cough (9 cases, 81.8), dyspnea (7 cases, 63.6%), and expectoration (6 cases, 54.5%). All patients had an oxygenation index < 250 mmHg, respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, and inflammation range involving more than two lung lobes. The patients had respiratory symptoms for 3 to 30 days (mean: 15.5 ± 8.7 days) before admission to our hospital (Additional Tables 1 and 2).Laboratory test resultsLaboratory examination (Table 1 and Additional Table 1) showed that four patients had a high white blood cell count (9.33 ± 5.16 109/L) and neutrophil count (7.76 ± 4.75 109/L); six patients had a low lymphocyte count (0.96 ± 0.54 109/L); and up to nine patients had an elevated CRP level (48.9 ± 17.6). Only two patients (mean value 2.2361) had an elevated PCT level. Laboratory examination results showed that white blood cells and neutrophils remained unchanged after viral infection alone, while white blood cells and PCT levels increased after combined bacterial and fungal infections.mNGS resultsThe viruses detected by mNGS were influenza A (six cases) and influenza B (five cases) (Table 1). Only three cases had simple virus infection; one case had bacterial infection; three cases had fungal infection; and four cases had both bacterial and fungal infection. The most common bacteria were gram-negative bacilli, and fungi mainly consisted of Candida albicans (Table 1). Figure 1 details the mNGS results, showing the relative abundance of various pathogens in each patient’s sputum or BALF.Fig. 1Species distribution and relative abundance of pathogens detected by mNGS of the sputum or BALF. The bar chart displays the results of NGS pathogen detection: the proportion of pathogen types and the number of specific sequences for a single pathogen to the total number of pathogen specific sequences. BALF, Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; mNGS, Metagenomic next-generation sequencing; NGS, Next-generation sequencing.Full size imageImaging dataThe imaging findings included a variety of patterns, such as spot shadow, ground-glass shadow, and lung consolidation shadow (Fig. 2). Two patients (Fig. 2D,I) showed diffuse ground-glass shadows in all lung lobes.Fig. 2Chest CT scan of patients on admission. On admission, CT and X-ray changes in the patient’s lungs showed obvious ground-glass shadows, some of which were combined with solid shadows. Among them, two patients with severe disease could not receive lung CT, so a bedside X-ray examination was performed instead. CT, comprehensive computed tomography.Full size imageTreatment-related outcomesLaboratory examination showed no statistical difference in the total white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, calcitonin, urea nitrogen, and CRP in 11 patients (P > 0.05) before and after treatment (Additional Table 3). The clinical symptoms (fever, cough, sputum, and dyspnea), oxygenation, and lung imaging results improved. None of the patients received tracheal intubation and ventilator therapy; among them, two patients (case 2 and case 7) were recommended to receive tracheal intubation and ventilator-assisted ventilation, but the patients and their families refused. After increasing the dosage of glucocorticoids, the oxygen concentration of the patients gradually decreased, and their symptoms gradually improved (Table 2).Table 2 Types of pathogenic bacteria and treatment strategies.Full size tableBy the time of discharge, all patients showed improved clinical symptoms, no fever, and significantly improved dyspnea and lung imaging results. Figure 3 shows the dynamic changes in imaging during the complete course of the disease in the two patients who received tracheal intubation and ventilator-assisted ventilation. Figure 3 (A1-E1 to A2-E2 and a1-e1 to a2-e2) shows obvious progress in the imaging results compared with the baseline of when the patient initially developed symptoms and did not use glucocorticoids, and Fig. 3 (A2-E2 to A4-E4 and a2-e2 to a4-e4) shows gradual imaging absorption after the application of glucocorticoids and the absence of any significant pulmonary inflammation.Fig. 3Comparison of chest CT imaging findings in two patients before and after treatment. A1-E1 was the lung CT before admission; A2-E2 was the lung CT at admission; A3-E3 was the lung CT at one month after discharge; and A4-E4 was the lung CT at three months after discharge; and the findings indicated that the lesion was obviously absorbed after treatment. CT, Comprehensive computed tomograph.Full size imageComplicationThe total course of treatment for patients treated with glucocorticoid application was 1–2 months, during which no serious life-threatening adverse reactions were observed. The most common adverse reactions were hypertension and hyperglycemia (Tables 1 and 2). After the adjustment of drugs, the above abnormalities could be controlled.DiscussionViruses pose a major threat to human health beyond SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-1928. Not only classic or major viruses (influenza virus, RSV, and rhinovirus) but also minor viruses (parainfluenza, adenovirus, and coronavirus 229E) fit the clinical-microbiological canon, which informs that “a virus is responsible for different diseases; the same disease is caused by different viruses”29.VPA is often a community-acquired infection caused by common pathogens, such as influenza virus, RSV, and adenovirus, and can be identified by chest CT showing airway-centered infection, bronchiolitis, and bronchopneumonia. Influenza viral infection in combination with bacterial and fungal infections can manifest as lung consolidation. Immunocompromised host-related community-acquired influenza virus-associated pneumonia is a common cause of severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome and has a high mortality rate30,31. Our retrospective analysis obtained the same results. Severe patients were mostly elderly or had underlying diseases. Simple influenza viral infections showed normal white blood cell counts and significantly decreased lymphocyte counts. Secondary bacterial and fungal infections may cause elevated white blood cell counts and PCT levels. Chest CT showed bronchopneumonia with multiple lobar involvement, and pulmonary consolidation was present when the viral infection was combined with bacterial and fungal infections.A series of studies have found that viral pneumonia can cause pulmonary fibrosis. One case report found secondary pulmonary fibrosis after ARDS in a patient with Influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia32. In a one-year follow-up study, Avinandan Saha et al., also found that patients with ARDS caused by H1N1 developed pulmonary fibrosis even after recovery. Noriko Nakajima et al. conducted a respiratory histopathological analysis of 20 autopsy cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection from August 2009 to February 2010, and they found that 12 cases (60%) showed pathological changes indicative of pulmonary fibrosis33.Glucocorticoids are recognized as powerful anti-inflammatory drugs, which can regulate the immune function of the body, exert anti-inflammatory function, inhibit the production of inflammatory factors, and reduce the immune response of the body34. However, there is still a lot of disagreement about how to treat severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia; Antoni Torres et al. found that the administration of glucocorticoids during the initial high inflammatory response to severe pneumonia improved treatment success35. A large retrospective study of critically ill influenza patients by Delaney et al. found an increased risk of death among those treated with glucocorticoids; however, there was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups after adjusting for time variations36. Also, the potential differences between low-dose and medium-/high-dose glucocorticoid therapy have not been studied in depth. Cao, Bin et al. An observational study of hospitalized patients with VPA caused by the H7N9 avian influenza virus showed that high doses of glucocorticoids rather than low or medium doses of glucocorticoids were associated with increased mortality at 30 and 60 days37. A number of studies have shown that the application of glucocorticoids in severe pneumonia does not increase the mortality rate, but the serum inflammatory factors are more significantly reduced; clinical symptoms improve faster; and the length of hospital stay is shortened38,39,40.Marco Confalonieri et al. found that the use of glucocorticoids could save lives of critically ill patients infected with the H1N1 virus. In a study of 2 cases of H1N1-related pneumonia, Catherine Roberts et al. found that high-dose corticosteroids provided rapid relief of symptoms and/or complete recovery41. This retrospective study showed that high-dose steroid therapy for SVPA can improve patient symptoms, such as fever and breathing difficulty, improve finger pulse oxygen, and reduce intubation rates (two patients required tracheal intubation treatment, but the patients and their relatives refused the above treatment; hence, we increased the glucocorticoid dose, resulting in significant relief of respiratory distress symptoms and finger pulse oxygen in the patients). Our long-term application strategy of slow reduction of glucocorticoids has also been applied by other scholars in clinical application21. In addition, patients with pulmonary fibrosis were found to recover with combination treatment of pirfenidone, azithromycin, and prednisolone42. Our retrospective study also obtained the same result; we found that prolonged glucocorticoid therapy (oral administration of 20–30 mg prednisone tablets, with reduction of one tablet every 3–5 days) can reduce pulmonary fibrosis. Chest CT scans of the lungs after 4 weeks of discharge showed absorption of pulmonary inflammation in patients (Fig. 3). At the same time, no clear signs of co-infection were observed during glucocorticoid therapy. During hospitalization, we combined anti-infective and antifungal therapy based on the patient’s pathogen results, and some patients were given prophylactic anti-infective treatment with piperacillin-sulbactam, considering the severity of disease in the patients. After discharge, anti-infective or antifungal therapy was not applied. There were no fatal complications, and common complications were hyperglycemia and hypertension, which were due to underlying diseases. Medications could control the hypertension and hyperglycemia caused by glucocorticoids (Tables 1 and 2).The inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on viral pneumonia-induced lung fibrosis may be related to inhibition of the TGF-β/Smad pathway. Pulmonary fibrosis in H1N1 patients may be related to increased fibroblast activity in the post-inflammatory repair pathway. In this process, TGF-β and collagen play an important role. H1N1 infection enhances the expression of TGF-β and MAD-2 in macrophages and alveolar cells, suggesting that H1N1 may induce pulmonary fibrosis by activating the TGF-β/Smad pathway. In addition, influenza A virus infection can induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, triggering multiple reactions, such as Caspase-12-dependent epithelial cell apoptosis and JNK1-dependent TGF-β expression9. Glucocorticoids down-regulate the expression of TGF-β1 and 2 in lung fibroblasts by blocking the intrinsic positive feedback regulatory mechanism of TGF-β. In addition, glucocorticoids and TGF-β1 have a synergistic effect on fibrotic tissue remodeling. It has been confirmed that both Smad2 and Smad3 are involved in the up-regulation of TGF-β1-mediated glucocorticoid binding. Smads up-regulate glucocorticoid binding and signaling by activating protein-143. It can be seen that influenza virus, glucocorticoid, TGF-β/Smad are closely related to fibrosis.In summary, our retrospective study showed that high-dose glucocorticoid therapy was beneficial for the treatment of patients with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia, and sequential orally administered glucocorticoid therapy was also helpful for reducing the occurrence of lung fibrosis. However, the limitations of our study were the small number of cases, and the potential for bias in patient selection due to the retrospective nature of the analysis. However, our study still provides clinicians with a treatment option, especially for critically ill patients who are unable to cope with the refusal of invasive mechanical ventilation, where glucocorticoid therapy may help save patients’ lives.ConclusionsTimely and appropriate application of high-dose glucocorticoid therapy is beneficial for patients with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia, and it can reduce the mechanical ventilation rate and improve the survival rate. Sequential short-term oral administration of glucocorticoids can alleviate pulmonary fibrosis, and no serious adverse reactions have been observed.

article Share toX This approval paves the way for exports to the world's fourth most populous country. SK bioscience aims to continue to grow as a global vaccine brand beyond Korea by leveraging the advantages of cell-cultured vaccines. SEONGNAM, South Korea, Oct. 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SK bioscience, a global innovative vaccine and biotech company committed to promoting human health from prevention to cure, today announced that Indonesia's Food and Drug Agency, BPOM (Badan Pengawas Obat dan Makanan), has approved the Biologics License Application (BLA) for the SKYCellflu Quadrivalent prefilled syringe, the world's first quadrivalent cell-cultured influenza vaccine. This is the first time a domestically made influenza vaccine has received approval in Indonesia. Continue Reading SKYCellflu Quadrivalent prefilled syringe Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous nation with over 280 million people, with rapidly growing pharmaceutical market. According to global market research firm Innsight10, Indonesia's flu vaccine market is projected to grow from USD 38.5 million in 2022 to USD 69.1 million in 2030. Due to its elongated geography, spanning both Northern and Southern Hemispheres, Indonesia is impacted by the World Health Organization's flu vaccination guidelines for both regions. Following this approval of SKYCellflu for the Northern Hemisphere influenza strains, SK bioscience anticipates fast-tracked approval of flu vaccine for Southern Hemisphere influenza strains by the Indonesian Food and Drug Agency.SKYCellFlu is the world's first cell culture-based influenza vaccine to achieve WHO Prequalification (PQ) certification, demonstrating acceptable immunogenicity and safety across clinical trials. It is the only cell-cultured influenza vaccine currently available in Korea.Compared to the egg-based vaccines, its shorter production timeline makes it more suited for rapid response to pandemics or the emerging variants. SKYCellflu also does not require antibiotic or preservative administration.In addition, cell-cultured vaccines are less likely to mutate during the production process than those produced in fertilized eggs, allowing for a more accurate match to circulating influenza strains.In SK bioscience's research, the company conducted subcultures 15 times by employing cells for SKYCellflu production and fertilized eggs. Subculturing, also referred to as passaging cells, is the removal of the medium and transfer of cells from a previous culture into fresh growth medium, a procedure that enables the further propagation of the cell line or cell strain.The study results showed that mutations were found in three proteins within the virus in the fertilized egg method, while no mutations were found in the cells used for SKYCellflu production. These findings were presented at the 2019 Korea Interscience Working Group on Influenza (KIWI) Symposium.SKYCellflu has already been approved in multiple Asian countries, including Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Iran, Singapore, Pakistan, Mongolia, and Brunei. Last year, it was granted in Chile, marking its first approval in the South American market. SK bioscience plans to pave the way for a full-scale expansion into global export markets.Jaeyong Ahn, CEO of SK bioscience, said, "It is very encouraging that our own developed vaccines are receiving approvals worldwide, a significant step for expanding our global export market." He added, "We are confident that SK bioscience will continue to grow into a global vaccine brand beyond Korea, as our vaccines, including shingles, chickenpox, and typhoid vaccines, are securing WHO PQ certifications and global approvals one after another."About SK bioscienceSK bioscience is an innovative vaccine and biotech company, committed to vaccine development and manufacturing to enable more equitable access to vaccines around the world. Leveraging strengths on cutting-edge technologies, SK bioscience has been dedicated to promoting human health from prevention to cure across the globe. With the cooperation of domestic and international governments, regulatory agencies, healthcare providers, doctors, and medical experts, all of the SK colleagues are passionately committed to providing high-quality vaccines to those who need them and better public healthcare solutions.- SK bioscience Website- SK bioscience LinkedinContactSK bioscience Communications TeamChanghyun Jin([email protected]) Jeannie S.

Getting immunized prevents the spread of influenza and COVID-19 and protects people at high risk of serious illness, such as young children, pregnant people, people over 65 years of age and people with certain medical conditions. Influenza and COVID-19 vaccines are updated each year to protect against the current viruses in circulation. As protection from these vaccines wears off with time, it is important to stay up to date on your influenza and COVID-19 immunizations. This year, you can book your appointment by: Watching for an email or text from the provincial Get Vaccinated system for your personalized booking link. Use that link to find a date, time and location that works for you. Alternatively, you can call the provincial call centre (toll-free) to book your influenza and COVID-19 immunizations at 1-833-838-2323. People will have the opportunity to receive influenza and COVID-19 immunizations at the same time. It is safe and recommended to receive these vaccines at the same immunization visit. Some immunization clinics will be dedicated for families with children six months to eleven years of age. Appointments for children along with one family member can be booked through the provincial call centre at 1-888-838-2323. If you have not registered with the Get Vaccinated system, you may register at getvaccinated.gov.bc.ca. You can also contact your primary care provider to see if they are providing influenza and/or COVID-19 immunizations this year. Different flu vaccines are available this year, including free enhanced flu vaccine for seniors 65 years of age and older. The flu vaccine you receive will depend on your age, risk factors and availability. To learn more about flu vaccine types and eligibility, please visit the Government of BC Influenza (flu) vaccine page. Influenza and COVID-19 are spread from coughing, sneezing, talking and touching contaminated surfaces or objects then touching your mouth, eyes or nose. Symptoms of influenza include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and cough. COVID-19 shares these symptoms and can also cause loss of taste or smell, breathing difficulties, sore throat and nausea. For more information about COVID-19 vaccines, please visit the Government of BC understand my COVID-19 vaccine options page. Influenza can cause severe complications such as pneumonia, hospitalization or death in vulnerable people, including young children, seniors, people with chronic health conditions and pregnant people. In addition to getting immunized, preventive measures proven effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and influenza include washing your hands, wearing a mask if you have mild symptoms or are recovering from illness and staying home when sick.

English Indonesia - Bahasa News provided by SK bioscience 23 Oct, 2024, 15:11 CST Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX This approval paves the way for exports to the world's fourth most populous country. SK bioscience aims to continue to grow as a global vaccine brand beyond Korea. SEONGNAM, South Korea, Oct. 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SK bioscience, a global innovative vaccine and biotech company committed to promoting human health from prevention to cure, today announced that Indonesia's Food and Drug Agency, BPOM (Badan Pengawas Obat dan Makanan), has approved the Biologics License Application (BLA) for the SKYCellflu Quadrivalent prefilled syringe, the world's first quadrivalent cell-cultured influenza vaccine. This is the first time a domestically made influenza vaccine has received approval in Indonesia. Continue Reading SKYCellflu Quadrivalent prefilled syringe Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation with over 280 million people, is impacted by the World Health Organization's flu vaccination guidelines for both regions due to its elongated geography, spanning both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Following this approval of SKYCellflu for the Northern Hemisphere influenza strains, SK bioscience anticipates fast-tracked approval of flu vaccine for the Southern Hemisphere in Indonesia. SKYCellFlu is the world's first cell culture-based influenza vaccine to achieve WHO Prequalification (PQ) certification, demonstrating acceptable immunogenicity and safety across clinical trials. It is the only cell-cultured influenza vaccine currently available in Korea.Compared to the egg-based vaccines, its shorter production timeline makes it more suited for rapid response to pandemics or the emerging variants. SKYCellflu also doesn't require antibiotic or preservative administration.In addition, cell-cultured vaccines are less likely to mutate during the production process than those produced in fertilized eggs, allowing for a more accurate match to circulating influenza strains.In SK bioscience's research, the company conducted subcultures 15 times by employing cells for SKYCellflu production and fertilized eggs. Subculturing is the removal of the medium and transfer of cells from a previous culture into fresh growth medium, a procedure that enables the further propagation of the cell line or cell strain.The study results showed that mutations were found in three proteins within the virus in the fertilized egg method, while no mutations were found in the cells used for SKYCellflu production. These findings were presented at the 2019 Korea Interscience Working Group on Influenza (KIWI) Symposium.SKYCellflu has already been approved in multiple Asian countries, including Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Iran, Singapore, Pakistan, Mongolia, and Brunei. Last year, it was granted in Chile, marking its first approval in the South American market. SK bioscience plans to pave the way for a full-scale expansion into global export markets.Jaeyong Ahn, CEO of SK bioscience, said, "It is very encouraging that our own developed vaccines are receiving approvals worldwide, a significant step for expanding our global export market." He added, "We are confident that SK bioscience continues to grow into a global vaccine brand beyond Korea, as our vaccines, including shingles, chickenpox, and typhoid vaccines, secures WHO PQ certifications and global approvals one after another."SK bioscience Communications TeamChanghyun Jin ([email protected]) Jeannie S.

"We believe the individuals that we have gotten the results back have been exposed to infected poultry," said Washington State Secretary of Health Dr. Umair A. Shah. "We do not have evidence at this time of human-to-human spread."The farm these workers were at was the site of an avian influenza outbreak in chickens. 800,000 birds were euthanized after Washington State DOH testing indicated they were infected with the virus. Bird Flu detected in commercial flock in Franklin County"Not only are we dealing with the birds themselves and disposing of them properly, but we're also removing any eggs that could potentially be infected or exposed," said the Department of Agriculture's State Veterinarian, Dr. Amber Itle. "Those are all being disposed of and they are not entering the food chain. So, I want you to know that your eggs are safe and your poultry is safe."Health checks on the exposed workers were conducted by Benton-Franklin Health District (BFHD). The collected samples have been sent to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for final confirmation of the virus.The DOH and BFHD are monitoring exposed workers. Testing, vaccines, and treatment have been provided for those displaying symptoms.Officials say the four workers showed up to work on October 18 with red eyes, and then presumptively tested positive for the virus, though the confirmation is still pending. While they are sick, the four have not been hospitalized but are recovering."Workers who were exposed have been offered prophylactic medication," says Benton Franklin Health District's Health Officer Dr. Steven Kraeger. "We continue monitoring for the rest of the individuals that may have been exposed."Anyone who has worked on a poultry farm in Benton or Franklin counties since Oct. 7 and is having symptoms such as red eyes or respiratory infection is asked to contact BFHD at 509-460-4550.Those who encounter sick birds are asked to fill out the Washington State Department of Agriculture's reporting form, linked here. Avian influenza is a virus that naturally occurs in wild birds globally. The H5N1 virus, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), can infect other species of birds and mammals, according to the DOH.

WastewaterSCAN monitors the levels of 11 viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 190 municipal wastewater systems three times a week to inform local, regional, and national public health responses.'Critical' public health toolThe probe detected the biomarker for H5N1 at three Texas treatment plants, with two confirming that animal protein had already left processing facilities such as dairy farms. The researchers then compared the results with clinical data on flu-related healthcare visits. Every second counts when responding to emerging pathogens—that's why wastewater surveillance is a critical tool in the public health toolbox. Alessandro Zulli, PhD The findings demonstrate the value of wastewater surveillance in tracking and flagging zoonotic viruses in agricultural facilities before cases appear in animals or people, the authors said. "Every second counts when responding to emerging pathogens—that's why wastewater surveillance is a critical tool in the public health toolbox," presenting author Alessandro Zulli, PhD, postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University, said in the IDWeek news release. "Expanded use of wastewater surveillance will give public health professionals the early warning system they need to address emerging infectious diseases threats." Study shows wastewater detections accurate for norovirus News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) antikainen / iStock Norovirus can be accurately tracked in wastewater samples, which can help identify outbreaks and trends, according to a new study based on California wastewater surveillance published in Emerging Infectious Diseases.Norovirus is one of the leading causes of gastroenteritis in the United States, but surveillance is challenging because many cases are unreported, the authors said. As wastewater surveillance has proved useful and accurate for viral detections, including COVID-19, the researchers assessed its usefulness for norovirus. The authors collected wastewater data from December 17, 2022, through December 17, 2023, from 76 California wastewater utilities, as part of the WastewaterSCAN program. The authors looked for norovirus viral RNA from wastewater samples and compared findings with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) norovirus test positivity at the national and western US regional level. Activity peaked in Southern California in February That data was then cross-referenced with California Norovirus Laboratory Network (NLN)–confirmed GII norovirus outbreaks, which are published monthly. "We observed positive, statistically significant (p<0.001), moderate-to-strong correlations between California regional and statewide wastewater aggregates and US national and western regional NREVSS test positivity," the authors said. The authors said they observed distinct regional patterns to norovirus outbreaks in the state, with activity peaking February 22, 2023, in Southern California, and March 24, 2023, in the San Joaquin Valley.Given that no other local California norovirus surveillance data are available, wastewater data have been used as a local and leading indicator to support investigations of gastrointestinal illness outbreaks."Given that no other local California norovirus surveillance data are available, wastewater data have been used as a local and leading indicator to support investigations of gastrointestinal illness outbreaks," the authors concluded. "Those data have enabled LHDs [local health departments] to more (or less) aggressively pursue investigation and control efforts during gastroenteritis outbreaks, efforts that are time- and resource-intensive for LHDs, the public, and affected establishments." Carbapenem resistance remains elevated in Brazil post-COVID, study shows News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship PongMoji / iStock Carbapenem resistance rates in critically ill hospital patients in Brazil rose during the COVID-19 pandemic and have remained higher than pre-pandemic rates, researchers reported last week in the American Journal of Infection Control.For the study, researchers retrospectively analyzed data on all critically ill, mechanically ventilated adults admitted to eight Brazilian hospitals from January 1, 2018, to April 30, 2023, stratifying the patients into three periods: pre-surge (January 1, 2018, to March 1, 2020), surge (March 1, 2020, to October 1, 2021), and post-surge (after October 1, 2021). The main outcome was the number of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacterial isolates across the three periods. Brazil had one of the highest COVOD-19 burdens in the world, and notable increases in carbapenem use in Brazilian hospitals during the early months of the pandemic have previously been reported.Concerns about resistance rates remaining ‘permanently high’Of the 9,780 patients included in the study, 3,718 were in the pre-surge, 3,185 in the surge, and 2,247 in the post-surge period. The patients in the pre- and post-surge periods had similar characteristics and outcomes, while the patients in the surge period were younger (median age, 70 vs 74 pre-surge vs 75 post-surge), mainly male (57% vs 48% vs 51%), and had higher rates of mechanical ventilation (7 vs 5 days pre- and post-surge). The isolation of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria increased during the surge (rate ratio [RR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5 to 2.2 compared to pre-surge), decreased in post-surge (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.9), and remained higher than pre-surge (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.6). Resistance rates for Pseudomonas aeruginosa fell from 32% to 23% pre- to post-surge, whereas Klebsiella pneumoniae doubled during the surge, 26% to 52%, and remained higher (42%) than pre-surge. “In a post-COVID-19 world, with the emergence of new infectious diseases and ongoing challenges posed by existing pathogens, the importance of preserving the effectiveness of antimicrobials cannot be overstated,” the study authors wrote. “It is necessary to coordinate efforts to avoid antimicrobial resistance rates remaining permanently high and to prevent future similar antimicrobial stewardship breakdowns.” Italy to provide funding for CARB-X News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship The government of Italy has announced a commitment of $21 million over 3 years to support the Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X).The commitment, announced at a recent G7 Joint Finance and Health Ministers’ Meeting by Italian Health Minister Orazio Schillaci, will support CARB-X’s efforts to advance early-stage development of new antimicrobials, vaccines, and diagnostics for drug-resistant pathogens. Italy is now the sixth country to provide funding to CARB-X, which has supported 104 research-and-development projects in 13 countries since it was founded in 2016.“Italy’s investment is a powerful addition to the support we receive from our global consortium of funders, including other G7 governments and leading global health foundations,” CARB-X Executive Director Kevin Outterson, JD, said in a CARB-X press release. “This collective effort underscores the critical importance of international collaboration in the fight against AMR. Together, we are driving innovation and ensuring that the most promising research can be translated into life-saving treatments for patients worldwide.”Italy, which currently holds the G7’s rotating annual presidency, has made antimicrobial resistance (AMR) a focal point of G7 ministerial meetings.

The presence of HPAI was confirmed in each flock on October 21. CFIA did not disclose what types of poultry or how many birds were involved.These are the first HPAI infections in British Columbian poultry of 2024. The last case in the province was confirmed on December 25, 2023, with that case in Chilliwack.The new HPAI detections come just days after the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) reported that all HPAI-related primary control zones, quarantines and movement restrictions had been lifted.Prior to now, the last instance of HPAI in a Canadian commercial poultry flock was confirmed on February 19, in Mountain View County, Alberta, while the last case in a non-commercial flock was confirmed on April 10 in Haut-Saint-François, Quebec.So far in 2024, Canada has had eight commercial poultry flocks affected by HPAI. Two of those were in Quebec, while Ontario and Alberta each have had one.View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.

swept through dairy farms and chicken houses across the country and infected at least 13 farmworkers this year. (Smiley N. Pool/The Dallas Morning News/TNS) By Dan CristolUPDATED: October 25, 2024 at 10:01 AM ESTAvian influenza has been in the news for years, and until the coronavirus beat it to the punch, was expected to cause the next deadly pandemic. Also known as bird flu, avian flu, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or H5N1 (for the identity of two of its genes), this virus has circulated among wild birds for millions of years.It passes easily from bird-to-bird when it is expelled in bodily fluids and can cause severe mortality of domestic poultry when wild and domestic birds mix in barnyards. For decades, avian influenza has triggered the mass liquidation of infected flocks of turkeys or chickens in an effort to keep it from wiping out the whole industry.One strain of avian influenza strain circulating this year has gained the ability to infect mammals and caused massive die-offs of seals. It has also infected herds of cows in the United States, and the farmers who work with them. This week the number of infected workers nationwide topped 30 as several people in Washington state tasked with killing off an infected chicken flock came down with mild avian influenza. The most notable symptom besides respiratory distress is pink eye, and only six states have reported infected humans. (Surveillance is inconsistent so many more have probably been infected.)So far, this doesn’t sound too bad in terms of causing the next deadly pandemic. All that has happened is that the virus has evolved into a form that easily crosses from birds to some mammals. Herds of cows are being slaughtered to prevent spread, but the virus itself doesn’t make the cows or their handlers very sick, so far.More importantly, perhaps, is the fact that this year’s avian influenza does not yet seem to be able to spread from person-to-person easily. There is one concerning case, from Missouri, in which the patient had no known contact with cows, poultry or other animals. Several attending health care workers also reported respiratory symptoms.How could things get worse? Very easily, it turns out.Viruses often exchange genes with other viruses, and the flu season is upon us. This means that some of the genes from normal human influenza may be available to the avian influenza virus in a person infected with both. If a farm worker with human influenza is infected with avian influenza while milking a cow, the two viruses could exchange genes in one of that person’s cells. If this random accident happens repeatedly, the avian influenza virus could end up with the genes necessary to easily spread person-to-person, something the human influenza virus does very well. If it also mutates into a highly pathogenic form, a new pandemic might occur.For now, my advice is not to worry about this, but to keep paying attention, as the situation is more risky than in other years given that people are already being infected by other mammals and this virus has sometimes made people very sick. Instead of worrying about things beyond your control, I recommend doing something that is under your control, and that is voting for candidates who will protect birds.Dan Cristol teaches in the biology department at William & Mary and can be contacted at dacris@wm.edu.

Photo courtesy of Paul Franz/Greenfield Recorder. By Mara Mellits Boston University News Service Earlier this year, a nationwide outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in cows caused panic for dairy farmers everywhere. Now, Massachusetts has become the only state to test all of its dairy herds, from 95 farms, and achieve 100% negative results for the virus. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, also known as bird or avian flu, often results in death for poultry. According to the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources, cows that contract the virus exhibit lethargy and show reduced milk production for a few weeks. There have also been several cases of dairy farm workers who have contracted the virus and experienced flu-like symptoms from coming into contact with unpasteurized milk. The virus was first detected back in March in dairy cows in Texas. According to MDAR, it spread to herds in at least 14 states after that. “It’s so new this year that they’re still figuring out what the ideal host is and how it’s spreading,” said MDAR Commissioner Ashley Randle. “It’s hard to say how common it is.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state Department of Public Health consider the public health risk to be low, but are preparing in case that changes. MDAR collaborated with DPH, the Massachusetts Association of Dairy Farmers and the Broad Institute to fight the outbreak. “We as an organization really want to make sure that we’re all in this together. And there’s a certain risk to everybody,” said Mark Duffy, who serves on the board of Massachusetts Association of Dairy Farmers and operates Great Brook Farm in Carlisle. “In the scheme of things, we are all family dairy farms in Massachusetts.” Massachusetts is the only state in the country to yield a 100% negative result, however, despite the result, testing is ongoing, Randle said. MDAR is still testing herds and will continue to test this month, at no cost to the farmers. “We must remain vigilant and continue monitoring farms across the state to protect animal and public health,” DPH Commissioner Dr. Robert Goldstein said in a statement. “This is a great example of how collaboration across government and with communities can result in better health and maintain the integrity of the local dairy industry.” Randle said MDAR is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to have a national model that states can follow. “It does take quite a bit of staff time and capacity to travel to all the herds and do testing,” Randle said. “We’re hoping that the processors will be able to assist when they’re picking up milk from the farms, to be able to take the samples as well.” Duffy said state milk inspectors come in and pull samples out of the tank where the milk is stored. “We really stress that the milk supply is safe,” Duffy said. “This is to prevent it from spreading in the dairy herd, which, if it was to occur, and it has not occurred, would have an impact on our cows.” Andrea O’Brien of O’Brien Farm in Orange said because her farm produces raw milk, she’s already used to the milk getting tested every month, so it didn’t have an impact on her farm. Yet, O’Brien said because of the size of her farm, she knows right away when something isn’t normal. “If we have a sick cow, we know right away, whereas if you’re milking 10,000, you don’t have the same sort of management,” O’Brien said. Peter Laznicka and Kat Chang operate Reed Farm in Sunderland, a small-scale poultry farm and processor. They have to take strict biosecurity measures to ensure their 10,000 chickens don’t get sick. Chang said the two are always thinking about preventing illness. They take measures to make sure they are not cross-contaminating and keeping the area clean. “We’re just very careful. We make sure any birds that show up are healthy,” Laznicka said. Randle said the virus in cattle spreads when moving in between herds. She said the size of the herds doesn’t matter but the movement of the cattle and the hygiene of the equipment is what counts. She said the virus was first detected in cows in Texas due to animals that had moved from one farm to another. “All it takes is one animal to move that has the presence of the virus, or workers that may be working on different dairy farms, or going from a poultry operation to a dairy and back again,” Randle said. Randle said because Massachusetts was the first state to yield a 100% negative result, it set a model for other states to follow. She attributed success to starting a partnership with farmers and public health officials early and keeping all lines of communication open. This story originally appeared in the Greenfield Recorder.

millions of Americans each fall, winter and early spring, causing doctor visits, hospitalizations and deaths. The Pennsylvania Department of Health estimates 5% to 20% of the state’s residents get the flu each year. The state says 120 to 2,000 people die each flu season from flu complications, the most common of which is pneumonia. There are a lot of myths out there about the flu and the flu shot, so we hope clearing things up will make you better prepared. Myth 1: The flu shot can give you the flu. The simple answer is no. The National Foundation for Infectious Diseases says that’s because flu vaccines are made with flu viruses that are either weakened, inactivated (killed), or recombinant (made without influenza viruses or eggs). It can take two weeks for the flu vaccine to become effective. Myth 2: Healthy people don’t need a flu vaccine. Anyone can get the flu, even someone who considers themselves the pinnacle of good health. Getting vaccinated each year is important for everyone age 6 months and older. And vaccination can help prevent the spread of the virus to others who may be vulnerable to flu and related complications. Myth 3: The flu is just the same as a bad cold. Flu and colds are caused by different viruses and the flu can be a lot worse than the common cold. Flu symptoms come on suddenly and can last two weeks or longer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says flu symptoms can include the following: • Fever • Cough • Sore throat • Runny or stuffy nose • Muscle or body aches • Headaches • Fatigue • Vomiting and diarrhea Myth 4: Everyone should get the same flu vaccine. Most people should get the standard flu vaccine, but those 65 and older can get a high-dose vaccine that prompts a stronger immune response. Senior citizens are at higher risk for severe flu and complications, says the CDC. Myth 5: The flu vaccine isn’t safe. The CDC says the flu vaccine has a good safety record, with hundreds of millions of Americans getting the shots over the past 50 years. It’s the best way to reduce your chances of getting the flu or spreading it to others. The flu vaccine can have side effects — such as muscle aches, nausea and fever — but they are generally mild and go away on their own after a few days. Life-threatening, severe reactions to the flu vaccine are rare and you should not get the vaccine if you have had that reaction to the vaccine or any of its ingredients. Talk with your doctor if you have a reaction to eggs or any of the vaccine components or if you’ve had Guillain-Barré syndrome. Getting your flu shot has never been easier Do you know that you can go to LVHN ExpressCARE–Palmerton for your flu shot? Located at 528 Delaware Ave., Palmerton, they are open 365 days a year and no appointment is necessary.

Medscape Medical NewsConference NewsIDWeek 2024Wastewater Acts as an Early Warning System for Bird Flu OutbreaksMarcia Frellick October 21, 2024 00LOS ANGELES — Researchers found a biomarker for avian flu in Texas wastewater treatment plants more than a month before the first confirmed cases of H5N1 among Texas dairy cattle in 2024, according to new data presented at the Infectious Disease Week (IDWeek) 2024 Annual Meeting.The retrospective finding demonstrates the power of wastewater monitoring in detecting pathogens that could alert public health departments earlier to impending outbreaks.Outbreaks of H5N1 were seen regularly in poultry in the United States, but the latest outbreak “has been very concerning because of the spread in cattle and a few human cases,” presenting author Alessandro Zulli, PhD, postdoctoral fellow, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, said.As of October 11, 20 human cases of H5 bird flu have been reported in the United States since April of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One other case was reported in 2022.Researchers were looking to explain unseasonal spikes in influenza A virus seen in Texas wastewater treatment plants in early 2024. Zulli and colleagues turned to wastewater monitoring, which had been used historically to track viruses for cholera, typhoid, and polio but recently was used to track severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Zulli noted wastewater-based epidemiology is useful with tracking an array of other pathogens, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus.Zulli is part of the Stanford WastewaterSCAN team, which operates in partnership with Emory University, Atlanta, and industry partner, Verily. The team monitors wastewater nationally to track more than a dozen pathogens across 190 wastewater locations three times a week and publicly displays the results on a dashboard at data.Wastewaterscan.org within 48 hours of readings.Their data had shown an increase in H5N1 in poultry, mammals, and wild birds in late 2023 and early 2024, so they investigated whether the influenza increase in Texas could be H5N1.They developed a hydrolysis probe digital droplet H5 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for detecting the H5 hemagglutinin gene found in bird flu and demonstrated it to be 100% specific and 90% sensitive, according to the data. They distributed the test to wastewater treatment plants and identified wastewater treatment plants that had registered increases in influenza A concentrations beyond seasonal variations.During the monitoring period, after the seasonal influenza period had ended, 59 wastewater treatment plants showed increases in the H5 gene in bird flu that coincided with the recorded emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in dairy cattle.At a wastewater plant in Amarillo, Texas, he said, retrospective sampling by the Stanford team found that H5N1 had been detected on February 24, 2024, 2 weeks before cattle illnesses were reported in Texas. “The first cattle illness was reported on March 7, and at that point they didn’t know what it was,” Zulli said. The first confirmed detection of H5N1 in dairy cattle was on March 25. A month can give public health officials a good amount of time to develop a response, he said.“We have the infrastructure and expertise necessary to deploy rapid responses to these emerging pathogens,” Zulli said. “We’ve demonstrated that — perhaps most convincingly — with H5N1, where we’ve been able to detect avian influenza markers well before clinical cases or the detection of cattle in 32 locations across eight states.”He said with information ahead of time, public health officials can deploy staff to test poultry farms and cattle farms to test for the virus and medical facilities to look for increased cases of conjunctivitis, for example, which has been the primary symptom for humans infected by cattle.“Wastewater monitoring remains the fastest, most unbiased method to actually measure the prevalence and spread of pathogens in a population. Leveraging this could have enormous implications for understanding the spread of illnesses and implementing interventions like the ones we have for H5N1,” Zulli said.In the future, researchers need to better understand the shedding of the viruses — how much is from humans and how much from animals, Zulli said.Karl Evans Henson, MD, an infectious disease physician and director of the Department of Advanced Medical Education at The Medical City in Pasig City, Philippines, who was not part of the study, said Zulli’s demonstration of 1 month of lead time in capturing the increase of the avian flu virus could have implications for a variety of diseases. In the Philippines, he said, wastewater is being used most prominently to track the polio virus.He added that wastewater monitoring “has applicability in the One Health field,” a global health systems approach that aims to balance and integrate the health of people, animals, and ecosystems.Zulli reported no relevant financial relationships.Henson reported honoraria from BSV BioScience Philippines and Merck Sharp & Dohme; grant support from Cathay Drug Company, Inc.; and is an adviser for Pfizer.Marcia Frellick is a freelance journalist based in Chicago.

Franklin County is in the southeastern part of the state. The results in poultry have been confirmed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).The spurt of infections in poultry workers is reminiscent of what Colorado experienced over the summer, when nine infections were reported in cullers who were part of the response outbreaks on large commercial farms.The WSDH said the Benton-Franklin Health District conducted health checks of exposed workers and coordinated testing at the Washington State Public Health Lab. Samples have been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for final confirmation. Similar to earlier infections in US poultry and dairy farm workers, the Washington patients had mild symptoms and have been provided with antiviral medication. The WSDH said test results on other farm workers are pending and that case numbers could change.The Benton-Franklin Health District is asking any employees or contractors who may have worked on a Benton or Franklin county poultry farm since October 7 to contact the health department if they have symptoms such as conjunctivitis or respiratory infection. Meanwhile, the USDA confirmed a second highly pathogenic avian flu outbreak in Washington poultry, which appears to involve a backyard facility that has 60 birds. The Washington and California cases, if confirmed, would push the national total this year to 31 human cases, all but 1 linked to contact with infected poultry or cattle. Large California broiler farm, more dairy farms hitAmid an uptick in H5N1 detections in dairy cows and poultry, the USDA has confirmed an outbreak at a broiler farm in the same Central Valley area that has been hit hard by outbreaks in dairy cows. The virus was detected at a broiler facility in Tulare County that has 786,600 birds.Also, the USDA has confirmed the virus in 7 more California dairy herds, raising the state's total to 131 and the national total of confirmed outbreaks to 331 across 14 states.

FILE PHOTO Posted Friday, October 25, 2024 8:33 am By The Chronicle staff Avian influenza has been identified in a Lewis County poultry flock, according to a news release from Lewis County Public Health and Social Service. A backyard flock tested preliminary positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, as reported by the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA). According to the county, testing was completed after the owner of the flock reported sick and dying birds to the WSDA. Samples from the birds tested preliminary positive for H5N1 at the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Lab, according to the release. Confirmatory testing at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory is pending. “Lewis County Public Health and Social Services is in contact with residents exposed to the infected birds to provide health education and to monitor for symptoms,” said Lewis County Health Officer Dr. Joe Wiley. No human illnesses related to the Lewis County flock have been reported. Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a disease caused by infection with Type A viruses. “These viruses occur naturally in wild aquatic birds, but can also infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, domestic ducks and geese) and other bird species, as well as wildlife and domestic animals,” the county health department stated. “On rare occasions, bird flu viruses infect people and make them sick. Most instances of people becoming infected with avian influenza have happened after prolonged, close contact with animals infected with avian influenza or to environments contaminated with avian influenza.” Earlier this month, Washington state health officials announced four agricultural workers tested presumptively positive for bird flu, the first presumed human cases in the state. “The four worked with infected birds at an egg farm in Franklin County where 800,000 chickens were euthanized after testing positive Tuesday,” The Seattle Times reported. “The workers had mild symptoms and received antiviral medication. More worker testing is underway and ‘the number of cases under investigation may change,’ the department said. The likely infections would make Washington the sixth state to record human infections of the bird flu strain H5N1. Health officials have reported 27 human cases across the country this year, some after exposure to poultry and others after exposure to cattle, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One case reported in Missouri last month involved someone with no known animal exposure.” Although avian influenza is a highly contagious disease among birds, the risk of it spreading to the general public is low, the county health department stated in the release. “However, those with exposure to infected animals are at increased risk and should take precautions to protect their health. If avian influenza is suspected in your flock, wear appropriate personal protective equipment while caring for your birds, entering the coop or if you are in contact with any surfaces, water or feed that could be contaminated with their saliva, feces or other bodily fluids. Take steps to protect the health of your flock by reducing your poultry’s exposure to wild animals and birds.” Report sick or dead domestic birds to the WSDA’s Avian Health Program at 1-800-606-3056 or through https://fortress.wa.gov/agr/appsad/.

UNMC Nebraska Medicine Current Students Faculty & Staff Alumni Language Amharic Arabic Chinese (Simplified) English Myanmar (Burmese) Nepali Persian Somali Spanish Sundanese Swahili Vietnamese Powered byGoogle Translate Search UNMC Search UNMC Search Home — Newsroom — Colleague vaccination rates for flu, COVID-19 are lagging Colleague vaccination rates for flu, COVID-19 are lagging Written by Aimee Grindstaff, Nebraska Medicine Published Oct 22, 2024 A patient receives a flu shot The med center is counting on all colleagues to come together to raise its organizational vaccine compliance and documentation rates for both influenza and COVID-19. Respiratory viral illness season is here. Now is the time to get vaccinated for influenza and COVID-19. Organizationally, the med center is falling short of expectations and must rally together to do its part. As shared previously, the goal is 90% vaccine compliance for influenza, with a 100% documentation rate for influenza. As of Oct. 21, the med center is well below goal, with an influenza vaccination rate of 30.7% for Nebraska Medicine colleagues, 28.9% for UNMC faculty and staff and a documentation rate of 34.9% for both organizations. Only 9.5% of colleagues, faculty and staff are vaccinated for COVID-19, and 17.9% have completed documentation. “We must come together to get vaccinated and do the right thing for the safety of our patients, peers and communities,” said Kelly Cawcutt, MD, Nebraska Medicine’s infection prevention and hospital epidemiology medical director and assistant professor in the UNMC Division of Infectious Diseases. “We still have a few weeks to improve these numbers, and we need everyone to be accountable and take action.” Vaccination is strongly recommended for all Nebraska Medicine colleagues and UNMC faculty and staff. If anyone has been delaying a flu shot, now is the time to get it, along with the COVID-19 vaccine. There are three ways to get vaccinated: If someone works in a clinical area that has staff to administer the influenza vaccine, get a flu shot in your clinical area. (COVID-19 vaccines are not available for colleague administration in clinical areas.) If someone does not work in a clinical area, visit one of the remaining drop-in vaccine clinics. No appointment is required. Remember to complete the influenza questionnaire on the Health Tracking System before arriving and bring your ID badge. Visit an outpatient pharmacy, health center or receive a dose in the community at another location. Remember to bring your health insurance card and record the vaccination status in the Health Tracking System afterward. Learn more about how to track vaccination status here. Regardless of vaccination, all Nebraska Medicine colleagues and UNMC faculty and staff are required to document their influenza and COVID-19 vaccination status in the Health Tracking System. The organization is obligated to report this information to regulatory bodies. Nebraska Medicine colleagues and UNMC employees who received vaccines outside their clinical area or a Nebraska Medicine drop-in clinic or if they declined the vaccination should log in to the Health Tracking System as soon as possible to complete this reporting. Colleagues also are required to fill out the annual tuberculosis symptom questionnaire at this time. Log in to the Health Tracking System to complete this task. Get vaccinated for a chance to win a prize Nebraska Medicine and UNMC employees have two chances to earn a reward: Nebraska Medicine and dually-employed colleagues who document the completion of their influenza vaccine in their Empower Your Well-Being portal will be entered into a drawing for 2,800 Empower Prize Store points, which equals a $25 gift card. Ten winners will be chosen, and the drawing will take place at the end of November. All Nebraska Medicine and UNMC employees who document their vaccination in the Health Tracking System (whether they received their vaccine at a drop-in clinic, in their clinical area or elsewhere in the community) will be entered into a drawing for one of 20 vouchers to The Company Store.

Influenza is a respiratory disease that typically causes fever, cough and body aches. While many people recover from influenza within a week to 10 days, for some, an infection can cause severe illness. Every year, influenza causes an estimated 12,200 hospitalizations and 3,500 deaths in Canada. “It’s a good idea for everyone aged 6 months or older to get an influenza vaccine, but it’s especially important for adults aged 65 years or older, pregnant people and individuals who have medical conditions that put them at higher risk of complications from influenza infection,” says Kwong, the Associate Director of the Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases (CVPD), adding that medical conditions of concern include heart diseases, diabetes and even obesity. Prof. Natalie Crown The most common reason for Canadians to not get a flu shot is because they don’t think it’s necessary — a sentiment Natalie Crown, Associate Professor in the Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, has heard before. “Sometimes people will tell me they don’t get vaccinated because they think they don’t need it — for example, they’ll say they are healthy and rarely get sick themselves,” says Crown, who is also a CVPD member. “The reality is getting the flu vaccine is one of most effective ways of protecting ourselves from the flu and its complications, and we are doing our part to protect the more vulnerable people around us who are at higher risk of developing complications from the flu.” Why the influenza vaccine is especially important this year This year, public health officials are also concerned about a strain of influenza circulating in wild birds and some agricultural animals. While the risk to the general population is still low, avian influenza A H5N1 has infected some humans who have close contact with sick animals. “While current influenza vaccines don’t protect against avian influenza, they may reduce the risk of infection with human influenza viruses and therefore the possibility of both human and avian influenza viruses infecting someone at the same time. These co-infections could create a new ‘version’ of influenza that might spread easily among humans and cause very severe disease” says Kwong. When to get the influenza vaccine The flu season doesn’t have a precise start and end date. According to the National Advisory Committee on Immunizations (NACI), influenza season typically starts in December but can start as early as October or as late as February. Prof. Jeff Kwong, CVPD Associate Director Influenza vaccines will be available first for high-risk individuals and then for the public beginning in late October and early November. Since antibodies generated by influenza vaccines gradually decrease over time, Kwong takes a strategic approach to timing his influenza vaccine — but notes that may not be the best approach for everyone. “I tend to wait until around mid-November to get my influenza vaccine, so I will be protected in December when influenza activity often starts, and I can be fairly confident that the vaccine will still offer some protection up to May,” says Kwong. “However, for those at high risk, getting the influenza vaccine in late October is not a bad idea because occasionally influenza activity can start earlier than December.” Where to get the influenza vaccine The University of Toronto community now has access to the newly opened Discovery Pharmacy, located in the Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy on the university’s St. George Campus. “Discovery Pharmacy is a dedicated community pharmacy that serves our local community,” says Crown. “They have a convenient online booking process and can help with all your vaccine and medication-related questions.” For the broader public, influenza vaccines will be available at local community pharmacies, through primary care providers or at dedicated community clinics offered by public health units across the country.

(Photo: Gaizka Iroz, Getty Images) (Photo: Gaizka Iroz, Getty Images) Share BY FRANK SUMRALL MyNorthwest Content Editor The first possible human avian influenza infection might be in Washington after the State Department of Health (DOH) announced it is investigating an illness that has spread among multiple agriculture workers in Franklin County. According to the DOH, four agriculture workers at a poultry farm in Franklin County showed signs of sickness and were being treated with anti-viral medication. “We are confirming that four agricultural workers have tested presumptively positive for avian influenza,” Secretary of Health for Washington, Doctor Umair Shah, told KIRO Newsradio on Monday. More from DOH: Patients at Washington dental clinic told to get tested for HIV, hepatitis The DOH stated the cases are under investigation. “These are the first presumed human cases of H5 virus under investigation in Washington state,” the DOH wrote in a press release. “The cases took place at a farm that was the site of an avian influenza outbreak in chickens. Approximately 800,000 birds were euthanized after test results by the Washington State Department of Agriculture on Oct. 15 showed that they were infected with avian influenza.” Avian influenza is a disease caused by avian influenza Type A viruses that naturally occur in wild aquatic birds worldwide. H5N1 viruses can also infect other species of birds — and occasionally mammals — and can cause significant mortality in poultry species, including chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese and guinea fowl. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is also involved in confirming whether it is avian influenza. If confirmed, Washington would be the sixth state to find the H5N1 infection in humans. “Washington has monitored the spread of H5N1 closely since it was first detected in poultry in the state in 2022, and our state is prepared with the knowledge, relationships, and tools to minimize its impacts on our community,” said Washington Secretary of Health Umair Shah M.D., MPH. However, Shah said there is no evidence at this time of human-to-human spread. The DOH, with assistance from the Benton-Franklin Health District (BFHD), has provided personal protective equipment to workers on the farm and is monitoring any exposed workers for symptoms of avian influenza. Testing, vaccines and treatment for symptomatic workers has been made readily available. Walnuts recalled as E. coli hospitalizes 7: Which Washington stores sold them? Avian influenza viruses can infect people and make them sick on rare occasions. Most instances of people becoming infected with avian influenza have happened after prolonged, close contact with animals also infected with avian influenza. However, Doctor Amber Itle with the Washington State Department of Agriculture stressed eggs are safe. “Your eggs are safe and your poultry is safe as well,” she said. “So no birds that are infected or have been infected are entering the food chain.” Anyone who has worked on a poultry farm in Benton or Franklin County since Oct. 7 is asked to call (509) 460-4550 if they experience any symptoms such as red eyes or respiratory infection.

The campaign, “Play Defense Against the Flu,” features public-service announcements in English and Spanish that encourage vaccination in advance of flu season, which in the Northern Hemisphere is generally from about October to May. The flu season typically peaks from December to February, though flu seasons vary and are unpredictable in their timing and duration. Advancing public health AMA membership offers unique access to savings and resources tailored to enrich the personal and professional lives of physicians, residents and medical students. Learn More “We urge everyone 6 months and older to get vaccinated against the flu, ideally before virus begins spreading in your community,” said AMA President Bruce A. Scott, MD. “Black and Hispanic populations are at higher risk of severe complications from the flu due to longstanding health care inequities and disproportionately low vaccination coverage. Our campaign particularly focuses on Black and Hispanic populations to help improve vaccination rates in these communities. The AMA will continue to support efforts to improve vaccination rates and achieve optimal health for all people.”Why it’s important: During last year’s flu season, only half of the U.S. population got a flu vaccine, and 35 million or more people contracted the flu. At least 390,000 people were hospitalized with the virus, and an estimated 25,000 died of the flu or from complications related to it. A range of experts consulted by the CDC estimated a 54% chance that the peak hospitalization burden of COVID-19, influenza and RSV combined will be similar to that of the 2023–2024 respiratory-virus season. The experts estimated an 18% chance that it will be at least 20% higher this season, and a 28% chance it would be at least 20% lower.The AMA and CDC both recommend that everyone 6 months and older get the updated COVID-19 and flu vaccines every year, with rare exceptions. What doctors wish patients knew Subscribe for the answers to the latest questions patients are bringing to the exam room. Subscribe Now Though the vaccine does not guarantee a person will not get the flu, it cuts the chance of infection and significantly reduces the chance of more serious complications, particularly among patients in high-risk groups such as children and those older than 65. Last year, CDC data showed that the flu shot reduced hospitalizations for children by about half and by about 40% for adults. A recent CDC report analyzing 2024 data from the Southern Hemisphere, which has an earlier flu season, showed that the flu vaccine reduced hospitalizations there among high-risk groups by about 35%.The recently released public-service announcement shows a team of antibodies getting ready in their locker room to fight against the flu. They’re a strong team already, but the flu shot provides them with the strength and gear they need to beat the flu. The campaign spots will be featured on TV, radio, social media and other formats in time and space donated by several media companies. Learn more: The AMA recently highlighted the influenza vaccine in “8 things doctors wish patients knew about flu vaccines,” part of its What Doctors Wish Patients Knew™ series. The AMA also provides advice for how to talk to your patients—including with those who have previously expressed hesitancy—about vaccination for influenza, and what to say in response to some of the more commonly expressed concerns.

This 2005 electron microscope image shows an avian influenza A H5N1 virion. (Cynthia Goldsmith, Jackie Katz/CDC via AP) Officials find no evidence bird flu is spreading between people after Missouri investigation By Associated Press Missouri PUBLISHED 7:00 AM CT Oct. 26, 2024 PUBLISHED October 26, 2024 @7:00 AM SHARE NEW YORK (AP) â Health officials said Thursday that there's no evidence bird flu is spreading between people after investigating a mysterious infection in Missouri. The illness reported last month was different from the 30 other bird flu infections in people in the U.S. so far this year. Those cases have been in farmworkers who had contact with infected dairy cows or chickens. There was no known contact with an infected animal in the Missouri case, but health officials said Thursday thatâs the only remaining explanation. "There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission,â said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely in the U.S. among wild birds, poultry, cows and a number of other animals. Its growing presence increases the chances that people will be exposed, and potentially catch it, officials say. The most recent of the 31 confirmed human cases are two workers at a commercial egg farm in Franklin County, in southeast Washington state. The rest: 15 in California, 10 in Colorado, two in Michigan, one in Texas and the unusual one in Missouri. Symptoms have been mostly mild, including eye redness. Few details have been released about the Missouri case. The person had preexisting health problems and was hospitalized in late August. The patient was given a test for flu that was positive for influenza A, a broad virus category. Further testing found partial genetic sequences similar to bird flu viruses from U.S. dairy cows. Because the Missouri person did not work at a farm and had no known contact with an infected animal, health officials have been looking into the possibility it had come from another person with an undetected infection. That kind of spread would be a worrisome sign the virus might be turning into a more common threat to humans. They did complicated blood testing of the patient, five hospital workers, and a person described as a âhousehold contactâ of the patient â looking for antibodies that would serve as proof of a past infection. The household contact got a stomach illness at the same time as the patient, but was not initially tested. On Thursday, CDC officials said test results were negative for the health care workers. The patient and the household contact showed signs of past infection in one round of testing, but not in others. Neither met the World Health Organization's blood testing threshold for a bird flu case. The household contact is not part of the U.S. tally. Since they both got sick at the same time, officials believe the patient and the contact were exposed together to some unknown animal or animal product â ruling out spread of the virus from one of them to the other, Daskalakis said.

(AP Photo/David Goldman) South Carolina DPH confirms first 2024 flu related death By Allissa Young South Carolina PUBLISHED 10:59 AM ET Oct. 24, 2024 PUBLISHED 10:59 AM EDT Oct. 24, 2024 SHARE COLUMBIA, S.C. - Just three weeks into the flu season, the South Carolina Department of Public Health announced on Wednesday that the state has suffered its first influenza-associated death. âSadly, a person from the Midlands region has died from complications due to the flu, becoming our first confirmed influenza-associated death of the season that officially started September 29,â said Dr. Linda Bell, State Epidemiologist and Director of DPHâs Health Programs Branch. DPH and the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older get vaccinated. Protecting yourself against the flu is extremely important for people who are at an increased risk from the virus such as young children, pregnant women, people 65 and older, and those with chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes, or heart or lung disease. Preventive methods that protect against the flu and other respiratory viruses include vaccination, masks, frequent handwashing, and staying home or away for others while sick. âRegardless of what this season will bring, we can be prepared for significant activity not only from the flu, but respiratory illnesses in general,â Dr. Bell said. Flu vaccines offered at DPH health department clinics are available by appointment. To make an appointment or to find the nearest location on their website.

According to the state Department of Health, the individuals experienced mild symptoms and have been provided with antiviral medication. Testing of additional individuals on the farm is currently pending, and the number of cases under investigation may change. These are the first presumed human cases of H5 virus under investigation in Washington state. The cases took place at a farm that was the site of an avian influenza outbreak in chickens. About 800,000 birds were euthanized after test results by the Washington State Department of Agriculture on Oct. 15 showed that they were infected with avian influenza. The Benton-Franklin Health District conducted health checks of exposed workers and coordinated testing at the Washington State Public Health Lab. The samples have been forwarded to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for final confirmation and analysis of the virus. Image courtesy of Farm Watch, Flickr The Benton-Frankin Health District and the Washington State Department of Health are working with the Washington State Department of Agriculture and the CDC on the regional response to this outbreak. DOH and BFHD have provided personal protective equipment to workers on the farm, are monitoring exposed workers for symptoms of avian influenza, and are providing testing, vaccines, and treatment for symptomatic workers. Any employees or contractors who may have worked on a poultry farm in Benton or Franklin counties since Oct. 7 should contact BFHD at 509-460-4550 if they have symptoms such as red eyes or respiratory infections. Washington is the sixth state to identify a human infection of H5N1. H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has caused ongoing multistate outbreaks in poultry, dairy cattle, and wildlife. “Washington has monitored the spread of H5N1 closely since it was first detected in poultry in the state in 2022, and our state is prepared with the knowledge, relationships, and tools to minimize its impacts on our community,” said Washington Secretary of Health Dr. Umair Shah. The DOH has worked in partnership with the Washington State Department of Agriculture and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife to respond to detections of H5N1 in animals in the state, and to monitor the health of people exposed to infected animals. The DOH has worked with these animal health partners to distribute personal protective equipment and informational materials to dairy and poultry farmers. Avian influenza is a disease caused by avian influenza Type A viruses that naturally occur in wild aquatic birds throughout the world. H5N1 viruses can also infect other species of birds, and occasionally mammals, and can cause significant mortality in poultry species, such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese, or guinea fowl. On rare occasions, avian influenza viruses infect people and make them sick. Most instances of people becoming infected with avian influenza have happened after prolonged, close contact with animals infected with avian influenza or environments contaminated with avian influenza. The CDC currently considers the risk to the general public from this H5N1 avian influenza to be low; however, people with job-related or recreational exposures to infected birds, cattle, or other potentially impacted domestic or wild animals are at higher risk and should take precautions, including wearing personal protective equipment.

Four egg farm workers in Washington state have tested "presumptively positive" for bird flu.This suspected outbreak in Franklin County marks the first time the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 has been detected in humans in Washington. It is now the sixth U.S. state where humans have tested positive for this highly infectious strain of the virus.Around 800,000 chickens at the same farm were euthanized after the Washington State Department of Agriculture found they had been infected by an outbreak of avian influenza on October 15.Workers at the farm were subsequently tested, leading to four testing "presumptively positive" for the virus, the Washington State Department of Health said."Washington has monitored the spread of H5N1 closely since it was first detected in poultry in the state in 2022, and our state is prepared with the knowledge, relationships, and tools to minimize its impacts on our community," Washington Secretary of Health Umair Shah said in a Washington State Health Department statement. What Is H5N1 Bird Flu?Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, refers to influenza viruses that primarily infect birds but can sometimes spread to other animals, including humans. There are many subtypes, but the most well-known strain that affects humans is H5N1.Bird flu viruses are divided into two categories: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). H5N1 is an HPAI that causes severe illness and a high mortality rate in birds."Avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) and A(H5N6) viruses have been responsible for most human illness from avian influenza viruses reported worldwide to date, including the most serious illnesses with high mortality," the CDC explains.There has been a notable outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in wild birds around the world in recent months. Over 100 million domestic birds across 48 U.S. states and dairy cows across 14 states have also been affected. Stock image of chickens (main) and a virus (inset).

CDC graphic shoings how bird flu viruses can spread between infected birds and people. Four workers tested positive for N5H1 bird flu at a Washington state egg farm. CDC Before the Washington farm workers, the CDC reported 27 cases of H5N1 bird flu in humans in the U.S. this year, 16 of which have been confirmed as H5N1.Thirteen of these cases were reported in California, 10 in Colorado, two in Michigan, and one each in Missouri and Texas. One additional case was previously detected in a poultry worker in Colorado in 2022."CDC believes the current risk to the general public from bird flu viruses is low," the CDC said. "The spread of bird flu viruses from one infected person to a close contact is very rare, and when it has happened, it has not led to continued spread among people."Symptoms of Bird Flu in HumansBird flu symptoms in humans include typical flu-like symptoms, such as conjunctivitis, fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, muscle aches, headaches and fatigue.In some cases, infection may lead to more severe conditions such as pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and even death. H5N1 bird flu has previously been found to have a mortality rate of around 50 percent in humans.The Franklin County farm workers were found to have only mild symptoms and have been treated with antiviral medication."Testing of additional individuals on the farm is currently pending and the number of cases under investigation may change," the Washington State Department of Health said."[Washington State Department of Health] and [Benton-Frankin Health District] have provided personal protective equipment to workers on the farm, are monitoring exposed workers for symptoms of avian influenza, and are providing testing, vaccines, and treatment for symptomatic workers."Do you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

Coronavirus infections led to 32,576 deaths during the 12 months, with those aged 65 or older accounting for 97 percent of the total, while the number of influenza fatalities reached 2,244, according to the health ministry's vital statistics. Electron micrograph of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus. (File photo courtesy of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases)(Kyodo) After the virus was downgraded to the same legal status as influenza on May 8 last year, the government removed guidelines, including the seven-day quarantine period for those who tested positive, to facilitate the normalization of social and economic activities. "Each of us has to think about how we can lessen the number of victims in Japan as we face an aging society," said Hitoshi Oshitani, a virology professor at Tohoku University. The government discontinued financial support for coronavirus treatment and prevention on April 1. The coronavirus continues to mutate, forming new variants that remain highly contagious and spread rapidly. In 2022, 47,638 people died after contracting the virus, as the Omicron strain became prevalent. The death toll dropped to 38,086 in 2023, aided by the effects of vaccination and natural immunity, according to the data. "In order to reduce the number of deaths while continuing social economic activities, the government should provide financial aid for the elderly to take tests and receive vaccines," Oshitani said.

What it’s like dealing with avian influenza on a dairy farm Lower milk production and the need to treat many cows are some of the challenges By John Greig Reading Time: 4 minutes Published: October 21, 2024 Calf health, Cow health, Dairy, Livestock The World Dairy Expo went on despite the avian influenza in dairy cattle outbreak in the United States. There have been no cases of the outbreak in Wisconsin.

Avian influenza is hitting American cows and dairy farms hard when they have an outbreak of the disease, say farmers who have had it on their operation. ADVERTISEMENT Read Also Jeffrey-Way Hard Rock Twigs wins Royal Supreme Champion Jeffrey-Way Hard Rock Twigs won her second of North America’s major dairy show championships when she took the Royal Agricultural… Mortality on farms varies greatly, but some have had up to eight per cent. The number of infectious cases also varies, but can be around 20 per cent of animals. Why it matters: The disease is moving through dairy herds in United States after it jumped from a bird to cows in the spring and is having a significant impact. There have been no cases found yet in Canadian dairy herds. The virus spread has slowed down recently and the outbreak is now mostly centred in California, with 97 cases in the past 30 days. Montana is the only other state with a new case in the past 30 days. Brent Wilson, who owns Wilson Centennial Farms in Carson City, Mi. has been public about how the disease affects his herd. H5N1 avian influenza is a reportable disease in the United States, but herds that are found to be positive with the disease are not made public. Wilson has a leading herd and has collaborated on research over years with Michigan State University. He decided that speaking publicly and working with the researchers on the new disease was more valuable than staying silent. Because so many herds are not publicly disclosing infections, not a lot of research is being done on the disease. His first clue that something was wrong in his herd was when herd average somatic cell count jumped to 200,000 from less than 75,000. ADVERTISEMENT “All of a sudden we’ve got sick cows and we’re pumping them with electrolytes and aspirin,” he said at the recent World Dairy Expo in Madison, Wi. Students from the Michigan State veterinary school tested his cows for eight weeks and found that 22 per cent of the cows in his 1,250 cow dairy were infected. They are now trying to clear the herd of the infection, but milk production is down by five to seven pounds on average and their usual combined seven pounds per day of butter fat and protein combined is well down. The cows get sick with influenza-like symptoms, can go off feed, have runny noses, often develop mastitis and have increased abortions and cows that are already thin or compromised have less chance of recovering. “I’ve lost a tremendous amount of peak lactations. We’ve experienced abortions, particularly in later lactation cows,” he said. Wilson is worried how those cows will perform in the next lactation. That’s a concern across the United States and researchers like Dr. Jason Lombard, from Colorado State University, are trying to answer those questions about a fast-evolving, new disease. ADVERTISEMENT Immunocompromised cows are more affected, Lombard said at the World Dairy Expo. That includes cows who are pregnant, which explains why there are more abortions in cows with avian influenza. Lots to learn Lombard has researched how the disease is transmitted and there are still many questions to answer. Researchers swabbed 126 places on milk trucks in Michigan leaving infected farms and found only one positive test for the virus, so trucks are not considered a major vector for the disease. He cautioned that trucks could be found to be an issue elsewhere. Movement of wild birds has also been ruled out in the spread of the disease. Some poultry on farms near to infected dairy farms have tested positive, but it’s believed that the infection came from the dairy to the poultry barn. The biggest remaining question is whether the virus moves through the air – termed aerosol spread. “We haven’t been able to really prove that aerosol spread is an issue,” he says, but testing shows that most animals in a herd are exposed even if they don’t get sick, which would suggest potential aerosol spread. There are also closed herds, which have imported no cattle and share no workers which have also broken with the virus, which would also suggest potential aerosol spread. ADVERTISEMENT Testing or not? Some dairy farmers like Brian Pacheco who owns Pacheco Dairy in Fresno, Cali., have decided to test cows each week for H5N1. The first case in California was 10 miles from his farm. A group of cows from California had been sold to Iowa. For whatever reason, some were sent back to California and were resold into three herds. The cows had brought the disease back from Iowa. Pacheco milks about 1,400 cows and has a herd of 100 top Brown Swiss cows. He hasn’t bought or added cows to his farm for years. However, he’s identified other risk factors, including cattle destined for beef leaving the herd on a weekly basis. Those truck tires are sprayed entering and leaving the farm and workers coming onto the farm wear disposable boots and gloves. His workers only work on his farm. “We try to be reasonable and practical on what we have to do,” he said at the World Dairy Expo. He says on a friend’s dairy with 2,500 cows with an outbreak, they drench 400 cows per day, which means a crew working from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. and bringing in totes of electrolytes. ADVERTISEMENT He’s eager to avoid that situation, so has decided to test his herd. That creates some concern, but he’s decided it’s worth it. “I wait with anxious anxiety each week” for the results of the tests, he says. So far, in dairy-dense Fresno County, his herd is still negative for H5N1. World Dairy Expo still went on In another area of the United States with a lot of cows, Wisconsin, home of the World Dairy Expo which brings thousands of people and cows together from around the world, there have been still no positive reported cases of H5N1 in dairy cows. Dr. Keith Poulsen, an associate professor in the University of Wisconsin school of veterinary medicine, and the person in charge of veterinary care for the cows at the World Dairy Expo, says that value of the expo in terms of genetics sales, and in being together as a community, along with the fact that there had not been a case in Wisconsin, meant that the show had to go on. Cattle had to be tested for H5N1 before they could arrive at the show, and they had to be quarantined when they leave, especially those returning to Canada.

(KTTC) – Dairy and poultry farmers in Mower County can get free, seasonal influenza (flu) shots on their farm, thanks to a new public health initiative to remove vaccination barriers.Driven by the increased concerns around the high severity of the H5N1 avian influenza virus, Mower County Community Health announced it will be working with Fairview’s Minnesota Immunization Networking Initiative (MINI).Farmers who have too many staff to transport or are unable to step away from their work can coordinate with the county’s community health team to bring the vaccination service to them. “Reducing barriers for people who want the vaccine is what this is all about,” said Pam Kellogg, Public Health Manager for Mower County’s Health & Human Services.Those interested should contact Darr Ehmke or Allison Scott of Mower County Health & Human Services via email at darre@co.mower.mn.us and allisons@co.mower.mn.us or call 507-437-9700.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a new influenza virus could emerge through “reassortment,” which is when viruses swap genetic material when infecting the same cell, potentially creating a new and more serious virus with characteristics from both parent viruses.Combining the easy transmission of a typical seasonal flu with H5N1’s high severity could potentially lead to a major public health crisis, which is why efforts are underway to minimize the chances of such a virus developing through co-infection and genetic mixing, Mower County says.Farm workers and farm owners, particularly those who work on poultry and dairy farms, might be exposed to H5N1– also called “avian influenza” or “highly pathogenic avian influenza” (HPAI). Routine service providers for farms, such as veterinarians, truck drivers and hoof trimmers, as well as family members who live on the farm, also might be exposed to H5N1.While the 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccine does not protect specifically against H5N1, it can provide protection against other influenza infection, illness and disease spread. People can get sick with more than one influenza virus at a time, and when that happens, the different viruses can recombine into a new, potentially more serious virus.Find stories like this and more, in our apps.Copyright 2024 KTTC.

Asthma and allergy flares – anyone who flares in the cold weather is having problems. We’re starting to test more since we’re entering into the flu season. Now’s the time to get your flu shot! The reason the flu shot is important is so we can prevent the complications associated with flu. We can deal with the cough and fever, but we’re trying to prevent children from being hospitalized and dying from the flu.”Dr. Jaime Hope -- Medical Director, Emergency Medicine, Beaumont Outpatient Campus – Livonia, a part of Corewell Health“We are seeing a lot of the usual viruses, including more individuals testing positive for both COVID and flu. And while the fall weather has been beautiful, we are seeing a lot of injuries from people doing yard work, decorating activities, and playing outside. The activity is very healthy, but it’s a great time to remind people to use caution with ladders and climbing. Also, it’s a good idea to use the buddy system for being up in a roof. Falling is bad enough… falling and waiting to be found is worse.”Dr. Erin Brennan -- DMC Sinai-Grace and DMC Detroit Receiving Emergency Department“We have a lot of people who have viral syndrome, upper respiratory things. It doesn’t seem to be COVID or flu. It’s general run-of-the-mill, season-changing things. The typical chest pain, stroke and trouble breathing are always there in the background. But this week we’re seeing a surge of the common cold and viruses.”Oakland County – Strep throat, pneumonia, flu-like illnesses, COVID, breathing problemsDr. David Donaldson -- Emergency Center Chief, Corewell Health Beaumont Troy Hospital“We are seeing lots of strep throat cases coming in. There has been a lot of peds pneumonia lately too.”Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital Emergency Department“We have seen a lot of falls with fractures this week. We are still seeing respiratory issues and a small spike in Covid-positive patients. There also were patients presenting with stroke symptoms, chest pain and a lot of complaints of pain.“Washtenaw County – Upper respiratory viruses, COVID, influenza, rhino enterovirus, stomach viruses, norovirusDr. Brad Uren -- Clinical Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, Michigan Medicine“Still seeing a lot of upper respiratory viruses. Some covid and some flu. We are not testing everyone with cold symptoms, but among those being tested, human rhino enterovirus is fairly common right now on the adult side. There’s also a notable increase in GI illness with vomiting and diarrhea. Some tests have been positive for norovirus.”Washtenaw County Health Department“Influenza cases in Washtenaw County residents are currently at low levels. Sporadic cases of influenza A and influenza B are being reported. Most influenza cases being reported in Washtenaw county are influenza B. Influenza wastewater detection is currently at low levels in both Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti.”Monroe County – Colds, influenza, stomach viruses, asthma & allergiesProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital Emergency Center“We are seeing patients coming in with complaints of weakness, cold and flu symptoms, and abdominal pain.”Macomb County – Asthma & allergies, upper respiratory infections, stomach viruses, COVIDDr. James Larkin -- Emergency Physician at McLaren Macomb“The late-season warm weather has led to a significant increase of patients experiencing complications of allergies and asthma. Also associated with the warm temperatures, injuries sustained during outdoor activities have noticeably increased. After a brief rise, the rate of patients complaining of COVID-19 symptoms and testing positive have significantly tapered off. Cases of both upper respiratory infections and gastroenteritis have tapered off after weeks of increasing volumes.”Livingston County -- Stomach viruses, norovirus, asthma & allergies, common coldCopyright 2024 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved.About the AuthorsSarah Mayberry, M.P.H. headshotSarah Mayberry, M.P.H.emailFrank McGeorge, MD headshotFrank McGeorge, MDDr. McGeorge can be seen on Local 4 News helping Metro Detroiters with health concerns when he isn't helping save lives in the emergency room at Henry Ford Hospital.emailClick here to take a moment and familiarize yourself with our Community Guidelines.Loading...Recommended VideosTV ListingsEmail NewslettersRSS FeedsContests and RulesContact UsCareers at WDIVClosed Captioning / Audio DescriptionPublic FileTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My InfoFCC ApplicationsCookie PreferencesFollow UsVisit our YouTube page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Facebook page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Instagram page (opens in a new tab)Visit our X page (opens in a new tab)Visit our RSS Feed page (opens in a new tab)Get Results With OmneIf you need help with the Public File, call (313) 222-0556.At WDIV, we are committed to informing and delighting our audience.

Every year, millions of people get infected with flu, with potentially serious complications. Getting the yearly flu vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others from flu.While seasonal flu activity is currently low across most of the country, CDC recommends that, ideally, everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October. Contact your healthcare provider, local health department, or pharmacy, or use the Flu Vaccine Finder to find a flu vaccine in your area.According to CDC, almost everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine each season. Flu vaccines are particularly important for people with HIV. People with HIV, especially those who have a very low CD4 cell count or are not on antiretroviral therapy (ART), are at a higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications and hospitalization. For this reason, people with HIV should get an annual flu shot (not the nasal spray) as the best form of protection against flu.People with HIV should also be up to date with their pneumococcal vaccination to protect against pneumococcal diseases, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections. Pneumococcal pneumonia is a serious flu complication that can cause death.If you have HIV and get sick with flu symptoms, call your doctor right away. CDC recommends prompt flu antiviral treatment for people with HIV who have flu or suspected flu.Other Respiratory Viruses: COVID-19 and RSVIn addition to flu, several other respiratory viruses spread during flu season, including COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).COVID-19 Vaccine. CDC recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older should get a 2024â2025 COVID-19 vaccine. This includes people with HIV. The COVID-19 vaccine helps protect against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. It is especially important to get a 2024â2025 COVID-19 vaccine if you are ages 65 and older, are at high risk for severe COVID-19, or have never received a COVID-19 vaccine.

While influenza viruses spread year-round, most of the time flu activity peaks between December and February. It takes about two weeks for the flu vaccine to become fully effective and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends getting the vaccine before influenza starts spreading in your community. Ideally, everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October. The flu can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Everyone age six months and older should get a flu vaccine every season with rare exceptions. Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of serious complications. Information on who is at risk is available here. Some children need two doses of flu vaccine. It is recommended they get the first dose as soon as the vaccine is available because the second dose needs to be given at least four weeks after the first. Flu vaccine is available now in many locations such as your doctor’s office, pharmacies and health departments. Find locations available in your area here. Your vaccine will help protect you throughout the 2024-2025 flu season. The Red Cross encourages individuals to protect their own health this cold and flu season by receiving a vaccination for flu, COVID 19 or RSV. It’s important to know that getting any of these vaccines does not cause a wait period for donating blood, and does not affect donation eligibility, as long as you are healthy, feeling well and symptom free at the time of donation. “It’s particularly important that when we see an increase in respiratory illnesses, that those who are in good health share their good health by giving blood,” said Dr. Baia Lasky for the American Red Cross. Those who come to donate now through October 31 will receive a $10 Amazon.com Gift Card by email as a thank you. Plus, all those who come to give in October will automatically be entered for a chance to win one of three $5,000 gift cards. For details on both offers, see RedCrossBlood.org/Treat. Find a blood drive or schedule a donation appointment by using the Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting RedCrossBlood.org or calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767).

The patients had been experiencing mild symptoms and were provided with antiviral medication.Samples from the patients have been forwarded to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for final confirmation and analysis.BFHD and DOH are working with the Washington State Department of Agriculture and the CDC on the regional response to this outbreak. DOH and BFHD have provided personal protective equipment to workers on the farm, are monitoring exposed workers for symptoms of avian influenza, and are providing testing, vaccines, and treatment for symptomatic workers. Any employees or contractors who may have worked on a poultry farm in Benton or Franklin counties since October 7 should contact BFHD at +1.509.460.4550 if they have symptoms such as red eyes or respiratory infections.Washington is the sixth state to identify a human infection of H5N1. “Washington has monitored the spread of H5N1 closely since it was first detected in poultry in the state in 2022, and our state is prepared with the knowledge, relationships, and tools to minimize its impacts on our community,” said Washington Secretary of Health Dr. Umair Shah.The DOH has worked in partnership with the Washington State Department of Agriculture and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife to respond to detections of H5N1 in animals in the state, and to monitor the health of people exposed to infected animals. The DOH has worked with these animal health partners to distribute personal protective equipment and informational materials to dairy and poultry farmers.

These findings highlight again the power of COVID-19 vaccination to safeguard health, especially for the most vulnerable, including older persons and people with underlying conditions. Published today in The Lancet Regional Health – Europe, this COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness study, conducted in 6 countries and areas (Albania, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, North Macedonia, Serbia and Kosovo 1) from January 2022 to November 2023, is the first study to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in middle-income countries and areas across the eastern part of the WHO European Region. The 6 countries and areas are part of EuroSAVE – the European Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Vaccine Effectiveness network.The study also found that despite the vaccine’s effectiveness, vaccine uptake was very low, pointing yet again to the need for governments and health authorities to ensure that those who could benefit the most from COVID-19 vaccine have access to the vaccine and are encouraged to get vaccinated.Getting vaccinated routinelyThe world is in the fifth year of living with COVID-19, and Omicron subvariants continue to drive infections, leading to hospitalizations and deaths, especially in those at higher risk, such as older adults, people with chronic medical conditions, and people who are immunocompromised or pregnant. Anyone can become infected and transmit SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to these vulnerable groups. Dr Mark Katz, a medical epidemiologist at the WHO Regional Office for Europe and the lead author of the study, explained, “We found that in the countries in the eastern part of the European Region where different kinds of COVID-19 vaccines have been used, the vaccines were very effective in preventing severe outcomes from COVID-19, such as hospitalization and death, for a period of 6 months. This message is still relevant as ever: COVID-19 continues to cause hospitalizations and deaths, overwhelmingly in high-risk people.”“In our study, fewer than 25% of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 had received a COVID-19 vaccine in the past year. Receiving an up-to-date vaccine remains the best way to prevent serious illness from COVID-19 in high-risk groups.”As the WHO European Region – encompassing 53 Member States across Europe and central Asia – approaches the winter season, with colder weather on the horizon, it is imperative that vulnerable individuals and groups receive a COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of how many doses of COVID-19 vaccines they may have had in the past. Because the vaccine’s effectiveness decreases over time, WHO recommends that high-risk people should get a new COVID-19 vaccine routinely – at least once every year – just like the flu vaccine.Vaccines safeguard health systemsHospitals have finite resources, such as beds, ventilators, and intensive care units (ICUs). Data from the study show that COVID-19 vaccinations prevented over half of hospitalizations, thereby reducing admissions to ICUs and lessening the burden on health systems and the health workforce. Widespread use of effective COVID-19 vaccines among vulnerable people can ultimately help to alleviate the strain on critical resources, allowing hospitals to focus on providing care for other emergencies, surgeries, and non-COVID-19 illnesses. Fewer COVID-19 hospitalizations also mean lower likelihood of COVID-19 exposure and transmission among health-care workers themselves, which is critical to ensure adequate staffing levels in hospitals. A resilient health system is better prepared for future pandemics or health emergencies.Low uptake even when vaccines are availableThe study found that fewer than half of hospitalized adults had ever received a COVID-19 vaccine, and fewer than a quarter had received a COVID-19 vaccine in the past 12 months. Most of these hospitalized patients were in risk groups that are prioritized for vaccination. These findings highlight the underuse of this effective tool and should serve as a call to action for governments and individuals as the winter season approaches.Dr Silvia Bino, head of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Institute of Public Health of Albania and an author of the study, pointed to the pooled data, which showed that vaccines were effective in reducing hospitalizations and severe outcomes, like ICU admission and death, in the first 6 months after vaccination. However, she cautioned, “Vaccine effectiveness did not last past 6 months – a finding demonstrated in a number of other studies of COVID-19 vaccines around the world. This study should remind people both of the continued effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine in preventing severe outcomes and the importance of staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccination regardless of how many doses of the vaccine a person has received”. “The most important determinant of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness was the time since the patient received the last dose of the vaccine,” reiterated Dinagul Otorbaeva, head of the epidemiology department at the Ministry of Health of Kyrgyzstan and an author of the study. “More than 1 in 2 hospitalizations were prevented in people who had recently received a COVID-19 vaccine. These findings again underscore the critical importance of up-to-date vaccination for high-risk people.”Advice from WHO/EuropeAlongside COVID-19, influenza is also circulating in the WHO European Region during autumn and winter. It is essential to be aware of your risk and take steps to protect yourself and those around you, which includes becoming vaccinated against influenza and COVID-19 if you are in a risk group.While influenza and COVID-19 can affect everyone, they can lead to severe illness in certain people. If you are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 and flu – an older adult, someone with a chronic condition, or someone who is immunocompromised or pregnant – you should: receive both the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines this autumn if they are available where you are;revaccinate against COVID-19 6–12 months after your last dose; andreceive a booster with each pregnancy upon consulting your health-care provider.If you are a health-care worker, and your Ministry of Health and/or other health authorities recommend the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines, you should become vaccinated. If you do not belong to at-risk groups but have never had COVID-19 or have not been vaccinated, you should get the vaccine when it is offered to you.

Getting vaccinated in the fall can lower your chances of getting the flu (influenza). Flu is a serious disease, caused by influenza viruses, that can lead to hospitalization and even death. Every flu season is different, and the substantial health impacts can vary widely from season to season, with some flu seasons being worse than others. Your best defense against influenza disease is to get a flu vaccine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration every year. To find a flu vaccine near you, visit this page. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that during the 2023-24 U.S. flu season, there were: 35 million to 65 million flu illnesses. 16 million to 30 million flu-related medical visits. 390,000 to 830,000 flu-related hospitalizations. 25,000 to 72,000 flu-related deaths. The CDC estimates that during the 2022-23 season, flu vaccination prevented: 6 million influenza-related illnesses. 2.9 million influenza-associated medical visits. 65,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations. 3,700 influenza-associated deaths. Compared with past seasons, the severity of the 2022–23 flu season was considered moderate, with high severity observed among children. A Flu Vaccine Is the Best Prevention The CDC recommends that people ages 6 months and older get a flu vaccine, ideally by the end of October. Even if you wait until after October, the vaccine will still be beneficial and provide protection. For more information on recommendations, visit this CDC page. If you have already been sick with the flu this season without getting vaccinated, getting a flu vaccine is still important because it helps prevent disease caused by three different strains of flu viruses. You likely were infected with one type of flu virus strain, so the vaccine would offer protection against the strains that you haven’t already had. Flu viruses are spread by droplets when people infected with the flu cough, sneeze or talk. Flu may also be spread when a person touches a surface or object that has flu viruses on it and then touches their own mouth, nose or eyes. You also can reduce the spread of the flu and its effects by taking practical measures such as washing your hands, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when you’re sick. Why We Need a New Flu Vaccine Every Year The FDA plays a key role in ensuring that safe and effective flu vaccines are available every flu season. Flu vaccines are approved by the FDA for the prevention of influenza disease caused by three different influenza virus strains. The vaccine typically changes each year and contains the three flu virus strains that are expected to circulate and cause illness in the U.S. during the upcoming flu season. The effectiveness of influenza vaccines varies depending on several factors, such as the age and health of the recipient, the types of circulating influenza viruses, and the degree of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in the vaccine. The flu vaccine will trigger your immune system to produce antibodies to protect against influenza disease — it will not make you sick with the flu. It can take about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body, which is an important reason to get your flu vaccine early, before flu activity starts. The task of producing a new vaccine for the next flu season starts well before the current season ends. For the FDA, it’s a year-round initiative. There are several reasons a new flu vaccine must be made each year. Flu viruses can change from year to year, so the vaccine is updated to protect against the influenza virus strains that are expected to circulate in the U.S. In addition, the protection provided by the flu vaccine a person received in the previous year will diminish over time and may be too low to prevent influenza disease into next year’s flu season. Who’s Most at Risk of Getting Sick with Flu Anyone can get sick with flu. Typically, children and people age 65 and older are most at risk of developing serious complications from influenza. In addition, pregnant people and those with certain chronic medical conditions are also most at risk of complications. The best way to protect babies who are too young to be vaccinated is to make sure the people around them are vaccinated. Occasionally, a flu virus will circulate that disproportionately affects young and middle-age adults. If you do get the flu, there are FDA-approved antiviral drugs, available by prescription, to treat it. There are several FDA-approved antiviral drugs recommended by the CDC for use against circulating influenza viruses. These drugs work best if started soon after the onset of symptoms (within 48 hours). How Vaccine Flu Virus Strains Are Selected Every year, in late February or early March, before that year’s flu season ends, the FDA, the World Health Organization, the CDC and other public health experts collaborate on collecting and reviewing data from around the world to identify the flu viruses likely to cause the most illnesses during the next flu season. Following that process, the FDA convenes its vaccines advisory committee, consisting of outside experts, to discuss the WHO recommendations and to consider which flu viruses are expected to circulate in the U.S. The committee reviews data about which flu viruses have caused illnesses in the past year, how the viruses are changing, and disease trends for the U.S. The FDA takes that information into account before it selects the virus strains for those manufacturers that have an FDA-approved influenza vaccine to include in their updated vaccine for use in the upcoming U.S. influenza season. The closer the match between the vaccine virus strains and the circulating virus strains causing disease during flu season, the better the protection that the flu vaccine provides. Although the vaccine and circulating viruses may not be an exact match in some years, that does not mean the vaccine is not benefiting people. Available data show that the vaccine can reduce the severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick. FDA-Approved Flu Vaccines Are Safe A rigorous evaluation of laboratory and clinical trial data was conducted by FDA scientists and physicians to determine the safety and effectiveness of the influenza vaccines for initial approval. If a vaccine meets the FDA’s scientific and regulatory standards, it receives an FDA approval. To ensure that updated seasonal flu vaccines are safe, effective and of high quality, the FDA prepares and provides reagents (materials to standardize vaccines) to those manufacturers that have an existing FDA-approved influenza vaccine to ensure that they can make their updated influenza vaccine and to verify its identity and potency. The FDA also inspects manufacturing facilities regularly and evaluates each manufacturer’s vaccine annually before it can be approved for use for the upcoming flu season. The FDA’s oversight doesn’t end there. After manufacturers have distributed their vaccines, the FDA and CDC work together to routinely evaluate reports of adverse events following vaccination submitted by vaccine manufacturers, health care professionals and vaccine recipients (or their parents/guardians) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Additional systems are in place to monitor the safety of vaccines. The FDA partners with private organizations that collect health care data (such as health insurance companies) and other federal agencies (such as Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Veterans Health Administration and CDC) to further evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the influenza vaccines. The Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) System is one of the programs the FDA utilizes to assess vaccine safety and effectiveness in real-world conditions, reflecting patient care and the real-world use of the influenza vaccine and other vaccines in use in the U.S. In addition, the CDC maintains the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) program, which evaluates the safety of vaccines similar to the BEST System. VSD receives its data from integrated health care organizations in the U.S.Source: FDA View the discussion thread. back to top More News Articles California Governor Gavin Newsom Announces Granting Five Pardons to Veterans and Initiated the Process for Granting a Posthumous Pardon to Sergeant Richard Allen Penry - 2024-11-11 Caltrans Announces State Route 108 (Sonora Pass) Closes Today, Monday, November 11 at 9:00 A.M.

Office preparation for fall vaccine administration: Are you ready? | Image Credit: © REDPIXEL - © REDPIXEL - stock.adobe.com.As all pediatric providers know, the administration of immunizations is a significant part of the day-to-day pediatric primary care office practices. Discussions with parents, school-age children, and teenagers occur at all routine health care visits. Some conversations are easy: parents accept the recommendations, school-age children are reluctant to “get the shots” but when involved in the conversation, they understand the meaning of preventive care, and while there may be some resistance from adolescents, they most often trust us and accept our recommendations. That’s a good day. But then, the vaccine hesitant and/or the vaccine refuser is the next parent and/or adolescent visit. The :refuser” visit takes extra time, provider patience, and well thought out ways to respond to parent and/or adolescent concerns. The provider must be prepared to talk about the differences between immunization facts versus misinformation that permeates social media sites, that confuse and frighten parents and teenagers. These conversations are challenging but worth our extra time and attention to protect of our pediatric populations from contracting vaccine preventable diseases. Available influenza and COVID-19 vaccines The October issue of Contemporary Pediatrics is the vaccine issue. “What to expect during the 2024-2025 flu season,”contains information that providers can share with parents about the available 2024-2025 influenza vaccine and the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine. Providers must remember that children 6 months through 8 years (up to their 9th birthday) should receive 2 doses of the influenza vaccine if it is the first time they are receiving the influenza vaccine.1 If an infant or child 6 months through 8 years received only 1 dose of the influenza (Flu) vaccine in the 2023-2024 season, then the infant or child needs to receive 2 doses of the influenza vaccine in the 2024-2025 season.1 In addition, any child 6 months through 8 years must receive 2 doses if the child’s vaccine history is unknown.1 Providing parents with links to information on the CDC website for parents is very helpful for parents [and teenagers] to receive easy to understand evidence-based vaccine information.2 For the COVID-19 vaccines, I always review the CDC website for all updates.3 The information is clearly written and in Table format for administering COVID-19 vaccines to children from 6 months to 4 years.3 The same site provides information for children 5 to 11 years, and ‘people’ ages 12 years and older.3 Information is also available for providers to determine when an individual should receive the 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine, if they recently had a diagnosis of COVID-19. Information is also available for the various COVID-19 vaccines that are available for the different age children.3 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine The October issues of Contemporary Pediatrics, also has an article in the Pediatric Pharmacology section on Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. I highly recommend reviewing Table 2 in this article, which provides a detailed summary of the available pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.4 Yearly responsibilities for pediatric providers for vaccine updatesFrom October 1, 2023, to August 31, 2024, 197 laboratory-confirmed influenza associated pediatric deaths were reported to the CDC via their monitoring system for deaths in children under 18 years.5 These mortality data strongly support the major responsibility of all pediatric providers to review and highly recommend to parents and adolescents the annual vaccine updates from the CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Protection of our pediatric, adolescent, and young adult populations from vaccine preventable diseases and death is a major responsibility for all pediatric providers. We must take this responsibility seriously! References: 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Flu and children. CDC. 2024.
