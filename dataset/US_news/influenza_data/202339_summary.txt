Influenza activity in the United States during the 2022-2023 season was moderately severe and characterized by activity returning to pre-COVID-19 levels but occurring earlier than usual. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses were the predominant virus subtype circulating during the season, but influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B/Victoria viruses were also reported. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza viruses to determine the composition of the annual Northern Hemisphere flu vaccines. The composition of the 2023-2024 U.S. flu vaccines was based on the data from the 2022-2023 flu season.
