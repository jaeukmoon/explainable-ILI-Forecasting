- Egg and turkey prices are expected to remain high due to the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreak.
- Approximately 43.8 million birds have been affected by the outbreak in commercial and backyard flocks across 39 states.
- Egg prices have nearly tripled since the beginning of the outbreak, and the price of turkey breast meat has increased by 60%.
- The outbreak is impacting domestic markets more than the previous HPAI outbreak in 2014-2015 due to supply chain issues like feed shortages.
- CoBank predicts that egg and turkey supplies will remain tight and prices will stay higher for longer, potentially leading to decreased consumer demand.
- Poultry and egg producers have faced high costs for feed and the culling of millions of birds.
- Egg producers have been the most affected, with 9.5% of pre-outbreak table egg-producing flocks being culled.
- Turkey production has also been impacted, with lower availability of breast meat and a 2.5% loss in the annual turkey population.
- The effects of the HPAI outbreak are expected to linger, with rebuilding efforts necessary to fill the supply gap in the coming years.
- Companies like Hormel, which owns turkey brand Jennie-O, have experienced volume declines and expect production reductions due to the disease.
