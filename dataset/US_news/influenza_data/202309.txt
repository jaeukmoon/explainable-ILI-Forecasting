CDC Update March 3, 2023—This update provides results of a preliminary assessment of the H5N1 viruses identified in two human infections detected in Cambodia in 2023 based on their genetic sequences and gives an update on the epidemiological investigation. On February 26, 2023, the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, in collaboration with the Cambodian Ministry of Health, shared the full genetic sequence of the H5N1 virus recovered from the patient who died in that country on February 22, 2023. The genetic sequence of the second case was later also shared by the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. CDC has conducted a preliminary analysis of the genetic sequences of these H5N1 bird flu viruses. They are H5N1 viruses from clade 2.3.2.1c, which are different from the H5N1 viruses now spreading in U.S. wild birds and poultry, which are from clade 2.3.4.4b. These viruses are similar to past 2.3.2.1c viruses detected in that geographic area over recent years. The genetic sequences suggest that an existing clade 2.3.2.1c candidate vaccine virus (CVV), called NIBRG-301 (A/duck/Vietnam/NCVD-1584/2012-like) would offer protection against the viruses identified in Cambodia. Additionally, there were no genetic changes identified that are known to be associated with increased ability to spread to people or reduce susceptibility to influenza antiviral drugs. CDC has requested virus samples from both cases in Cambodia in order to conduct additional laboratory testing/analysis to confirm these and other characteristics of the viruses and to provide a more detailed risk assessment. CDC continues to support the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal, Forestry and Fisheries, and Ministry of Environment, in its ongoing One Health investigation. Evidence to date continues to support the conclusion that these two human infections are the result of two instances of bird-to-human spread. There is still no indication of person-to-person spread associated with these two cases. The investigation has revealed that both patients became sick at about the same time and were likely exposed to sick or dead poultry prior to becoming ill, including being near sick/dead poultry kept in a coop under the house or through butchering, cleaning, and cooking chicken that died. Investigation and containment efforts continue, including monitoring and/or testing of contacts of the two cases for 10 days after their last exposure, along with active surveillance for influenza-like-illness in the village. CDC will provide additional updates as needed. This is an update to a spotlight originally posted on February 25, 2023. This spotlight was first posted on March 2 and subsequently updated on March 3 to provide information about the gene sequence from the virus isolated from the second patient in Cambodia and give appropriate credit for the gene sequencing work.

Their reporting states that government officials and scientists are looking at overturning a ban on vaccinating tens of millions of birds as the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak continues. Although we are exploring potential for use of vaccination as a preventive measure, we are not at the point of changing any policy and the use of avian influenza vaccines in poultry and other captive birds is unlikely be a viable option for the 2023/24 high risk season. Further evidence is needed on vaccine effectiveness. We need a better understanding of how far vaccines can prevent infection, rather than just reducing mortality, given the risk of vaccinated birds without clinical signs, spreading the virus undetected. This would increase the time taken to detect and eradicate the virus and some trading partners may not accept the use of vaccination when considering trade in poultry or poultry products. In addition, there are a number of practical, animal welfare and commercial disadvantages relating to the use of currently available vaccines which would present significant logistical and cost challenges to industry. Defra in conjunction with the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) will continue to monitor the development and availability of vaccines for their utility in preventing and responding to avian influenza outbreaks as they are put forward for market authorisation by vaccine manufacturers. Any future decisions on disease control measures, including the use of emergency or preventive vaccination, will be based upon the latest scientific, ornithological, and veterinary advice. We have established a cross government and poultry industry task force to explore potential for use of vaccination as a preventive measure. The group will meet on a regular basis. A Defra spokesperson said: “The vaccination of poultry and captive birds against avian influenza, excluding those in licensed zoos in England, is not currently permitted. We recommend strict biosecurity measures to prevent transmission of the disease. “At present, while authorised vaccines are available in the UK, they are unlikely to provide full protection for the current strains of the virus - it is likely that some vaccinated birds would still be capable of transmitting avian influenza if they became infected. “We continue to invest in avian influenza research and the development of efficacious vaccines aimed at tackling the virus”. The UK has some of the toughest biosecurity measures in the world, and we have taken swift action to protect flocks from the threat of avian influenza. All poultry and captive birds must be housed in England until further notice. Bird keepers are required to house their birds indoors and implement strict biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks from the threat of avian influenza, regardless of whatever type or size. Introducing these steps on farm is the most effective way in reducing the risk of disease spreading. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) advises there is no increased risk to the general public from bird flu and that the avian influenza viruses do not spread easily to people. You can read Defra’s policy on the use of avian influenza vaccines in poultry and other captive birds together with sector-specific guidance for zoos and other collections with a current zoo licence on how to apply for authorisation to vaccinate against avian influenza.

Burt1Jacqueline Smith11The Roslin Institute and R(D)SVS, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom2National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Bhopal, IndiaIntroduction: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, such as H5N1, continue to pose a serious threat to animal agriculture, wildlife and to public health. Controlling and mitigating this disease in domestic birds requires a better understanding of what makes some species highly susceptible (such as turkey and chicken) while others are highly resistant (such as pigeon and goose). Susceptibility to H5N1 varies both with species and strain; for example, species that are tolerant of most H5N1 strains, such as crows and ducks, have shown high mortality to emerging strains in recent years. Therefore, in this study we aimed to examine and compare the response of these six species, to low pathogenic avian influenza (H9N2) and two strains of H5N1 with differing virulence (clade 2.2 and clade 2.3.2.1) to determine how susceptible and tolerant species respond to HPAI challenge.Methods: Birds were challenged in infection trials and samples (brain, ileum and lung) were collected at three time points post infection. The transcriptomic response of birds was examined using a comparative approach, revealing several important discoveries.Results: We found that susceptible birds had high viral loads and strong neuro-inflammatory response in the brain, which may explain the neurological symptoms and high mortality rates exhibited following H5N1 infection. We discovered differential regulation of genes associated with nerve function in the lung and ileum, with stronger differential regulation in resistant species. This has intriguing implications for the transmission of the virus to the central nervous system (CNS) and may also indicate neuro-immune involvement at the mucosal surfaces. Additionally, we identified delayed timing of the immune response in ducks and crows following infection with the more deadly H5N1 strain, which may account for the higher mortality in these species caused by this strain. Lastly, we identified candidate genes with potential roles in susceptibilityesistance which provide excellent targets for future research.Discussion: This study has helped elucidate the responses underlying susceptibility to H5N1 influenza in avian species, which will be critical in developing sustainable strategies for future control of HPAI in domestic poultry.1 IntroductionAvian influenza, caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) such as H5N1, is responsible for enormous economic losses in the poultry industry, causes devastating effects of wildlife and poses a serious pandemic threat to public health. To date, H5N1 has affected the poultry industry in 68 countries, with over 15,000 outbreaks reported, and has become endemic in six countries (Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia and Vietnam; Alexander and Brown, 2009; Bui et al., 2016). Avian influenza has a particularly devastating impact in developing countries, where outbreaks have a huge social and economic impact on small and marginal poultry farmers (Rushton et al., 2005; Brown, 2010; Alders et al., 2014). In addition it has devastating impacts on wild bird populations and poses a serious conservation threat (Daszak et al., 2000), highlighted by recent widespread outbreaks in wild bird populations (at least 57 species) in Europe (EFSA (European Food Safety Authority), 2022)Due to the close proximity of domestic species, wild birds and humans in backyard farms and bird markets in countries such as India and China, the risk of novel zoonoses is high and the fear of the emergence of a devastating pandemic flu ever-present. Since the emergence of H5N1 in 1997, there has been an increasing number of bird-to-human transmission events (WHO (World Health Organisation), 2021a). Over 800 cases of H5N1 infections in humans have been confirmed across 17 countries as of 2021, with a mortality rate of over 50% in those infected (WHO (World Health Organisation), 2021a). Previous influenza pandemics are estimated to have collectively killed 25 to over 100 million people (WHO (World Health Organisation), 2013; Spreeuwenberg et al., 2018). It is essential that the spread of H5N1 be controlled, particularly in domestic birds, where the risk of transmission to humans is the highest. The recent COVID19 pandemic has highlighted the devastating economic and human impact such zoonotic diseases pose (WHO (World Health Organisation), 2021b). Control of this disease in domestic birds is therefore critical for food biosecurity, animal welfare and public health.H5N1 is known to infect a variety of both domestic and wild avian species; however, the response to infection varies widely. Chickens typically exhibit high mortality in outbreaks of H5N1, with case fatality rates as high as 100% (Kayali et al., 2011). Ducks and other waterfowl are generally asymptomatic and can act as reservoirs of H5N1 (Walsh et al., 2017). Additionally, wild species such as pigeons and crows also appear to be generally resistant to the effects of H5N1 (Yamamoto et al., 2012). Strikingly in a 2011 outbreak in India, high mortality from H5N1 was observed in the normally H5N1-resistant crows and ducks (Khan et al., 2014). The mechanisms that promote high pathogenicity of these recent clades of HPAI are not understood. Though the pathogenesis of HPAI in chickens and ducks is known to some extent, little is understood about mechanisms of resistance in other birds, which can act as reservoirs of infection to poultry. Resistant species may have mechanisms able to prevent viral replication and spread, check disease progression or mitigate immunopathology.Despite measures to control the disease, HPAI continues to be detected globally in wild birds, even in the absence of local poultry outbreaks (Walsh et al., 2017). At present HPAI outbreaks among poultry are usually controlled by draconian measures, with the culling of all susceptible commercial flocks in affected areas and areas at risk (Alexander and Brown, 2009). Vaccination has not had widespread success in controlling the disease, partly due to the rapid evolution of influenza viruses and insufficient cross-protection between different variants (Kayali et al., 2013; Spackman and Swayne, 2013; Kim, 2018). As HPAI can be spread by free-flying species (Walsh et al., 2017) which cannot be contained, new approaches to HPAI control are needed.The overall aim of this study was to understand the genetic differences in the host that set the balance of disease resistance versus susceptibility for individual avian host-pathogen combinations. In order to examine the differences in the molecular signatures of hosts differing in their susceptibility to avian influenza we took a comparative transcriptomic approach. Six avian species - chickensurkeys (highly susceptible with high mortality), geese/pigeons (tolerant carriers with only sporadic mortality) and ducks/crows (resistant to most AIV infections but having differential responses to virus of different H5 clades) were infected with two H5N1 strains from different clades, as well as low pathogenic (LPAI) H9N2 virus. The knowledge gained from these comparisons can be used to develop sustainable strategies to control HPAI infections in domestic poultry.2 Materials and methods2.1 Virus strainsThe three wild-type virus strains used for infections were H9N2 (A/duck/India/249800/2010) hereafter referred to as H9, H5N1 clade 2.2 (A/duck/Tripura/103597/2008) hereafter referred to as 2.2 and H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1 (A/duck/India/02CA10/2011) hereafter referred to as 2.3. All viruses were grown on 11-day-old embryonated duck eggs of white Pekin ducks at ICAR-NIHSAD (Bhopal, India). The experimental birds were infected intra-nasally with 106 EID50 of the virus in 100µl of allantoic fluid, with volume adjusted with PBS.2.2 AnimalsAll animal experiments were approved by the ICAR institute animal ethics committee (IAEC) approval (73/IAEC/HSADL/13). Six species were examined in three groups. Group 1 - Chicken (White leghorn, Gallus gallus domesticus) and turkey (Beltsville, Meleagris gallopavo), Group 2 - mallard duck (Pekin duck, Anas platyrhnchos domesticus) and jungle crow (Corvus macrorhynchos) and Group 3 - greylag goose (Embden goose, Anser anser domesticus) and rock dove (pigeon, Columba livia). Chickens and turkeys were procured from the Central Poultry Development Organization, Mumbai, India as day old chicks and reared for 3 weeks in a well-drained concrete floored animal house at the receiving shed and for the next 3-5 weeks in a holding shed at NIHSAD, Bhopal. The ducks were procured from the Nature and Culture Society, Malur, India, as day old ducklings and reared in wire mesh floored, positive pressure isolators up to 6-8 weeks. Geese (11-13 months old), crows (age not known) and pigeons (age not known) were procured from the local live bird market in Bhopal, India and housed for 3 weeks in a receiving shed to meet institutional quarantine requirements. Sexing was done by PCR and only females were included in the study. Haemagglutination inhibition tests were used to screen the birds to confirm that they were free from AIV antibodies, using the viruses H9N2 (A/duck/India/249800/2010), H5N1 (A/duck/Tripura/103597/2008) and H5N1 (A/duck/India/02CA10/2011).2.3 Preliminary trialsA preliminary infection course trial was carried out in crows, pigeons and geese to ensure that the AIV of duck origin were able to infect these species. The purpose here was also to observe the course of disease in these species to determine the appropriate time point for sampling of infected birds for transcriptome analysis. For each species, 3 groups of 6 birds were experimentally challenged intra-nasally with each of the three viruses at a dose of 106 EID50 virus in 100 μl allantoic fluid diluted in PBS. The birds were observed for clinical signs and oral as well as cloacal swabs were collected at 24-48 hr intervals up to 10 days.2.4 Infection trialsFor the challenge experiments, 5 birds were infected for each treatment group, to ensure sufficient sample numbers for RNA-seq, the birds of each species were grouped into 3 groups (A, B and C) of 15 birds each and a fourth control group (D) of 5 birds. The birds from Group A were intra-nasally infected with 106 EID50 of 2.3. The birds from Group B were intra-nasally infected with 106 EID50 of 2.2. The birds from Group C were intra-nasally infected with 106 EID50 of H9. Group D was inoculated with PBS intra-nasally. The control birds were euthanised 48 hours after inoculation. In each group A-C, 5 birds were euthanised by cervical dislocation at each time point as outlined per species and infection in Table 1. No early deaths of experimental animals occurred. Times of tissue collection post infection differ between some groups for practical reasons, for example chickens and turkeys do not generally survive an HPAI infection beyond 3 days (Table 1). All challenge experiments were carried out in a BSL3 facility and post-mortem collection of tissue was done in a BSL3 laboratory at ICAR-NIHSAD (India).TABLE 1 Table 1 Time points for sampling.2.5 Tissue collection and RNA preparationTissues collected for RNA-seq included lung (3-5 mm cross-sections of the central to lower part of lung), ileum (1.5 cm long mid-part of ileum sectioned into three parts of mm each) and brain (3-5 mm transverse sections from the middle of the either cerebral lobe) which were stored in Trizol at -20°C until required. RNA extractions were performed using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). RNA quality and quantity were checked using NanoDrop (Thermofisher) and Bioanalyser (Agilent), and the three highest quality samples were selected for sequencing. Due to quality and/or quantity issues with some of the samples, 3 samples could not be obtained for sequencing for all conditions. For reasons unknown all turkey lung samples were of insufficient quality for sequencing and so were not included in any further analysis. In addition, as disparity in sample quality can affect results, samples were required to range no more than 2.5 RIN within each species × tissue group. A table showing the number of samples successfully sequenced and included in downstream analysis in each group is shown in Supplementary File 1. In total, 497 samples were used in the analysis.2.6 RNA-sequencing and processingFor sequencing, mRNA libraries were prepared and sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq2500 platform. 36 cycles of pair-end sequencing was run generating 50 - 230 million reads per sample. Reads were quality checked using FastQC (version 0.11.2) and trimmed for quality using cutadapt (Martin, 2011). Reads were mapped to transcript sequence files from the relevant genome using Kallisto (Bray et al., 2016). As the genomes for the greylag goose and jungle crow were not available, the genomes of the closely related swan goose (Anser cygnoides) and American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) were used. Transcript files were obtained from NCBI as follows: Chicken (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Gallus_gallus/RNAna.fa.gz), turkey (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Meleagris_gallopavo/RNAna.fa.gz), duck (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/971/095/GCF_000971095.1_AnsCyg_PRJNA183603_v1.0/), crow (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Corvus_brachyrhynchos/RNAna.fa.gz), goose (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/971/095/GCF_000971095.1_AnsCyg_PRJNA183603_v1.0/) and pigeon (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Columba_livia/RNAna.fa.gz). To allow for comparison of genes between species, the transcript level abundance data were converted to gene level data with tximport in R (Soneson et al., 2015). Differential expression analysis was performed in EdgeR using a glm model (Robinson et al., 2010). The cut-offs for significance were FDR < 0.05 and logFC > 1.5. For most cross-species analyses, a set of 11,384 genes with conserved 1-1 orthology between all six species was used. This list was generated through reciprocal BLAST searches of the genes of each species against all chicken genes, and then cross-referencing each list to produce a single list of genes conserved across all six species.2.7 Data analysisHeatmaps were constructed in R using the pheatmap package (v. 1.0.10; https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pheatmap). Over-representation of gene ontology (GO) terms was investigated using the PANTHER Over-representation Test using Fisher’s Exact with FDR multiple test correction (Thomas et al., 2003). Network analysis for both sample-sample networks and gene-gene networks was performed in BioLayout 3D (Theocharidis et al., 2009) which performs a Pearson correlation matrix calculated for each pair of samples or genes, using a modified Fruchterman-Rheingold algorithm. Clustering was performed on these networks using the Markov clustering algorithm (MCL) with an inflation value of 1.8. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA®) program (QIAGEN; Krämer et al., 2014) was used to identify cellular canonical pathways and physiological functions (p-value ≤ 0.05 and q-value ≤ 0.05). Statistical tests on RNA-seq viral counts were implemented in R 4.0.5. ANOVAs with Type III Sum of Squares were performed and Tukey Honest Significant Differences (HSD) test was used for performing multiple pairwise-comparison between the means of groups. The Tukey HSD produces p-values adjusted for the multiple comparisons.2.8 Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactionFor RT-qPCR for viral genes, cDNA production and RT-qPCR were performed using the SensiFAST SYBR Lo ROX One Step kit (Bioline) as previously described (Gaunt et al., 2016). Primers targeted avian influenza A virus segment 2 (Fw 5’-CAAATACCAGCAGAAATGCTTGC; Rev 5’ TTGAACATGCCCATCATCATTCC) or avian GAPDH (Fw 5’ – TGGCCAAGGTCATCCATGACAA; Rev 5’ GATGGCATGGACAGTGGTCATAA). Reaction contained 0.8ul of 10uM of each primer. RNA samples were diluted 1 in 10 in nuclease free water and made a tenth of the total reaction volume. Amplification was performed on the Rotorgene (QIAGEN) with the following cycle conditions: 45C for 10 min, 95°C for 2 min, then 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 sec and 60°C for 30 sec, with a final melt step of 50-99°C with a 1 degree increment. Relative segment 2 expression levels were calculated using the ΔΔCt method.For qPCR on chicken innate genes, a highly multiplexed qPCR 96.96 Fluidigm Dynamic Array system was used as described previously (Borowska et al., 2019). In brief, the Reverse transcription was performed using the High-Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer’s instructions with random hexamers and oligo (dT)18 in a final volume of 10 μl, containing 500 ng total RNA. Pre-amplification of cDNA was performed using TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR was performed in the BioMark HD instrument and the 96.96 Dynamic Array (Fluidigm). Assay mixes were prepared by mixing 2.5 μl 2X Assay Loading Reagent (Fluidigm), 2.3 μl of primer pair mix (final concentration 1.15 μM) and 0.2 μl low EDTA TE buffer. Sample mixes were prepared by mixing 2.5 μl TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.25 μl 20X DNA Binding Dye Sample Loading Reagent (Fluidigm), 0.25 μl 20X EvaGreen DNA binding dye (Biotum) and 2 μl of preamplified cDNA. Thermal cycling conditions for qPCR were: thermal mix 50°C for 2 min, 70°C for 30 min, 25°C for 10 min, followed by hot start 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min, PCR (x30 cycles) 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 60 sec and melting curve analysis 60°C for 3 sec to 95°C. Real-Time PCR Analysis software 3.1.3 (Fluidigm) was used to visualise results. Analysis settings were as follows: quality threshold was set to 0.65, baseline correction to linear (derivative) and quantitation cycle (Cq) threshold method to auto (global). PCR data pre-processing, normalisation, relative quantification and statistics were performed in GenEx version 6 (MultiD Analyses AB). Data were validated and genes with >50% of missing values were removed. Data were corrected for reaction efficiency and normalised using two most stably expressed reference genes selected by NormFinder - TBP and GUSB. The dataset technical duplicates were averaged and further normalisation to control sample for each tissue was performed. Relative quantities were transformed to logarithmic scale (log2) before further analysis. Software tool for versatile matrix visualization and analysis, Morpheus by Broad Institute (RRID : SCR_017386), was used to create the gene expression heat map. All primers used for qPCR are found in Supplementary File 2.3 Results3.1 TrialsPreliminary trials were conducted to examine clinical symptoms, mortality and viral isolation in the crow, pigeon and goose over a 10 day testing period (Supplementary File 3). Crows and pigeons showed clinical symptoms such as ocular swelling, reduced appetite and dullness to both 2.2 and 2.3 infection after 2-5 days post infection (dpi). Goose showed no symptoms following either challenge. The only death recorded was one crow at 7 dpi after 2.3 challenge. For the goose, all tissues were positive for both 2.2 and 2.3 virus by 2 dpi. For the crow, all samples in the 2.2 challenge were positive by 2 dpi but only lung was positive for 2.3 by 2 dpi. For pigeon, all tissues were negative for virus at 2 dpi for both 2.2 and 2.3 but all samples were positive by 10 dpi. In the full animal trials, chickens and turkeys infected with both strains of H5N1 showed dullness after 24h, were off feed, and showed swollen eyes and wattles at approximately 48h. No deaths occurred during the trial period of 2-5 days.3.2 Viral loadsThe viral RNA load in each sample was determined by two methods: normalised counts of influenza viral genes from RNA-seq data (pooled) and RT-qPCR of viral genes in order to verify the RNA-seq results (Figure 1). In general, the two methods agreed, although the RNA-seq was more sensitive detecting viral RNA in more samples. On the other hand the RT-qPCR was able to detect viral genes in a few samples that were too degraded for successful RNA-seq, including the turkey lung samples. It is likely that the RNA-seq approach is more sensitive in higher quality samples due to high throughput, while the RT-qPCR technique was better at detecting gene expression in degraded samples as only short amplicons are amplified (145bp). As the two methods were in close agreement in samples with moderate to high levels of viral expression, both can be considered reliable, while at lower levels of expression the possibility of false negatives due to low levels of viral gene expression or sample degradation should be considered.FIGURE 1 Figure 1 Expression of viral genes after challenge with standard error bars. Expression determined by two methods, RT-qPCR of viral genes and viral counts from RNA-seq data. Only RT-qPCR data is available for turkey lung samples. For treatment group sample sizes see Supplementary File 1.After H9 challenge all chicken, turkey and duck samples were positive for viral transcripts, although expression was low. Expression of viral RNA was detected in the brain of all three of these species providing evidence of systemic spread to the central nervous system even with LPAI. In crow, goose and pigeon most samples were negative for H9 with only a few samples, mostly lung samples, showing low counts in each species.For both 2.2 and 2.3 challenges, chicken and turkey had the highest viral loads (Figure 1). This was statistically significant for all time points when compared to crow, goose and pigeon and most time points to duck (Supplementary File 4). They showed high loads in all three tissues which increased with dpi. For duck, viral loads were also high for both challenges in all tissues, but were significantly lower than turkey and chicken in the 2.2 challenge at 48h (Supplementary File 4). Crow had significantly lower viral loads than duck at the majority of time points, with counts being highest in lung for 2.2 and for both lung and ileum in 2.3. Goose showed very low viral load for both infections, with only viral RNA detected in the lung after 2.2 challenge, but in all three tissues after 2.3. Lastly, no viral RNA was detected in the pigeon tissues after challenge with 2.2, but was detected in lung after 2.3 infection.3.3 Overviews of host responsesTo provide an overview of the similarity in response between all host samples a clustered sample-sample network graph was constructed (Figure 2), which groups samples based on similarity of gene expression. As expected, the samples clustered primarily on tissue type, with lung, ileum and brain samples clustering separately. Within each tissue, samples clustered broadly by species, although chicken and turkey samples were generally interspersed. Lung was the only tissue that did not form a single cluster – chicken lung samples clustered separately indicating a possible distinctiveness in lung gene expression and/or response to infection in this tissue. Based on the close clustering of chicken and turkey brain and ileum samples we can speculate that turkey lung samples would likely group with the chicken cluster, if present. Within each tissue cluster, the samples that formed the fewest edges with the remaining samples, which were those that were the most outlying in each cluster, were those samples from the later time points in susceptible species challenged with 2.2 and 2.3 HPAI. For example, two duck samples that lay furthest from the lung sample cluster were 2.3 infected samples from 48h and 5d. Those showing the greatest divergence from ileum and brain clusters were the 2.2 and 2.3 infected chicken and turkey samples from the 48h time-point. This may be the result of extreme or dysfunctional immune response, aberrant gene expression and/or cell death in the latter stage of disease progression.FIGURE 2 Figure 2 Sample-sample network graph of each individual sample normalised counts. Clustering based on Pearson correlations of gene expression in each sample. Colours are based on species with and time points are pooled.The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each group relative to PBS controls, is shown in Table 2 (Full list in Supplementary File 5) and GO terms associated with the DEGs in Supplementary File 6. DEGs were identified for most groups. In most cases, the number of DEGs correlated with viral RNA load, with chicken, turkey and duck having the highest number of DEGs while crow, goose and pigeon showed lower numbers of DEGs. Expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISG) from RNA-seq data was also measured (Figure 3; Supplementary File 7) and likewise ISG expression significantly correlated with viral load (p < 0.01). For H9 LPAI challenge, despite all birds surviving this challenge with no clinical signs, many DEGs were identified. The number of DEGs was higher after 2.2 and 2.3 HPAI than LPAI challenge in all species. Pigeon showed the lowest number of DEGs in most tissues and time-points. However, pigeon and goose showed differential expression in all tissues, demonstrating a response to infection despite the low viral loads. The highest number of DEGs was seen in the chicken and turkey in response to 2.2 and 2.3 challenge, particularly at the later time points. The tissues showing the highest number of DEGs varied by species and strain, though were highest in either the lung or ileum in most cases.TABLE 2 Table 2 Number of DEGs in each treatment group (LogFC >1.5, FDR < 0.05).FIGURE 3 Figure 3 Average RNAseq read count expression of ISGs in each treatment group with Standard Error bars. Time 1, 2, 3 = 12h, 24h and 48h in chicken and turkey to 2.2 and 2.3 infection. Time 1, 2, 3 = 12h, 48h and 5d in the remaining treatment groups. For treatment group sample sizes see Supplementary File 1.3.4 Species-specific responsesA profile of the response in each species was determined by analysis of DEGs (Supplementary File 5), GO terms associated with DEGs (Supplementary File 6) and expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISG) from RNA-seq data (Figure 3; Supplementary File 7). Additionally, qPCR was used to further examine and confirm innate immune gene expression in chicken (Supplementary File 8: Figure S1). The primary focus of this work was to examine the responses to different HPAI strains, so presented results will mainly compare the effects of 2.2 and 2.3 challenge.3.4.1 ChickenFollowing HPAI 2.2 challenge, upregulation of immune pathways was not seen at 12h in any tissue (Supplementary File 6). In the lung and ileum at 12 and 24h, upregulated genes were primarily associated with hormone response, cell development and proliferation, and neuronal function pathways. At 24h only a limited immune response was seen in lung or brain, but there was significant upregulation of some ISGs and innate immune genes in the ileum such as CATHB1, IL22 and IFIT5. This was confirmed by qPCR which showed clear upregulation of innate immune genes by 24h in ileum but not lung or brain. There was a very strong immune response in all three tissues by 48h, demonstrated by both RNA-seq and qPCR data. This involved a large upregulation of interferons (IFNs; up to 9-fold in the brain), ISGs, genes associated with both innate and adaptive immune response, apoptosis and viral defence pathways. HPAI 2.3 challenge induced a very similar response to that following 2.2, with a strong immune response at 48h in all tissues and with the same cytokines and pathways being upregulated. However, the immune activation occurred earlier than in response to 2.2 with ISGs upregulated in all three tissues by 24h, with particularly strong up-regulation in the ileum. This earlier immune response was seen both in RNA-seq and confirmed in the qPCR data.3.4.2 TurkeyFollowing HPAI 2.2 challenge an immune response was seen in the brain and ileum as early as 12h with strong up-regulation of several ISGs including RSAD2 and IRF7 (brain) and MX1 (ileum). The immune response increased over time, with the highest up-regulation of immune pathways at 48h. In the ileum, pathways associated with metabolism and ion transport were differentially regulated across the course of infection. Following 2.3 challenge, as for chicken, the turkey response to 2.3 was very similar to that against 2.2, except that the immune response occurred earlier, with stronger up-regulation of ISGs at 24h in both brain and ileum in response to 2.3.3.4.3 DuckHPAI 2.2 challenge induced an immune response in all tissues and included strong up-regulation of ISGs, defensins and cathelicidins. No immune pathways were significantly up-regulated at 12h though a small number of immune genes were, and immune response peaked in all tissues with the strongest up-regulation of gene expression at 48h. Many ISGs were still significantly up-regulated by 5d in all tissues (Figure 3; Supplementary File 5). This strong increase in expression of inflammatory genes across tissues including the brain was surprising, considering ducks show minimal clinical signs after challenge with 2.2. The host response to HPAI 2.3 challenge shared many of the same features as infection with 2.2, although the timing of immune response differed. Up-regulation of immune genes was not seen at 12h in the lung after 2.3 challenge as was seen with 2.2 challenge. However, as with 2.2, the ISG response generally peaked at 48h after challenge, but it was more sustained in the ileum, with ISGs still strongly up-regulated at 5d. There therefore may be a delayed immune response in the duck lung after challenge with clade 2.3.3.4.4 CrowFollowing HPAI 2.2 challenge an immune response was already present in the ileum by 12h, mostly featuring many chemokines (XLC1, CCL5, CXCL14) and genes associated with T-cell or NK function (CD3E/D, TNFSF8, EOMES). The strongest ISG response in both the lung and ileum was at 48h. In the brain there was a modest up-regulation of ISGs, which disappeared by 5d. Following 2.3 challenge, ISGs were up-regulated in the lung at 48h, but not as strongly as with 2.2, and they remained up-regulated at 5d. In the ileum, immune response was first apparent at 48h and showed expression of a similar suite of genes as were activated by 2.2 at 12h. Very few genes were differentially regulated in the crow brain after 2.3 challenge. This included a few ISGs at 48h and 5d, but these were not as strongly expressed as when under challenge by the 2.2 virus. As with the duck, the crow response to 2.3 appears to be weaker and delayed, particularly in the lung and brain, compared to that of 2.2. This may help explain the poorer outcome following infection.3.4.5 GooseFollowing HPAI 2.2 challenge there was little upregulation of immune genes seen in the lung, however at 12h and 48h there was a strong up-regulation of genes associated with nerve function (Supplementary File 5). In ileum most differentially expressed genes were related to ion transport and nerve function at 12h and 48h and to metabolic functions at 5d. In the brain there was little response until 5d when there was increased expression of a range of ISGs and genes associated with adaptive immunity. The immune response after challenge with 2.3 was stronger, with robust up-regulation of a range of ISGs at 48h in the brain and lung, with immune gene up-regulation maintained at 5d in the brain.3.4.6 PigeonFollowing HPAI 2.2 challenge, the strongest response was in the lung. There was up-regulation of genes associated with nerve function at 12h and 5d. In both lung and ileum there was down-regulation of some immune pathways at 5d (Supplementary File 6), including those of innate immunity and viral response. In the brain there was little response, however there were a few immune genes up-regulated including AVD and CCL5. The response to 2.3 was similar to that found for 2.2, with few DEGs and both up- and down-regulation of immune genes. Few genes were differentially regulated in lung, but one that was consistently strongly down-regulated was OLFM4, an anti-apoptotic gene. In the brain there were several complement-associated genes up-regulated at 12h and 48h. Notably, the baseline ISG expression in control pigeon samples appears substantially higher than that of other birds, in both lung and ileum.3.5 Cross-species comparisonTo compare the response to H5N1 infection across the six species we firstly constructed Venn diagrams to identify genes uniquely or commonly differentially regulated in each of the six bird species (Figure 4; Supplementary File 8; Figures S2, S3). Across the treatment groups the majority of differentially expressed genes were uniquely differentially expressed in only one species. There were also many common DEGs between two or more of the four most susceptible bird species (chicken, turkey, duck and crow), and these were most frequently immune genes and ISGs, likely a response to the higher viral loads seen in these species. There were few common DEGs shared between goose, pigeon and the remaining four species, although goose DEGs were more commonly shared with duck than the remaining species, likely due to their close evolutionary relationship.FIGURE 4 Figure 4 Venn diagram of genes differentially expressed in lungs in each species. (A) 12h 2.2, (B) 12h, 2.3, (C) 48h 2.2, (D) 48h 2.3.We further examined DEGs from groupings of interest, including those with a possible role in resistance/susceptibility. Of particular interest were any DEGs in all species, DEGs from only the resistant species, and DEGs unique to pigeon and goose (the most resistant species). These genes are shown in Table 3. The majority of these genes were associated with two main functions and are thus highlighted in the table - immune genes (blue) and those associated with the nervous system (orange). Most genes in these groups were immune genes, largely ISGs and anti-viral genes, and these were often common to all species, or all those excluding pigeon. Other genes of particular interest that were differentially expressed in multiple species included OLFM4, an anti-apoptotic gene which is also involved in innate immune response regulation (Zhang et al., 2004) that was often differentially expressed exclusively in the more resistant species. GUCA2B is a gene with a role in water and salt transport in intestine and was expressed more highly in resistant species. BPI, an antimicrobial gene with a known role in innate immunity and which can inhibit the infectivity of influenza (Pinkenburg et al., 2016), was also found to be differentially expressed only in pigeon and goose.TABLE 3 Table 3 Common DEGs in key comparisons.A group of genes associated with nerve cells and their function were often commonly differentially regulated in multiple species, but particularly in goose and pigeon. Surprisingly this set of genes was not differentially regulated in brain (except for PLP1, down-regulated in duck at 5d), instead showed strong differential regulation in both lung and ileum. This group of genes encode proteins including GRIN1, which plays a key role in the plasticity of synapses, PLP1 which is the predominant component of myelin and SNAP25 which is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. To look at this group further a heat map of these identified nerve-associated genes at 12h (Figure 5) and 48h was constructed (Supplementary File 8; Figure S4). A very similar expression pattern was seen at both time points. In the lungs, these nerve-associated genes are frequently up-regulated following infection. After challenge with 2.2, the up-regulation of these genes was much higher in the resistant species, with some genes expressed up to 9-fold higher, some of the most highly up-regulated genes following infection (Supplementary File 5). After 2.3 challenge, these showed the highest up-regulation in crow and duck. In the ileum these genes were conversely down-regulated following infection, and again the effect was stronger in the resistant birds, with genes showing up to 10-fold down-regulation. In the ileum, the highly resistant goose and pigeon showed the strongest down-regulation of these nervous system genes, in both 2.2 and 2.3 infections. These data show a complex interaction between tissue, species and strain of virus, but with the strongest differential regulation in the more resistant species.FIGURE 5 Figure 5 Heat map diagram of differential expression of selected nervous function genes at 12h in (A). Lung and (B). Ileum. Legend is logFC relative to control samples.To further examine patterns of gene pathway and network regulation we examined the data from all species in a pathway analysis using IPA software. We compared the regulation of pathways in each tissue (Figure 6; Supplementary File 8; Figure S5), focussing on the 48h time point as this showed the strongest pathway enrichment. In the lung at 48h we can see that strongest enrichment of pathways during 2.2 infection was in chicken, duck and crow, consistent with the greater number of DEGs seen in these species. These were largely immune-related pathways such as pattern recognition, interferon signalling, complement system and RIG-I receptor signalling pathways. Crow did not show the same strong enrichment of immune pathways at 48h after 2.3 infection, consistent with their weaker but more extended up-regulation of immune genes, as discussed earlier.FIGURE 6 Figure 6 Pathway analysis comparison in (A) Lung, (B) Ileum and (C) Brain.In the ileum a similar pattern was seen as in lung, with strongest enrichment of pathways in the chicken, turkey, duck and crow with mostly the same immune-related pathways being affected. Down-regulation of calcium signalling and CREB signalling in neuronal pathways were related to the down-regulation of nerve-associated genes.In the brain the strongest enrichment of pathways was in the chicken and turkey in response to 2.2 challenge, and additionally duck to 2.3 challenge. This included a host of immune and inflammatory pathways, including apoptosis signaling, pattern recognition, interferon signaling and death receptor signaling. This strong inflammatory response is likely a reaction to the high viral load in the brain of these species, but may also be contributing or causing the neurological damage seen in these species. The duck in particular showed a much stronger enrichment of inflammatory pathways in response to 2.3 compared to 2.2, which may underlie the differing susceptibility of ducks to these two infections. Lastly, the goose also showed some up-regulation of these inflammatory pathways in the brain, despite the resistance of this species and the relatively low viral load seen in the brain. This indicates that the 2.3 virus may have a greater impact than 2.2 on the brain and nervous system of birds, even when hosts are relatively resistant and show no symptoms.3.6 Comparison of 2.2 vs 2.3 challenge in duck and crowDue to the difference in outcomes after 2.2 and 2.3 infections in both duck and crow (Khan et al., 2014; Supplementary File 3), we compared the host responses in more detail using a pathway approach. A pathway comparison (Figures 7A, B; Supplementary File 8; Figure S6, S7) showed the clearest distinction between 2.2 and 2.3 response in the lung. At 48h, immune pathways were strongly enriched after challenge by both strains in duck but only against 2.2 in crow. As discussed previously, the response to 2.3 was lower and delayed in crow. At 12h in these species however, it was neuronal-related pathways that were strongly enriched. Intriguingly, this was seen in response to 2.2 but not 2.3 in both species. To understand this further we looked at the upstream regulators predicted to control these pathways (Figure 7C). Two regulators stood out as showing a strong difference between the 2.2 and 2.3 infections. Firstly, the regulatory gene BDNF was enriched in both species in response to each strain. This gene supports survival of neurons and encourages growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses (Duman, 1999). A second gene regulator, REST, was suppressed specifically in response to 2.2 but not 2.3 virus. REST is a transcriptional repressor that suppresses neuronal gene expression in non-neuronal tissues (Chong et al., 1995). Suppression of this regulator can therefore be predicted to increase expression of neuronal genes in tissues such as the lung. The interaction of these regulators may be responsible for the differential regulation of neuronal pathway genes following HPAI infection, and furthermore may contribute to the differing outcome of duck and crow to 2.2 and 2.3 infection.FIGURE 7 Figure 7 Pathway analysis of crow and duck lung at (A) 12h and (B) 48h and upstream regulators at 12h (C).3.7 Host response genes shared between birds and humansTo further examine similarities in response between the six species we analysed the data using a meta-analysis by information content (MAIC) approach (Li et al., 2020). This analyses the shared information content across species and produces a ranked list of genes summarising the combined evidence from species of each gene being involved in HPAI response (Supplementary File 8, Figure S8). This demonstrated that the top genes shared across these species were largely ISG genes, consistent with other analyses which found strong ISG responses in these species. We also extended this analysis by including data from human influenza studies, including data from CRISPR/CAS9 screen, annotated pathways, genetic perturbation screens and protein–protein interactions (See Li et al., 2020 for full list of data sources included; Supplementary File 8, Figure S8). This study found strong shared information content between the data from this current study and that of many human studies. The top ranked genes were primarily ribosomal genes and others (including MCM7 and FASN) that have been reported to act as important host factors aiding virus genome replication in host cells (Kawaguchi and Nagata, 2007; Du et al., 2020).3.8 Candidate gene identificationLastly, it was a goal of this study to identify candidates which can be used in future investigation using in vitro systems and animal modification experiments to elucidate their role in HPAI susceptibility. From this study we have identified a list of genes that may have a role in resistance (Table 4). These were identified either due to a differential response in resistant and susceptible birds, a differential response to 2.2 vs 2.3 in ducks and crows, or a unique response in pigeon, being the species exhibiting the highest resistance. We have included several of the most strongly differentially expressed nerve-associated genes and regulators, including GRIN1, SNAP25, SLC17A6 and REST. OLFM4 is another key candidate discussed previously; this gene has anti-apoptotic function, is a stem cell marker associated with cell proliferation, and is involved in the regulation of host innate immunity (Zhang et al., 2004). Furthermore high expression of this gene is associated with poor prognosis in several diseases in humans (Liu and Rodgers, 2022). OLFM4 showed strong downregulation in resistant species in the face of challenge with both 2.2 and 2.3 viruses. We identified several antimicrobial peptides, both defensins (AvDB2, AvBD10) and cathelicidins (CATH2) that showed different responses in duck and crow to 2.2 vs 2.3 infection. We also identified a range of genes, including PERP1 a pro-apoptotic cytokine and A4GNT which is involved in mucin synthesis, which were exclusively differentially regulated in the highly resistant pigeon or goose. These could be interesting targets for further research.TABLE 4 Table 4 Candidate genes with possible roles in resistance/susceptibility.4 DiscussionUnderstanding the underlying molecular and cellular response to avian influenza infection in resistant and susceptible avian species is crucial for mitigating the impact of this economically devastating disease. In this study we have analysed the gene expression profiles of six avian species with varying susceptibility to two strains of HPAI and identified key patterns, similarities and differences in the responses of these host species.The first major difference between the species tested in this study was the disease progression and viral loads. Our pilot data confirmed the high tolerance of the geese and pigeons to HPAI infection, showing no symptoms or mortality in the test period. We also demonstrated that while all six species showed evidence of viral replication, the viral loads were much higher in susceptible species, with high viral loads in the lung, ileum and brain as early as 12 hours in susceptible species.Our study is the first to compare the host responses in the brain in these six species. Chickens show neurological symptoms following infection with HPAI, and it has been proposed that infection of the central nervous system may contribute to the high mortality in poultry species and wild birds (Sturm-Ramirez et al., 2004; Tanimura et al., 2006; Zou et al., 2010; Balasubramaniam et al., 2012). We found very high viral loads in the brains of chickens and turkeys in this study, and in ducks after 2.3 infection. This was accompanied by strong upregulation of ISGs, pro-inflammatory cytokines and other immune genes, along with enrichment of inflammatory pathways. Prior studies have found inflammation, apoptosis, gliosis and neuronal degeneration in the brain of chickens, ducks and crows following HPAI H5N1 infection. (Fleming-Canepa et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020). By contrast, the viral loads in the brain of crow, goose and pigeon were low, and they showed little to no up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. The high viral loads and corresponding neuro-inflammation in susceptible species is likely to be the cause of neurological symptoms and damage to the brain, resulting in high morbidity and mortality seen in these species.The duck and crow were key species in this study, as they typically show high tolerance to HPAI infections, but have high mortality when specifically faced with the 2.3 viral strain (Khan et al., 2014). Some key differences were identified that may explain this increased mortality. Firstly, both species showed a delayed immune response to 2.3. Both species showed immune gene up-regulation by 12 hours in response to 2.2 challenge: duck in the lung and crow in the ileum. However, immune gene up-regulation was not seen at 12 hours in either species after 2.3 challenge. This lack of response at 12 hours cannot be explained by viral load, with both crow and duck showing no significant difference in viral load between 2.3 and 2.2 at this time point, in all tissues. The up-regulation of ISGs was more sustained in response to 2.3 in both species, in both lung and ileum, with stronger immune gene up-regulation at 5 days, likely an indication that the birds have not overcome and recovered from the infection by 5 days. Prior studies have also found delayed timing of immune responses in species with higher susceptibility (Cornelissen et al., 2013), but this is the first time delayed timing has been shown with different strains of HPAI in the same species. This delayed immune response likely contributes to the higher mortality seen in ducks and crows in the face of 2.3 challenge. Further research into the early interaction between virus and these species would be useful for exploring the cause of this delayed response.The goose and pigeon are two species observed to be highly resistant to H5N1 infection (Yamamoto et al., 2012) and this was confirmed by our animal trials. As well as no observed mortality from both the 2.2 and 2.3 strains, these birds also showed very low viral loads following infection, in particular the pigeon. Both species showed low up-regulation of immune responses following infection, again particularly the pigeon. This suggests that the virus may be blocked by innate factors or barriers that prevent viral entry into cells or spread of the virus. One interesting finding was the higher overall ISG expression in the pigeon control samples compared to other species. It is possible that this higher baseline expression of many ISGs could be providing a protective effect. Alternatively, as these birds were acquired from markets, the possibility of pre-existing infection or diseases cannot be entirely ruled out, despite best efforts to check for disease and parasites in the acquired birds. In the goose stronger immune response was seen following 2.3 challenge compared to 2.2 challenge, and even including inflammatory response in the brain, indicating that even in species highly tolerant of both strains, 2.3 does elicit a stronger immune response.One unexpected finding of our analysis was the strong differential regulation of many genes associated with nerve function in both the lung and ileum. The observed expression pattern was that of up-regulation in the lung and down-regulation in the ileum, with much stronger differential regulation in resistant species. Furthermore, this up-regulation was weaker in ducks and crows after 2.3 challenge compared to that of 2.2, suggesting an intriguing viral strain interaction. These genes were some of the strongest differentially regulated genes in this study, with up to 10-fold up-regulation or down-regulation, occurring as early as 12 hours post infection, suggesting a very strong and rapid reaction in these pathways. Ours is not the first study to find a link between nerve-associated genes and avian influenza. Zou et al. (2010) found significant changes in gene expression in neural signal transduction proteins, while a GWAS study (Drobik-Czwarno et al., 2018) identified three nerve-related genes which were candidates for differing susceptibility to HPAI in chickens. As previously discussed, the rapid influx of HPAI virus in the central nervous system (CNS) may be critical for the high susceptibility and mortality of chickens to HPAI. Studies in ferrets and mice have demonstrated influenza may enter the CNS through the olfactory, vagal, trigeminal, and sympathetic nerves (Park et al., 2002; Plourde et al., 2012; Shinya et al., 2000). Regulation of peripheral nerve function in tissues may be one means of controlling viral spread to the central nervous system. Additionally, there is a growing body of research on the effect of the neuro-immune interaction, particularly in the gut (Keita and Söderholm, 2010). In intestinal mucosa there is close connections between nerve cells and immune cells, with immune cells such as mast cells responding to neural stimulation (Stead, 1992). This cross-talk between the nervous and immune system has largely been studied in the context of stress, nematode parasitism, bacterial infections, respiratory disease and food sensitivity (Pothoulakis et al., 1998; Keita and Söderholm, 2010; Chu et al., 2020; Camp et al., 2021), but perhaps this neuro-immune interaction also plays a key role in infectious viral disease. Investigating the role of peripheral nerves in mucosal tissues in influenza infections could be an intriguing target for future research.In this study we identify several candidate genes with possible roles in resistance/susceptibility. As previously mentioned, a suite of nerve-associated genes showed stronger differential regulation in the more resistant species and showed a difference in expression against the two different HPAI viral strains. We identified the genes REST and BDNF as two possible regulators of these nerve genes; the latter gene supports survival of neurons and encourages growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses (Duman, 1999), and was enriched in resistant species in response to both strains of virus. REST, a transcriptional repressor that limits neuronal gene expression in non-neuronal tissues (Chong et al., 1995), was suppressed during 2.2 infection but not 2.3. Another interesting gene that was identified through multiple analyses was OLFM4, an anti-apoptotic factor that is also involved in cell adhesion and proliferation (Zhang et al., 2004). This gene was down-regulated in the lung of all species, but was more strongly down-regulated in resistant species. As apoptosis has previously been identified as a key difference between the response of ducks and chickens to H5N1 (Cornelissen et al., 2013) and between the response to LPAI and H5N1 (Hui et al., 2016), this gene may be a key controller of this resistance mechanism. Several other genes were identified that were up-regulated only in response to 2.2 infection and not 2.3 infection in ducks and crows. This included several defensins - peptides which can have direct anti-viral activity and can also play a role as important immune signalling molecules (Ding et al., 2009), and thus could play a key role early in infection. We also identified genes that were uniquely differentially expressed in the pigeon, the most resistant of the six birds in this study. These genes had a variety of functions that may be involved in inhibition of viral replication and spread, including A4GNT a gene involved in the synthesis of type II mucin (Nakayama et al., 1999) and PERP which is involved in the regulation of apoptosis (Attardi et al., 2000). Investigating the role of these genes in HPAI infection in more depth would be an excellent target for future research.5 ConclusionsIn this study, we investigated the response of six bird species with varying susceptibility to two strains of HPAI H5N1. We discovered intriguing patterns in the differential responses of these species which helps to elucidate the differing mortality and morbidity rates in these species. We found high viral loads and strong up-regulation of neuro-inflammatory pathways in the brains of susceptible species, explaining the neurological symptoms seen in these species. Linked to this, we found a surprising strong differential regulation of genes associated with nerve function in the lung and ileum. Regulation of peripheral nerves at the mucosal sites could potentially be linked to the transmission of the virus to the brain through peripheral nerves or be related to neuro-immune regulation in the mucosa to control viral infection and spread. Additionally, we found key differences in the timing of immune response to different strains of HPAI in ducks and crows, which may explain the differing mortality rates seen in response to these two strains in these species. Lastly, we identified a panel of candidate genes which can be used for future research to further explore their role in HPAI susceptibility and could be targets for selective breeding or gene editing in the development of domestic birds with increased HPAI resistance. The knowledge gained from this study can be used to develop sustainable strategies to control HPAI infections in domestic poultry in the future.Data availability statementThe datasets generated for this study can be found in the Short Read Archive at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra] under accession number PRJEB41063.Ethics statementAll animal experiments were approved by the ICAR institute animal ethics committee (IAEC) approval (73/IAEC/HSADL/13).Author contributionsDWB, PD, LV, AM and AR conceived and designed the study; AM, AR, PV, SC and RD conducted pilot and infection trials and collected the samples; EG performed qPCR analysis on viral genes; DB performed qPCR analysis on host genes; RK conducted Kallisto analysis on the RNA-seq data; BW and KB performed MAIC analysis; KM performed differential expression analysis and all other downstream analysis of the data, prepared the figures and wrote the manuscript; JS and DWB supervised the project and revised the manuscript.

Seasonal flu vaccines must be reformulated each year to match the predominantly circulating strains. When the vaccine matches the predominant strain, it is very effective; however, when it does not match, it may offer little protection. For the first time, U.S. National Science Foundation-supported researchers at the University of California San Diego have created an atomic-level computer model of the H1N1 virus that reveals new vulnerabilities through glycoprotein "breathing" and "tilting" movements. This work, published in ACS Central Science, suggests possible strategies for the design of future vaccines and antivirals against influenza. The main targets of the flu vaccine are two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin, or HA, and neuraminidase, NA. While the HA protein helps the virus bind to the host cell, the NA protein acts like scissors to cut the HA away from the cell membrane, allowing the virus to replicate. Although the properties of both glycoproteins have been studied previously, a complete understanding of their movement does not exist. "Once we knew our models were correct, we realized the enormous potential this discovery held," said Rommie Amaro, principal investigator on the project. "This research could be used to develop methods of keeping the protein locked open so that it would be constantly accessible to antibodies." Amaro is making the data available to other researchers who can uncover even more about how the influenza virus moves, grows and evolves. "This paves the way for other groups to apply similar methods to other viruses," Amaro said. "We've modeled SARS-CoV-2 in the past and now H1N1, but there are other flu variants, MERS, RSV, HIV — this is just the beginning."

The memorial was erected in 2018. Memories of that pandemic influenced Alaska Native management of the COVID-19 pandemic a century later, said experts who spoke at the One Health, One Future conference in Fairbanks. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon) Past pandemic trauma helped shape Alaska Native response to the modern COVID-19 pandemic, limiting the damages and providing some lessons for future health responses, said experts speaking at a health conference in Fairbanks. The influenza epidemic that struck Alaska in late 1918 and nearly wiped out entire Native villages is a “living memory” that inspired people to take precautions on behalf of their entire communities, said Dr. Alisa Alexander, senior medical officer for the Tanana Chiefs Conference, a Fairbanks-headquartered tribal consortium. “So asking people to wear a mask for other people was really easy,” Alexander said. “Walking past those cemeteries and seeing these tiny little graves with 2-year-olds who died from the flu, it’s really easy to keep other people in your mind.” Alexander spoke Tuesday in a panel discussion at a conference held by the University of Alaska Fairbanks’ Center for One Health Research. Tanana Chiefs Conference senior medical officer Alisa Alexander, at Tuesday’s poster session at the One Health, One Future conference in Fairbanks, said historical experience and cultural values shaped COVID-19 responses that protected communities. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon) While those influenza memories underscored the gravity of COVID-19, they also helped provide some confidence in people’s ability to be resilient during the modern pandemic, said Taylor van Doren, an anthropologist and post-doctoral fellow with the Sitka Sound Science Center and another panel speaker at the One Health, One Future conference. Van Doren, who focuses on pandemics, reviewed her research into COVID-related risk perceptions and adaptations among Native residents in the Southeast Alaska communities of Sitka, Hoonah and Kake. Her findings, described in a study published in January, showed reliance on tradition as key to coping and effective health protection – traditional foods, cultural practices and knowledge. “The Tlingit people had agency over the response,” she said. While they took the pandemic seriously and followed precautions, residents she interviewed generally considered COVID-19 to be a problem that could be managed – and something less daunting than long-term climate change, she said. Residents told her they are more worried about things like shrinking glaciers, diminished salmon runs and ocean acidification, “the really large-scale environmental changes that are threats to their traditional ways of life,” she said. A close-up view of names of influenza victims is seen on Sept. 3, 2021, at Nome’s 1918 pandemic memorial. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon) The COVID-19 pandemic, like others before it, placed a disproportionate burden on Alaska Native people, statistics show. In the case of COVID-19, some of the blame has been placed on inadequate water and sanitation service and overcrowded housing. Through 2021, COVID incidence rates were about twice for Alaska Natives as the for white Alaskans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of late February, according to the Department of Health’s COVID-19 data hub, 26% of the state’s more than 1,400 COVID-19 deaths were among Alaska Natives, which is greater than the Native share of the population. Still, there were important successes within the Native population. Cultural values were demonstrated in the rapid distribution of vaccines by Native organizations, including TCC, Alexander said. That included hard work and creativity to ensure that the vaccine was distributed throughout the population, not just Native patients, she said. “It really highlights our sense of community,” she said. Alexander mentioned the pharmacy manager at TCC’s Chief Andrew Isaac Health Center, Daniel Nelson, who was recently honored for his service during the pandemic. That service included personally packaging vaccine doses in coolers for shipping by bush plane to far-flung villages, she said. Pandemic researcher Taylor van Doren, at a poster session on Tuesday at the One Health, One Future conference in Fairbanks, studied COVID-19 experiences of Sitka, Hoonah and Kake residents. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon) There are other lessons that are important for the next pandemic, which is sure to come because of “the interconnectedness of our planet,” said Kristin Clark, public health coordinator at Iowa State University and part of the panel. “It’s not an if,” she said. “It’s when.” One lesson, the panelists said, is that providers and society need to figure out how to keep other medical services going. In Alaska and globally, there have been lapses in normal medical services and treatments, leading to problems like delayed cancer diagnoses and an upswing in active cases of tuberculosis. A new research project by van Doren seeks to quantify those lapses. That is a direct offshoot from her Southeast Alaska study. Participants from the Southeast communities told her directly that they were missing some of their normal medical checkups and treatments, and Dr. Eliot Bruhl, chief medical officer for the SouthEast Alaska Regional Health Consortium, has expressed his own concerns about the problem, she said. Alexander said some reduction in normal services stems from exhaustion of medical professionals, many of them now retired or working curtailed schedules. That results in a scramble to find bed space for needy patients, she said. The preserved chapel at Pilgrim Hot Springs near Nome, seen on Sept. 4, 2021, was part of an orphanage that housed children who lost their parents during the 1918 influenza epidemic. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon) “The hospitals are full. They’re not full from COVID cases. They’re full because we don’t have enough staff to manage the beds,” she said. Fixing that so that people can continue to have access to care that they need might require a continuation of some practices that became important during the pandemic, like flexible work schedules and delivery of care through telemedicine, she said. Alexander, von Doren and Clark all said that in retrospect, they believe it would have been better to keep schools open rather than endure the widespread closures that occurred earlier. “In terms of tamping down the transmission of the virus, it was probably a good strategy. But at what cost?” van Doren said. Many villages in the vast Interior TCC region were able to keep schools open by using precautions to avoid spreading infections, Alexander said. Yet another lesson is the need to respect Indigenous knowledge, said van Doren. “Western science cannot explain everything,” she said. GET THE MORNING HEADLINES.

(Getty Images) As more eagles die from H5N1, researchers concerned virus may undo decades of conservation efforts Bald eagles are often touted as a massive conservation success story due to their rebound from near extinction in the 1960s. But now a highly infectious virus may put that hard-fought comeback in jeopardy. Published in Nature’s Scientific Reports, new research from the University of Georgia showed highly pathogenic avian influenza, also known as H5N1, is killing off unprecedented numbers of mating pairs of bald eagles. Nicole Nemeth (Photo by Jason Thrasher) “Even just one year of losses of productivity like we’ve documented regionally is very concerning and could have effects for decades to come if representative of broader regions,” said Nicole Nemeth, lead author of the study and an associate professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine. “There were nights where I couldn’t sleep based on what we were hearing and seeing. We have already lost unprecedented numbers of wild birds due to this virus in the U.S. and it appears here to stay.” Less than half of Georgia bald eagle nests fledged one chick in 2022 The researchers found that just under half of bald eagle nests along coastal Georgia successfully fledged at least one eaglet in 2022. That’s 30% below average for the region. The study also showed the success rate for nests was halved in one Florida county, dropping to 41% from an average of 86.5%. Another Florida county experienced a less dramatic but still concerning decrease from an average of approximately 78% to 66.7%. “We had reports from people who faithfully monitor eagle nests year after year with these heartbreaking stories of an adult eagle found dead below their nest. Within a few days, often its mate and the chicks were also found dead below the nest. It is clear the virus is causing nest failures,” said Nemeth, who is part of the UGA-based Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study (SCWDS). The collaboration is the first diagnostic and research service established specifically to investigate wildlife diseases. A healthy bald eagle soars through the air. (Georgia DNR) Number of infected wild birds likely an undercount In April 2022, SCWDS researchers confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza had hit Georgia’s eagle populations for the first time. The three dead eagles were found in Chatham, Glynn and Liberty counties in March. At the time, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had confirmed around 660 cases of the H5N1 virus in wild birds, only 11 of which were from Georgia. I think the number of wild bird cases is drastically underreported.” —Nicole Nemeth, College of Veterinary Medicine That number has since skyrocketed to more than 6,200 reported cases across the country, according to the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Those cases include a variety of vultures and other raptors, waterfowl like geese and ducks, as well as other aquatic birds like pelicans and herons, and even some songbirds, though they are less common victims of the virus. (Tens of millions of commercially farmed poultry have died or been culled due to risk of infection.) “I think the number of wild bird cases is drastically underreported,” Nemeth said. “People will submit one snow goose, for example, and it will test positive for the virus. And then they’ll tell you, ‘Well, there are thousands of geese dying at the same site.’ But it only goes down as one infected bird.” Healthy seagulls explore the Georgia coast. Seagulls are one of many species of birds that can contract the H5N1 virus. (Photo by Dorothy Kozlowski/UGA) H5N1 doesn’t pose massive threat to humans but may to other species The birds at biggest risk of infection are those that live in coastal or other aquatic areas inland or prey on other birds that do. The virus can persist in water for over a year, given the proper conditions. While not a risk to people, birds can pick up the virus from spending time in the water and carry it to new locations through migration. Raptors like eagles and vultures then catch the virus when they consume the infected birds. “Worst case scenario, we get into a scary place with some of these bird species,” Nemeth said. “We could see a lot more decline in the numbers of eagles, raptors, waterfowl and other birds than what we’ve already seen. It could be devastating.” Bears, red foxes and coyotes among animals infected with virus Avian influenza has hopped species as well. H5N1 has infected wild mammals such as red foxes, coyotes, raccoons, seals, opossums and even some bears in North America. However, very few people have been infected with the virus in the U.S. and have recovered with minimal symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s everywhere now. We can’t contain the virus, and we can’t vaccinate wild birds.” —Nicole Nemeth “A virus that can spread and be maintained as this virus can, it’s everywhere now,” Nemeth said. “We can’t contain the virus, and we can’t vaccinate wild birds.

This may lead to problems with thinking, memory, and/or movement. Examples include Alzheimer’s disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). These diseases tend to happen late in life. There are few effective treatments. Infection with certain viruses like influenza, shown here, could raise the risk of neurodegenerative disease. John Gallagher and Audray Harris, NIAID Laboratory of Infectious Diseases Previous findings have suggested that viruses may play a role in certain neurodegenerative diseases. For example, a recent study found a link between Epstein-Barr virus infection and the risk of MS. There are also concerns about cognitive impacts from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. A research team led by Drs. Mike Nalls, Kristin Levine, and Hampton Leonard of NIH’s Center for Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias examined links between viruses and neurodegenerative diseases more generally. To do so, they analyzed data from the FinnGen project. This is a repository of biomedical data, or biobank, from more than 300,000 people in Finland. The team searched the biobank for people who had been diagnosed with one of six different conditions: AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, generalized dementia, vascular dementia, PD, and MS. They then checked how many had been hospitalized for a viral illness before. To confirm their findings, they looked for the same associations in the UK Biobank, which contains data from almost 500,000 people in the United Kingdom. Results appeared in Neuron on Jan. 19, 2023. The researchers found 45 associations between viruses and neurodegenerative diseases in FinnGen. Of these, 22 also appeared in the UK Biobank. The strongest association was between viral encephalitis — brain inflammation caused by a virus — and AD. A person with viral encephalitis in the FinnGen database was 30 times as likely to be diagnosed with AD as someone without encephalitis. Results were similar in the UK Biobank; people with viral encephalitis were 22 times as likely to develop AD as those without. The team also found, in FinnGen, the association between Epstein-Barr virus and MS that was described before. The association wasn’t seen in the UK Biobank, but this may reflect how the different biobanks use hospital diagnostic codes; Epstein-Barr viruses are common and so often not noted. Influenza with pneumonia was associated with all the neurodegenerative diseases except MS. The researchers only included cases of influenza severe enough to need hospitalization in the study. Thus, these associations only apply to the most severe cases of influenza. FinnGen contains data on the same people over time. The team used this to examine how the associations depended on the time since infection. They found that some viral infections were associated with increased risk of neurodegenerative disease as much as 15 years later. The researchers note that vaccines exist for some of the viruses they identified. These include influenza, varicella zoster (which causes chickenpox and shingles), and certain pneumonia-causing viruses. Vaccination might thus reduce some of the risk of the conditions they examined. “The results of this study provide researchers with several new critical pieces of the neurodegenerative disorder puzzle,” Nalls says. “In the future, we plan to use the latest data science tools to not only find more pieces but also help researchers understand how those pieces, including genes and other risk factors, fit together.” Reference: Levine KS, et al.

Photo: Owen Humphreys/PA Images via Getty Images By Saima May Sidik Contributor, Audubon magazine Published Spring 2023 In late 2021, Tufts University virologist Wendy Puryear began to worry. The avian flu virus was behaving oddly. It usually passes through wild birds with little harm. But in Europe, a highly pathogenic strain known as H5N1 was killing a range of avian species, such as Mute Swans in France and a White-tailed Eagle in Scotland, and infecting mammals like otters and foxes. Then it hopped across the Atlantic. Carried long distances by migrating waterfowl, gulls, and shorebirds, within months the virus found almost every corner of North America—and eventually South America—until the situation reached “whole new levels of crazy,” Puryear says. By now, USDA’s National Wildlife Disease Program has detected the virus in nearly 150 avian species, such as Canada Geese, Brown Pelicans, Red-tailed Hawks, and Snowy Owls, and recorded thousands of dead birds, says program lead Julianna Lenoch. Meanwhile, H5N1 hit North America’s farms. More than 55 million poultry have died—some from flu and others culled to contain it—at a cost of billions of dollars. At grocery stores, egg prices skyrocketed. Despite surging and cresting in the past year, the now-global strain is showing no signs of burning out. As a result, birds are facing their own pandemic, with unknown long-term consequences for avian health. Public health agencies are also monitoring for human infections. While rare, people can contract bird flu through close contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces. What’s more, there’s a low but real risk the strain could mutate to enable people to pass the virus to others, a scenario that’s caused human pandemics over the last century. Although it snowballed recently, today’s situation has been brewing since 1996 when a garden-variety avian influenza acquired mutations on a farm that made it lethal to poultry. Over time, the virus appeared in Asia, Europe, and Africa, with an outbreak hitting North America in 2014 before fizzling. Experts think further mutations may be behind its recent ability to cause more severe disease in wild birds and infect more birds and some mammals. To keep tabs on H5N1’s prevalance and distribution, USDA and other agencies are collecting samples from tens of thousands of wild birds—mostly dabbling ducks, which transmit the virus when they congregate (usually without getting ill). As birds return from their migration journeys this spring, scientists will be looking at whether the virus has changed genetically over the winter in ways that make it more or less dangerous, and whether it affects bird behavior during the breeding season. While determining the flu’s long-term effects will take more time and surveys, researchers are especially worried about its impact on vulnerable avian populations, including some colonial waterbirds, long-lived seabirds, and birds of prey. In June, for example, almost 1,500 Caspian Terns died on Lake Michigan islands—about 60 percent of Wisconsin’s population, including many breeding adults. Such losses, says Timm Harder, a veterinary virologist at Germany’s National Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza, could leave “a deep scar” on future generations. Bald Eagles, which can get sick after consuming infected waterfowl, also face challenges. In the United States, more than 300 Bald Eagles tested positive in 2022. A recent study reported an unusually poor eagle nesting season in avian flu hotspots in Georgia and Florida. The authors warned the disease may pose an “impending threat” to a species that conservationists spent decades bringing back from near extinction. It’s a disheartening situation for bird lovers. While songbirds are mostly unaffected so far, some authorities have urged the precaution of taking bird feeders down during local outbreaks, so birds don’t gather and risk getting the flu. (People who keep backyard chickens or other domestic birds should especially avoid attracting wild avian visitors). Audubon generally advises removing feeders if at least one local wildlife agency calls for it and regularly cleaning any bird feeders or baths in use. Also important: Don’t touch live or dead birds. Broader efforts to rein in the virus also face uncertainty. Wild birds pass it to poultry and vice versa, and even the best measures to avoid such intermingling haven’t been foolproof. Rodents, farm equipment, or even the wind may move the virus around. Given this outbreak’s staying power, governments and experts are debating the use of vaccines. But giving doses to billions of farmed birds might not be feasible, Harder says, and vaccinating wild birds through bait they consume is even harder. While inoculations could target high-risk animals such as free-range chickens that interact with wild birds, incomplete measures also risk speeding the rise of new variants, says University of Missouri virologist Henry Wan. These considerations may feel all too familiar to a world still reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the last few weeks, H5N1 has begun appearing more widely in mammals, including wild bears and sea lions and among farmed mink. Amid these troubling developments, many experts ramped up calls for more urgent measures, such as better biosecurity on farms and improved global cooperation, to avoid the risk that the virus could adapt to infect people more easily. The goal: ensure that bird flu won’t trigger another major public health crisis.

In China, outbreaks involving at least 10 people must be reported to health authorities.Nearly all of the samples that tested positive that week – 99 per cent of 786 samples – were infected with influenza A, a common flu virus that causes symptoms such as fever, aches, headaches and diarrhoea.

Many raptors that contract it die. (May 5)APBald eagle nest failures and deaths are piling up at an “alarming rate” as a result of the highly infectious avian influenza, University of Georgia researchers announced this week.The avian influenza strain known as H5N1 is killing an unprecedented number of mating pairs of the national symbol birds, University of Georgia researchers concluded in a study published in Nature’s Scientific Reports. “Even just one year of losses of productivity like we’ve documented regionally is very concerning and could have effects for decades to come if representative of broader regions,” said Nicole Nemeth, an associate professor at UGA’s college of veterinary medicine, who led the study with 10 other researchers. “There were nights where I couldn’t sleep based on what we were hearing and seeing.”Are we ready: Is the US prepared for a possible bird flu pandemic? What we know.What did the research show? “We had reports from people who faithfully monitor eagle nests year after year with these heartbreaking stories of an adult eagle found dead below their nest, Nemeth said. “Within a few days, often its mate and the chicks were also found dead below the nest. It is clear the virus is causing nest failures.”Just under half the bald eagle nests in coastal Georgia fledged an eaglet in 2022, 30% below average for the season. The influenza was documented in Georgia’s bald eagles for the first time in April 2022 after dead eagles were found in Chatham, Glynn and Liberty counties in March.The success rate for nests in one Florida County was 50% lower than average, dropping from an average of 86.5% to 41%.What about bald eagles elsewhere? There have been many reports of bald eagles dying across the U.S. and Canada, said Nemeth, a part of the University of Georgia's Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study. The study has diagnosed cases of the influenza in high numbers of bald eagles and other avian species from member states. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service also revealed the influenza is widespread in bald eagles, she said. Eagles and other raptors probably contract the virus by eating other diseased birds, federal officials say. BACKGROUND: Bird flu costs accumulate as avian influenza outbreak enters second yearWhat other birds have been affected?Since it was first detected in the United States in January 2022, the H5N1 virus has exploded in birds across the country, federal data shows, but also infects other wildlife.Reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show the virus has:Has struck more than 58 million domestic poultry animals, including chickens and turkeys, in 777 outbreaks.Been the subject of 4,672 reports in wild birds.Infected at least 146 avian species .Been documented in every state but Hawaii and every Canadian province and territory.Has spread to 17 other wildlife species in 22 states, including 60 red fox, 16 harbor seals and 14 striped skunks.Nearly half the infected red foxes were reported in Michigan and Wisconsin.Nemeth suspects the number of wild bird cases “is drastically underreported.”“People will submit one snow goose, for example, and it will test positive for the virus,” she said. “And then they’ll tell you, ‘Well, there are thousands of geese dying at the same site.’ But it only goes down as one infected bird.“We can’t contain the virus, and we can’t vaccinate wild birds," Nemeth said. "But we can document the losses and try to help conserve affected species and populations the best we can.”Experts say it's likely the virus is being spread when birds or other mammals eat infected birds. The virus affects birds by impairing their nervous systems and making them unable to fly. But some species are more susceptible than others, including the bald eagle.What humans need to knowThe CDC says bird flu strikes primarily in animals, but it has been detected in four people in the United States. Symptoms include eye redness, flulike upper respiratory symptoms that range from mild to severe, fever and body aches.Also, an 11-year-old girl died in Cambodia in late February.Dig deeper: IN MAMMALS: The bird flu outbreak is spilling over into mammalsEGG PRICES: Here's why egg prices are soaring across the USIN HUMANS: Colorado prison inmate diagnosed with human avian flu; first case of strain detected in US Facebook Twitter EmailShare your feedback to help improve our site!HelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices © Copyright Gannett 2024Vaccine Makers Are Preparing for Bird Flu | Scientific American Skip to main contentScientific AmericanMarch 2, 20236 min readVaccine Makers Are Preparing for Bird FluAlthough most experts say bird flu is not an immediate threat to humans, efforts are underway to produce vaccines for H5N1 or another potential pandemic virusBy Hannah Docter-LoebA worker weighs chickens at a market in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on February 24, 2023. The father of an 11-year-old Cambodian girl who died from bird flu tested positive for the virus, health officials said. Tang Chhin Sothy/AFP via Getty ImagesMinks in Spain, seals in Scotland, sea lions and dolphins in South America: a number of mammal species have recently been found to be infected with H5N1, a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza. Avian flu is not new; epidemiologists have been studying it for decades. But the detection of the virus in mammals has many concerned about the potential that it could spill over to humans and cause a larger outbreak.As the world enters the fourth year of a global pandemic caused by a virus that likely came from an animal, concern over another virus potentially uprooting our lives is valid. H5N1 has infected humans before, although human-to-human transmission has rarely been observed. And while the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the mortality rate of avian flu in humans is around 56 percent, many experts believe it’s likely to be much lower if the virus becomes more transmissible. One reason avian flu is so lethal is that it infects the lower respiratory tract, which can lead to respiratory failure. If it were to mutate to infect the upper respiratory tract and spread more easily, it would probably cause milder illness. Yet even a virus that causes mild or moderate illness in many people can have a serious toll, as we’ve seen with the COVID pandemic. So efforts are underway to develop vaccines to protect against such a form of bird flu.Bird flu has spilled over to humans before—in fact, just last week a girl in Cambodia died from H5N1 (although not the same strain as the one that is sickening birds worldwide).On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

But he stressed that H5N1 is likely not an imminent threat to humans.Others agree. “I’m keeping a close eye on it as an expert, but as a member of the community, as a parent and someone who [has been] recently experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic, I’m not worried about this right now,” says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “This is an animal health issue right now that has a theoretical risk to become a human health issue.”Avian influenza viruses infect birds by attaching to a receptor in their respiratory tract. In order for the virus to become a human virus and start circulating from person to person in the population, it would have to be able to attach itself to the human version of this receptor—something it hasn’t yet evolved to do.“It’s a really dangerous time to be a bird,” Andrew Pavia, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah, adds. “But as of today, the risk to humans remains very low. Our concern is what’s going to happen as it circulates more and more.”It’s unfortunately nearly impossible to predict when this jump could happen. “None of us know when the next influenza pandemic will emerge. It could be tomorrow [or] it could be years from now, and we don’t know which of the viruses will become the next pandemic virus,” Osterholm says. “At the outset, you have to say there is uncertainty, with one exception: there will be a pandemic.”The U.S. is somewhat equipped to handle avian flu: there is a stockpile of egg-based flu vaccines for the H5N1 strain. Eggs are one of the most common ways to make a flu vaccine. To create it, manufacturers inject an inactivated or weakened virus into a fertilized chicken egg, incubate the egg for a few days while the virus multiplies and then harvest the virus to use for the vaccine. The country has a secret chicken stockpile in undisclosed locations across the U.S. just in case we need to make egg-based vaccines quickly—such as during a flu pandemic. It may be concerning that this vaccine strategy depends on an animal that is highly susceptible to the flu in question. But several experts told Scientific American that there are high levels of biosecurity at the chicken facilities in order to avoid bird flu contamination.Alternatives to egg-based vaccines exist. Since the early 2010s, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has been partnering with CSL Seqirus, one of the largest influenza vaccine manufacturers, to develop vaccines grown in cells in a laboratory. The pandemic preparedness vaccine AUDENZ, which targets the H5N1 subtype specifically, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And although it’s impossible to determine which virus will cause the next pandemic, CSL Seqirus has a library of viruses that have the potential to infect humans. And the company is constantly looking for candidate vaccine viruses that it can tailor to a specific pathogen.“We use data [for] one of the avian strains to create a mock-up file,” says Marc Lacey, who runs CSL Seqirus’s pandemic preparedness and response team. The team members basically identify certain viruses, use them to create vaccines and conduct some of the early safety studies so that if an avian flu strain evolves into a true pandemic strain transmitting between humans, they will be ready to go with an adequate vaccine. Lacey says that his company would be able to supply the U.S. government with 150 million doses within the first six months of a pandemic being declared, but he thinks the scale-up potential could be higher, especially if multiple manufacturers could help produce it. Because there are eight billion people in the world, scale-up and widespread collaboration across countries would be necessary to make enough vaccine.There are also efforts to apply messenger RNA (mRNA) technology—such as that used for some of the COVID vaccines—to flu vaccines. According to University of Washington microbiologist Deborah Fuller, these efforts range from developing a universal flu vaccine to creating a “multivalent” vaccine that targets only a few subtypes—or versions of the virus (like a typical seasonal flu vaccine does). One advantage of mRNA technology is its speed of production. And because of the COVID pandemic, there is now more infrastructure to mass-produce doses. “RNA vaccines can be designed extremely quickly—you only need the genetic sequence of what the new variant is that’s emerging, and within weeks, [you] can have a vaccine already tested in animal models,” Fuller says.Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, is also investigating mRNA flu vaccines. He’s part of a research team developing a 20-subtype mRNA flu vaccine that includes an H5N1 strain (although not the one currently circulating in birds). The team recently published its findings in Science. Hensley’s lab is now developing a single-strain vaccine tailored to the current bird flu strain—and is already testing it in laboratory animals. He emphasizes that, as with the COVID vaccines, his vaccines are meant to prevent serious illness and death, not infection.But even the 20-subtype vaccine is expected to provide some protection against the new strain. “When we developed [that] vaccine, the idea was to create one that could induce a certain level of immune memory against every subtype,” Hensley says. “Our goal wasn’t to predict which influenza subtype would cause the next pandemic or which strain would cause it. Rather the vaccine [would induce] some level of immune memory against every subtype so that it would limit disease and death caused by new pandemic strains.”A vaccine is only part of pandemic preparedness—you also need effective treatments. As Pavia says, researchers aren’t working from scratch trying to create something like the COVID antiviral Paxlovid, which took nearly two years to get to market. FDA-approved antivirals for influenza, such as Tamiflu, already exist and will be important for reducing deaths during a flu pandemic. Pavia is also hopeful that the U.S. could quickly adapt diagnostic tests to match an outbreak strain of pandemic flu.“We have better tools and better knowledge about influenza than we did about coronaviruses. In many ways, we would be a step ahead,” Pavia says. “But what I worry about is our political capacity to respond. We need to continue to [increase] awareness and continue preparation efforts. And if things start to accelerate, we need a concerted, nonpoliticized effort to move quickly and effectively.”Rights & PermissionsHannah Docter-Loeb is a freelance writer based in Washington, D.C.More by Hannah Docter-LoebExpand Your World with ScienceLearn and share the most exciting discoveries, innovations and ideas shaping our world today.SubscribeSign up for our newslettersSee the latest storiesRead the latest issueGive a Gift SubscriptionFollow Us:Return & Refund PolicyAboutPress RoomFAQsContact UsInternational EditionsAdvertiseAccessibility StatementTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyCalifornia Consumer Privacy StatementUse of cookies/Do not sell my dataScientific American is part of Springer Nature, which owns or has commercial relations with thousands of scientific publications (many of them can be found at www.springernature.com/us).

Because an avian flu killed 43 million hens last yearThis article is more than 1 year oldGene BaurA global pandemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza is driving deaths in the egg industry. And factory farming is largely to blameWed 1 Mar 2023 11.16 GMTLast modified on Wed 1 Mar 2023 12.04 GMTShareThe increased cost of eggs has been in the news, but the cause has largely been absent in mainstream media. A global pandemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), a form of bird flu (H5N1), has resulted in the deaths of over 43 million hens in the egg industry, causing a drop in the supply of eggs and higher prices for consumers. While industry and government officials are feverishly working on getting this outbreak under control, the more significant issue is that confining animals by the billions in cruel and stressful conditions exacerbates the spread of disease. The problem is getting worse, and agribusiness needs to stop distracting consumers with messages about high egg prices and be held accountable for its irresponsible conduct.On factory farms across the US, animals used to produce meat, milk and eggs for human consumption are crowded by the thousands in unsanitary conditions, and they’re fed a steady diet of pharmaceuticals to ward off the resulting illness. This helps keep animals productive and alive long enough to reach market, benefiting agribusiness in the short term, but it is contributing to the development of more virulent forms of resistant pathogens that jeopardize the wellbeing of both human and nonhuman animals. As a study published in 2018 warned: “The golden age of antibiotics (the 1950s through 1970s) marked the beginning of the arms race between humans and bacteria. Antimicrobial resistance is now among the greatest threats to human health.”Confining animals by the billions in cruel and stressful conditions exacerbates the spread of disease - and the problem is getting worseAnd if antibiotic-resistant bacteria aren’t scary enough, viruses also mutate and evolve and can jump between species. The current bird flu pandemic has claimed its first human fatality, an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia, and it’s also been detected to spread within mammals on mink farms. We don’t know the full risks posed by this and other zoonoses, especially with the continuous evolution of new variants, but what we know so far, according to the World Health Organization, is: “Humans can be infected with avian, swine, and other zoonotic influenza viruses, such as avian influenza virus subtypes A(H5N1), A(H7N9), and A(H9N2) and swine influenza virus subtypes A(H1N1), A(H1N2) and A(H3N2).”Our recent experience and challenges with the global Covid pandemic should serve as an important reminder that humans, like other animals, are susceptible to communicable diseases from other species. The world’s top scientists and experts have had limited success controlling Covid or even determining its origin with certainty, and it’s impossible to predict what new variants of zoonotic diseases will develop or the full extent of these emerging risks.Science is a valuable tool for understanding our world and ourselves, including how microbes and other animals and organisms interact, but it is limited. It can reduce complex multitudes of interrelated issues to a narrow set of empirical measurements, and it can also be biased. Researchers working for industries with particular interests tend to focus on narrow-minded objectives without considering the broader contexts and implications. Within animal agriculture, science is focused on increasing profitability by manipulating genetics, formulating feed and other inputs to maximize productivity, and engineering systems to increase the speed and efficiency of raising and processing billions of animals for food. Chickens, pigs, cows and other individuals exploited in agriculture are stretched to their biological limits, which increases their susceptibility to disease when their bodies and immune systems break down.The factory farming industry breeds misery, disease and destruction. It is unhealthy and unsustainable. This needs to changeWhen diseases in animals threaten industry profits, agribusiness is motivated to act. However, when the costs associated with animal diseases and deaths are less than the financial benefits generated by the harsh system that creates them, the industry considers diseases and fatalities to be acceptable economic losses. For example, when chickens are pushed to grow six times faster than before, the system is profitable even if a significant percentage of them die. Shockingly, even without diseases like HPAI, hundreds of millions of farm animals in the US are expected to die before reaching slaughter every year due to the realities of a system that puts profit above animal health or welfare.The factory farming industry breeds misery, disease and destruction. It is unhealthy and unsustainable, and it receives billions of dollars of government subsidies. This needs to change. We can feed people more efficiently and support biodiversity and more resilient ecosystems by eating plant foods directly instead of growing feed for farm animals. In the US, 10 times more land is used to feed farm animals than humans.We can lighten our footprint, lower ecological stresses, and lessen the risk of disease in humans and other animals by ending factory farming and shifting toward plant-based agriculture. Preventing the intolerable suffering and needless deaths of billions of animals every year would also benefit humanity.

By Saima May Sidik Saima May Sidik View author publications You can also search for this author in PubMed Google Scholar Twitter Facebook Email Access through your institution Buy or subscribe Fears are rising about bird flu’s potential to spark a human pandemic, as well as its destruction of wildlife and farmed birds. An 11-year-old girl tragically died in Cambodia last week after catching avian influenza. That followed reports earlier this year of the virus spreading from mammal to mammal through a mink farm, and causing mass mortality in Peruvian birds and sea lions. Since the beginning of 2022, more than 50 million poultry birds in the United States, and a similar number in Europe, have either died of the disease or been killed in efforts to stem its spread. Can bird flu be stopped, and if yes, how?

A genetic analysis reveals that the virus family probably originated hundreds of millions of years ago in primordial aquatic animals that evolved well before the first fishes. It’s not clear whether influenza moved onto land with early terrestrial vertebrates, or jumped from sea to land more recently.Nature | 5 min readReference: bioRxiv paper (not peer-reviewed)Forget the ‘alpha’ wolf stereotypeAn increasing number of wildlife biologists say that wolf packs in the wild aren’t led by a domineering ‘alpha male’ — just good old mum and dad. “He’s just the father of the family,” says wolf researcher L. David Mech. The terminology arose from studying unrelated wolves thrown together in captivity, says Mech — a recipe for discord. In the wild, competition tends to arise in rare cases when there’s plenty of food around and wolf packs balloon in size. “In that case, I personally think the alpha term applies because there is still a dominant female calling the shots in that pack,” says wolf researcher David Ausband.Scientific American | 6 min readFeatures & opinionThe molecule that kickstarted lifeFor more than 15 years, scientists have been on a quest: create a functional ‘protoribosome’, a reconstructed version of the protein-building machine that many think might have helped to kickstart life on Earth. The modern ribosome is a key ingredient of life as we know it because it translates genetic information into proteins. At its heart sits a small RNA pocket that some think might be closest to what the very first ribosome looked like. Now, there’s proof that some reconstructed protoribosome-like RNAs can link amino acids — the first step to making proteins. Some scientists say there are other ways for proteins to emerge, without a ribosome. But others are already thinking about repurposing these simple machines to manufacture new kinds of biomolecule.Nature | 12 min readHow researchers can help Syria’s survivorsIn northwest Syria, the disastrous earthquake that struck on 6 February has been compounded by the fact that the region has no unified government, is isolated with limited border crossings and is trapped in an ongoing civil war. “This tragedy has opened a rare window to provide more international support for people who have been neglected for much too long,” argues a Nature editorial. After speaking to researchers, medical personnel and engineers in the region and internationally, Nature lists ways that members of the international research community can help.Nature | 4 min readHow to tackle political polarizationSocial scientists are seeking strategies for reducing hostility between people who support different political parties. One real-world success story: a joint political advertisement in which the opposing candidates for Utah governor agreed to campaign respectfully. Extreme political polarization has been associated with a rise in support for partisan violence, and some fear it could eventually culminate in the collapse of democracy. “That’s the lurking dark pit that we’re all trying to avoid,” says social psychologist Kurt Gray.Nature | 12 min readMaking music with quantum computersDrones, wild beats and bleeps — these were some of the sounds produced using quantum computing at an event in London last December. Brazilian composer and computer scientist Eduardo Reck Miranda captured a crowd with improvised musical compositions created using a seven-qubit IBM Quantum device, housed in New York City and remotely controlled through hand gestures. Measurements of the quantum bit’s state determined the characteristics of the sounds produced by synthesizers at the venue. Quantum algorithms are appealing because they offer a source of randomness not possible with classical computers. “You set up the conditions, but you’re not completely sure what it will produce until the piece is performed,” says Miranda. “The performance will be unique for that particular moment.”Physics World | 15 min readImage of the weekThe delicate, non-venomous Canopy’s snail-eating snake (Sibon canopy) is one of five tree-dwelling snake species that were described for the first time by Western science this year. They are found in the rainforests of Ecuador, Colombia and Panama, which host a vast biodiversity — and some of the world’s biggest gold and copper deposits. The snakes, as well as many other species, face threats from both legal and illegal mining activities, which cut down trees and flush harmful waste into rivers and soils.

Such predictions could be useful for pandemic preparedness. The study has been published in PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY. Study: Using real-time data to guide decision-making during an influenza pandemic: A modelling analysis. Image Credit: Angelina Bambina/Shutterstock Background The influenza pandemic caused by H1N1 influenza virus in 1918 took approximately 50 million lives worldwide. The case fatality rate of the influenza pandemic was similar to that estimated during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Some highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have continued to cause sporadic human infections in recent times. Although human-to-human transmission of these infections occurs occasionally, there remains a risk for the future emergence of a large-scale influenza pandemic. Influenza infections generally follow a seasonal pattern, with already-identified viruses causing a wave of infections each winter in temperate countries across the world. Certain seasonal drivers, such as absolute humidity, play a vital role in shaping the dynamics of the influenza pandemic as well as seasonal influenza waves. Influenza epidemics are mostly associated with an initial emergence of a novel viral variant, followed by a resurgence accompanying the onset of the annual influenza season. In the USA, the novel H1N1 influenza variant caused a “spring wave” between April and July 2009, with over 5 million people experiencing symptomatic infections. Subsequently, a strong resurgence of the virus was observed during seasonal influenza infections in October 2009. This “fall wave” had caused an estimated 60.8 million infections and 274,304 hospitalizations by April 2010. In the current study, scientists have analyzed the surveillance data obtained from the “spring wave” using mathematical models to predict the peak timing and health outcomes of the subsequent “fall wave.” They have applied this framework to guide the decision-making for future pandemics. Important observations The influenza infection surveillance data of the “spring wave” in 2009 was collected from ten states in the USA. The data was analyzed using mathematical models to predict the health outcomes of the “fall wave.” The effects of school opening as well as environmental triggers, were considered in the model. In the surveillance data, many states, including California, showed clear signs of distinct spring and fall waves. The model used this data for the proportion of symptomatic cases that were laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized.

These states also reported a significantly lower number of cases during the fall wave. Using the surveillance data, the model predicted the peak timing and size of the fall wave. The model-predicted peak timing was slightly earlier than the actual fall wave peak timing documented. However, regarding the size of fall wave, the model predictions were reasonably comparable to the surveillance data. Regarding the proportion of hospitalization during the fall wave, the model predictions were similar to the surveillance data for seven out of ten states studied. However, for the states of Georgia, New Mexico and Tennessee, the predictions were less accurate. Specifically, the model significantly overestimated the proportion of hospitalizations for these states. This could be due to insufficient surveillance data available for these states. Application of the model The scientists determined how this model can be applied for the timely prevention of upcoming waves. They specifically focused on preemptive school closures until a vaccine becomes available. Considering a situation where 25% of the population is vaccinated, and preemptive school closures are implemented, the model predicted a significant reduction in health burden during the fall wave. According to the model prediction, preemptive school closures for ten weeks can lead to a 72% reduction in the proportion of hospitalization during the fall wave. Study significance The study describes how mathematical models of influenza transmission dynamics can be used to analyze pre-existing surveillance data obtained at the initial pandemic phase for future pandemic preparedness. For the states with sufficient first wave surveillance data, the model accurately predicts the health burden of the second wave. However, the model fails to predict the peak timing of the second wave accurately. Journal reference: Haw DJ. (2023).

Earlier this February, the World Health Organisation head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that the world had to prepare for a possible bird-flu pandemic. The virus can be life-threatening as it has demonstrated neurotropism, which can infect the central nervous system. Severe cases may experience encephalitis, yet another potentially life-threatening inflammation of the brain. Written by Satata Karmakar |Updated : March 3, 2023 12:12 PM IST The year 2019 saw the emergence of the deadliest virus -- SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. The infection attacks the respiratory system of the body, leaving it suffering from severe breathing difficulties and sometimes, even multiple-organ failure. It took the world over two years to bring the situation under control. The outbreak was so massive that the World Health Organisation (WHO) termed it a 'pandemic'. But now, standing in 2023, we all wanted to live a pandemic-free life. But, is that even possible? In its recent warnings, the global health body has notified that the H5N1 bird flu variant is spreading rapidly and has the ability to not only infect birds, but also humans. Let's know more about this. Will Bird Flu Drive The Next Pandemic?Avian influenza, also known as bird flu has already claimed the lives of over 15 million domestic birds and led to the culling of an unprecedented 193 million more since October 2021. Experts have warned that the virus is no longer restricted to birds. In the United States, the list of wild mammals killed by bird or avian influenza is growing. Also Read Avian Influenza Outbreaks In Animals: Humans At Risk Too, Warn FAO, WHO And WOAH More News Looking at the current trend of bird flu and its ability to evade the human immune system, one question that is lingering in everyone's mind is, could bird flu, or avian influenza, evolve from an ecological disaster to a full-blown pandemic? After COVID-19, will bird flu be the next virus to kill millions of lives? TheHealthSite.com spoke to Dr. Anamika Dubey, Senior Consultant, General Pediatrician, Madhukar Rainbow Children's Hospital, Malviya Nagar. You may like to read Bird Flu: All That You Need To KnowBird flu is an air-borne infection caused by strains of the influenza virus that primarily infect birds. How does it transmit to humans? As per experts, a bird flu infection can spread to humans when a fit individual comes in contact with sick birds. Human-to-human transmission is also possible. The virus responsible for severe human infections has been identified as H7N9 and H5N1. The symptoms associated with this type of infection can look like common flu, such as fever, body aches, sore throat, and cough. Bird flu infection is usually diagnosed by collecting a swab from the upper respiratory tract of the sick person. In the United States, there are repeated outbreaks of H5N1 in wild birds and poultry since 2022. In India, H5N1 in poultry farms was first reported in 2006 in Maharashtra. Since then, outbreaks of Avian influenza A in poultry farms is reported every year. One human case of H5N1 was notified on 21 July, 2021, from Haryana state. How To Stay Safe From Catching Bird Flu?As advised by WHO, at all times the public should avoid contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets/farms and live poultry, or surfaces that might be contaminated by poultry or bird feces. One of the most important things to keep in mind in order to stay safe from catching the infection is hand hygiene. Washing hands frequently with soap and water is highly recommended. Good food safety practices should be followed. There is no evidence to suggest that influenza or other avian influenza viruses can be transmitted to humans through properly cooked poultry. There is no epidemiological evidence to suggest that people have been infected with the avian influenza virus by consumption of eggs or egg products. However, eggs collected from areas with outbreaks of bird flu or avian influenza should not be consumed raw or partially cooked. Make sure to wash them and cook them well before eating. TRENDING NOW Although bird flu viruses mainly infect and spread among wild migratory water birds and domestic poultry, some bird flu viruses can infect and spread to other animals as well. While it is unlikely that people would become infected with bird flu viruses through contact with an infected wild, stray, or domestic animal, it is possible especially if there is prolonged and unprotected exposure to an infected animal.

File | Photo Credit: The Hindu Rising cases of intense cough lasting for over a week coupled with fever, observed in most parts of the country, can be linked to Influenza A H3N2, a subtype of a virus that causes flu, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said on Saturday.“Surveillance data from December 15 reflects the rise in number of cases of Influenza A H3N2,” the health agency has stated. The ICMR has 30 Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDL) for respiratory virus surveillance. These VRDLs are attached to the top medical colleges in different States and gather samples from patients suffering from severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). In its observations, the ICMR noted that about half of all patients admitted with SARI and patients walking in to clinics were found to be afflicted with Influenza A H3N2. At least 92% of the hospitalised SARI patients detected with the virus were showing up with fever and upto 86% have cough. Additionally, 27% progressed to breathlessness and 16% showed wheezing symptoms. Also, 16% had signs of pneumonia and 6% presented with seizures, the ICMR has stated. The agency has also said that the virus appeared to lead to more hospitalisations than other Influenza subtypes. Also read |Influenza virus might have marine origin with fish as early host About 10% of all SARI patients who have Influenza A H3N2 needed oxygen and 7% required ICU care, the health body has said.Mumbai-based senior physician Altaf Patel sees at least ten patients every day with suspected flu. “The cases have certainly risen, and patients are presenting with breathlessness and severe episodes of spasmodic cough. Some patients are showing symptoms for as long as 10 to 12 days,” observed Dr. Patel. Because it is a viral flu, antibiotics are of no use. The ICMR has advised patients against the intake of antibiotics or any other medication without consulting a doctor. “Treatment with paracetamol for fever and bodyache is advised. Also take in plenty of fluids,” the ICMR has stated. Dr. Patel observed that there was very little difference in symptoms between COVID-19 and the illness brought on by Influenza A H3N2. Shaking hands or using other forms of contact greeting should be discouraged, the ICMR has said. “Wearing masks while venturing out is a good idea. It is important for people to take their flu vaccination,” Dr. Patel said.

Tang Chhin Sothy / AFP via Getty Images An 11-year-old girl died last week after contracting avian influenza (H5N1) in a village in the province of Prey Veng, Cambodia. Following her diagnosis, officials tested 12 of her close contacts, but only one, her father, also tested positive for the disease, though he was asymptomatic, per the World Health Organization (WHO). These are the first reported human cases of bird flu in Cambodia in nine years. Since 2021, avian flu has been decimating wild and domestic birds in several parts of the world. This wave of deaths is now the worst on record for the United States, where more than 58 million birds have died or were culled since February last year, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As the virus infects more mammals—including foxes, minks, seals and bears—health officials have urged vigilance about its potential to evolve and spread more easily among humans. But this most recent death, experts say, is not an immediate cause for panic. “Tragic though this case in Cambodia is… this one case in itself does not signal the global situation has suddenly changed,” James Wood, head of the veterinary medicine department at England’s University of Cambridge, tells Sopheng Cheang and Grant Peck of the Associated Press (AP). Per the WHO, the virus does not infect humans easily, and human-to-human transmission remains rare. It’s still unclear whether the Cambodian cases were spread from one person to another or from both the father and daughter having separate contact with infected birds, reports Nicola Davis for the Guardian. Over the past 20 years, almost 900 people have been infected worldwide with H5N1. Of those, about 460 have died—a case fatality rate of around 50 percent. However, the death rate may appear higher than it truly is, because not all those who contracted the disease may have been tested or shown symptoms, Wendy Barclay, a respiratory virus expert at Imperial College London, tells New Scientist’s Clare Wilson. “Right now… the good news is the virus appears to be very poor at infecting human cells,” Scott Hensley, a microbiologist from the Penn Institute for Immunology, tells PBS News’ William Brangham and Courtney Norris. “But we start to get nervous when we see these essential crossover events, when these avian viruses are getting into other animals.” While there is currently no treatment for avian flu in birds, infections are so widespread that experts are exploring poultry vaccination options, writes Apoorva Mandavilli and Emily Anthes for the New York Times. The H5N1 variant that infected the father in Cambodia is endemic to the country and not related to those infecting birds in the U.S. and Europe, per the Times—and around 30 variants of H5N1 are thought to be circulating in birds, per New Scientist. “I don’t really think that we should panic at the moment,” Shayan Sharif, an avian immunologist at the University of Guelph in Canada, tells the Times. But “as we see all of these various different bits and pieces of the puzzle coming together… I believe we need to get really, seriously ready for an emergency.” Get the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.

Innovators & Disruptors Economy 4.0 MoneyWatch Managing Your Money Your Taxes Retirement Watch CBS News MoneyWatch FDA authorizes first at-home test for both COVID and the flu By Megan Cerullo Edited By Anne Marie Lee, Alain Sherter Updated on: March 2, 2023 / 10:34 AM EST / MoneyWatch Doctors seeing more respiratory illnesses Doctors see cases of mystery respiratory illnesses as flu, COVID-19 and RSV infections rise 04:59 Sick and wondering if you may have either COVID-19 or the flu? A new test cleared for use by the Food and Drug Administration promises to tell you just that. The Lucira COVID-19 & Flu Home Test is available over the counter and delivers results from a self-collected sample in roughly 30 minutes. The new test differentiates between COVID and the flu and indicates if a user is positive or negative for either of the viruses based on a nasal swab. It is the first such test to receive an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA."Today's authorization of the first OTC test that can detect Influenza A and B, along with SARS-CoV-2, is a major milestone in bringing greater consumer access to diagnostic tests that can be performed entirely at home," said Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, in a statement. The agency added that it is committed to expanding the availability of at-home tests that can detect contagious respiratory viruses. Influenza A, B and COVID-19The single-use diagnostic test from Lucira is designed for people with respiratory viral infection symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or the flu, and is suitable for anyone two years of age or older, according to the company. The test works similarly to other kits approved for detecting COVID-19. Test users swirl the sample swab in a vial, which then goes in a test unit. The device delivers results indicating whether a person is positive or negative for influenza A, influenza B or COVID-19. According to the EUA, it correctly correctly identified 99.3% of negative and 90.1% of positive flu A samples; 99.9% of negative flu B samples; and 100% of negative and 88.3% of positive COVID-19 samples. Without a diagnostic test, COVID-19 and the flu can easily be mistaken for one another. "COVID-19 and flu look the same, feel the same, spread the same and, unfortunately, can still kill the same," said Dr. Davey Smith, head of infectious disease at the University of California – San Diego in a statement announcing the FDA's approval of the Lucira test kit. "Having an at-home molecular test now available should really help people know how to keep their families safe and seek appropriate treatment when they're ill." Despite getting clearance from the FDA for its product, Lucira has struggled financially and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection only days before the agency authorized the test kit. That raises questions if the test will ever be widely available to consumers. For now, the kit is available for sale on Lucira's website for $99.Lucira CEO Erik Engelson said in a statement that the company is seeking a potential strategic or financial partner to resume manufacturing and development of the product.

Image by Katrin B. from Pixabay.Image by Katrin B. from PixabayBy Deron Dalton | ddalton@pennlive.comCanine influenza, a transmissible respiratory disease seen in dogs, reportedly has been spreading across the U.S. including in Pa. Here’s what pet owners need to know.In particular, this winter cases of dog flu have been rising in Philadelphia, according to Philly Voice. Other areas in the U.S. like North Texas and Minneapolis have also seen an increase in the virus.The news outlet reported that a strong possible reason for the uptick in dog flu cases in Pa. may be because many dogs weren’t vaccinated against the virus. Dog flu is much more common in southern regions of the U.S.Dr. Amber Karwacki, a partner veterinarian at Callowhill Heart + Paw, confirmed there weren’t many cases of the dog flu in Philly before this winter.“We weren’t seeing cases up here, so we weren’t readily vaccinating dogs for it,” Karwacki said via Philly Voice. “So I think the biggest reason for the spike is no one up here has really been vaccinated for it, so it’s spreading like wildfire.”Heart + Paw posted information about canine influenza and tips on how to protect your dogs on Instagram. The vast majority of canine influenza cases are not life-threatening and usually resolve in 2-3 weeks. Some cases can develop secondary bacterial infections and result in more severe cases or even develop into pneumonia. The most common symptoms of canine influenza are cough, runny nose, fever, and decreased appetite and activity. If you observe these symptoms, please reach out to us about whether your pet should be seen. There is a vaccine for canine influenza, however, there are currently shortages as a result of the outbreak. Here’s what you can do to help: 🦠 If your pet is not vaccinated for canine influenza and has been boarded in the area please let us know and be extra vigilant for symptoms. 🦠 Be cautious about going to dog parks or being around other dogs at this time. 🦠 Consider having your dog vaccinated for canine influenza. Please contact us for vaccine availability. 🦠 If your dog has any of the above symptoms prior to your appointment, please give us a quick call so we can prepare to limit any potential contamination on your arrival. Symptoms of the dog flu include coughing, fever, runny nose and eyes, sluggish behavior and sneezing. Dogs may also experience changes in eating habits.Though no matter how mild or severe the symptoms Karwacki suggests pet owners should still be safe and call their veterinarian.“If it’s mild, definitely call your vet,” Karwacki added. “If it’s mild, your vet might just have you stay home and monitor or they might bring you in.”RECOMMENDED•pennlive.comCDC calls for expanded bird flu testing after blood tests reveal more human infectionsNov. 7, 2024, 3:00 p.m.Kirk Herbstreit shares heartbreaking news that has fans sending prayersNov. 8, 2024, 5:00 a.m.Read more via Philly Voice.READ MORE:Cruise ship witnesses gathering of 1,000 whales: reportAfrican lion at Lake Tobias dies of cancer: ‘She will be tremendously missed’Pigeon named Flamingo dies after someone dyes the bird pink: reportPa. man, woman face charges after being accused of neglecting dog: reportWoodpeckers leave 700 pounds of acorns in walls of home: reportPolice dog accused of stealing officer’s lunch; his mugshot goes viral: reportIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Are humans next?Save 40% when you subscribe to BBC Science Focus Magazine!Dr Jeremy RossmanPublished: February 27, 2023 at 4:00 pmIn the midst of the still ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we now have another virus to worry about, the H5N1 influenza virus which has just caused one fatality and several cases in Cambodia. What is the H5N1 virus? We are all familiar with the flu virus, this is the same virus that causes typically mild illness during the winter months, with the most common versions we normally encounter being the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes. Subtypes for the flu are somewhat similar to the different variants of SARS-CoV-2; when a new variant or subtype starts spreading, chances are that previous vaccination or infection will no longer be as protective. The same is true for flu, previous infection or vaccination with an H3N2 subtype will likely not offer much protection against infection with an H5N1 subtype. However, the H5N1 flu virus is quite different from the types of flu we normally think of. First, these viruses usually spreads between birds, where it is often lethal, giving them the name Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses (HPAI), which includes H5N1 and other similar flu subtypes. Outbreaks of these viruses can have devastating effects on both wild and farmed bird flocks. Thankfully though, the H5N1 virus doesn’t spread to people very easily and even then, further person-to-person transmission is quite rare. How dangerous is it? In the 26 years since the H5N1 flu virus first emerged, there have only been 868 cases of human infection. However, the concerning part is that of these 868 cases, 457 have died, giving an estimated case fatality rate of 53 per cent, which makes the H5N1 virus one of the most lethal that we know. The critical concern here is that in recent years, H5N1 and other HPAI viruses have been spreading around the world, with repeated outbreaks in many countries, including the UK, which recently saw its first human case of H5N1 infection. The more cases of bird flu that we have in any region, the more chances that it will spread to people or other animals. In 2022, the virus jumped from birds to farmed minks in Spain. There the virus caused severe illness in the minks, but also began to spread from animal to animal, something that hadn’t been seen before and may have been facilitated by the close confines the farmed animals are kept in. The flu virus evolves quickly and so there were fears that rapid evolution of the virus in minks would result in a virus that could easily infect people. Thankfully, this didn’t happen, but we are seeing more and more cases of mammals infected with H5N1, from seals to bears, with some of these infections showing evidence of mutations that enable better growth and transmission in mammals. Can H5N1 infect humans? With the growing number of H5N1 outbreaks in birds, and the large scale of the farmed animal industry, there are more and more chances for adaptive mutations to occur, raising the possibility of a human-transmissible H5N1 virus emerging. If a human-transmissible version of H5N1 does emerge, there is a good chance that it would rapidly spread, as most people have no immunity to this subtype of flu, which could potentially result in a new pandemic. The big unknown though, is that if this H5N1 pandemic did arise, would the virus still be as lethal? A pandemic of H5N1 with a 53 per cent fatality rate would be unimaginable; however, some studies have suggested that when the virus switches hosts and adapts to mammals the lethality drops down significantly. This is a glimmer of hope, but as we’ve seen over the past years, it is impossible to predict exactly what a virus will do or how it will evolve in nature. The good news is that this evolution to a human-transmissible version of H5N1 is not a sure thing. We’ve been tracking these viruses since 1996 and despite many chances, the virus has never made this jump. Even with the significant increase in avian H5N1 outbreaks in recent years, the number of human cases has remained very low. It’s very possible it will never happen, that the virus is too well adapted to birds and that limits its ability to infect people. How can we stop it spreading? However, hope is not a strategy to control the spread of an infectious disease. As such, we have a robust H5N1 monitoring network and many governments around the world respond rapidly to any outbreaks of bird flu, in order to minimise the chances for human spread. In addition, we have two antivirals that would likely offer some benefit against H5N1 infection and there are several licensed H5N1 vaccines. Unfortunately, just like with SARS-CoV-2, the virus keeps evolving and so our existing H5N1 vaccines may not offer robust protection against the current versions of H5N1, though studies suggest they may still work very well and they also give us a very good starting point for making updated versions of the vaccines. An additional wild-card in the emerging H5N1 situation is the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We know that even mild cases of SARS-CoV-2 can cause immune alterations that persist after resolution of the acute infection. We do not know how, and if, this altered immunity would affect human H5N1 infections or transmission, but it is an additional aspect that needs continual monitoring. At present, the situation poses very little threat for most people, but the situation needs careful monitoring and preparation, as it could change at any time with dire consequences.

Symptoms of the illness are: high-grade fever, joint pain, cough and weakness, which can last for up to two weeks. They have tracked the rise in the cases since over a month Mumbai: Kandivali-based fashion designer Kanchan Racharla, 29, has just recovered from high-grade fever, body ache and cold. She picked up the infection from her four-and-a-half-year-old daughter who had suffered similarly. Soon, her husband and her parents also took ill. “The fever was as high as 102-103 and the body ache was so bad that I couldn’t get up from the bed,” she said. The Racharlas were prescribed oseltamivir – an antiviral medication for influenza, which had them back on their feet in four days. Illustration of Influenza Virus H1N1. Swine Flu.

What Cambodia found following 2 cases Doctors say that the city is rife with people showing similar symptoms and testing positive for H3N2 -- a sub-type of Influenza A virus. Symptoms of the illness are: high-grade fever, joint pain, cough and weakness, which can last for up to two weeks. They have tracked the rise in the cases since over a month. Dr Shalmali Inamdar, internal medicine specialist at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital-Andheri said, lately the hospital’s outdoor patients department (OPD) has been observing a rush of H3N2 cases. “Of the five cases we see every day, four are H3N2 and one H1N1. The patients come with severe myalgia, which is a lot of body pain, muscle pain, headache along with runny nose. Previously, we used to get to get a lot of upper respiratory tract symptoms like running nose and cough but no body ache,” she said. Blame it on bad air While Influenza A is typically self-limiting and does not require hospitalisation, doctors warn that rising pollution levels and temperature fluctuations may be exacerbating the illness, prolonging the recovery period and leading to repeated episodes of cough and cold. “Most patients don’t need hospitalisation but we had two patients last week -- a 45-year-old man, with no comorbidity, and a 58-year-old woman – who had to be admitted. The man had a persistent high-grade fever which did not settle down with OPD treatment. Alongside, he had cough and landed with allergic bronchitis. We had to start him on injectable medicines along with nebulisation,” said Dr Neeraj Tulara - Infectious Disease Specialist at L H Hiranandani Hospital, Powai. He said the woman too had no comorbidity but had two episodes of unconsciousness due to high-grade fever and dehydration and hence was hospitalised. “We are seeing almost more than 50-70 patients daily in hospitals with similar symptoms. Apart from the regular symptoms, many also have gastrointestinal problems, such as loose motions and nausea,” said Dr Tulara. Dr Harshad Limaye, senior consultant, Infectious Diseases, Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital, has been seeing approximately 12-15 patients between 25 to 50 years daily. He observed that the spread of infection is also causing anxiety among people, as some symptoms overlap with those of Covid-19. “People are seeking immediate medical care driven by fear. However, there is no reason for panic as almost all patients are recovering within three to four days with Tamiflu treatment. To prevent the spread of the flu, it is important to continue wearing triple-layer surgical masks and maintaining good hand hygiene,” said Dr Limaye.

Dr Behzad Bhandari, Consultant Internal Medicine, SRCC Hospital-Haji Ali, said, “Almost 70 per cent are coming to the OPD suffering from cold, fever, breathing issues, throat pain, cough and even loose motions and vomiting. Several have tested positive for influenza, while many remain undiagnosed viral infections,” he said. Dr Bhandari has also blamed the rising pollution levels and fluctuations in temperature levels taking a toll on the immune system of children and adults. “Wearing a mask is a preventive measure, especially when going to crowded places to avoid influenza risk,” he concluded.

Experts have advised various precautionary measures while citing immunity-boosting methods to help people stay healthy. Besides low immunity, health experts have blamed the unpopularity of annual flu shots in the country for causing this sudden spike in influenza. Dr Akshay Budhraja, Senior Consultant, Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Aakash Healthcare stated that post-flu prolonged cough has been quite prevalent in a lot of influenza patients. advertisement"A majority of patients are getting infected with flu-causing viruses, like influenza, RSV, adenovirus, rhinovirus etc. Post-viral cough is a well-known entity in all these cases. A secondary bacterial throat infection usually occurs after getting flu, which needs more care and treatment," said Dr Akshay Budhraja. ALSO READ | Adenovirus spike in West Bengal: What are its symptoms and treatment?Dr GC Khilnani, Chairman, PSRI Insitute of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, said, "We have witnessed a rampant spread of flu (influenza infection) during the last two months. Every other person is down with fever, cough, loss of voice and breathlessness. Uncontrollable cough is a frequent symptom (with or without wheezing)."The probable reasons for prolonged coughing are air pollution hampering respiratory immunity, new mutant pathogens which need research, post-nasal drip, allergic airway, reflux diseases (acidity), and irrational use of antibiotics. The expert cautioned people from consuming antibiotics which, many times, do not work. "H3N2 influenza should not be confused with H1N1 (Swine flu), which is a potentially lethal infection. However, those above the age of 75 and those with compromised immunity due to comorbidities may have severe disease, especially due to secondary bacterial infection," said Dr Khilnani.ALSO READ | Indian researchers find new way to stop Covid-19According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the West experienced influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, A (H3N2), and influenza B viruses circulating in several countries between September and January. WHAT IS INFLUENZA B VIRUS? Influenza is caused by flu viruses and is of three main types - A, B and C. Influenza B virus can easily spread from human to human. It is milder than the influenza A virus. The common indicator for the influenza virus is fever, often more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit. It causes seasonal outbreaks annually. Fever, sore throat, runny nose and fatigue are common symptoms of influenza B virus. (Photo courtesy: Getty Images) WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF INFLUENZA B VIRUS? Fever Chills Sore throat Coughing Runny nose and sneezing Fatigue Muscle and body aches TREATMENT FOR INFLUENZA B VIRUS"The best way to avoid getting the flu is by avoiding crowded places, practising good hand and respiratory hygiene, annual flu shots, keeping indoor air quality under control, wearing a pollution mask when outdoors and avoiding home remedies without consultation," as per Dr Khilnani.According to Dr Nikhil Modi, Senior Consultant, Respiratory Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi, people should wear a mask to protect themselves from the influenza virus as it is transmitted via cough and sneezing."Home remedies like steam and saline gargling should be started. Contact your doctor immediately so that the symptoms can be controlled when they are mild. It is also important that you build your immunity," said Dr Modi.

The H3N2 causes more hospitalisations than other subtypes, said ICMR scientists who keep a close watch on ailments caused by respiratory viruses through the Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratories network. NEW DELHI: A persistent cough, sometimes accompanied by fever, running through India for the past two-three months is due to Influenza A subtype H3N2, ICMR experts said.The H3N2, which has been in wide circulation for the past two-three months, causes more hospitalisations than other subtypes, said Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) scientists who keep a close watch on ailments caused by respiratory viruses through the Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratories network.They have also suggested a list of Dos and Don'ts for people to follow to protect themselves from contracting the virus.The Indian Medical Association (IMA), on the other hand, has advised against indiscriminate use of antibiotics amid rising cases of cough, cold and nausea across the country.Seasonal fever will last five to seven days, it said.The fever goes away at the end of three days but the cough can persist for up to three weeks, the IMA's Standing Committee for Anti-Microbial Resistance said.Viral cases have also surged due to air pollution, it said, adding that it mostly occurs in people aged below 15 and above 50 and causes upper respiratory infections along with fever.The association also asked doctors to prescribe only symptomatic treatment and not antibiotics."Right now, people start taking antibiotics like Azithromycin and Amoxiclav etc, that too without caring for done and frequency and stop it once start feeling better. This needs to be stopped as it leads to antibiotic resistance. Whenever there will be a real use of antibiotics, they will not work due to the resistance," the IMA said in a statement.The most misused antibiotics are Amoxicillin, Norfloxacin, Oprofloxacin, Ofloxacin and Levofloxacin. These are being used for the treatment of diarrhoea and UTI, it said."We have already seen widespread use of Azithromycin and Ivermectin during Covid and this too has led to resistance. It is necessary to diagnose whether the infection is bacterial or not before prescribing antibiotics," it said.

(ANTARA/HO-Sutterstock/FR) Jakarta (ANTARA) - The risk of avian influenza or H5N1 infection in humans is still categorized as low, head of the public communication and services bureau of the Health Ministry, Siti Nadia Tarmizi, said here on Tuesday. "There has not been any human-to-human transmission incident. It only occurs toward ducks," she confirmed. Avian influenza is a communicable disease in poultry and is caused by the type A influenza virus, which is known to infect a variety of animal species, including pigs, horses, sea mammals, and humans. "The H5N1 virus is categorized as a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)," she informed. "Since 2020 to this day, there have been six human Influenza A (H5N1) cases, which have been included in clade 2.3.4.4b reported to the WHO (World Health Organization),” she added. One death from the infection was reported in China, while one patient with severe symptoms recovered in Vietnam. Then, two cases were reported in Spain while England and North Ireland recorded one case each, and the United States registered one case. "The cases from Europe and the United States have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic," she said. Related news: China reports first two human fatalities from bird flu this winter She highlighted that there has been an increase in infection transmission from wild birds to several mammal species in various countries in Europe and North America. "This may come as a result of the high virus prevalence among the poultry population in the region," she explained. All cases of poultry infection through direct contact in 2023 have been reported to be H5N1, including one death in Cambodia based on a report received by the Health Ministry from local authorities in February 2023. In addition, one H5N1-positive case has been recorded in Ecuador, as reported on the website WHO Outbreak News in January 2023. "In 2022, in Indonesia, there has been a 2.3.4.4b H5N1 HPAI case in waterfowl or livestock that had not been vaccinated in South Kalimantan," Tarmizi informed. Evidence of avian influenza mutation related to an adaptation in mammals and humans is still very limited, she said.

Murphy) Advertisment17 Share Tweet A woman in eastern China has tested positive for H5N1 bird flu, the strain of avian influenza which has spread around the world and worried experts. The news comes just a week after two people in Cambodia were infected with a similar variant. The latest case is a 53-year-old woman from Jiangsu province in eastern China, according to WHO. She developed symptoms on January 31 after exposure to poultry and tested positive some time in February. She was last reported in serious condition. Last week, an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia died of H5N1 avian influenza after ducks and chickens at her home died suddenly. Her father, a 49-year-old man, tested positive a few days later but did not become seriously ill. Genetic sequencing carried out in China showed that the new case was caused by clade 2.3.4.4b, the same variant which has spread around the world and raised concern about a possible threat to human health. This sets it apart from the cases in Cambodia, which were caused by clade 2.3.2.1c, an older variant. Article continues below the player Other details about the new case have not been released. The new variant of H5N1, which emerged in late 2021, has caused outbreaks around the world, even in countries where bird flu had never been found. Since then, more than 200 million birds have either died or been culled, most of them in Europe and the U.S. The global spread of bird flu has raised concern about the possibility of a future variant which could lead to human-to-human transmission. Recent cases in mammals – including in mink, foxes and sea lions – have added to those concerns. “The global H5N1 situation is worrying given the wide spread of the virus in birds around the world and the increasing reports of cases in mammals, including in humans,” Dr. Sylvie Briand, a WHO official, said on Friday. “WHO takes the risk from this virus seriously and urges heightened vigilance from all countries.” The World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) echoed those concerns. “The current situation highlights the risk that H5N1 avian influenza may become better adapted to mammals and spill over to humans and other animals,” the agency said on February 13. “Some animals, such as mink, may act as mixing vessels for different influenza viruses, leading to the emergence of new strains and subtypes that could be more harmful to animals and/or humans.” Advertisment1 A 9-year-old girl in Ecuador tested positive for H5N1 bird flu in January, making it the first such case in South America. She was hospitalized in critical condition but has since recovered. In September 2022, a 38-year-old woman died of H5N1 in China’s Guangxi after exposure to backyard poultry.

Written by Sushmita Panda March 3, 2023 13:12 IST Follow Us Seasonal Influenza (Flu) Symptoms, precautions & treatment: The most effective way to prevent the disease is vaccination. (Image Credits: Pixabay) Flu outbreak in India: with symptoms like nagging and persistent cough, India is currently engulfed in a wave of flu. People across the country are suffering from a long cough that lasts for days and sometimes weeks. According to doctors, the current flu is because of influenza A (H3N2). The doctors told Financial Express.com that there has been a significant rise in influenza infections. Currently, every other person across the country is down with fever, cough, loss of voice, and breathlessness. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the surge in flu cases in the country the spike in flu cases in the country is similar to the surge in the West between September and January.Also Read Campus conundrum: Balancing degrees and job-readiness amid unrelenting pressure EXPLAINER | Why south India wants big families EXPLAINER | Why doctors want changes in the anti-sex detection law BrandWagon Explainer: What is retention marketing? “Doctors at Primus Hospitals in New Delhi are seeing an increase in instances of seasonal diseases, including viral infections like H3N2 influenza and other seasonal infections, as a result of the rapid shift in weather from cold to warmer temperatures. It is no secret that weather has a significant influence on overall health. Throughout the winter, as the number of cardiovascular illnesses grows, the number of viral infections climbs as well. When winter fades and summer arrives earlier, the number of patients reporting viral fever, cold and cough, and severe throat infections is fast growing,” Prof Dr. SK Chhabra, Head of Department -Pulmonary, Sleep and Critical Care Medicine, Primus Hospital, Chanakyapuri, New Delhi told Financial Express.com. A study published in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) last month revealed that the surge was caused by low immunity among people and a decline in flu vaccination. “Influenza virus infections declined globally during the Covid-19 pandemic. Loss of natural immunity from lower rates of influenza infection and documented antigenic changes in circulating viruses may have resulted in increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection during the 2021-2022 influenza season,” the report stated. The influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses occurred in a number of nations, as per WHO. In India, influenza vaccines or flu shots are supposed to be taken every year never gained popularity. Also ReadShigella bacteria outbreak in US raises concern; Here’s all you need to know about drug-resistant superbug According to WHO, there are four types of seasonal influenza viruses, types A, B, C, and D. Influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics of disease. The Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) maintains that influenza cases in India usually peak during monsoon season, June to September with secondary peaks during winter. According to ICMR figures, H3N2, a sub-type of the influenza virus, is in wide circulation for the last two-three months—slightly more than the swine flu virus. “There are a lot of patients coming with post-flu prolonged cough. Majority of patients are getting infected with flu causing virus like influenza, RSV, adenovirus, rhinovirus etc. Post viral cough is a well known entity. A secondary bacterial throat infection usually occurs after getting flu which needs more care and treatment. The probable reasons for prolonged cough are air pollution hampering respiratory immunity, new mutant pathogens which need research, post nasal drip, allergic airway, reflux diseases (acidity), irrational use of antibiotics etc.,” Dr Akshay Budhraja, Senior Consultant, Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Aakash Healthcare told Financial Express.com. In the last one month of 31 January, more than 451 cases and nine deaths have been reported, as per media reports. “The current flu is caused by Influenza A from H3N2 strain. The patient suffers with high grade fever for 4 to 5 days along with sore throat for 7 to 10 days. This is often followed by productive cough producing sputum which last for 2-3 weeks. In these cases the patient has to be given either inhalation or oral steroids to recover. It is a threat to elderly patients with co-morbid heart conditions if they suffer from this virus and could lead to heart failure,” Dr Samrat Shah, Consultant Internist at Bhatia Hospital Mumbai told Financial Express.com. Also ReadBird Flu in Cambodia: WHO raises concern over Avian flu cases; Warns more to come What are the Symptoms? According to doctors, flu signs and symptoms usually come on suddenly. People who are affected with flu experience the following symptoms: FeverUncontrollable coughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseMuscle or body achesHeadachesand fatigue among others. Which Age Group Is Most At Risk? According to doctors, school-going children are at the most risk as they have resumed going to school. Those above 60 years with co-morbidities like COPD, diabetes, asthma and heart disease are also very vulnerable. “The increase in the number of patients complaining of viral infections and chest congestion demonstrates how seasonal change is having a negative influence on people’s health. Pollution is also playing a significant influence in increasing the number of patients affected by viral diseases. The elderly, children and pregnant women are the most vulnerable to infection. As a result, they must exercise extreme caution while walking outside. Apart from asthmatic patients, there are many additional individuals who have serious lung infections and are having difficulties breathing,” Prof. Dr. Chhabra told Financial Express.com. Dr. Chhabra also maintained that patients are experiencing similar issues as a result of climate change. “Individuals with chronic illnesses, such as asthma, must exercise special caution during such weather shifts since they might provoke severe respiratory difficulties and asthma episodes. At this period, even small respiratory problems must be reported to a pulmonologist or a physician to avoid the condition from worsening,” he added. Diagnosis According to WHO, the majority of cases of human influenza are clinically diagnosed. “Laboratory confirmation of influenza virus from throat, nasal and nasopharyngeal secretions or tracheal aspirate or washings is commonly performed using direct antigen detection, virus isolation, or detection of influenza-specific RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),” the global health agency stated. Treatment WHO has outlined the following guidelines for influenza infection: Patients that are not from a high risk group should be managed with symptomatic treatment and are advised, if symptomatic, to stay home in order to minimize the risk of infecting others in the community. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms of influenza such as fever. Patients should monitor themselves to detect if their condition deteriorates and seek medical attention Patients that are known to be in a group at high risk for developing severe or complicated illness, should be treated with antivirals in addition to symptomatic treatment as soon as possible. Patients with severe or progressive clinical illness associated with suspected or confirmed influenza virus infection should be treated with antiviral drug as soon as possible. Treatment is recommended for a minimum of 5 days, but can be extended until there is satisfactory clinical improvement. How To Prevent Influenza Infection? According to Dr. Budhraja, the best way to avoid getting flu is by avoiding crowded places, practice good hand and respiratory hygeine, annual flu shot, keeping indoor air quality under control, wearing a pollution mask when outdoors and avoiding home remedies without consultation. The most effective way to prevent the disease is vaccination. Injected inactivated influenza vaccines are most commonly used throughout the world.Among healthy adults, influenza vaccine provides protection, even when circulating viruses do not exactly match the vaccine viruses.Regular hand washing with proper drying of the handsGood respiratory hygiene – covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, using tissues and disposing of them correctlyEarly self-isolation of those feeling unwell, feverish and having other symptoms of influenzaAvoiding close contact with sick peopleAvoiding touching one’s eyes, nose or mouth WHO recommends annual vaccination for: pregnant women at any stage of pregnancychildren aged between 6 months to 5 yearselderly individuals (aged more than 65 years)individuals with chronic medical conditionshealth-care workers.

Bird flu outbreak underscores need for early detection to prevent the next big pandemicActive monitoring of wild animals, farm animals and humans will allow health officials to detect the first sign of spillover and help prevent a small viral splash from turning into a large outbreakTreana MayerPublished on: 26 Feb 2023, 3:28 amCopiedThe current epidemic of avian influenza has killed over 58 million birds in the US as of February 2023. Following on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic, large outbreaks of viruses like bird flu raise the spectre of another disease jumping from animals into humans. This process is called spillover.I’m a veterinarian and a researcher who studies how diseases spread between animals and people. I was on the Colorado State University veterinary diagnostic team that helped detect some of the earliest cases of H5N1 avian influenza in US birds in 2022. As this year’s outbreak of bird flu grows, people are understandably worried about spillover.Given that the next potential pandemic will likely originate from animals, it’s important to understand how and why spillover occurs — and what can be done to stop it. Viral spillover occurs when a virus spills out from an animal population into people. Treana Mayer/BioRender, CC BY-NDHow spillover worksSpillover involves any type of disease-causing pathogen, be it a virus, parasite or bacteria, jumping into humans. The pathogen can be something never before seen in people, such as a new Ebola virus carried by bats, or it could be something well known and recurring, like Salmonella from farm animals.The term spillover evokes images of a container of liquid overflowing, and this image is a great metaphor for how the process works.Imagine water being poured into a cup. If the water level keeps increasing, the water will flow over the rim, and anything nearby could get splashed. In viral spillover, the cup is an animal population, the water is a zoonotic disease capable of spreading from an animal to a person, and humans are the ones standing in the splash zone.The probability that a spillover will occur depends on many biological and social factors, including the rate and severity of animal infections, environmental pressure on the disease to evolve and the amount of close contact between infected animals and people. Epidemiologists estimate that three-quarters of all new infectious human diseases originated in animals. Valerie Macon/AFP via Getty ImagesWhy spillover mattersWhile not all animal viruses or other pathogens are capable of spilling over into people, up to three-quarters of all new human infectious diseases have originated from animals. There’s a good chance the next big pandemic risk will arise from spillover, and the more that’s known about how spillovers occur, the better chance there is at preventing it.Most spillover research today is focused on learning about and preventing viruses — including coronaviruses, like the one that causes COVID-19 and certain viral lineages of avian influenza — from jumping into humans. These viruses mutate very quickly, and random changes in their genetic code could eventually allow them to infect humans.Spillover events can be hard to detect, flying under the radar without leading to bigger outbreaks. Sometimes a virus that transfers from animals to humans poses no risk to people if the virus is not well adapted to human biology. But the more often this jump occurs, the higher the chances a dangerous pathogen will adapt and take off.Spillover is becoming more likelyEpidemiologists are projecting that the risk of spillover from wildlife into humans will increase in coming years, in large part because of the destruction of nature and encroachment of humans into previously wild places.Because of habitat loss, climate change and changes in land use, humanity is collectively jostling the table that is holding up that cup of water. With less stability, spillover becomes more likely as animals are stressed, crowded and on the move. As housing and farmland expand into wild places, the risk of spillover increases. Cavan/Getty Images As development expands into new habitats, wild animals come into closer contact with people — and, importantly, the food supply. The mixing of wildlife and farm animals greatly amplifies the risk that a disease will jump species and spread like wildfire among farm animals. Poultry across the US are experiencing this now, thanks to a new form of avian flu that experts think spread to chicken farms mostly through migrating ducks.Current risk from bird fluThe new avian influenza virus is a distant descendant of the original H5N1 strain that has caused human epidemics of bird flu in the past. Health officials are detecting cases of this new flu virus jumping from birds to other mammals — like foxes, skunks and bears.On Feb. 23, 2023, news outlets began reporting a few confirmed infections of people in Cambodia, including one infection leading to the death of an 11-year-old girl. While this new strain of bird flu can infect people in rare situations, it isn’t very good at doing so, because it is not able to bind to cells in human respiratory tracts very effectively. For now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention thinks there is low risk to the general public.Active monitoring of wild animals, farm animals and humans will allow health officials to detect the first sign of spillover and help prevent a small viral splash from turning into a large outbreak. Moving forward, researchers and policymakers can take steps to prevent spillover events by preserving nature, keeping wildlife wild and separate from livestock and improving early detection of novel infections in people and animals.Treana Mayer, Postdoctoral Fellow in Microbiology, Colorado State UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

It can also indicate a fever, cough, sore throat, tiredness, bodily aches, and, in rare situations, nausea and vomiting.Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementIndia Today Information DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Mar 2, 2023 14:49 ISTThe recent Instagram post by prominent television actress Debina Bonnerjee has sparked widespread concern about the Influenza B virus. The actress discussed the condition on her social media handle. She is married to Gurmeet Choudhary, who works in the same industry. According to the reports, they both went on a vacation to Sri Lanka. Debina developed symptoms of a cold after returning from her trip, which was subsequently proved to be the Influenza B virus.advertisementWHAT IS INFLUENZA B?The influenza B virus is an Orthomyxoviridae family of RNA viruses. The description appears to be a little confusing. It is a disease that causes flu-like symptoms in people. It can also indicate a fever, cough, sore throat, tiredness, bodily aches, and, in rare situations, nausea and vomiting.The influenza B virus is less frequent than the influenza A virus, yet it nevertheless circulates widely and can produce seasonal flu outbreaks. Because the influenza B virus mutates often, new strains of the virus can develop and create epidemics. Vaccines are available to help prevent such infections. And antiviral drugs can be used to treat sick individuals.INFLUENZA B: SYMPTOMSEarly detection of influenza can help you choose the best treatment options and stop the transmission of the virus. Fever and aches are among the most prevalent symptoms of the influenza B virus. Clinical signs usually involve stomach ache, coughing, sneezing and running nose, tiredness, body pains, and muscle pain. INFLUENZA B: TREATMENTAfter a disease diagnosis, medications are available to treat this virus. It will further provide aid in preventing the virus from reproducing. Thus, reducing the length of symptoms and the danger of consequences.Published By: Karan YadavPublished On: Mar 2, 2023--- ENDS ---READ | What is Adenovirus?

Later she had fallen ill a week earlier with a high fever, cough, and sore throat. Written by Satata Karmakar | Published : February 26, 2023 2:10 PM IST Bird Flu 2 Bird Flu Death Death Due To Bird Flu 1/5 Girl Dies Of Bird Flu In Cambodia A 11-year-old girl died of bird flu in Cambodia earlier this week. Taking cognizance of the worsening situation, the World Health Organisation has described the situation as "worrying", and has also asked nations to take proper precautions as cases of avian flu in increasing on a daily basis. Talking about the symptoms of bird flu as noted in the girl, the authorities said that she was diagnosed with the H5N1 virus on Wednesday. Later she had fallen ill a week earlier with a high fever, cough, and sore throat. The girl's father has also tested positive for the H5N1 virus. As per Cambodian authorities, this is the first known human infection of the H5N1 strain in Cambodia since 2014. 2/5 What Is Bird Flu? Avian influenza or bird flu is a severe health condition that is primarily caused by an infection triggered by avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. According to the experts, these viruses naturally spread among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. To date, it was rare that human cases of the virus were reported by any nation. However, right now the situation has changed, and even humans are catching the H5N1 virus. Scroll down to know more.

Amid rising cases, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has called Influenza A subtype H3N2 as the major cause of rising respiratory illness in India. According to the data given by ICMR, Pan respiratory virus surveillance has been established by ICMR/DHR across 30 VRDLs. The surveillance data from December 15 to date reflects the rise in the number of cases of influenza A H3N2. About half of all inpatient severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and outpatient influenza-like illnesses were found to have influenced A H3N2. Emphasising about the clinical features of Influenza A H3N2, ICMR has said that this subtype appears to cause more hospitalizations than other influenza subtypes. "Out of the hospitalised SARI patients with influenza A H3N2, about 92 per cent are suffering from fever, 86 per cent from cough, 27 per cent from breathlessness, 16 per cent with wheezing, and additionally, 16 per cent had clinical signs of pneumonia and 6 per cent has seizures. Also, 10 per cent of SARI patients who have H3N2 needed oxygen, and 7 per cent required ICU care," ICMR stated. ICMR has suggested people wash their hands regularly and avoid shaking hands and spitting in public. "The Dos include washing hands with soap and water. If symptomatic, wear masks and avoid crowded places, cover mouth and nose while sneezing and coughing, take plenty of fluids, avoid touching eyes and nose, and take paracetamol for fever and body ache," ICMR stated. Read: Seasonal flu: IMA advises doctors to avoid prescription of antibiotics to patients It further added, "The Don'ts include shaking hands or using other content greetings, spitting in public, taking antibiotics or other medicines without consulting a doctor, eating together sitting close to others." Notably, ANI was the first to report the prevalence of H3N2 in January. According to Dr Arjun Dang, CEO, Dr Dangs Lab, H3N2 influenza cases are being reported more in comparison to H1N1. He said, "In the past few weeks, we've gotten more than a few 100 tests out of which a lot of them are positive for H3N2. But it's interesting to see that we are getting less H1N1 positive."

Check symptoms, treatmentInfluenza A subtype H3N2 is responsible for large cases of fever and breathlessness in Delhi and its adjoining citiesThe Indian Medical Association has asked medical practitioners to stop prescribing antibiotics for the H3N2 flu treatment. LivemintUpdated4 Mar 2023, 12:00 PM ISTDelhi’s Lok Nayak Hospital (File photo)Delhi-NCR residents are reeling from prolonged fever and cough, breathing problems off late. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)'s latest report, the residents are not suffering from any casual fever but it is a virus that has gripped the larger population.IMA said Influenza A subtype H3N2 is responsible for large cases of fever and breathlessness in Delhi and its adjoining cities-Noida, Gurugram, and Faridabad.Concurrently, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has asked medical practitioners to stop prescribing antibiotics for the H3N2 flu treatment.The ICMR's surveillance data from December 15 to date reflects the rise in the number of cases of influenza A H3N2. About half of all inpatient severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and outpatient influenza-like illnesses were found to have influenced A H3N2.The ICMR stated the subtype appears to cause more hospitalizations than other influenza subtypes.Among the severe acute respiratory infection with influenza A H3N2, about 92% are suffering from fever, 86% from cough, 27% from breathlessness, 16% with wheezing, 16% showing signs of pneumonia, and 6% has seizures. Also, 7% of the patients required ICU care.Dr Suresh Kumar, Medical Superintendent of Lok Nayak Hospital told Live Hindustan (Mint's sister publication) that the H3N2 influenza has largely affected children below 5 years and people above 60 years. Besides, the virus is detrimental to diabetic patients and people reeling from lung-related diseases.H3N2 symptoms:As per the IMA, the key symptoms of the H3N2 virus are--cough, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, fever, body ache, and diarrhoea.Duration of H3N2 influenza:The infection usually lasts for about five to seven days. The fever goes away at the end of three days, but the cough can persist for up to three weeks.Dos and Don'ts to protect from the H3N2 virus:The ICMR has suggested people wash their hands regularly and avoid shaking hands and spitting in public.The "Dos" include washing hands with soap and water. If symptomatic, wear masks and avoid crowded places, cover mouth and nose while sneezing and coughing, take plenty of fluids, avoid touching eyes and nose, and take paracetamol for fever and body ache.While the "don'ts" include shaking hands or using other contact greetings, spitting in public, taking antibiotics or other medicines without consulting a doctor, eating together sitting close to others.Misuse of antibiotics:The IMA in its latest notification wrote, "Give only symptomatic treatment, no need to give antibiotics. But right now, people start taking antibiotics like Azithromycin and Amoxiclav etc, that too without caring for dose and frequency and stop it once start feeling better. This needs to be stopped as it leads to antibiotic resistance".The most misused antibiotics are amoxicillin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and levofloxacin. These are being used for diarrhoea and Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), Dr Sharad Kumar Agarwal National President, IMA said."It is necessary to diagnose whether the infection is bacterial or not before prescribing antibiotics," he added.Catch all the Business News , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Type-A influenza is highly contagious, causing disease to spread rapidly and causing pandemics. It has many strains, one of which is influenza-B. If you have had the influenza vaccine, it will not protect you from the new strain. Wild birds are natural hosts of Type-A virus, capable of causing epidemics. Type-B infection naturally infects only humans. It spreads more than type-A and is less commonly seen during flu season. Influenza-B strains mutate more slowly than influenza-A strains. Therefore, the probability of a pandemic spread due to influenza-B virus is very low. Influenza B virus: How are its symptoms? Severe symptoms due to flu can bother you, but it can also be like common cold at times. Cough, runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, sore throat, headache, fever, tiredness, shivering, and body aches are the main symptoms. This disease can spread from one person to another. This virus can infect your respiratory system. If your symptoms do not improve within a week, you must see a doctor. Also read: What is epilepsy? Know all about its symptoms and causes Influenza B virus: How is it treated? Your doctor may prescribe some anti-viral medicines for influenza-B. Due to which the symptoms of flu will be mild and you will get immediate relief. Also drink a lot of water and take more and more fluids. Influenza B virus: How can this virus be avoided? To avoid influenza-B virus, it is necessary to apply influenza vaccine once a year. This will protect you against many strains of influenza during flu season. Apart from this, do clean hands several times a day, stay away from crowds during flu season, cover your mouth while sneezing or coughing, and try to wear a mask.

Some pharmacies in Abu Dhabi are already offering the service, while new ones in different emirates are being added to the list. This comes after the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) last year opined that the initiative is in line with efforts to make healthcare services more accessible to all community members. Aster Pharmacy, the retail arm of Aster DM Healthcare, is taking a nascent step in this direction by offering in-store flu vaccinations. Their first stand-alone pharmacy vaccination programme will be launched at Aster Pharmacy 200, located at Al Nahda, Dubai. The organisation offers flu jabs in the initial rollout phase, and more preventive vaccines against infectious diseases will be added later. Who's eligible to take the in-stores vaccine? At present, the Aster vaccination programme will only cater to the adult population between the ages of 16-65 and won’t be available for children, pregnant women, the elderly or anyone who is vulnerable as they may have the need to consult a doctor before taking any shots. Shiraz Khan, Chief Operating Officer at Aster Retail says, “Now with pharmacies being so close to our customers there is a real opportunity to be able to offer these services. We will start with one and then we will be looking at rolling out to many more pharmacies. Specifically trained pharmacists who have undergone a particular training that the DHA have prescribed will be administering these vaccines. These people are trained and accredited by the DHA.” Shedding light on the costs he says, “The cost will vary from clinica because when you go to a clinic you may want to have a consultation with the doctor. With the pharmacy, that will not be needed. We will have three vaccines available from different brands and the price will vary One is priced at Dh55, the other one costs Dh60.50 and another one is available for Dh62.50. They are cheaper than ones administered in clinics. As we enhance the myAster App we are looking to add this service as well.” “We have specifically trained pharmacists and it’s always good to give them a call and check their availability, as at the moment, we don’t know how much demand we will have for this service. But there is no need to make an appointment per se,” he added. MoHAP earlier stated the decision of making the vaccine available at pharmacies has been taken to improve the ease of taking it, ultimately enhancing the immunisation rate of communities. MoHAP has also underlined that this will only be allowed subject to the adherence to certain guidelines stipulated by the country’s health authorities. Dr Hussain Abdul Rahman Al Rand, Assistant Undersecretary for the Public Health Sector earlier said, “We are doing this to make it easy for the public. People can just walk into the pharmacy and get the vaccine. Some people are busy throughout the day. So, they don't have time to go to a primary health care centre or the hospital, but they can easily go to the nearest pharmacy and ask for the vaccine. There will be charges according to each pharmacy. Each store will have to apply for the service because they need to be licensed by the concerned (health) authority.” Meanwhile, Life Pharmacy which already houses a clinic inside some of its pharmacies is administering the flu vaccine at a few of its locations. These include Life Clinic at Muraqabat Deira; Al Wasl Road Jumeirah 1; at White Swan building Sheikh Zayed road; Al Attar Tower Sheikh Zayed road; Concourse 1; Dubai World Trade Centre; Bluewaters; Dubai Marina and Discovery Gardens. Dubai Health Authority services Other than the newly added pharmacies, different clinics and various private hospitals in the emirate, residents in Dubai can get influenza shot at any of the health centres operated by the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) which mandates everyone to have an MRN number (Medical Record Number). Residents can also download the ‘DHA’ smartphone application to book an appointment. Other than this, residents can also call the DHA hotline oatn 800 DHA (342). The cost of the flu vaccine is Dh50, and it is administered free for people of determination (POD), residents who are above the age of 65 and people who suffer from chronic illnesses. Other categories that are exempted to pay the fees include pregnant women and children below five years of age. Abu Dhabi- Department of Health DoH also encourages members of the community to get vaccinated, as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza. The Department has been working closely with pharmacies in different areas of the Emirate to ensure the availability of vaccines in primary neighbourhoods. The pharmacies include Al Manara Pharmacy at YAS Mall, Al Thiqa Al Almyiah, Al Thiqa Al Dowaliah and different branches of Al Ain Pharmacy. Dr Farida Al Hosani the Executive Director of Infectious Disease Sector had said, “DOH adaptation of group of pharmacies to provide influenza vaccination service will extend receiving the vaccine on wider range.” ALSO READ: Flu season in UAE: How to avoid catching the viral infection UAE: Infections among children on the rise as rains bring sharp drop in temperatures, say doctors Not just vaccines, we need clean air to prevent another pandemic UAE: Hospitals see increase in patients after heavy rains UAE: School-going children frequently falling sick due to sudden weather changes, say doctors UAE UAE Nandini Sircar Nandini Sircar has a penchant for education, space, and women's narratives.
