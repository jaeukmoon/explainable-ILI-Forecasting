In particular, the B/Yamagata lineage has not been isolated from April 2020 to August 2021, suggesting that this influenza lineage may have become extinct, which may provide opportunities for improving availability and effectiveness of influenza vaccines. Infection with influenza B virus (IBV) accounts for around a quarter of the annual influenza burden. Influenza vaccine composition is reconsidered bi-annually to account for continuous antigenic drift in the haemagglutinin protein. The co-circulation of two antigenically distinct lineages of IBV, referred to as B/Victoria/2/1987 and B/Yamagata/16/1988 lineages (hereafter B/Victoria and B/Yamagata), has driven the development and application of a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV). With circulation of IBV only in humans and no established animal reservoir1, high vaccination coverage that induces broad immune protection provides a potential pathway to eradication of IBV. The considerable reductions of influenza circulation globally due to COVID-19 may have already precipitated the extinction of the B/Yamagata lineage.Global disappearance of B/Yamagata viruses during the COVID-19 pandemicInfluenza virus detections dropped dramatically from April 2020 (Fig. 1), with a ~99% reduction compared with previous years despite roughly similar levels of testing2. Behavioural changes (social distancing, mask wearing and hygiene measures) and travel and movement restrictions are thought to be the major factors driving the reduction in influenza incidence, which was also observed for other common respiratory infections such as respiratory syncytial virus3. The genetic diversity of influenza viruses has also dramatically diminished (Supplementary Fig. 1). The number of clades detected has fallen for both influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) subtypes, and, similarly, diversity has diminished for the B/Victoria lineage. Although most IBV cases are not routinely subtyped into the two lineages, only very few B/Yamagata cases (none with successful virus isolation or sequencing) have been reported globally in 2021 (31 cases in FluNet as of 27 July 2021; Supplementary Table 1), and, since March 2020, no B/Yamagata viruses have been isolated or sequenced.Fig. 1: Circulation of influenza viruses before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.Global influenza virus sequences from the GISAID database with collection dates from September 2019 to 6 August 2021 illustrate a reduction of influenza virus detection and potential extinction of B/Yamagata during the COVID-19 pandemic (shaded).Full size imageHas the B/Yamagata lineage gone for good, or merely gone into hiding? While the global dominance of the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages seems to alternate in recent years (Supplementary Fig. 2), IBV lineages have been known to periodically enter a state of ‘dormancy’ for long time intervals. For example, during the 1990s the B/Victoria lineage was mostly undetected globally, except for an outbreak in Asia, but subsequently dominated global IBV isolates in the early 2000s4.Epidemiology and evolution of B/Yamagata virusesThe stark reduction in global prevalence of B/Yamagata viruses compared with the other lineages may indicate an inherent vulnerability of this lineage. Indeed, B/Yamagata viruses have a lower effective reproductive number than B/Victoria viruses, and B/Yamagata epidemics have a slower initial growth phase with shorter transmission chains than B/Victoria epidemics5. This may make B/Yamagata more vulnerable to breakdowns in onward transmission, especially in the context of social distancing and movement restrictions. Furthermore, although multiple B/Yamagata clades can co-circulate for extended periods, previously long-lived clades went extinct6,7. Although the precise factors that drive B/Yamagata clades into extinction are unknown, the frequency of such extinctions suggests an intrinsic volatility in global B/Yamagata circulation. Lastly, as B/Victoria prevalence has been increasing since 2019, B/Yamagata may have already been at a low prevalence cycle at the beginning of the pandemic.The global circulation patterns of influenza viruses have been associated with age-specific patterns of infection, whereby infection of adults, who are more likely to travel than children, correlates with greater global spread8. School-aged children and adolescents are more frequently infected with B/Victoria viruses, whereas adults over the age of 25 years are more frequently infected with B/Yamagata viruses5,7. Consistently, in 2008–2019, B/Yamagata viruses demonstrated greater global movement than B/Victoria viruses7. The reduction in global mobility due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to low distribution and seeding of B/Yamagata. Overall, the temporal and intrinsic epidemiology of B/Yamagata viruses may have rendered them particularly vulnerable to this effect.From 2017, circulating B/Yamagata viruses have all been from a single lineage (clade 3A), whereas several lineages existed before. Although this clade has diversified at the genomic level, and even acquired amino acid substitution in haemagglutinin, these have not resulted in significant antigenic changes to necessitate updating the B/Yamagata vaccine component since 2015 (refs6,7). Therefore, although B/Yamagata viruses have continued to evolve genetically, they remain antigenically conserved in the haemagglutinin protein in recent years. Thus, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic coinciding with a period of low incidence and low antigenic diversity, coupled with prolonged use of a well-matched influenza vaccine, may have enabled massive suppression of B/Yamagata during the pandemic. However, as sampling and sequencing is not comprehensive, it is difficult to distinguish with certainty between lack of detection and true extinction.Implications for vaccinesThe potential extinction of one of the circulating seasonal IBV lineages creates a dilemma for the vaccine strain recommendation, with two possible alternative strategies. First, returning to vaccines with two IAV strains and a B/Victoria strain could increase the available doses for global distribution (from ~500 million QIV doses to ~700 million doses of a trivalent vaccine9). The second possibility is including two A(H3N2) candidate viruses in a QIV, as the divergence and co-circulation of A(H3N2) sub-clades often makes vaccine strain selection challenging. The inclusion of two A(H3N2) viruses should give greater antigenic coverage, in principle, although direct data for this are currently lacking and clinical trials would be needed with substantial cost. Furthermore, the inclusion of two A(H3N2) strains will be challenging with respect to the current registered potency assay, as the single radial immunodiffusion assay uses polyclonal sera, which may not distinguish between alternate A(H3N2) virus clades. Thus, alternative potency assays that use strain-specific reagents will be required.SummaryEpidemiological and evolutionary characteristics of B/Yamagata viruses, combined with suppressive conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, may have facilitated strong suppression of global B/Yamagata circulation and the potential extinction of this lineage. While time will tell whether the B/Yamagata lineage is gone for good, elimination of one of the four current vaccine targets would have favourable implications for annual influenza vaccine reformulation, with opportunities for rational rethinking of optimal strategies to further reduce global influenza burden.

There is also an 8-fold increase for strokes during the same week.3,4Â Influenza creates inflammation in the body, in the lungs and in the linings of blood vessels and other vital organs.5Â For this reason, the infection can cause other severe complications like pneumonia, cardiovascular events or diabetic crises. The oldest and frailest of the population can also suffer irreversible loss of general health, a phenomenon called âfunctional declineâ.6 Influenza vaccination can reduce the risk of heart attack by 15% to 45%, which is similar to the reductions estimated with high-cholesterol medications (19%-30%) or cutting out smoking (32%-43%).2 Dr. Tor Biering-SÃ¸rensen, MD, PhD, MPH, and Associate Professor in Health and Medical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen summed it up, âWe know today that influenza can cause cardiovascular complications, and an influenza vaccine can reduce the risk of these complications.â1,2 The impact of COVID-19 on flu In a normal year, before the pandemic, between ~ 50% and ~ 80% of adult populations in OECD countries got their annual flu shot each year.7Â Public health recommendations range by geography: in the US anyone can get the annual jab, and Europe prioritizes at-risk populations such as people with underlying conditions and most people in their 60s (and older). Influenza vaccination has gone a long way already in terms of reducing hospitalizations due to the flu and its complications, and thatâs been incredibly important as COVID-19 emerged.Â But we can and need to do more. âWe saw a strange epidemiological year in 2020-2021 where very little flu circulated, likely due to social distancing and mask wearing, and travel bans, all in anticipation of that first pandemic winter,â Bogdana said.Â The coming flu season remains unpredictable, with the question remaining-will there be a flu rebound? The situation is unique, and epidemiologists cannot predict with certainty what will happen.8 In the Northern Hemisphere, the influenza season ahead overlaps with the easing of many COVID-19 social restrictions and the back-to-school season, which could result in an increase in transmission of infection. Added to that, experts fear a lower level of population immunity against influenza due to last yearâs lockdowns and social distancing rules. The result could be an active flu season with more severe cases and a risk of increased burden on healthcare systems.Â Added Dr. Biering-SÃ¸rensen, âIn my view, itâs of the utmost importance to increase the vaccine uptake to reduce the burden of cardiovascular complications caused by influenza epidemics.âÂ âMost people who get their flu shot will be able to avoidÂ going to the hospital with influenza or an influenza-triggered heart attack this winter,â concluded Bogdana. âNow we need to maximize the number of people in that scenario. Itâs such an easy, proven, and cost-effective intervention to just get a vaccine, we need to make sure people are aware of the full extent of its benefits.â In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US CDC and several additional national health authorities in Europe have recommended co-administration of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines this fall to facilitate broad and timely vaccination against both infections.9,10 Sanofi offers several different kinds of influenza vaccines, which are broadly distributed and administered worldwide. Our standard-of-care quadrivalent vaccines help protect against all four main virus strain types that circulate each flu season and our high-dose vaccines are tailored for adults aged 65 and older.Â As unpredictable and potentially deadly infectious diseases like COVID-19 and influenza continue to evolve, our Sanofi scientists and medical experts continue to pursue better understanding of their transmission and harm to continually develop new vaccines to help prevent and control their impact.Â ShareExplore moreA Look Inside Influenza Vaccines: Today And TomorrowRead the articleProtecting Heart Health: Flu Vaccines and BeyondRead the articleMaking the flu vaccine: a race against the clockRead the articleReferences Kwong et al 2018 NEJM MacIntyre CR, et al.

Fortunately, there are a variety of flu vaccination options that are available to almost everyone, according to an expert at Baylor College of Medicine. “In the United States, it is recommended that everyone over the age of 6 months be vaccinated against the flu, and there are many vaccines available that will fit your need based on age and other important risk factors,” said Dr. Pedro Piedra, professor of molecular virology and microbiology and of pediatrics at Baylor. Last year’s flu season was one of the mildest we have ever seen, due to the public health measures such as masking and social distancing implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. But in many places, these guidelines have been lifted, and flu season could look quite different in 2021 – 2022. Here are some important things to keep in mind about the flu vaccine, according to Piedra: All the influenza vaccines (inactivated, recombinant and live attenuated) available in the United States during the 2021-22 flu season are quadrivalent. That means they contain four components to protect against the seasonal influenza viruses: influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), influenza B (Victoria lineage) and influenza B (Yamagata lineage). Children under 9 years of age who have never received the influenza vaccine should get two doses of the vaccine four weeks apart Those under 9 years of age who have received only once a single dose of a flu vaccine in the past should get two doses of the vaccine four weeks apart Because babies under 6 months of age cannot get the vaccine, it is recommended that everyone in the child’s household be vaccinated to protect the child Pregnant women should get the inactivated or recombinant vaccine (the flu shot) at any time during pregnancy to protect themselves and their unborn child. Antibodies transferred via the placenta from the vaccinated mother to the newborn infant will provide protection to the infant during the first six months of life. Breastfeeding also will provide a level of protection. It is recommended that adults over the age of 65 years get a high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccine. There also are vaccines that are not derived from eggs for those who have a history of a severe, life-threatening egg allergy. FluMist (live attenuated virus) Piedra, who also is with Texas Children’s Hospital, said that the availability of the FluMist will be beneficial for children, who are more likely to be fearful of shots. He also noted that the biggest protection benefit of the FluMist has been demonstrated in children. The FluMist is approved for those between the ages of 2 and 49 years who are healthy. FluMist is a live attenuated influenza virus vaccine and is not recommended for: Children taking aspirin or aspirin-containing medication Those who have a history of a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine or any of its components Those who have received influenza antiviral medication within 48 hours Women who are pregnant Those with a significant health condition such as immunodeficiency, moderate to severe asthma, etc. Those with other medical conditions should discuss with their physician if the live vaccine is recommended for them. Flu shot (inactivated and recombinant virus) There also are a number of inactivated flu vaccines available for individuals over the age of 6 months. The recombinant flu vaccine is available for adults 18 years of age and older. The only contraindication for inactivated and recombinant influenza vaccines is a history of a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine or any of its components. Piedra recommends consulting with your child’s pediatrician on which vaccine is best for them. In addition, anyone with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome within six weeks of receipt of an influenza vaccine should talk to their doctor. Take early action Piedra recommends getting vaccinated against influenza now and not waiting for the outbreak to begin. It takes about two weeks for the vaccine to be fully effective in adults and children who require one vaccine dose. However, for children who require two doses of the vaccine at least four weeks apart, it will take about six weeks to be fully effective. Adults who are eligible for a COVID-19 booster shot because of age, underlying medical condition, are at increased risk for COVID-19 infection because of the work environment or are getting the COVID-19 vaccine for the first time may consider getting it and the flu vaccine at the same time. The CDC recently updated its guidance to state that COVID-19 vaccines may be administered on the same day as other vaccines. If getting both at the same time, expect to receive one in each arm. While the vaccine is effective, some may still contract influenza. Piedra recommends discussing the need for an influenza antiviral strategy with your physician so that if there is breakthrough infection, you can get a prescription for antiviral medication quickly. Antiviral therapy is most effective when administered in the first 48 hours of symptom onset. “The flu season is unpredictable every year, but the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones is to get vaccinated,” Piedra said.

Getting the shots, which were prescribed for all faculty members, students, and employees after experts predicted an epidemic year for Type A influenza, was seen by most as their patriotic duty.Read moreAPby David Gambacorta Published Sept. 29, 2021, 5:00 a.m. ETThe world had lurched into a dark and uncertain winter. Americans were dying by the thousands, and the rhythms of everyday life seemed to carry only mournful notes of loss and deprivation.Even mundane things, like a trip to the grocery store, were different. Shelves were increasingly bare, and shoppers discovered ordinary staples were no longer easy to come by. Air and train travel virtually ceased.Hints of normalcy could still be found across Philadelphia in February 1943. Department stores, like Lit Bros. and Strawbridge & Clothier, tried to lure customers through their Market Street doors for furniture sales. A hiking club planned to meet on a Friday night in North Philly and trek to Belmont Mansion in Fairmount Park. The University of Pennsylvania’s basketball team had a 13-game winning streak end with a thud against Cornell.AdvertisementBut mostly, there was just the war.It had been 14 months since Japanese fighter planes attacked a Navy base in Pearl Harbor, propelling the United States, through plumes of smoke and a fleet of smoldering ships, into World War II.Behind closed doors in Washington, officials fretted about an invisible threat, one that could kill more members of the military than any Nazi weapon: the influenza virus. The 1918 flu pandemic had struck near the end of World War I, and claimed the lives of more than 45,000 service members.Now, millions of young service members were squeezed together in ships and on planes, fighting in foreign lands and then returning home, while millions of refugees were fleeing the ravages of war that swept across Europe. The perfect breeding ground, in other words, for another pandemic.To prevent a devastating outbreak, the United States needed something it didn’t have: a vaccine.“Developing a flu vaccine was considered to be as important, if not more important, than any wartime planning activity,” Kendall Hoyt, an assistant professor of medicine at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College, would later say.» READ MORE: Nearly half of the unvaccinated say they’re willing to get a coronavirus shot. The challenge is trying to get it to them.The government pulled together medical, academic, and pharmaceutical experts and tasked them with finding a path to an effective vaccine, an effort that would be repeated generations later, when the world once again confronted an existential crisis.Research developments were detailed on the front pages of newspapers across the country, alongside the latest war dispatches, with headlines like “Can U.S. Win The Battle Against Flu?”The virus, though, was the last thing on Ed Costantini’s mind. He was 19 and itching to fight. Drafted by the Army — and eager to join an older brother already in the service — Costantini left his parents in South Philly that February, and stepped onto a train bound for Georgia. He’d spend 15 weeks in basic training at Camp Wheeler, before making his way to Liverpool, England, and, later, France.But first, he had to get jabbed.Decades later, at age 98, Costantini would recall in crisp detail how he waited, alongside other young soldiers, to receive a handful of vaccinations that the Army required. “The government was worried about their soldiers,” he said.It didn’t occur to Costantini to question the necessity of the vaccines, or to refuse them in the name of personal freedom. “We didn’t give a crap. OK? It was that simple. You got in line, took your shot, and that’s it. It was no big deal.”“You got in line, took your shot, and that’s it. It was no big deal.”Ed Costantini, 98, of South PhillyThis was a different time, one when personal sacrifices became synonymous with patriotism, and scientific breakthroughs were hailed as miracles that would help define a new generation of discovery. It was a moment that also contained seeds of division and distrust that would metastasize across the country decades later during another hour of crisis.‘More devastating than war itself’With few existing vaccines, public health was essentially a gamble, like driving down a hill in a car with faulty brakes.Kit Kita was in grammar school when her parents moved, during the war, from Connecticut to Philadelphia, where they operated a bar in Northern Liberties. Money was tight, and sometimes there wasn’t enough to pay for a doctor if she got sick. The only vaccine she’d receive as a little girl was for smallpox.“That hurt,” she’d recall, “like a sonofagun.”The weight of the flu vaccine effort fell on the shoulders of Thomas Francis Jr., a 41-year-old native of New Castle, a steel mill town on the western edge of Pennsylvania. Jowly, with a neatly trimmed mustache, Francis was the country’s foremost expert on influenza.He had been a young man in 1918, when the flu killed more than 50 million people around the world — and about 12,000 in Philadelphia — its victims suffocating as their lungs filled with blood and other fluid. The pandemic “demonstrated virulent influenza may be more devastating to human life than war itself,” Francis observed.» READ MORE: Only a third of Philly city employees and half of Pa. state health workers have reported being vaccinatedIn 1940, as the chair of microbiology at New York University, Francis became the first in his field to isolate the Type B strain of the flu. A year later, he was named executive director of the Army’s Commission on Influenza, and called on a 27-year-old former NYU colleague for help: Jonas Salk.Slender and bespectacled, Salk grew up in New York City the child of Russian Jewish immigrants. “When he was really young, he had this sense that he was going to do something to help the world,” Salk’s son Peter would later explain. “It was embedded in him.”“There was a sense towards science, in that postwar era, that we were living in a time of miracles and wonder.” Kendall HoytMonths before Pearl Harbor, a U.S. ship ferried secret cargo to England: 500,000 doses of a potential flu vaccine that had been tested on ferrets. But a Nazi sub torpedoed it. The government concealed the name of the ship, and where it sank, but the Associated Press described the incident as a “major medical disaster.”There was little glamour in vaccine work; researchers often sat hunched over long rows of eggs that were used to cultivate the flu virus, their faces hidden behind masks and protective goggles. But advertisements for pharmaceutical companies like Merck & Co. encouraged the public to see a link between the military and medical science, proclaiming: “The Health of Our People Is a Vital Part of National Defense.”Salk and Francis, meanwhile, had decided — against established medical wisdom — not to use live flu virus in their vaccine, believing that a “killed virus” could still provoke a person’s immune system to respond.In 1942, they conducted their first field trials of the vaccine on 8,000 patients at two Michigan hospitals for mental health patients, Charlotte DeCroes Jacobs recounted in her book Jonas Salk: A Life. Some were deliberately exposed to the flu — an approach considered ethically acceptable at the time. In patients who had received the vaccine, flu antibodies climbed by 85%.A year later, 12,500 members of an Army training program at eight universities received injections with the Type A or Type B strains of the flu. The stakes were high; cases of the flu had already begun to spread across the country. In Philadelphia, school officials sent home students and cafeteria workers who had “even a slight fever,” and 200 police officers and firefighters fell sick with the virus.The stress gnawed at Salk. He slept poorly and began to experience chest pains. Then the trial results delivered a verdict: Only 2% of those who had been vaccinated had gotten sick with the flu. The vaccines worked. With a large number of students vaccinated, the virus had a smaller chance of spreading.Salk and Francis had a term for this scenario. The herd effect.The Surgeon General’s Office of the Army ordered millions of doses for its troops, and a nightmare outbreak in the service never materialized.Ed Costantini, the Army soldier from South Philly, years later would say he felt certain that he was among those vaccinated. ”I took my shot, but I had no knowledge of vaccines,” he’d say. “I didn’t even know what the word meant.”Civilians wouldn’t have access to the flu vaccine until just after the war. Some surely were hesitant to get vaccinated — “People have been anti-vaccine since we’ve had vaccines,” Hoyt would later say — but their voices were muted. Black communities, meanwhile, had reason to be wary of the white medical establishment.“Partly this was the result of the appalling, racist attitudes by physicians who either refused to treat them, or put them in basements, or in segregated facilities in hospitals,” Naomi Rogers, a professor of the history of medicine at Yale University, would later explain. “It was the very example of separate and not equal.”But in the short term, the flu vaccine was hailed as another American wartime triumph — Francis was awarded the Medal of Freedom — and a harbinger of more dramatic achievements to come.“Science had helped us win the war,” Rogers would say. “Why wouldn’t it help transform American life?”A time of miracles — and a Florida hoaxerHarry Truman could hardly contain his glee.It was 1952, and Truman, in his second term as president, had traveled to Philadelphia to speak at the American Hospital Association Convention. Life expectancy in the United States had reached a new peak, and a growing number of once-fatal diseases were being contained by vaccines. Flu deaths had fallen by 50%.“We now have the highest standard of health in our history,” Truman told the attendees.The budget for the National Institutes of Health had been $8 million during Truman’s first term. It would soar to more than $1 billion by 1966.“There was a sense towards science, in that postwar era, that we were living in a time of miracles and wonder,” Hoyt would later say.Jonas Salk was now in charge of his own virus research lab at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and had set his sights on conquering another horrific disease. Along the way, he would attract the attention of a businessman on a mission to undermine vaccines.In the late 1940s, with funding from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Salk began developing a vaccine for poliomyelitis, as cases multiplied at a worrisome rate. By the early 1950s, the disease was paralyzing more than 15,000 people every year; young children were especially vulnerable.Photographs of polio-stricken kids, with only their heads poking out of metal iron lungs, haunted parents and youngsters — and Salk, too.“I have memories of my father coming home, well after dark, with notes pinned under his tie clip. Lists of things to do,” Peter Salk would recall. “He was constantly thinking, constantly going in the lab early, constantly getting home late.”In May 1953, Jonas Salk carried something from his lab to his home in Wexford, Allegheny County — several doses of a potential polio vaccine. Like the flu vaccine that he and Francis had pioneered, it did not contain a live virus. Before long, the vaccine would be tested on more than a million American schoolchildren, whose parents had volunteered to have them participate in double-blind trials, considered the “gold standard” for determining a drug’s efficacy.But first, Salk gathered his young sons, Peter, Darrell, and Jonathan.Peter, who was 9, stood and faced the family’s kitchen table, his eyes drifting toward a large window that looked out onto a side yard. His father boiled glass syringes and needles on the stove, then readied the doses.Once again, the stakes were dizzying. If successful, the vaccine could prevent tens of thousands of people from becoming paralyzed. Salk plunged the needle into his boy’s arm.Peter, who hated needles, was stunned. “I just plain didn’t feel it,” he’d remember.A year later, Salk enlisted his old mentor, Thomas Francis, to help administer the sprawling vaccine field trials — and America got a glimpse of an insidious misinformation campaign that, decades later, would become all too common.While Salk and Francis tested the polio vaccine, Duon H. Miller, a cosmetics manufacturer in Coral Gables, Fla., began using newspaper ads, fliers, and the mail to spread anti-vaccine rhetoric. “Fake vaccine may kill your child — send a three cent stamp for details,” read one.Miller even created an official-sounding company, Polio Prevention Inc., to share his propaganda, which included claims that pasteurized milk was a “deliberate fraud on the public,” the Dayton Daily News reported at the time. Miller himself had no medical expertise; his cosmetics company had been flagged by the Federal Trade Commission for using misleading language on its products.New Yorkers ripped some of Miller’s leaflets from the walls of buildings in the Bronx, and the Better Business Bureau warned the public that Miller’s claims — which included personal attacks on Salk — were false and to ignore Miller’s vow to stage an “American rally” in Chicago. He was charged federally with sending libelous material through the mail, found guilty, and fined $1,000.April 1955, meanwhile, brought another national sigh of relief: Salk’s vaccine was found to be safe and effective. The Inquirer devoted nine pages of coverage to the news; more than 78,000 first- and second-grade students in the city were slated to receive the first of three doses within weeks.Kit Kita, a child when Salk first worked on the flu vaccine, was now teaching in Willingboro, N.J. She didn’t hesitate to get the polio vaccine. “We were all relieved,” she’d later remark, “everyone in my circle of friends.”Salk was feted at the White House, where President Dwight Eisenhower praised him as a “benefactor of mankind.” Polio was eradicated in the United States by 1979.Postwar medical achievements loomed large in the public’s imagination. “If you had asked parents, ‘What would you most like your son to become?’ everyone said, ‘A doctor,’” Naomi Rogers would say.Those feelings wouldn’t last.‘Mind-bending and heartbreaking’At the University of Pennsylvania, Drew Weissman and Katalin Karikó were living lives of quiet obsession.As a child growing up in Hungary, Karikó had been endlessly curious about life around her — farm animals, birds in trees. By the mid-1990s, she was at Penn, trying to understand even tinier subjects: RNA, the molecules that direct protein production in the body.Karikó believed RNA could be modified for therapeutic uses, and was soon joined by Drew Weissman, who’d studied immunology at the National Institutes of Health. But synthetic mRNA injections in mice had long been shown to produce harmful inflammation; Weissman and Karikó had to scrounge for funding. Their research papers sat unpublished.In the middle of the night, they’d email each other, mulling studies they’d read, obsessed with finding a path forward. “As a physician,” Weissman would later say, “my dream was always to develop something in the lab that would help people.”Weissman and Karikó kept at it — just as Jonas Salk had when he’d been told that “killed virus” vaccines would never work. In 2005, they reported a breakthrough: mRNA could be rendered safe by altering one of its building blocks.“Our phones will start ringing off the hook,” Weissman told Karikó.They’d wait five years for those calls to come — and, later, messages they never imagined. Ultimately, their research was licensed to two companies, Moderna and BioNTech, a partner of the drug company Pfizer.» READ MORE: Penn scientists win $3 million Breakthrough Prize for RNA research that enabled COVID-19 vaccinesIn the decades since Salk had been hailed a hero, some Americans’ perception of medical science had started to erode. There was growing skepticism toward experts, and less trust in federal agencies like the FDA, the CDC would find in studies in the 2010s.By 2017, only 37% of adults in the United States would be vaccinated against the flu, well below the optimal threshold of 70%.Black Americans were more unlikely than whites to trust vaccinations, part of the enduring legacy of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, a grotesque government experiment that forced hundreds of Black men in Alabama to suffer with syphilis — and in some instances die — beginning in the 1930s. (In another traumatic incident, one of the six manufacturers of the polio vaccine in the 1950s inadvertently distributed doses with live virus, spreading the disease to thousands.)Vaccine misinformation and conspiracy theories spread easily on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, where users needed only their thumbs and a hunch to find answers that suited their preferred reality. “In these days, those people who know less think that they know everything,” Karikó would note. “They are confident.”Measles, one of the most contagious diseases in the world, was eliminated in the United States in 2000, nearly 40 years after a vaccine was first developed. But some parents began to resist having their children vaccinated, and by 2019, more than 1,200 cases were reported in this country.“In these days, those people who know less think that they know everything.”Katalin Karikó, scientistAnd then came 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic, the kind of nightmare that Thomas Francis and Jonas Salk had raced to avoid in the 1940s. Schools emptied, hospitals overflowed, and businesses boarded up. Supermarkets had to place limits on ordinary items to ward off panic buying. Everyday life fell into a kind of suspended animation.The United States, under President Donald Trump, committed $18 billion to Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership that sought to develop COVID vaccines at a breakneck speed, echoing the old Commission on Influenza.In November 2020, Pfizer and Moderna would each announce that trials had shown their COVID vaccines — built on the foundation of Weissman and Karikó’s nearly two decades of mRNA research — were effective and safe.Yet Trump proved to be a perpetual source of misinformation about COVID, and contracted the virus himself. When he later tried to encourage some of his followers to get vaccinated, during a rally in Alabama, he was booed.Millions not only chose to be unvaccinated, but to resist small precautions that could protect them. In Idaho, parents and children gathered in front of the state capitol and dropped masks into a fire. In Florida — where Duon Miller had once discouraged parents from getting their children vaccinated — the governor vowed to withhold funding from school districts that implemented mask mandates.A Republican member of Congress even invoked the darkest figures from the 20th century to malign medical professionals who might offer door-to-door vaccinations. “Needle Nazis,” she called them.» READ MORE: These doctors and nurses share COVID-19 falsehoods. They can become misinformation superspreaders.Stories of Americans insisting that COVID is a hoax, and then expressing remorse as they lay dying from the virus in a hospital bed, became too numerous to count.Peter Salk, now a professor of infectious disease and microbiology, struggles to make sense of COVID denialism.“It’s not mind-blowing — it’s mind-bending and heartbreaking to see this,” he says. “How many people are dying, and how many are suffering loss in their families, because of not being tuned in to the reality of what’s taking place?”When Salk’s father encountered people who had misgivings about his polio vaccine, he patiently reasoned with them.Drew Weissman adopts the same approach now, logging on to virtual meetings, or visiting church groups and retirement communities, to discuss the importance of getting vaccinated against COVID-19. When people express concern about the vaccine, he responds with dispassionate statistics.The virus has claimed the lives of more than 685,000 Americans — far more than the 418,500 who died during World War II — while hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines have been delivered, with just a handful of reported deaths from complications.The conversations are mostly encouraging.Later, when Weissman’s talks are finished, he logs on to his computer and opens his email. He finds notes from people whose opposition to the vaccine runs darker, and has calcified into a political identity.You’re lying, some of them tell Weissman.Then they threaten his life, and his family.There’s no way to inoculate against hate.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAbout UsAbout The InquirerDiversity & InclusionAdvertiseContact UsLicensing & PermissionsPhoto ReprintsNewspapers in EducationJobs & InternshipsInquirer EventsAcel Moore WorkshopsNewsroom StaffHelp and FeedbackNews & InfoNewsSportsEntertainmentBusinessHealthFoodLifeOpinionPhilly FirstArchivesSpecial ReportsSite MapMarketplaceSubscribeInquirer StoreJob ListingsAll ClassifiedsDeath NoticesLegal NoticesGift Subscriptionse-EditionsThe InquirerThe Daily NewsSubscriber ServicesMobile AppsApple iOSGoogle AndroidXFacebookInstagram© 2024 The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLCTerms of Use/Privacy Policy/Cancellation Policy/California Notice/California residents do not sell my data requestCovid-19 and flu infections can happen at the same time.

Video Ad Feedback This Atlanta hospital is having to make tough choices amid Covid patient influx 03:50 - Source: CNN CNN — Dr. Adrian Burrowes has seen hundreds of Covid-19 patients. But he’s especially worried about what will happen this flu season – even more so than last year. This fall and winter could mark the first surge of patients infected with both the flu and the Delta variant – the most contagious strain of coronavirus to hit the US. “You can certainly get both the flu and Covid-19 at the same time, which could be catastrophic to your immune system,” said Burrowes, a family medicine physician and assistant professor of family medicine at the University of Central Florida. “I’m definitely more concerned this year than I was a year ago,” he told CNN. “And the reason why is because now we have pretty significant Covid fatigue amongst the American population.” Shutterstock Related article Why ths flu season may be severe Heightened safety precautions against Covid-19 last year helped stymie the spread of the flu last year, said Dr. Mark Rosenberg, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians. “Last year, more people staying home and covering their faces when they did go out kept flu numbers historically low,” Rosenberg said in a written statement this month. But “this year the situation could be dangerously different.” With more people out and about – and millions of Americans not vaccinated against the flu nor Covid-19 – “I do believe you’re going to see a rise in flu cases,” Burrowes said. “I do believe you’re going to see coinfection with flu and coronavirus. And I do believe you’re going to see a higher rate of mortality as a result of that.” What Covid-19 and the flu together could do On their own, both Covid-19 and the flu can attack the lungs, potentially causing pneumonia, fluid in the lungs or respiratory failure, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Each illness can also cause sepsis, cardiac injury and inflammation of the heart, brain or muscle tissues. Susan Walker Related article After 169 hospitals, a dad got the Covid-19 care he needed -- and changed dozens of skeptics' minds Having both illnesses simultaneously “would increase the risk of longer-term effects of any of those organ systems,” said Dr. Michael Matthay, a professor of medicine and a critical care specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. “The two together definitely could be more injurious to the lungs and cause more respiratory failure,” Matthay told CNN last year and reiterated this week. Respiratory failure doesn’t necessarily mean your lungs stop working. It means the lungs can’t get enough oxygen into the blood. “Acute respiratory failure can be a life-threatening emergency,” the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute says. “Respiratory failure may cause damage to your lungs and other organs, so it is important to get treated quickly.” But with so few flu cases last year, there’s not much data on how many people had the flu and Covid-19 simultaneously. “Health experts are still studying how common this is,” the CDC said. Internal medicine physician Dr. Jorge Rodriguez typically sees about 60 flu patients each flu season. Last season, the Los Angeles doctor saw zero. Kaylee Roberts Family Photo Related article Why the flu sometimes kills young, healthy people But this year, “the odds of a double whammy are definitely going to increase,” Rodriguez told CNN this week. “The fever may be worse. The shortness of breath may be worse. The loss of smell and taste could be worse. And on top of all that, it could last longer.” Both he and Burrowes said they expect to see more patients with both illnesses in the coming months. Not only are more people ditching last year’s safety precautions, but having one virus can weaken the immune system’s ability to respond to a second virus. Think about it this way, Rodriguez said: “If you get hit with a hammer, it will hurt. But if you already have a broken leg and get hit with a hammer again, it will hurt more. And it will take longer to heal.” That’s particularly worrisome because some Covid-19 patients are already struggling with monthslong complications. While flu symptoms often subside within a few weeks, Rodriguez and other doctors are seeing more patients with long Covid. Increasingly, they include young, previously healthy adults, Rodriguez said. Mario Tama/Getty Images Related article What experts say about the best time to get a flu shot this year He recalled a “38-year-old, super healthy” athlete and martial artist who came down with Covid-19. A year later, he still can’t exercise regularly. “He just does not have the pulmonary reserve to do it anymore,” Rodriguez said. “It’s affected (other aspects of) his health. He’s gained weight. He’s depressed because he’s not the same person that he feels he used to be.” On the other side of the country, Burrowes has also noticed an increase in younger Covid-19 patients. “This year, I have seen over 400 patients with Covid,” he said. “And since April, the overwhelming majority of those patients have been under the age of 40. Of those patients, 98% were unvaccinated.” How a one-two punch could hit health care In some states, hospitals are already overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients. Some have activated crisis standards of care, allowing hospitals to ration resources and treatment. Add an influx of flu patients this season – or flu and coronavirus patients – and the situation could get dire, Burrowes said. Nurses check on a patient in the ICU Covid-19 ward at NEA Baptist Memorial Hospital in Jonesboro, Arkansas, U.S., on Wednesday, Aug. 4, 2021. Houston Cofield/Bloomberg/Getty Images Related article As Covid-19 hospitalizations spike, some overwhelmed hospitals are rationing care Not only could that reduce other people’s access to prompt health care, it can also endanger medical workers – which, in turn, would also impact the public. “When people say coronavirus is just like the flu, that bothers me,” he said. “I have never lost a physician colleague to the flu. … But I’ve lost four physician colleagues, relatively healthy, that all died from coronavirus.” Each of those colleagues died before Covid-19 vaccines were available, Burrowes said. But even now with vaccination and protective equipment, “we’re treating patients and we’re right up against them and we’re in close proximity with them for prolonged periods of time,” he said. The public needs to understand that if they don’t help mitigate the spread, they may get a harsh reality check if they have a car accident or another emergency and don’t get the urgent care they’re expecting, Rodriguez said. How to avoid a flu-Covid-19 double whammy “Getting vaccinated is one of the best ways to avoid the double whammy,” said Rosenberg, the head of emergency physicians’ association. But only 55.8% of Americans have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to CDC data Tuesday. And “only about half of Americans get an annual flu vaccine,” the CDC said. Most children who die from the flu are not vaccinated.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Joe Raedle/Getty Images Related article Two-for-one vaccine clinics fight flu and Covid, too The CDC recommends flu vaccines for everyone ages 6 months and up, with rare exceptions. Covid-19 vaccines are available to everyone ages 12 years and up, and children ages 5 to 11 might become eligible in the next several weeks. Conveniently, Americans can now get a Covid-19 vaccine and a flu shot at the same time, the CDC said. That could spur more people to get both shots, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “If that means going in and getting the flu shot in one arm (and) the Covid shot in the other, that’s perfectly fine,” Fauci said. While breakthrough infections are possible with both the flu and Covid-19 vaccines – which work differently in the body – “both of those vaccines have that same ability to decrease the severity of your illness,” Burrowes said. Even though he’s fully vaccinated, Rodriguez plans to wear a mask in public this fall and winter to help minimize the chances of a breakthrough infection – either of coronavirus or the flu, he said. He doesn’t want to risk reducing his immune system and becoming vulnerable to the other virus. “I don’t have a problem with taking extra safety precautions,” he said. “My freedom is not affected in the least.” CNN’s Jacqueline Howard and Maggie Fox contributed to this report.

Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyBut some of the common symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other common viral infections, including the flu (not to mention colds and seasonal allergies). Both viruses can both make you feel lousy, but they’re different illnesses caused by different viruses.Infectious disease specialist Kristin Englund, MD, shares insight into the key similarities and differences between COVID-19 and the flu.Do you have COVID-19 or the flu?The flu has been around for many years. During winter months, two types of influenza viruses, types A and B, cause outbreaks, though getting a flu shot can provide you with strong protection. SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is a newer virus.“This was something we’d never seen before, so no one had natural immunity against it,” Dr. Englund explains. “That’s why it’s been able to spread worldwide so rapidly — because no one was protected.”How COVID-19 and the flu are spreadHere’s something the viruses have in common: Both coronavirus and the flu are passed from person to person in similar ways — through droplets that come out of an infected person’s nose and mouth when they cough, sneeze or talk. When another person inhales these droplets (or touches a surface contaminated with the virus and then touches their mouth, nose or eyes), they can become infected, too.AdvertisementImportantly, both viruses can be spread by people who are infected but not showing symptoms. Stay home if you’ve been exposed or infected so that you don’t risk spreading the flu or COVID-19 to others.Symptoms of COVID-19 and the fluMild cases of COVID-19 present similarly to the flu. “The symptoms are virtually the same, especially new infections in people who have been vaccinated,” Dr. Englund says. “Breakthrough cases with mild symptoms may feel very similar to the flu.”According to the CDC, both COVID-19 and the flu can lead to a range of mild to severe illnesses. They both may cause:Body aches.Cough.Fever.Headache.Runny or stuffy nose.Shortness of breath.Sore throat.Tiredness.Some people with COVID-19 also develop other symptoms not associated with the flu. They include:A bluish tint to skin, lips and/or fingernails.Confusion.Diarrhea.Difficulty concentrating.Inability to stay awake.Loss of sense of smell and/or taste.Nausea.Pain or pressure in the chest.Rapid heartbeat.Vomiting.If you experience the symptoms of COVID-19 and/or the flu, call your doctor’s office. They may direct you to the emergency room, their office or online for a virtual visit, or give you instructions for getting tested for one or both of the viruses.If you have severe symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or a severe headache, go to the nearest emergency department or dial 911.Should you get tested?Getting tested is the only real way to tell the difference between COVID-19 and the flu. “Even if you’ve been vaccinated, it’s still reasonable to get yourself tested so that you know whether this is influenza versus a breakthrough of COVID-19,” Dr. Englund says.How to treat COVID-19 and the fluThere’s another benefit to getting tested: When you know which virus you have, you can get treatment (or treat yourself) accordingly.“For each of them, it’s about symptom control,” Dr. Englund says. “For COVID-19, you want to make sure you’re keeping an eye on your temperature and using a pulse oximeter, a small device you put on your finger to make sure that your oxygen levels are in a normal range.”Rest up. When you’re sick with any virus, taking it easy will allow your body to devote its limited energy to fighting back.Stay hydrated. Hydration is essential when you’re sick, helping ensure that your organs and muscles are working properly.Ease your symptoms. Over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen or cold-and-flu medicine nay help you feel better while you recover. Be sure to follow proper dosage instructions.Talk to your doctor. There’s no real treatment for COVID-19, though you may be eligible to receive monoclonal antibodies. If you have the flu, your doctor may prescribe treatment that can help cut down on the amount of time you feel sick.AdvertisementHow long the flu and COVID-19 lastTypically, flu symptoms stick around for four or five days — maybe even up to seven days, Dr. Englund says, while the CDC reports that people with mild to moderate COVID-19 remain infectious for about 10 days after symptom onset.Some people continue to experience the effects of COVID-19 even after they’ve stopped being contagious. “Long-haulers,” as they’re called, are those who still experience some sort of symptom 28 days or later after they were first infected.“Most people with either illness can recover at home with rest, fluids and over-the-counter medicines for fever or body aches,” Dr. Englund says. “But in some cases, they can both result in complications like pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and inflammation of the heart, brain or muscle tissue. These complications are more likely to affect older adults and people with underlying medical conditions.”Additional complications associated with COVID-19 include blood clots and multisystem inflammatory syndrome.If you contract either virus, it’s important to monitor your symptoms and stay in touch with your doctor.Prevention and vaccination are keyA few simple steps can make a big difference in keeping you healthy and curbing the spread of COVID-19 and the flu:AdvertisementWash your hands frequently.Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.Avoid close contact with people who are sick.Disinfect frequently touched surfaces.Cough and sneeze into your sleeve or a tissue instead of your hands.Stay home when you’re sick.Keep wearing a mask in public.And for both viruses, there’s one key way to protect yourself: vaccination.All three COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the United States are safe, effective and potentially life-changing. Though breakthrough cases of COVID-19 are possible, fewer than 0.005% of fully vaccinated Americans have experienced a breakthrough case resulting in hospitalization or death.Just be sure to get vaccinated against both COVID-19 and influenza, because getting just one of the vaccines won’t protect you from the other virus.“The viruses that cause influenza are completely different from the virus that causes COVID-19, so they require different vaccines to help you build immunity to them,” Dr. Englund explains.“A COVID-19 vaccine will not protect you against influenza and vice versa. So in this season of respiratory illness, it’s critically important for everybody to get both types of vaccines to be able to protect themselves and their families.”AdvertisementLearn more about our editorial process.AdvertisementRelated ArticlesNovember 7, 2024/Infectious DiseaseCan COVID-19 Cause Erectile Dysfunction?Research shows the virus can affect your ability to get or maintain an erectionOctober 29, 2024/Children's HealthRSV vs. Pneumonia: Sorting out Your Child’s Fever and CoughRSV can lead your child to develop pneumonia and have trouble breathingOctober 23, 2024/Cold, Flu & Respiratory IllnessesWhat Is Respiratory Season, and Are You Ready?Getting vaccinated in October can help protect you against severe illness between November and MarchOctober 10, 2024/Infectious DiseaseHow Contagious Is RSV?Respiratory syncytial virus spreads easily through respiratory droplets spewed out by those who are infectedOctober 8, 2024/Mental HealthHands Off!

(AP Photo/LM Otero, File) By Lauran Neergaard Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print Amid all the focus on COVID-19 vaccinations, U.S. health experts have another plea: Don’t skip your flu shot.Flu cases have dropped to historically low levels during the pandemic. The U.S. and Europe experienced hardly any flu last winter, and the Southern Hemisphere just ended its second flu season of the coronavirus pandemic with little to report.But with U.S. schools and businesses reopened, international travel resuming and far less masking this fall, flu could make a comeback. The big question is whether it will trickle in or roar back and put extra pressure on hospitals already struggling with COVID-19 surges.“People are sick to death of hearing about having to roll on out and get vaccines of any sort,” said flu specialist Richard Webby of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis. Yet after 18 months of little influenza exposure, “we probably as a population don’t have as much immunity against this virus as we typically might,” Webby said. “It makes absolute sense to go on out and get that vaccine and at least prepare for something that, you know, could be quite severe.” Here are some things to know: Q: Who should get a flu vaccine?A: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says just about everybody needs an annual flu vaccination, starting with 6-month-old babies. Influenza is most dangerous for adults over age 65, young children, pregnant women and people with certain health conditions, such as heart or lung disease. Q: Why do I need one this year, since flu hasn’t been a threat during the pandemic?A: COVID-19 restrictions including masking and staying home — especially for children, who are flu’s biggest spreaders — clearly had a side benefit of tamping down influenza and other respiratory bugs. But as soon as masks started to come off, the U.S. experienced an unusual summer surge of children hospitalized with a different virus, named RSV, that usually strikes in the winter. That’s a worrying sign of what to expect if flu returns. Q: What’s the forecast for flu this winter?A: Flu is notoriously difficult to predict. But there’s a little more circulating in some countries this fall than last, including a recent uptick in China, said Webby, who directs a World Health Organization flu center. And people may be a little more vulnerable: Before the pandemic, 15% to 30% of the population was exposed to flu each year, a missing bump in immunity, he said.“If flu does at least get a foothold in, it’s going to have more opportunity of spreading this season,” he said.Q: When should I get a flu vaccine?A: Now. The CDC encourages people to get their vaccine by the end of October. Doctors’ offices, retail pharmacies and local health departments have millions of doses in hand. And most Americans with health insurance can get it with no co-pay.Q: I already got a COVID-19 vaccine. Do I really need a flu shot, too?A: COVID-19 vaccines prevent the coronavirus and flu vaccines prevent influenza. They don’t overlap. But you can catch both viruses at the same time, or one after the other. “Avoid the double whammy” and get both vaccines, advised the American College of Emergency Physicians. For now, COVID-19 vaccines are available for anyone 12 and older.Flu vaccines aren’t as powerful as vaccines against some other diseases but if people do get influenza anyway, they tend to have a much milder illness.Q: Can I get a flu vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same visit?A: Yes, the CDC says it’s fine to pair a flu vaccine with either a primary COVID-19 shot or a booster dose. Q: What’s the best flu vaccine to get?A: Flu constantly evolves, and each year’s vaccine is made to fight the strains that international experts deem most likely to circulate. This year all the flu vaccines offered in the U.S. offer protection against all four of those strains. Options include traditional shots or a nasal spray vaccine. There also are shots specifically designed to rev up seniors’ age-weakened immune systems, either with a higher dose or an added immune booster. There are also options for people allergic to eggs, which are used to make some flu shots. Q: How much flu vaccine is available?A: The CDC expects vaccine manufacturers to deliver 188 million to 200 million doses. Nearly 194 million doses were distributed last winter, a record.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

But what will the upcoming flu season look like? Natural immunity against flu is likely to be lower because of last year’s lockdowns and preventive measures, which had an impact on the circulation of the flu virus. As such, many more people might catch the flu this winter and potentially be at risk of serious illness. Flu vaccination could be more important than ever, both to protect those most at risk, as well as to protect health systems that are already under so much pressure. Given this specific context, it will be important to adapt flu vaccination programs to address the challenges presented by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The continued threat of SARS-CoV-2, in conjunction with the ongoing roll-out of mass COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, will create logistical challenges to flu vaccine delivery, which should occur over a specific time frame. In parallel to COVID-19 vaccination programs, it will be important to ensure that the flu vaccine is available and accessible to all priority groups. Therefore, it will be paramount to time flu vaccination precisely. We also expect to see some complacency and fatigue towards flu vaccination as a consequence of the many-months focus on COVID-19. Conscious of those challenges ahead, IFPMA partnered with The Health Policy Partnership to provide guidance to policy makers and health planners on how to best plan and deliver flu vaccination programs and drive home the importance of getting the flu shot this year, especially for the most vulnerable people. Flu is most dangerous for some populations and we believe five groups should be prioritized for flu vaccinations, namely: older adults, babies and young children, health and care workers, pregnant women, and people with underlying health conditions, such as lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. They are at higher risk of developing serious complications from flu that can lead to hospitalization and even death. Many of these groups are also at high risk of contracting COVID-19. During a typical flu season, there are about 1 billion cases of flu and up to 650,000 flu-related deaths globally. We know that vaccination is the best way to stay protected against the flu. This is especially true for vulnerable groups. In fact, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that influenza vaccination prevented an estimated 7.52 million illnesses, 3.69 million medical visits, 105,000 hospitalizations, and 6,300 deaths due to influenza during the 2019-2020 season in the US. What specific actions can policy makers and health service planners take? In our report Influenza vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic – Planning and delivering vaccination programs to protect the most vulnerable people, we outlined four policy priorities to address those challenges so that the most vulnerable people are protected from flu during the upcoming flu season: Convenient access to the flu vaccine in community and healthcare settings that are COVID-19 safe. For example, offering the flu vaccine during existing appointments, such as routine check-ups, is convenient and has the benefit of personal advice from a healthcare professional whom patients know and trust. Making flu vaccination available in pharmacies can greatly improve uptake. Reimbursement for all priority groups. Seasonal flu vaccinations are often reimbursed for vulnerable people, but reimbursement should also be expanded to those at risk of spreading flu to the most vulnerable people, such as household contacts who might carry the virus home and put people living with underlying conditions more at risk. Optimal timing of flu vaccines while taking COVID-19 vaccine schedules into account. Flu vaccines need to be administered early enough in the autumn to induce immunity before the virus starts to circulate widely, but not too early so that immunity lasts until the end of the flu season. Also, health service planners should use the latest available evidence to determine the appropriate timing of the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu vaccine. Tailored communication campaigns that deliver targeted messages to specific populations. It is important to adapt messages to different target populations and use the right channels to reach them. By focusing on the above priorities, we can minimize the potentially devastating impact of seasonal flu on individuals and healthcare systems that are already struggling with the impact of COVID-19.

While ultra-violet (UV) based technologies have shown satisfactory virucidal potential, the photo-toxicity in humans coupled with UV associated polymer degradation limit their use in occupied spaces. Alternatively, longer wavelengths with less irradiation energy such as visible light (405 nm) have largely been explored in the context of bactericidal and fungicidal applications. Such studies indicated that 405 nm mediated inactivation is caused by the absorbance of porphyrins within the organism creating reactive oxygen species which result in free radical damage to its DNA and disruption of cellular functions. The virucidal potential of visible-light based technologies has been largely unexplored and speculated to be ineffective given the lack of porphyrins in viruses. The current study demonstrated increased susceptibility of lipid-enveloped respiratory pathogens of importance such as SARS-CoV-2 (causative agent of COVID-19) and influenza A virus to 405 nm, visible light in the absence of exogenous photosensitizers thereby indicating a potential alternative porphyrin-independent mechanism of visible light mediated viral inactivation. These results were obtained using less than expected irradiance levels which are considered safe for humans and commercially achievable. Our results support further exploration of the use of visible light technology for the application of continuous decontamination in occupied areas within hospitals and/or infectious disease laboratories, specifically for the inactivation of respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A.

By late February 2021, more than 112 million cases had been reported while accounting for approximately 2.5 million deaths, underscoring the rapid dissemination of the virus on a global scale2. As a complement to standard precautions such as handwashing, masking, surface disinfection, and social distancing, other enhancements to enclosed spaces such as improved ventilation and whole-room disinfection are being considered by segments beyond acute healthcare such as commercial offices, retail, dining, and transportation3.Initial guidance from health authorities such as the CDC and WHO on environmental transmission focused on contaminated surfaces as fomites4. Data pertaining to the survival of SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses to date has indicated that virions are able to persist on fomites composed of plastic5, wood6, paper5, metal7 and glass8 potentially up to 9 days. Recent studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may also remain viable approximately at least 3 days in such surfaces and another two studies showed that at room temperature (20–25 °C), a 14-day time-period was required to see a 4.5–5 Log10 of the virus9,10.Since the start of the pandemic, transmission of the virus by respiratory droplets and aerosols has become an accepted method of transmission although the relative impact of each mode of transmission is the subject of much debate. Nevertheless, enclosed spaces with groups of people exercising or singing have been associated with increased transmission. The half-life survival of SARS-CoV-2 in this type of environment has been estimated between 1 and 2 h6,11,12.Taking this information into consideration, several methods have been shown to effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Chemical methods, which focus on surface disinfection, utilize 70% alcohol and bleach and their benefits are well established. These methods are also episodic (or non-continuous) meaning that in-between applications, the environment is not being treated13.In addition to chemicals, one of the most utilized methods for whole-room disinfection is germicidal ultra-violet C (UVC; ~ 254 nm)14. This technology is well established15 and has been shown to inactivate a range of pathogens including bacteria16, fungi17 and viruses18. The mechanism of action of UVC is photodimerization of genetic material such as RNA (relevant for SARS-CoV2 and IAV) and DNA (relevant for DNA viruses and bacterial pathogens, among others)19. Unfortunately, this effect has been associated with deleterious effects in exposed humans such as photokeratoconunctivitis in eyes and photodermatitis in skin20. For these reasons, UVC irradiation requires safety precautions and cannot be used to decontaminate fomites and high contact areas in the presence of humans21.Germicidal properties of violet-blue visible light (380–500 nm), especially within the range of 405 to 450 nm have been shown as an alternative to UVC irradiation in human occupied whole-room disinfection scenarios where it has shown reduction of bacteria22,23 and surgical site infections24. Although 405 nm or closely related wavelengths have been shown to be less germicidal than UVC, its inactivation potential has been assessed in pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria spp. and Clostridium spp.24,25, and in fungal species such as Saccharomyces spp. and Candida spp.26. It is thought that the underlying mechanism of blue-light mediated inactivation is associated with absorption of light via photosensitizers such as porphyrins which results in the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS)27,28. The emergence of ROS is associated with direct damage to biomolecules such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids which are essential constituents of bacteria, fungi and viruses. Further studies have shown that ROS can also lead to the loss of cell membrane permeability mediated by lipid oxidation29. Given the lack of endogenous photosensitizers such as porphyrins in virions, it was expected that efficient decontamination of viruses (both enveloped and non-enveloped) required the addition of exogenous photosensitizers23. With the use of media suspensions (e.g. saliva, blood, etc.) containing both endogenous and/or exogenous photosensitizers (to create the ROS required for inactivation), 405nm light was shown to inactivate viruses such as feline calcivirus (FCV)30, viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)31 and murine norovirus-132 using unsafe, commercially impractical irradiance levels. This highlights the importance of answering the basic scientific questions related to viral inactivation within the context of the applied science required for clinical application. Our study specifically focused on three questions: (1) does the same wavelength of light (405 nm) that inactivates bacteria also inactivate enveloped viruses, (2) is a porphyrin rich medium required for this inactivation, and (3) can this inactivation be achieved using safe, commercially practical irradiance levels?In the current study, we show the impact of 405 nm irradiation on inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A H1N1 viruses without the use of photosensitizers making it directly relevant to the clinical environment. We show this using a commercially available visible light disinfection system ensuring that the irradiance used is both safe and practically achievable in a clinical setting supporting the possible use of 405 nm irradiation as a tool to confer continuous decontamination of respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A viruses. We further show the increased susceptibility of lipid-enveloped viruses for irradiation in comparison to non-enveloped viruses, further characterizing the virucidal effects of visible light.Materials and methods405 nm exposure systemThe visible light disinfection product used in this study was a commercially available 6″ LED downlight (Indigo-Clean, Kenall, Kenosha, WI) to allow for use within a BSL-3 level containment hood. Within the hood, the distance between the face of the fixture and the sample was 10″-much less than the normal 1.5 m used in normal, whole-room disinfection applications. The output of the fixture was modified electronically during its manufacture to match this difference and ensure that the measurements would represent the performance of the device in actual use. This test setup is shown in a BSL-2 hood in Fig. 1A below. Note the spectroradiometer and the bottom portion of the rig (~ 6″) used for calibration were removed during the actual study (Fig. 1B).Figure 1Inactivation device setup and characterization. (A) Test setup shown with spectroradiometer, and extension used for calibration. (B) Test setup showing the placement of the control and sample for irradiation. The bottom portion of the test rig was removed during the actual experiment to ensure the 10″ distance used in the study. (C) Normalized spectral power distribution showing peak irradiance at 405 nm. (D) Normalized spectral power distribution for the fluorescent control light (non-disinfecting) and standard LED light (without 405 nm) used in the study. Each spectrum is normalized relative to its own peak value.Full size imageControls were placed outside the test rig but within the BSL hood as shown in Fig. 1B. Note that this picture contains the bottom portion of the test rig to highlight the position of the radiometer. For the range of output used in this study, multiple discrete levels were created using pulse width modulation within the LED driver itself. These levels were made to be individually selectable using a simple knob on the attached control module.For reference, the amount of visible light within the 400–420 nm bandwidth, measured in mW cm−2, is a measurement of the “dose” delivered to the target organism and is used to quantify this relationship similar to that used in UV disinfection applications.To fully examine this effect, a range of irradiance values were used representing actual product deployment conditions in occupied rooms. The lowest value (0.035 mW cm−2) represents a single-mode, lower wattage used in general lighting applications while the highest value (0.6 mW cm−2) represents a dual-mode, higher wattage used in critical care applications such as an operating room.The device was placed in a rig to ensure a consistent distance (10″) between the fixture and the samples. The output of the fixture in the test rig was measured using a Stellar-RAD Radiometer from StellarNet configured to make wavelength and irradiance measurements from 350 to 1100 nm with < 1 nm spectral bandwidth using a NIST traceable calibration. To ensure that the regular white light portion of the illumination (which is non-disinfecting) was not measured, the measurement was electronically limited to a 1 nm bandwidth over the 400–420 nm range. The normalized spectral profile is shown in Fig. 1C below. The absolute value of the measurement was determined using a NIST traceable calibration as previously described. Samples were irradiated with the range of wavelengths depicted in Fig. 1C. This was deliberately done for two reasons: (1) prior work had shown that visible light disinfection was primarily active at 405 nm33 and (2) to emphasize the applied science associated with actual clinical use where a virus in the environment could be exposed to both 405 nm and regular white light in an occupied room.To isolate the contribution of 405 nm light, the control samples were placed outside the field of irradiation created by the disinfection product but within the biosafety hood. Accordingly, these samples were exposed to the overhead lights within the room which contained virtually no 405 nm light (< 0.001 mW cm−2).In any assessment of viral inactivation, thermal denaturing of the organism is a concern. Older lighting technologies such as incandescent sources heat a resistive element and were widely used in a variety of applications. This creates heat at both the source and to objects within its field. Fortunately, the disinfecting light (sample) and the overhead lights in the room (control) did not use this technology and therefore contain no infrared emissions (> 800 nm) a commonly known benefit associated with LED lighting. As a confirmation, the temperature beneath the disinfecting light was measured using a commercially available thermocouple during a 24-h period. During this time, the temperature at the sample position was constant at 20 °C ± 0.5 °C even at the highest disinfecting power (0.6 mW cm−2).For reference, two spectral profiles, one for traditional fluorescent lighting and the other for standard LED lighting are provided in Fig. 4 below. While both types of lighting are commonly used in the overhead lights within buildings, the lights in the BSL-3 laboratory were traditional fluorescent. As shown in Fig. 1B, the controls were exposed only to traditional fluorescent lighting with a negligible amount of disinfecting light (< 0.001 mW cm−2) between 400 and 420 nm. Due to the inherent differences between fluorescent and LED lighting, the standard LED spectra has a small, but measurable amount of disinfecting light (0.006 mW cm−2) between 400 and 420 nm. As will be later shown, this amount of light can have a measurable disinfecting effect.Cells and virusesVero-E6 cells (ATCC® CRL-1586™, clone E6) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) complemented with 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (HI-FBS; PEAK serum), penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco; 15140-122), HEPES buffer (Gibco; 15630-080) and MEM non-essential amino-acids (Gibco; 25025CL) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Vero-CCL81 (ATCC® CRL-81™) cells and MDCK cells (ATCC® CCL-34) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% HI-FBS and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All experiments involving SARS-CoV2 (USA-WA1/202, BEI resource–NR52281) were conducted within a biosafety-level 3 (BSL3) containment facility at Icahn school of medicine at Mount Sinai by trained workers upon authorization of protocols by a biosafety committee. Amplification of SARS-CoV-2 viral stocks was done in Vero-E6 cell confluent monolayers by using an infection medium composed of DMEM supplemented with 2% HI-FBS, Non-essential amino acids (NEAA), Hepes and penicillin–streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. Influenza A virus used here was generated using plasmid based reverse genetics system as previously described34. The backbone used in the study was A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai (H1N1) under the GenBank accession number AF389122. IAV-PR8 virus was grown and titrated in MDCK as previously described34. As a non-enveloped virus, the cell culture adapted murine Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV; ATCC® VR-12B) was propagated and titrated in Vero-CCL81 cells with DMEM and 2% HI-FBS and penicillin–streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 48 h35.405 nm inactivation of virusesThe SARS-CoV-2 virus was exclusively handled at the Icahn school of Medicine BSL-3 and studies involving IAV and EMCV were handled in BSL-2 conditions. Indicated PFU amounts were mixed with sterile 1× PBS and were irradiated in 96 well format cell culture plates in triplicates. In these studies, A starting dose of 5 × 105 PFU for SARS-CoV-2 and starting doses of 1 × 105 PFU for IAV and EMCV were used. The final volumes for inactivation were 250 μl per replicate. The untreated samples were prepared the same way and were left inside the biosafety cabinet isolated from the inactivation device at room temperature. The plates were sealed with qPCR plate transparent seal and an approximate 10% reduction of the intensity was observed due to the sealing film. The distance from the lamp and the samples was measured to be 10″. All samples were extracted at indicated times and were frozen at − 80 °C and were thawed together for titration via plaque assays.Plaque assaysFor SARS-CoV-2 studies, confluent monolayers of Vero-E6 cells in 12-well plate format were infected (with an inoculum volume 150 μl) with tenfold serially diluted samples in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and penicillin–streptomycin for an hour while gently shaking the plates every 15 min. Afterwards, the inoculum was removed, and the cells were incubated with an overlay composed of MEM with 2% FBS and 0.05% Oxoid agar for 72 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The plates were subsequently fixed using 10% formaldehyde overnight and the formaldehyde was removed along with the overlay. Fixed monolayers were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% tween-20 (TBS-T) for an hour. Afterwards, plates were immunostained using a monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV2 nucleoprotein (Creative-Biolabs; NP1C7C7) at a dilution of 1:1000 followed by 1:5000 anti-mouse IgG monoclonal antibody and was developed using KPL TrueBlue peroxidase substrate for 10 min (Seracare; 5510-0030). After washing the plates with distilled water, the number of a plaques were counted. Plaque assays for IAV and EMCV were done in a similar fashion. For IAV, confluent monolayers of MDCK cells supplemented with MEM-based overlay with TPCK-treated trypsin was used and was incubated for 48 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For EMCV, Vero-CCL81 cells were used to do plaque assays in 6 well plate format with an inoculum volume of 200 μl and was incubated for 48 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Plaques for IAV and EMCV were visualized using crystal violet. Data shown here is derived from three independent experimental setups.ResultsDose and time dependent inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of photosensitizersThe lowest irradiation dose of 0.035 mW cm−2 was applied for SARS-CoV-2 and when compared to the T4H untreated control, a reduction of 0.3288 log10 was seen as early as 4 h and after 24 h of irradiation, an inactivation of 1.0325 log10 (approximately 10 times reduction in infectivity) was observed for SARS-CoV-2 via plaque assays (Fig. 2A). A slightly higher dose of 0.076 mW cm−2 yielded 0.4123 log10, 0.6118 log10 and 1.5393 log10 reduction by 4, 8 and 12 h post irradiation when compared to the respective untreated controls (Fig. 2B). Subsequent increase of the irradiation dose to 0.150 mW cm−2 resulted in a reduction of 0.4771 log10 after 4 h which then had a 1.1206 log10 after 12 h. Irradiation for 24 h at 0.150 mW cm−2 suggested a total reduction of 2.0056 log10 (256 times) for SARS-CoV-2 and (Fig. 2C). As a final experiment, a high irradiation dose of 0.6 mW cm−2 was used to assess the inactivation potential within a much shorter time frame. Irradiation for 1 h resulted in a reduction of 0.4150 log10 which reached 1.2943 log10 reduction by 4 h and 2.309 log10 (385 times) after 8 h in comparison to untreated controls samples at the corresponding times. (Fig. 2D,E). All experimental conditions demonstrated the stability of untreated SARS-CoV-2 which was left at room temperature in PBS, as shown by the marginal reduction of viral titer over time.Figure 2Dose and time dependent inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in PBS by 405 nm irradiation.

Irradiation with a high dose of 0.6 mW cm−2 suggested a time dependent reduction of infectious titers as calculated by the 0.1619 log10, 0.5609 log10, and 1.6115 log10 (66 times) reductions at 1, 2, 4 and 8 h respectively (Fig. 3A). And the reduction of plaques was apparent (Fig. 3B).Figure 3Inactivation of Influenza A virus in PBS by 405 nm irradiation.

EMCV virus was irradiated at a high dose of 0.6 mW cm−2 similar to SARS-CoV-2 and IAV.In this case however, a total reduction of 0.0969 (approximately 2 times) in comparison to the untreated after 8 h of irradiation was observed (Fig. 4A,B) indicating a lower rate of inactivation (despite identical dosing) in contrast to the lipid-enveloped RNA viruses tested in this study. The plaque reduction at 8 h did not indicate the same dramatic reduction as observed with the latter studies.Figure 4Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) in PBS shows reduced susceptibility to 405 nm irradiation.

A reduction of 0.7 Log was observed by 4 h in comparison to the controls. By 24 h, a total of 1.7 log was observed using a standard LED light (Fig. 5).Figure 5Inactivation potential for SARS-CoV-2 using standard LED lighting containing spectral wavelengths from 400 to 420 nm. Standard LED lights were used to irradiate samples over a course 24 h while sampling at 4, 8, 12 and 24 h (done in independent triplicates). Blue bars indicate treated samples and red bars correspond to the untreated equivalent that was left at the biosafety cabinet under the same conditions while not subjected to disinfecting irradiation. Data shown as PFUml−1 in triplicate assessed by plaque assay.Full size imageDiscussionThe ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected day-to-day functions in the entire world, raising concerns not only with regards to therapeutics but also in the context of virus survivorship and decontamination36. Taking into consideration the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person by droplets, aerosols, and fomites, whole-room disinfection systems can be viewed as a supplement to best practices for interrupting transmission of the virus.Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we wanted to explore the impact of 405 nm enriched visible light technology on inactivation of respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus.Without the use of exogenous photosensitizers, we were able to show that irradiation with low intensity (0.035 mW cm−2) visible light yielded a reduction of log10 0.3288 inactivation after 4 h (0.5 J cm−2) and a total log10 1.0325 inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 after 24 h (3.02 J cm−2). A slightly higher dose (0.076 mW cm−2) resulted in log10 1.5393 reduction after 24 h (6.56 J cm−2) while an irradiation dose of 0.150 mW cm−2 showed a reduction log10 2.0056 after 24 h (12.96 J cm−2) of irradiation. Finally, increasing the dose to 0.6 mW cm−2 yielded log10 2.3010 reduction only after 8 h (17.28 J cm−2), indicating a both time and dose dependent inactivation of infectious viruses.The irradiations using standard LED lighting raise some interesting questions for further discussion. With nearly 6× the amount of disinfecting light as compared to traditional fluorescent lighting but 1/6th the lowest amount of 405 nm used in the study; it is conceivable that a reduction could be observed. The magnitude of this effect at less than 24 h was larger than expected based on other irradiations performed in this study (Fig. 5). These results at 24 h were largely consistent with other irradiation levels and reinforce the general observation of a 405 nm dose-dependent effect. The intermediate irradiation levels (4 h, 8 h, and 12 h) were generally larger than expected even when accounting for experimental uncertainty.A similar effect was observed by Bache, et al. in whole-room bacterial reduction studies37. They saw a disinfecting effect for irradiance values as low as 0.0023 mW cm−2. This effect was shown to be uncorrelated to the level of irradiance used suggesting that the mere abundance of 405 nm light can initiate the oxidizing chemical reaction. Nevertheless, our results clearly show a dose-dependent effect. One possible explanation for this observation is that the lower irradiance levels expose different responses by specific organisms within a population based on the individual biology of that organism. Clearly, these results suggest that additional factors may be at work and warrant further investigation.We selected conventional plaque assays as the read out to specifically estimate infectious virus titers upon disinfection. Methods based in the quantification of viral RNA via PCR based techniques might be misleading as they detect viral RNA from both infectious and noninfectious virions.SARS-CoV-2 is a lipid-enveloped virus composed of a ssRNA genome and our data indicates its susceptibility to visible light mediated inactivation. To further confirm these observations, we used influenza A virus. which is another human respiratory virus with a lipid envelope and a segmented-RNA genome. Upon irradiating for 1 h at 0.6 mW cm−2 (2.16 J cm−2), we observed a total reduction of log10 0.1619 for the influenza A virus compared to the reduction of log10 0.4150 for SARS-CoV-2 under the same conditions. While both viruses have lipid envelopes, there is clearly a difference here that will require further study. One possible explanation is the difference in the virion size creating a physically smaller cross-section for absorption. (IAV ~ 120 nm and SARS-CoV-2 ~ 200 nm)38,39. Nevertheless, both viruses were largely inactivated after 8 h achieving more 1.5 log10 reduction. Intriguingly, it was observed that both RNA viruses were able to remain stable at room temperature for at least 24 h, indicating minimal decay which is consistent with previous studies36,40. We next irradiated a non-enveloped RNA virus, EMCV. Previous results for visible light against non-enveloped viruses demonstrated the need for external photosensitizers such as artificial saliva, blood, feces, etc30,36. Without a porphyrin containing medium, we expected little to no inactivation when this virus was irradiated with visible light. For these measurements, we used the highest available irradiance of 0.6 mW cm−2. As anticipated, we observed only a log10 0.0969 reduction after 8 h, however, this appears to be with the statistical precision of the measurement based on the results obtained from shorter irradiations (1, 2, and 4 h). For comparison, a study involving the M13-bacteriophage virus (a non-enveloped virus) showed a 3-Log reduction using an irradiance of 50 mW cm−2 (almost 100 times greater than the highest irradiance used in this study) for 10 h at 425 nm further supporting the idea that non-enveloped viruses may require higher doses of visible light41.Our study was conducted using a neutral liquid media composed of PBS without any photosensitizers and we were able to show that visible light can indeed inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses, differing from the theory that states that photosensitizers are a requirement for inactivation. While these results provide insight into the basic science involved, they were performed within the context of the applied science needed to show the potential impact of this technology upon the current COVID-19 pandemic. By using safe, commercially practical irradiance levels, our results are more directly translatable to occupied rooms in the clinical environment.Other studies which used visible light-based irradiation have shown similar results in the absence of photosensitizers, indicating the possibility of an alternative inactivation mechanism23,25,30. Studies have proposed two theories for this observation primarily due to non-405 nm wavelengths emitted by the source: (1) some amount of 420–430 nm emitted from the source is contributing to the viral inactivation42, and (2) the presence of UV-A (390 nm) within the source. This wavelength is known to create oxidative stress upon viral capsids43.Longer wavelengths, such as 420–430 nm, have shown inactivation of the murine leukemia virus (MRV-A)42. While this is an intriguing study, it used a broad-spectrum lamp with optical filters to selectively identify the spectrum primarily responsible with their results. Unfortunately, they did not quantify the amount of light (using radiometric units) within the spectrum of interest used to irradiate the virus. While the transmission profile of the filters used was provided, it does not consider the spectral composition of the source itself making any direct quantitative comparison between our studies impossible. It is interesting to note that they did observe viral inactivation in their controls from wavelengths less than 420 nm confirming the qualitative findings of our study without confirming the specific use of 405 nm. This suggests that the viral inactivation is a likely a broad response (> 20 nm) with relative contributions unique to the chemistry of each organism. They also considered much longer exposures (~ 7 days) and much higher illuminance (> 200 lx) than that used in our study although this is again difficult to compare given the lack of radiometric quantification of their light source. It is important to note that the control samples used in our study were exposed to the same overhead (non-405 nm) lights as the irradiated samples and our results are the observed difference between the two demonstrating the contribution from 405 nm over and above that potentially from 420 to 430 nm. Future experiments can further quantify the potential effect.The other theory, potential UV-A irradiation, was historically applied to lamp-based sources with broad spectral (> 100 nm) outputs. Again, the use of LED technology addresses this question as the peak irradiance at 390 nm of the device used in this study was < 1% of its peak irradiance at 405 nm without the need for any additional filtration. Future experiments can further quantify the potential effect.Another consideration to be addressed is thermal heating of the virus by the LED source. Tsen and Achilefu used a pulsed laser method at 425 nm44 with ~ 100 mW cm−2 average power density for < 2 h while simultaneously measuring the sample temperature with a thermocouple. They detected less than a 2 °C demonstrating minimal temperature impact even under a power density nearly 9 orders of magnitude larger than that used in this study. This was confirmed by our thermocouple measurements as stated earlier. Nazari et al. used an 805 nm source with an average power density of > 0.3 W cm−2 for 10 s, nearly 1000 times that used in this study45. While the total energy delivered was more comparable to that used in our study, they did not make explicit temperature measurements, their analysis ruled out any potential thermal effects.One possible explanation for the observed differences between the enveloped and non-enveloped organisms is absorption of the 405 nm light by the lipid envelope itself. This could, in turn, lead to the creation of reactive oxygen species (causing an oxidative effect) or simply destruction of the envelope leading to a denaturing of the organism. This question could serve as the basis for a range of future studies.The results obtained suggest that the performance of visible light against SARS-CoV-2 is similar to other organisms commonly found in the environment such as S. aureus. Previous studies have shown that the visible light irradiance levels used in this study (0.035 mW cm−2 to 0.6 mW cm−2) reduce bacteria levels in occupied rooms and improve outcomes for surgical procedures. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that visible light might be an effective disinfectant against SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, this disinfection can operate continuously as it is safe for humans based upon the exposure guidelines in IEC 6247146. This means that once it has been in use for a period of time, the environment will be cleaner and safer at all future times including when it is occupied by humans.One limitation of this study is that the inactivation assays were performed in static liquid media as opposed to aerosolized droplets. While the use of visible light in air disinfection has been briefly studied where it was shown that its effectiveness increased approximately fourfold47, further studies involving dynamic aerosolization are needed to better understand the true potential of visible light mediated viral inactivation.In any case, our study shows the increased susceptibility of enveloped respiratory viral pathogens to 405 nm mediated inactivation in the absence of photosensitizers. The irradiances used in this study are very low and might be easily applied to disinfect occupied areas safely and continuously within hospitals, schools, restaurants, offices and other locations. Of particular interest is the potential for standard LED lighting to play a role in reducing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment.ConclusionsWe have demonstrated the basic science of inactivation of enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza-A using 405 nm visible light within the context of the applied science required for this technology to have an impact upon the current COVID-19 pandemic. Without the need for exogenous photosensitizers and by using safe, commercially practical irradiance levels, our results can be easily translated to the clinical environment.Future effortsFuture work should focus on explaining the difference between the enveloped and non-enveloped results. This may include transmission electron microscopy (TEM), hemagglutination assay (HA), or other methods focusing on the potential role that a mediated reaction (due to the envelope itself) might play. The size of the virion particle may play a role in photoelectric absorption and could be studied for different viral species. We acknowledge that while unlikely, other wavelengths of visible light, beyond 400–420 nm may play a role in the inactivation process and future studies should explore this possibility as well. Finally, the inactivation kinetics of low irradiances could add valuable insight into clinical applications of this technology. ReferencesAndersen, K. G., Rambaut, A., Lipkin, W. I., Holmes, E.

Credit: Towfiqu Barbhuiya, Unsplash. All Rights Reserved.ExpandOctober 1, 2021UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — More than five weeks into the fall semester, the COVID-19 vaccination rates among students, faculty and staff at University Park are continuing to rise as the positivity rate of University COVID-19 testing declines. The University continues to strongly encourage students, faculty and staff to get vaccinated for COVID-19 and influenza, as in-person classes will continue after Thanksgiving break. As of Oct. 1, more than 90% of students living on campus at University Park have confirmed with the University that they are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. More than 86% of students living off campus have uploaded proof of vaccination, and the overall vaccination rate among all students at University Park is more than 87%. Full-time academic personnel have a vaccination rate of more than 96% and administrators are vaccinated at a rate of 98%. Full-time nonunion staff have a vaccination rate of approximately 85% and the overall vaccination rate among employees at University Park is approximately 81%. "I'm pleased to see the vaccination rates at University Park continuing to climb," said Penn State President Eric J. Barron. “As we head into flu season, it’s more important than ever that everyone in our community gets vaccinated for COVID-19 and influenza. It’s the best way to protect yourself and your friends, family and fellow Penn Staters from getting seriously ill and will help us to be able to remain together on our campuses this fall.” Vaccination rates on Penn State Commonwealth Campuses also are climbing and each campus is working on strategies specific to the needs of their students, faculty and staff to increase their vaccination rates, which can be viewed on the University’s COVID-19 Dashboard. As part of the University’s fall health and safety plans, students, faculty and staff who have not shared with the University that they are fully vaccinated are required to test weekly for COVID-19. Starting this week, this requirement is being extended to unvaccinated part-time employees who work in the classroom. Face masks continue to be required by all individuals, regardless of their vaccination status, inside campus buildings. Significant consequences are in place through the Office of Student Conduct and Human Resources for those who do not comply with the required testing, up to and including separation from the University. To keep as many students as possible from facing interim suspension or expulsion, Student Affairs is contacting students facing these disciplinary measures to assist with any issues the students might be experiencing. Human Resources is examining employee testing data to determine the number of faculty and staff who are not in compliance. In addition to required testing, the University offers drop-in testing for students, faculty and staff at University Park who believe they may have been exposed to COVID-19 or who have been identified through contact tracing as a close contact of an infected individual. Testing for students who have symptoms of COVID-19 is available through University Health Services (UHS). As of Oct. 1, the seven-day positivity rate of all testing conducted by Penn State at University Park is 0.7%. The rate among student testing is 0.6% and the rate among employee testing is 1.2%. Out of 7,606 tests administered by the University over the past seven days, 51 have returned positive results. There are currently 23 students in isolation in University Park isolation space, and three students housed in quarantine. With Thanksgiving break a little more than seven weeks away, Penn State is urging all students who have not yet been vaccinated against COVID-19 to begin the process now so that they can be fully vaccinated before leaving campus for the break. Anyone who is traveling for the holiday should be fully vaccinated for both COVID-19 and the flu, continue to wear a mask and frequently wash hands to help prevent the spread of disease. Throughout the fall semester, Penn State will have COVID-19 vaccines available on or near all campuses. At University Park, first and second doses of the Moderna vaccine are readily available for Penn State students every Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from 8:15 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in the Student Health Center. Students can schedule appointments online through UHS. All three authorized COVID-19 vaccines are readily available at hospitals, urgent care centers, doctor’s offices and pharmacies. Providers can be easily located by visiting Vaccines.gov. UHS is hosting at least two additional flu vaccine clinics for University Park students this fall and may schedule more times to offer the flu vaccine to students. The next clinic is scheduled for 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Oct. 25 in Alumni Hall in the HUB-Robeson Center. Appointments must be scheduled in advance through myUHS; drop-in appointments are not available. Penn State Human Resources offers three ways for faculty and staff to receive a free flu vaccine. Employees and eligible spouses who are members of Penn State's health care plan can receive a vaccine at any network pharmacy or at their primary care physician’s office. All employees can utilize drive-through clinics, which will be held at most campuses in late September through October. Employees who do not participate in the Penn State health care plan, or who are not benefit-eligible, can also request a free voucher to receive a vaccine at CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Rite Aid and Safeway pharmacies, where available. Faculty and staff should visit the flu vaccine webpage to see the vaccine clinic schedule and instructions on how to register. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is safe to get both a flu shot and COVID-19 vaccine at the same time.

Future COVID-19 vaccines may need to be given annually, like the influenza vaccine, but carefully designed to avoid “immune imprinting” to prevent reduced efficacy against new variants. Immune imprinting is a phenomenon whereby prior exposure to one virus strain limits the development of immunity against new variant strains of the virus, while mainly only boosting responses to the original strain. The perspective, published in Trends in Immunology, was led by University of Melbourne Professor Stephen Kent, a laboratory head at the Doherty Institute, discusses whether new generation vaccines may need to be reformulated to combat a future global surge in infections. “We need to adapt quickly to these different strains and include the components in the new vaccines that are different to the original strain,” Professor Kent said. “We believe immune imprinting is going to be a problem and it is likely to be a growing issue every year when there is a new strain – that’s why we need to be thinking about the solution now. The good news is we are working towards a solution.” Professor Kent said imprinting had already been widely studied in Influenza infections and that the immune response became “imprinted” against previous strains, limiting robust neutralising antibodies to new strains. Imprinting is one reason why the annual flu vaccine is only partially effective. “We hypothesise that updated vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants might primarily boost “imprinted” immune responses to conserved regions of the spike protein to the detriment of new neutralising responses to new variants,” Professor Kent said. “We argue that this “updated strain” vaccine strategy will still yield partial efficacy against the new variants, particularly for vaccines that induce potent neutralising responses. “While existing vaccines have done a great job protecting us from the original SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is likely that new strains such as Delta will continue to emerge. In this case, repeated vaccine updates will be needed, and we should take into account the possibility that imprinting may limit vaccine effectiveness in the future.” Professor Kent said large studies of booster vaccines are needed and that internationally these trials are expected to start reporting early next year. Research teams at the Doherty Institute, including Professor Kent’s, are working on vaccines against Delta and other variants that try to avoid reduced effectiveness from immune imprinting. The team included many other members of the Doherty Institute including Dr Adam Wheatley, Dr Jennifer Juno, Dr Annette Fox, Professor Kanta Subbarao, and Dr Hyon-Xhi Tan.

Vaccines are free for these Horned Frogs in a year where public health is more critical than ever. “In the midst of the pandemic, I think it is crucial to be proactive by getting the flu shot to protect yourself and your community,” said Regina Meade, senior II nursing major and part of the marketing team for the TCU flu clinic. Nursing students and faculty understand that there may be several questions surrounding the flu vaccine while we are still in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and have developed a flu shot FAQ to help. In addition to vaccinating the campus population for influenza, the clinic serves as a massive service-learning project. Nursing students assemble every aspect of the clinic from marketing and planning to Spanish translation and logistics and, of course, administering the vaccine. “Nursing faculty and students have been providing this service for the last 15 years and it gives the students an opportunity to learn to manage the delivery of a mass event to the community by conducting marketing and outreach, learning management skills and implementing safe practice, procedures and quality care,” said Sharon Canclini, assistant professor of professional practice. Masks are required, and registration is required.

A potentially early and severe flu season could result from relaxed pandemic safety measures and the population’s reduced immunity to the flu after months of avoiding situations where viruses can spread, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. Flu season typically lasts from October to May in the Northern Hemisphere, and from April to September in the Southern Hemisphere, according to the CDC. The best time to get a flu vaccine – which reduces the risk of serious flu-related illness, hospitalization or death – is any time between September and the end of October, the CDC suggests. A nurse administers a flu vaccination shot to a woman at a free clinic held at a local library in Lakewood, California, on October 14, 2020. Mario Tama/Getty Images “People who are older, with compromised immune systems, may have waning immunity, and so sometimes are (advised not) to get their flu vaccines too early,” said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. “However, ‘too early’ generally refers to August. October – essentially now – is entirely fine for these individuals to get vaccinated.” Even if flu activity is low in your community right now, you shouldn’t wait for a surge in cases to be the reason you get a flu shot. Flu activity could increase at any time, according to the CDC. “Remember, after you are vaccinated, your body takes about two weeks to develop any antibodies that protect against flu,” the CDC noted. Getting your flu shot now can also help lessen the burden the health care system is facing as the pandemic continues. Some states – including Alabama, Georgia and Texas – have been running extremely low on intensive care unit capacity. (People with the flu can get sick enough to go to the hospital; during the 2019-2020 flu season there were 405,000 hospitalizations and 22,000 deaths among children and adults combined, according to the CDC.) Smile and let go a little -- learning to not be so hard on yourself can lead to a healthier lifestyle.

We want to prevent every flu infection possible to keep patients out of hospitals and other potential COVID-19 exposures in healthcare,” said Dr. David J. Cennimo, the associate chief of staff of education at VA New Jersey Health Care System, via email. Cennimo is also an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. Here’s what else you should know about getting your flu vaccine this season during the Covid-19 pandemic. Do I need a flu shot if I’m vaccinated against Covid-19? Some people think getting a flu or coronavirus vaccine reduces risks for both viruses, but that’s not the case, since these are different viruses, Wen said. Therefore, “getting a flu vaccine is the best protection against flu and its potentially serious complications, and getting a COVID-19 vaccine is the best protection against COVID-19,” the CDC said.

Since there are many flu viruses that constantly change, the makeup of US flu vaccines is reviewed yearly and updated as needed. Who can get a flu shot? People ages 6 months and older should get a licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine or nasal spray flu vaccine before the end of October, according to the CDC. Unless your doctor advises otherwise, you shouldn’t delay vaccination for a specific vaccine product if another age-appropriate vaccine is available. Where can I get a flu shot? In addition to the offices of physicians, including pediatricians, you can get a flu vaccine many places, including local health departments, pharmacies, and sometimes your workplace or that of an immediate family member. Can I get a flu shot and Covid-19 vaccine simultaneously? You can get a flu vaccine and a Covid-19 vaccine at the same time, the CDC and other experts have said, which wasn’t the case last year. Whether this also goes for third doses and booster shots of Covid-19 vaccines, too, hasn’t been publicly addressed by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, Cennimo said. One reason why last year was different is because Covid-19 vaccines “were only authorized in December,” Wen said. Also, they “were being actively studied for side effects,” Cennimo explained, and “the guidance to separate COVID (vaccines) from any other vaccine by 14 days was issued to allow any adverse effects to be accurately attributed to the vaccine. If you gave two vaccines together, you wouldn’t know which caused the problem. 21 September 2020, Bavaria, Allmannsdorf: Two women walk in the evening sun on the dam of Lake Brombach with Nordic Walking sticks.

If I wear a mask and practice physical distancing, should I still get a flu shot? Even if you wear a mask and physically distance yourself from others, getting vaccinated against the flu and Covid-19 is still the best way to protect yourself and others, according to the CDC.

We should do everything we can to prevent further illness, suffering and death.” CNN’s Jamie Gumbrecht and Lauren Mascarenhas contributed to this story.

Sanofi Pivots mRNA Vaccine Program from COVID-19 to Flu, Pathogens September 29, 2021 Sanofi said it is pivoting its messenger RNA vaccine (mRNA) program away from COVID-19 and toward influenza and other pathogens, despite announcing positive Phase I/II data for the vaccine candidate it had been co-developing with Translate Bio. Sanofi acquired Translate over the summer for $3.2 billion. [Sanofi] Sanofi said it is pivoting its messenger RNA vaccine (mRNA) program—acquired over the summer when it bought Translate Bio for $3.2 billion—away from COVID-19 and toward influenza and other pathogens, despite announcing positive Phase I/II data for the vaccine candidate it had been co-developing with Translate. Thomas Triomphe, executive vice president, Sanofi Pasteur, told reporters Tuesday that Sanofi was vacating the crowded COVID-19 vaccine field after concluding that its mRNA vaccine program stood a better chance of commercial success by refocusing its now clinically validated platform technology to the flu and other diseases. Sanofi reasons that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate it is co-developing with Translate Bio, MRT5500, won’t be able to reach the market for at least another year or two—leaving the pharma giant commercially further behind such category leaders as Pfizer and BioNTech’s Comirnaty® and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine, also known as mRNA-1273 and marketed in Europe and Canada as Spikevax™. “If we had come to market at the end of 2022 or early 2023, we would have been late and with no differentiation,” Triomphe said during a media briefing. “There is no public health need now for another messenger RNA vaccine against COVID-19 when you can walk down the street to any pharmacy and get one.” Triomphe spoke hours after Sanofi trumpeted positive initial data from a Phase I/II trial of MRT5500 that showed neutralizing antibody seroconversion (defined as four-fold increase vs baseline) in 91% to 100% of study participants, two weeks after a second injection, across all three dosages tested. Sanofi said no safety concern had been seen, while the tolerability profile was comparable to that of other unmodified mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Further data from the Phase I/II trial, Sanofi added, will be presented at an unspecified later date. “Promising mRNA platform” “These results will clearly help inform the path forward for our mRNA development programs,” Jean-Francois Toussaint, global head of research and development, Sanofi Pasteur, said in a statement. “Today, we have a promising mRNA platform, which we’re taking to the next level in development, including moving to modified mRNA, and against other diseases, including flu.” MRT5500 is an mRNA vaccine based on Translate Bio’s MRT™ platform, which it acquired from Shire in 2017. Sanofi liked the unmodified mRNA platform so much that it bought Lexington, MA-based Translate for $3.2 billion over the summer, in a deal completed September 14. Sanofi and Translate Bio began partnering on mRNA vaccines in 2018, launching an up-to-$805 million-plus collaboration in June 2018. Last year, Sanofi and Translate Bio expanded their collaboration to develop mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases, with the pharma giant nearly tripling to more than $2.3 billion its potential payout to Translate, and the companies increasing from five to seven the maximum number they plan to develop under that partnership. Most of that expanded collaboration (up to $1.94 billion) consisted of payments tied to milestones, with Sanofi committing $425 million to Translate Bio upfront, consisting of $300 million cash and a private placement common stock investment of $125 million. “We generated immunogenicity data, neutralization data for a number of infectious disease targets, both from the viral and the bacterial side. The productivity of that relationship was just a very natural foundation for when we decided to start working together on COVID-19,” Translate Bio CEO Ronald C. Renaud Jr. said in September 2020 as a guest on “GEN Live”, GEN’s monthly live-streaming video discussion series. Sanofi is not abandoning COVID-19 vaccine and drug development entirely. The company said it will continue development of the adjuvanted recombinant protein vaccine candidate developed with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which combines Sanofi’s S-protein COVID-19 antigen based on recombinant DNA technology and GSK’s pandemic AS03 adjuvant. The Sanofi-GSK vaccine candidate advanced in May into a Phase III trial in 35,000 volunteers aged 18 and older from the United States and countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The greater public health need, Sanofi concluded, is an mRNA flu vaccine, where Sanofi has targeted next year to begin clinical studies of a modified quadrivalent seasonal influenza candidate. Two formulations Sanofi is already assessing two mRNA vaccine formulations with different lipid nanoparticles based on Translate Bio tech—MRT5400 and MRT5401—against seasonal influenza in an ongoing Phase I trial that launched in June. That trial is evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of a monovalent flu vaccine candidate coding for the hemagglutinin protein of the A/H3N2 strain of the influenza virus across both vaccine formulations. Last month, Translate Bio said in a regulatory filing that it and Sanofi expected to have interim data from the trial by the end of this year. Translate Bio also disclosed in the filing that Sanofi paid it a milestone payment of $25 million upon the start of the Phase I/II trial of MRT5500 in March, followed three months later with another $50 million from Sanofi upon the successful manufacture, release and delivery of clinical drug product to supply the Phase I trial of MRT5400 and MRT5401. Also in June, Sanofi paid Translate Bio a $4 million milestone payment upon the start of the MRT5400-MRT5401 trial. Sanofi’s pivot to flu and pathogens marks the company’s latest move toward positioning itself as a leader in mRNA vaccine development. In April, Sanofi acquired Tidal Therapeutics for $160 million upfront plus up to $310 million tied to achieving milestones. Privately-owned Tidal had developed an mRNA-based tech platform for in vivo reprogramming of immune cells inside the body, allowing for an off-the-shelf approach to developing CAR-T therapies. Tidal’s platform uses proprietary nanoparticles to deliver mRNA selectively, with initial applications targeting specific types of immune cells. Sanofi concluded that the platform offered potential to expand its research capabilities in both immuno-oncology and inflammatory diseases, as well as applicability to other disease areas as well. Two months after buying Tidal Therapeutics, Sanofi announced plans in June to launch an mRNA Center of Excellence with approximately €400 million ($467 million) a year in funding. That Center is intended to accelerate the development and delivery of next-generation vaccines by joining approximately 400 employees together with end-to-end mRNA vaccine capabilities that include dedicated R&D, digital, and chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) teams across sites at Cambridge, MA, and Marcy l’Etoile, Lyon, France. Sanofi’s share price on the Euronext Paris market dipped 0.35% or €0.29 ($0.34) in late-day trading, to €81.82 ($95.59).

Positive topline results were announced from a phase 3 study evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of Prevnar 20 (pneumococcal 20-valent conjugate vaccine) administered with the seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluad Quadrivalent [adjuvanted], 2020/2021 strains) in adults 65 years of age and older. The randomized, double-blind trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04526574) enrolled a total of 1796 participants, of which 1727 completed the study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the Prevnar 20 and seasonal influenza vaccine at the same visit followed by a saline injection 1 month later or saline injection and seasonal influenza vaccine at the same visit followed by Prevnar 20 one month later. Findings demonstrated that the administration of Prevnar 20 with seasonal influenza vaccine elicited responses that were noninferior to those observed when the vaccines were administered 1 month apart. Moreover, the safety profile of Prevnar 20 was found to be similar when the vaccines were administered together compared with when the vaccines were administered 1 month apart. “We are encouraged by these results showing that these 2 vaccines can be administered at the same time without affecting the immune protection provided by either vaccine or changing the safety profile,” said Kathrin U. Jansen, PhD, Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development, Pfizer. “This study adds to the body of evidence further supporting that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines may be coadministered with influenza vaccines, this time studied with the adjuvanted influenza vaccine.” The Company is also conducting a phase 3 trial investigating the safety and immunogenicity of Prevnar 20 coadministered with a booster dose of Comirnaty (COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA) in adults 65 years of age and older.

This first Incident Coordination Group on avian influenza aim to gather needs from ECOWAS countries and Mauritania affected or threatened by HPAI events and coordinate any activities supporting them to... 27/09/2021 15 September 2021, virtual — For large-scale animal health emergencies that require system-wide mobilization due to the scale of their impact, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), through the support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), is committed to leading global coordination for animal health emergencies with severe impact on food security and livelihoods. This is the case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which has ravaged poultry population in some countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) region such as Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Togo. To support ECOWAS countries and Mauritania to better coordinate, prepare and respond to HPAI, FAO assisted the Regional Animal Health Center (RAHC) of ECOWAS to launch today the first Incident Coordination Group (ICG) on HPAI, with the participation of ECOWAS Chief veterinary services and laboratory directors, regional animal health networks including the epidemiological surveillance (RESEPI) and the veterinary laboratories (RESOLAB) ones, the World Health Organization (WHO), the West African Health Organization (WAHO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the African Union – Interafrican Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR); the ECOWAS Directorate of Environment and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). During the opening session, in representation of FAO, Lionel Gbaguidi, Animal Production Health Officer at the FAO sub regional office for West Africa affirmed that “FAO supports this initiative through its Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) to strengthen the capacity of ECOWAS countries to coordinate prevention and control actions against avian flu, mobilize their networks of experts and restore damaged livelihoods ”. Nick Nwankpa, on behalf of AU-IBAR stated that “in the region, poultry was the fastest growing sector from 2005 to 2015. The emergence of HPAI in the ECOWAS region is of critical concern. We are happy to assist to the creation of the first Incident Coordination Group that serves to agree on an action plan to fight HPAI”. ECOWAS RAHC Executive Director, Vivian Iwar, welcomed participants to the first ICG session. She further added that “the implications of HPAI must be avoided. ECOWAS countries need a coordinated approach to fight the spread of HPAI, hence the need of this Incident Coordination Group that will support and reinforce national veterinary services”. FAO and ECOWAS aligning efforts This first Incident Coordination Group on HPAI aim to gather needs from ECOWAS countries and Mauritania affected or threatened by HPAI events and coordinate any activities supporting them to better prepare and control those events. Running the ICG will also enable FAO to acquire up-to-date knowledge to develop a strategic framework for strengthening the regional coordination of HPAI emergencies and outbreaks. Participants in this first session come from various backgrounds and organizations, making the ICG best suited to address HPAI specific threats. The creation of the ICG will set the overall strategy for the preparedness, response and overall coordination of HPAI events, and will help to align efforts of animal health, public health and food security experts at the national, regional and global level. One Health approach Incident coordination groups (ICGs) are a solid example of tripartite members joining forces and strengthening One Health collaboration, recognizing the interconnection between people, animals, plants, and their shared environment.. The OIE, WHO, WAHO and UNEP are involved in this first ICG focused on HPAI that will promote cooperation and collaboration among animal health organizations, key partners and the public health sector. This first Incident Coordination Group in the ECOWAS region and Mauritania has already proven positive. Information sharing at global level and collaboration with WHO, OIE and other key partners in the countries and regions have been enhanced, while improving a One Health strategic approach to the prevention and control of existing and future animal health threats. Main highlights and conclusions The holding of the event is a great success, as it has had an impact on its perpetuation and on the continuity of exchanges between the many members of the networks, organisations and partners operating in the ECOWAS region and Mauritania, which promotes its sustainability in the short and medium term. More than 70 participants attended this first ICG virtual session, which gave the opportunity to HPAI national and regional experts to share their experiences, agree on key actions for HPAI control and, improve the preparedness and response capacities of veterinary services and adjust the RAHC action plan against HPAI in West Africa.

September 29, 2021 Share › Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share by Email Print A recently approved pneumococcal vaccine that protects against 20 types of bugs can be safely given together with an adjuvanted influenza vaccine in adults aged 65 and older, according to late-stage clinical trial results. Drugmaker Pfizer tested the protective response and safety of Prevnar 20 when given one month before or at the same time as SIIV Fluad quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (2020/2021 strains), a flu vaccine often recommended for older adults. Study participants’ immune responses to both the pneumonia and flu drugs were the same, whether given together or a month apart, the company reported. And the safety profile of Prevnar 20 was “similar” when given in either time frame, it said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends administration of pneumococcal vaccines PCV13 or PPSV23 during the same visit with influenza vaccination. The Food and Drug Administration approved Prevnar 20 in June, but health officials have not announced recommendations for its use. CDC to decide on drug’s use in October The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, is scheduled to convene in October, and may decide at that time how Prevnar 20 and a newly approved drug made by Merck should be used in practice. Prevnar 20 was the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to protect against 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes in adults aged 18 years and older, according to drugmaker Pfizer. Merck’s new drug Vaxneuvance, meanwhile, protects against 15 strains of bacteria that can cause pneumonia and other acute respiratory disease, and has shown evidence of efficacy in older adults. It was federally approved in July. Taking two vaccines during a doctor visit raises the likelihood that a patient will actually get both recommended vaccines, according to Pfizer. Vaccination rates are known to decline when multiple appointments are needed, it noted in a statement accompanying the new clinical trial results. “The results of this trial support current CDC clinical guidance allowing co-administration during a single doctor or pharmacy appointment, so that more adults are able to help protect themselves against both of these respiratory diseases,” said Luis Jodar, Ph.D., senior vice president and chief medical officer, Pfizer Vaccines.

It is not known for how long those seeking help had struggled with the problems - it could have been days or weeks.Nor was the severity of the symptoms documented. And the researchers acknowledged there was growing evidence that those who had fallen severely ill with Covid could have long-lasting and debilitating symptoms. They said more research was needed into the issue of long Covid, but said the study did also shine a light on how little is known about persistent ill-health caused by flu."Long-term symptoms from flu have probably been overlooked before," added Dr Max Taquet, another of the lead researchers.LOOK-UP TOOL: How many cases in your area?SYMPTOMS: What are they and how to guard against them?YOUR QUESTIONS: We answer your queriesTREATMENTS: What progress are we making to help people?NEW VARIANTS: How worried should we be?Is 'the worst cold ever' going around?Have I got Covid, a bad cold or something else?Long CovidFluRelatedHouseplant business grows from long Covid ordeal13 Oct 2024WalesLong Covid sufferer's call for better support17 Sep 2024West Yorkshire‘I grieve for the person I was before' - Covid inquiry to begin new phase9 Sep 2024HealthMore25 mins agoNHS urges vulnerable to get Covid and flu vaccinesThousands of those eligible for free winter vaccinations fail to take up the offer, the NHS says.25 mins agoEngland30 Oct 2024Flu vaccine scheme could help ease winter pressureChildren from reception to year 11 are being offered a flu vaccine.30 Oct 2024Bristol29 Oct 2024States unsure how long Sark got free flu jabs forIt says it is unclear how many years the issue continued29 Oct 2024Guernsey20 Oct 2024Parents urged to catch up on vaccinationsHealth chiefs say half-term is a good time for children to receive vaccinations.20 Oct 202413 Oct 2024Record start for autumn Covid booster campaignMore than 40,000 people had Covid-19 or flu vaccinations since the campaign began on 3 October.13 Oct 2024British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsUS ElectionSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthVideoLiveAudioWeatherBBC ShopBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2024 BBC.

(AP Photo/LM Otero, File)TOPICS:ChinaEuropeHealth Medical PharmaUnited StatesWorld Health Organizationst. jude children's research hospitalRichard WebbyST. JUDE CHILDREN'S RESEARCH HOSPITAL, INC.Amid all the focus on COVID-19 vaccinations, U.S. health experts have another plea: Don't skip your flu shot.Flu cases have dropped to historically low levels during the pandemic. The U.S. and Europe experienced hardly any flu last winter, and the Southern Hemisphere just ended its second flu season of the coronavirus pandemic with little to report.But with U.S. schools and businesses reopened, international travel resuming and far less masking this fall, flu could make a comeback. The big question is whether it will trickle in or roar back and put extra pressure on hospitals already struggling with COVID-19 surges."People are sick to death of hearing about having to roll on out and get vaccines of any sort," said flu specialist Richard Webby of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis.Yet after 18 months of little influenza exposure, "we probably as a population don't have as much immunity against this virus as we typically might," Webby said. "It makes absolute sense to go on out and get that vaccine and at least prepare for something that, you know, could be quite severe."Here are some things to know:______________Q: Who should get a flu vaccine?A: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says just about everybody needs an annual flu vaccination, starting with 6-month-old babies. Influenza is most dangerous for adults over age 65, young children, pregnant women and people with certain health conditions, such as heart or lung disease.Q: Why do I need one this year, since flu hasn't been a threat during the pandemic?A: COVID-19 restrictions including masking and staying home — especially for children, who are flu's biggest spreaders — clearly had a side benefit of tamping down influenza and other respiratory bugs. But as soon as masks started to come off, the U.S. experienced an unusual summer surge of children hospitalized with a different virus, named RSV, that usually strikes in the winter. That's a worrying sign of what to expect if flu returns.Q: What's the forecast for flu this winter?A: Flu is notoriously difficult to predict. But there's a little more circulating in some countries this fall than last, including a recent uptick in China, said Webby, who directs a World Health Organization flu center. And people may be a little more vulnerable: Before the pandemic, 15% to 30% of the population was exposed to flu each year, a missing bump in immunity, he said."If flu does at least get a foothold in, it's going to have more opportunity of spreading this season," he said.Q: When should I get a flu vaccine?A: Now. The CDC encourages people to get their vaccine by the end of October. Doctors' offices, retail pharmacies and local health departments have millions of doses in hand. And most Americans with health insurance can get it with no co-pay.Q: I already got a COVID-19 vaccine. Do I really need a flu shot, too?A: COVID-19 vaccines prevent the coronavirus and flu vaccines prevent influenza. They don't overlap. But you can catch both viruses at the same time, or one after the other."Avoid the double whammy" and get both vaccines, advised the American College of Emergency Physicians. For now, COVID-19 vaccines are available for anyone 12 and older.Flu vaccines aren't as powerful as vaccines against some other diseases but if people do get influenza anyway, they tend to have a much milder illness.Q: Can I get a flu vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same visit?A: Yes, the CDC says it's fine to pair a flu vaccine with either a primary COVID-19 shot or a booster dose.Q: What's the best flu vaccine to get?A: Flu constantly evolves, and each year's vaccine is made to fight the strains that international experts deem most likely to circulate. This year all the flu vaccines offered in the U.S. offer protection against all four of those strains. Options include traditional shots or a nasal spray vaccine. There also are shots specifically designed to rev up seniors' age-weakened immune systems, either with a higher dose or an added immune booster. There are also options for people allergic to eggs, which are used to make some flu shots.Q: How much flu vaccine is available?A: The CDC expects vaccine manufacturers to deliver 188 million to 200 million doses. Nearly 194 million doses were distributed last winter, a record.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...4 tips for journalists covering religious exemptions to vaccine mandates Skip to content Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy About The Journalist’s ResourceFollow us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDonate Main Menu About The Journalist’s ResourceFollow us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDonate Criminal JusticeEconomicsEducationEnvironmentHealthMediaPolitics & GovernmentRace & Gender Search for: Criminal JusticeEconomicsEducationEnvironmentHealthMediaPolitics & GovernmentRace & Gender Expert Commentary Education, Health, Politics & Government4 tips for covering religious exemptions to vaccine mandates Law professor Dorit Reiss, whose research focuses on vaccine mandates and religious exemptions, offers advice on how journalists should think about and cover these issues amid COVID-19. by Denise-Marie Ordway | September 28, 2021 | Vaccines(Denise-Marie Ordway) Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Email Republish This Article Close window XRepublish this articleThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.

Pope Francis, for example, <a href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/popeews/2021-08/pope-francis-appeal-covid-19-vaccines-act-of-love.html">recently urged</a> people to get inoculated as an “act of love.” The First Presidency, the highest governing body of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, <a href="https:/ewsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/first-presidency-message-covid-19-august-2021">also encourages COVID-19 vaccination</a>.</p> <p>Many of those who oppose immunization also are going online to share tips and resources and strategize ways to forgo required vaccinations on religious grounds. Workers, parents and others are gathering in Facebook groups that, as <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/09/inside-the-private-facebook-groups-where-anti-vaxxers-plot-to-get-religious-exemptions/">Mother Jones magazine reports</a>, have grown from hundreds of members to thousands within a short period.</p> <p><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/author/kiera-butler/">Kiera Butler</a>, a senior editor at the publication, <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/09/inside-the-private-facebook-groups-where-anti-vaxxers-plot-to-get-religious-exemptions/">writes</a> that while some “seem earnest in their religious objections to the vaccines, others skirt the line of opportunism.”</p> <p>“Though most of the religious exemption social media groups are only a few weeks old, it’s clear that they have already become powerful sources of camaraderie and identity,” she writes.</p> <p>A 2018 study published in the journal Sociological Perspectives shows how some parents already were gaming the system. In “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0731121418755113?casa_token=h0gzFChI_psAAAAA%3Acv8_a81Jo4zMEcdv7aDJHf7k1to5CJzZZ6XsR2lgW1ERsS2OoXcrAhmkr7oX1Iz3A8yMxBDl9K9hIA">I Have to Write a Statement of Moral Conviction. Can Anyone Help?”: Parents’ Strategies for Managing Compulsory Vaccination Laws</a>,” sociologist <a href="https://clas.ucdenver.edu/sociology/jennifer-reich">Jennifer Reich</a> describes how parents strategize to use vaccine exemptions and “craft claims of religiousness to justify opting out of vaccines, even as they lack religious beliefs that would be violated by using vaccines.”</p> <p>Some parents allow their kids to receive one or more vaccines but tell schools the children haven't had any so they qualify for a religious exemption, writes Reich, a professor at the University of Colorado Denver. </p> <p>"Outside of formal documentation, parents suggest to each other that they manage information carefully," she writes. "As one mother advises online, 'Whatever you do, less is best, be nice, not defensive. Provide the minimum letter, reiterate the statute and be vague if necessary. Don’t discuss your choices with other school families unless you trust them.'”</p> <p>As of Sept. 27, more than 213 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total" target="_blank">million people nationwide</a> had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine -- 64% of the population, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. <a href="https://journalistsresource.org/health/vaccine-hesitancy-research-roundup-data-sources/">Vaccine hesitancy</a> is strong in some parts of the country. Vaccination rates tend to track closely with political views -- most under-vaccinated states lean Republican, Anthony Fauci, the White House’s top medical advisor, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/09/22ation/fauci-decries-politicization-covid-19-vaccines-urges-people-get-their-shots-fight-their-common-enemy-deadly-virus/">told The Boston Globe</a>.</p> <p>A Pew Research Center survey conducted in August <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/20/10-facts-about-americans-and-coronavirus-vaccines/">supports Fauci’s assertion</a>. It finds Democrats are much more likely than Republicans to report receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine -- 86% compared to 60%.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/08/vaccine-mandates-republicans-democrats/619735/">several recent polls</a> indicate a majority of vaccinated Americans want COVID-19 shots to be required. A poll conducted this past summer by <a href="https://covidstates.org/">the COVID States Project</a>, a group of researchers from various universities, finds that <a href="/Users/dordway/Downloads/COVID19%20CONSORTIUM%20REPORT%2058%20REQUIRE%20July%202021.pdf">64% of U.S. adults</a> think federal, state or local governments should require everyone to get immunized against COVID-19.</p> <p>Because vaccination, civil liberties, employment law and health policy are all complicated topics, we asked law professor <a href="https://www.uchastings.edu/people/dorit-reiss/">Dorit Reiss</a> for advice on how journalists should think about and cover religious exemptions to vaccine mandates. Reiss teaches a course on vaccines at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law. She also researches and <a href="http://libraryweb.uchastings.edu/library/bibliographies/faculty/Dorit-Rubinstein-Reiss/">has written extensively</a> on vaccine mandates and religious exemptions.</p> <p>Here are the four tips Reiss shared:</p> <p>-------------------------</p> <h2><strong>1. Don’t assume employers, colleges or schools that require COVID-19 vaccinations will offer religious exemptions. If they do, don’t assume exemption requests will be approved.</strong></h2> <p>Title VII of the federal <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/statutesitle-vii-civil-rights-act-1964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> requires U.S. employers, including government agencies, to accommodate employees whose religious beliefs and practices conflict with work requirements -- so long as it doesn’t create an “undue hardship” for the employer, Reiss explains. That means workplace administrators must let employees request an exemption if vaccines are required for work, but don’t have to grant them.</p> <p>An accommodation “may cause undue hardship if it is costly, compromises workplace safety, decreases workplace efficiency, infringes on the rights of other employees, or requires other employees to do more than their share of potentially hazardous or burdensome work,” <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/oasam/civil-rights-center/internal/policieseligious-discrimination-accommodation">according to the U.S. Department of Labor</a>. In 1977, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/758rans-world-airlines-v-hardison">interpreted</a> “undue hardship” to mean incurring more than a <em>de minimis</em>, or minimal, expense.</p> <p>Title VII applies to employees at colleges and K-12 schools, but not students. State law generally governs whether college students and kids in kindergarten through high school can ask to be exempted from receiving the various vaccines required for enrollment. Because of that, policies vary considerably across the U.S.</p> <p>As of mid-September, 26 of the nation’s 50 biggest public university campuses did not require students to get inoculated against COVID-19, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-education-coronavirus-pandemic-only-on-ap-ca10e95511b4940375c037e871f939cd">an analysis from The Associated Press finds</a>.</p> <p>While no state has yet mandated COVID-19 shots for students in kindergarten through 12<sup>th</sup> grade, some school districts in California are considering a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for kids. Earlier this month, the Los Angeles Unified School District <a href="https://www.desertsun.com/storyews/education/2021/09/12/l-a-schools-require-vaccines-but-other-districts-no-rush/8310038002/">became the first major school system in the U.S.</a> to require students over age 12 to be vaccinated, the Desert Sun in Palm Springs reports.</p> <p>Six states prohibit K-12 schools from granting exemptions to vaccine requirements on religious grounds, <a href="https://www.ncsl.orgesearch/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx">according to the National Conference of State Legislatures</a>. Those states are California, Connecticut, Maine, Mississippi, New York and West Virginia.</p> <h2><strong>2. Know that some people make false claims to obtain religious exemptions.</strong></h2> <p>Reiss argues there are two major drawbacks to offering religious exemptions to vaccine requirements. First, many people game these exemptions, falsely claiming a religion they don’t follow or that their religious beliefs prohibit inoculation when they actually do not, she says. Secondly, employers, government agencies, colleges and others have difficulty verifying the sincerity of claims -- or don’t bother.</p> <p>“Given the amount of misinformation about vaccine safety and the virus, chances are that most of the exemption requests are from people who do not want to get COVID-19 vaccines because of safety concerns or misinformation about the pandemic,” Reiss <a href="https://blog.petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/2021/07/16eligious-exemptions-to-vaccines-and-the-anti-vax-movement/">writes in a recent article</a> on the Bill of Health blog, published by the <a href="https://petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/">Petrie-Flom Center</a> at Harvard Law School.</p> <p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13001898?casa_token=knDp5I6QOMYAAAAA:AHFXpg-1x21dGoj3Vc1Fz9EFZheJI_L3HCEdcMBRc0MMQvo5MoZVj7KQDLZx5Floqa1zaoILaaI#!">A 2013 paper in the academic journal Vaccine</a> offers a broad overview of how the teachings of various religions apply to vaccines.</p> <p>Academic research indicates some people seek religious exemptions for reasons that are not actually rooted in religion. For example, <a href="https://jme.bmj.com/content/44/6/389.abstract?casa_token=v21MZr9hu8wAAAAA:BIkNEvGtfXwN-Fs4ZLKFr_gqKAPTmFUYkxvd6inzpX3wvhKvscas8q4x9yqtcnJoWWfMOKMK7g40">a 2018 study in the Journal of Medical Ethics</a> finds that employees sought religious exemptions to a Cincinnati hospital’s flu vaccine mandate for various reasons, including concerns about the benefit of the vaccine. Some employee claims focused on false or misleading information about how the vaccine was manufactured.</p> <h2><strong>3. Understand the most common reasons people seek religious exemptions.</strong></h2> <p>Reiss says religious exemption requests tend to focus on one or more of the following four issues:</p> <ul> <li>Vaccines are linked to abortion. <p>Cells derived from aborted fetuses <a href="https:/heconversation.com/cells-from-human-foetuses-are-important-for-developing-vaccines-but-theyre-not-an-ingredient-157484">have been used for years to make vaccines</a>, including some COVID-19 vaccines. <a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/docs/vaccine/VaccineDevelopment_FetalCellLines.pdf">Public health officials stress</a> that while researchers used cells originally isolated from human fetal tissue to develop or test some COVID-19 vaccines, none of the vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. contain fetal cells. They also stress the vaccines don’t use fetal cells from recent abortions.</p> <p>“Cells that make up the ‘cell lines’ used for certain COVID-19 vaccine development came from two elective pregnancy terminations that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s,” the Michigan Department of Health &amp; Human Services <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/documents/coronavirus/COVID-19_Vaccines_and_Fetal_Cells_031921_720415_7.pdf">points out in an informational document</a>.</p> <p>When making vaccines, fetal cells can be used “as miniature ‘factories’ to generate vast quantities of adenoviruses, disabled so that they cannot replicate, that are used as vehicles to ferry genes from the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19,” <a href="https://www.science.orgews/2020/06/abortion-opponents-protest-covid-19-vaccines-use-fetal-cells">explains Science magazine</a>, published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. “When the adenoviruses are given as a vaccine, recipients' cells begin to produce proteins from the coronavirus, hopefully triggering a protective immune response.”</p> <p>Fetal cells were used to produce and manufacture the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine and during testing of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-johnson-aborted/fact-check-johnson-johnsons-covid-19-vaccine-does-not-contain-aborted-fetal-cells-idUSL1N2LU1T9">Reuters Fact Check confirms</a>.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Vaccine manufacturers use blood to create vaccines. <p>Vaccines typically do not contain human blood products. However, products derived from animals, including animal blood, can be used to grow disease-causing bacteria and viruses in a lab.

Anti-vaccine advocates, local churches and legal groups have offered their assistance for free or for a fee, even as high-ranking faith leaders worldwide speak out in support of COVID-19 vaccines. Pope Francis, for example, recently urged people to get inoculated as an “act of love.” The First Presidency, the highest governing body of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also encourages COVID-19 vaccination. Many of those who oppose immunization also are going online to share tips and resources and strategize ways to forgo required vaccinations on religious grounds. Workers, parents and others are gathering in Facebook groups that, as Mother Jones magazine reports, have grown from hundreds of members to thousands within a short period. Kiera Butler, a senior editor at the publication, writes that while some “seem earnest in their religious objections to the vaccines, others skirt the line of opportunism.” “Though most of the religious exemption social media groups are only a few weeks old, it’s clear that they have already become powerful sources of camaraderie and identity,” she writes. A 2018 study published in the journal Sociological Perspectives shows how some parents already were gaming the system. In “I Have to Write a Statement of Moral Conviction. Can Anyone Help?”: Parents’ Strategies for Managing Compulsory Vaccination Laws,” sociologist Jennifer Reich describes how parents strategize to use vaccine exemptions and “craft claims of religiousness to justify opting out of vaccines, even as they lack religious beliefs that would be violated by using vaccines.” Some parents allow their kids to receive one or more vaccines but tell schools the children haven’t had any so they qualify for a religious exemption, writes Reich, a professor at the University of Colorado Denver. “Outside of formal documentation, parents suggest to each other that they manage information carefully,” she writes. “As one mother advises online, ‘Whatever you do, less is best, be nice, not defensive. Provide the minimum letter, reiterate the statute and be vague if necessary. Don’t discuss your choices with other school families unless you trust them.’” As of Sept. 27, more than 213 million people nationwide had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine — 64% of the population, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. Vaccine hesitancy is strong in some parts of the country. Vaccination rates tend to track closely with political views — most under-vaccinated states lean Republican, Anthony Fauci, the White House’s top medical advisor, told The Boston Globe. A Pew Research Center survey conducted in August supports Fauci’s assertion. It finds Democrats are much more likely than Republicans to report receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine — 86% compared to 60%. Meanwhile, several recent polls indicate a majority of vaccinated Americans want COVID-19 shots to be required. A poll conducted this past summer by the COVID States Project, a group of researchers from various universities, finds that 64% of U.S. adults think federal, state or local governments should require everyone to get immunized against COVID-19. Because vaccination, civil liberties, employment law and health policy are all complicated topics, we asked law professor Dorit Reiss for advice on how journalists should think about and cover religious exemptions to vaccine mandates. Reiss teaches a course on vaccines at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law. She also researches and has written extensively on vaccine mandates and religious exemptions. Here are the four tips Reiss shared: ————————- 1. Don’t assume employers, colleges or schools that require COVID-19 vaccinations will offer religious exemptions. If they do, don’t assume exemption requests will be approved. Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires U.S. employers, including government agencies, to accommodate employees whose religious beliefs and practices conflict with work requirements — so long as it doesn’t create an “undue hardship” for the employer, Reiss explains. That means workplace administrators must let employees request an exemption if vaccines are required for work, but don’t have to grant them. An accommodation “may cause undue hardship if it is costly, compromises workplace safety, decreases workplace efficiency, infringes on the rights of other employees, or requires other employees to do more than their share of potentially hazardous or burdensome work,” according to the U.S. Department of Labor. In 1977, the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted “undue hardship” to mean incurring more than a de minimis, or minimal, expense. Title VII applies to employees at colleges and K-12 schools, but not students. State law generally governs whether college students and kids in kindergarten through high school can ask to be exempted from receiving the various vaccines required for enrollment. Because of that, policies vary considerably across the U.S. As of mid-September, 26 of the nation’s 50 biggest public university campuses did not require students to get inoculated against COVID-19, an analysis from The Associated Press finds. While no state has yet mandated COVID-19 shots for students in kindergarten through 12th grade, some school districts in California are considering a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for kids. Earlier this month, the Los Angeles Unified School District became the first major school system in the U.S. to require students over age 12 to be vaccinated, the Desert Sun in Palm Springs reports. Six states prohibit K-12 schools from granting exemptions to vaccine requirements on religious grounds, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those states are California, Connecticut, Maine, Mississippi, New York and West Virginia. 2. Know that some people make false claims to obtain religious exemptions. Reiss argues there are two major drawbacks to offering religious exemptions to vaccine requirements. First, many people game these exemptions, falsely claiming a religion they don’t follow or that their religious beliefs prohibit inoculation when they actually do not, she says. Secondly, employers, government agencies, colleges and others have difficulty verifying the sincerity of claims — or don’t bother. “Given the amount of misinformation about vaccine safety and the virus, chances are that most of the exemption requests are from people who do not want to get COVID-19 vaccines because of safety concerns or misinformation about the pandemic,” Reiss writes in a recent article on the Bill of Health blog, published by the Petrie-Flom Center at Harvard Law School. A 2013 paper in the academic journal Vaccine offers a broad overview of how the teachings of various religions apply to vaccines. Academic research indicates some people seek religious exemptions for reasons that are not actually rooted in religion. For example, a 2018 study in the Journal of Medical Ethics finds that employees sought religious exemptions to a Cincinnati hospital’s flu vaccine mandate for various reasons, including concerns about the benefit of the vaccine. Some employee claims focused on false or misleading information about how the vaccine was manufactured. 3. Understand the most common reasons people seek religious exemptions. Reiss says religious exemption requests tend to focus on one or more of the following four issues: Vaccines are linked to abortion.Cells derived from aborted fetuses have been used for years to make vaccines, including some COVID-19 vaccines. Public health officials stress that while researchers used cells originally isolated from human fetal tissue to develop or test some COVID-19 vaccines, none of the vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. contain fetal cells. They also stress the vaccines don’t use fetal cells from recent abortions.“Cells that make up the ‘cell lines’ used for certain COVID-19 vaccine development came from two elective pregnancy terminations that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s,” the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services points out in an informational document.When making vaccines, fetal cells can be used “as miniature ‘factories’ to generate vast quantities of adenoviruses, disabled so that they cannot replicate, that are used as vehicles to ferry genes from the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19,” explains Science magazine, published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. “When the adenoviruses are given as a vaccine, recipients’ cells begin to produce proteins from the coronavirus, hopefully triggering a protective immune response.”Fetal cells were used to produce and manufacture the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and during testing of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, Reuters Fact Check confirms. Vaccine manufacturers use blood to create vaccines.Vaccines typically do not contain human blood products. However, products derived from animals, including animal blood, can be used to grow disease-causing bacteria and viruses in a lab. Researchers also use blood from horseshoe crabs to test vaccines and injectable drugs to ensure they don’t contain harmful bacterial endotoxins.While many Jehovah’s Witnesses avoid blood transfusions and certain medical treatments that involve blood products, they view vaccination as a personal decision. The Bible calls the human body “a temple of the Holy Spirit.”The New Testament makes multiple references likening the human body to a temple. Some people argue getting injected with a foreign substance such as a vaccine would defile their bodies, which they say is sinful.Various religious doctrines direct people to take care of their bodies.Vaccines are designed to protect human health, but some people argue they are harmful, partly because of their side effects. For instance, some adolescents and young adults reported mild heart problems after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.Muslims, Jews and others whose faith traditions forbid the consumption of pork have raised concern that some vaccines are manufactured using ingredients derived from pigs, including gelatin, used as a stabilizer. However, scholars of Judaism and Islam have deemed such vaccines permissible, vaccinologist John Grabenstein writes in “What the World’s Religions Teach, Applied to Vaccines and Immune Globulins.” Grabenstein, the president of consulting service Vaccine Dynamics, notes that vaccines contain tiny quantities of these components and that dietary rules do not apply to vaccines because they are not ingested. 4. Stress that employers, colleges and schools can ask questions and require documentation to help them assess the sincerity of an exemption request. Some organizations give employees or students a short form to sign to request a religious exemption, and approve all or nearly all requests, Reiss says. Other organizations, on the other hand, require much more information to help them decide whether to grant an exemption, including a written explanation of how the requestor’s religious beliefs conflict with vaccination requirements. Administrators also are permitted by law to ask questions about the requester’s belief system and medical history. For example, if someone seeking an exemption opposes COVID-19 vaccines because fetal cell lines were used to develop or test them, an administrator might ask whether that person takes Tylenol or other over-the-counter medications developed or tested using fetal cell lines, Reiss points out. Federal law protects employees’ religious beliefs, observances and practices, regardless of whether workplace administrators are familiar with them. Employees don’t have to belong to organized religions. Because religious beliefs can be unique to each person, they also don’t have to make sense to the people deciding whether or not to grant exemptions. “You can’t say that their beliefs are irrational,” Reiss adds, stressing that requests should be judged based “just on their sincerity.” The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission advises employers to “ordinarily assume that an employee’s request for religious accommodation is based on a sincerely held religious belief.” About The Author Denise-Marie Ordway She joined The Journalist’s Resource in 2015 after working as a reporter for newspapers and radio stations in the U.S. and Central America, including the Orlando Sentinel and Philadelphia Inquirer.

Tracking wild waterfowl may be part of the solution. by Jessica Fu 09.29.2021, 4:22pm Environment Share Link Copied! Save for later Jonas Bonnedahl Scientists are mapping the migratory patterns of ducks in an effort to stave off another avian flu outbreak. Ecologists are equipping a team of ducks with satellite transmitters to help prevent the next outbreak of avian influenza. While veterinarians and poultry experts have long suspected that wild waterfowl are unwitting disease vectors for chicken and turkeys, little is known about exactly where the biggest avian flu transmission risks are located along the food chain. In a recent study published in the Journal of Applied Ecology, researchers used location-tracked birds to map their flight patterns relative to poultry farms, in an effort to bring the areas most vulnerable to outbreaks into greater clarity. Avian flu poses a constant and costly threat to the domestic poultry industry: Highly pathogenic strains cause fatal disease in chickens and turkeys, which can then spread like wildfire through entire flocks. Viruses on one farm can be transmitted to neighbors, and even low pathogenic avian flus (which cause mild or no symptoms) still present a looming danger, as they can (and do) mutate into highly pathogenic variants. Avian flu outbreaks have repeatedly upended U.S. chicken and turkey supply chains in recent years. Take, for example, the 2014-2015 outbreak which spread to more than 20 states over six months, and forced producers to cull more than 50 million chickens and turkeys. Deemed the “largest poultry health disaster in U.S. history” by the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the outbreak led to the destruction of one in every eight egg-laying chickens and one of every 12 turkeys in the country. According to one economic analysis, the fallout led to $3.3 billion in food system-wide losses. To conduct the study, researchers captured 42 blue-winged teal ducks, a species common throughout North America, and attached solar-powered satellite transmitters to them using harnesses secured over their sternums to track their movements over time. Just a year later, another avian flu outbreak forced producers to cull more than 400,000 turkeys in Indiana. In 2017, the disease took out 129,000 chickens across two Tennessee farms. Last April, it led to the culling of 361,000 birds across 13 farms between North and South Carolina. The top culprit in each of these crises? Wild waterfowl. Turns out, ducks and geese are natural carriers of avian flu-causing viruses, and can sicken their chicken and turkey cousins. Oftentimes, waterfowl are asymptomatic when infected, leading some researchers to dub them “silent spreaders.” Waterfowl can shed the virus through feces onto soil, water, or farm equipment, which can then transmit pathogens to chickens and turkeys. “Wild waterfowl are one of the natural reservoirs for these avian influenza viruses,” said Diann Prosser, a wildlife ecologist for the U.S. Geological Survey and co-author of the paper. “To understand what they’re doing and where they are, we need to know the connections between the wild [waterfowl] and where the disease might be able to be transmitted, for example agricultural industries.” To conduct the study, researchers captured 42 blue-winged teal ducks, a species common throughout North America, and attached solar-powered satellite transmitters to them using harnesses secured over their sternums to track their movements over time. Researchers chose the species because of its prevalence and evidence that it can host many avian flu-causing viruses. After data about the birds’ movements started rolling in, Prosser and her colleagues categorized them into three different patterns: long-distance flights, short-distance flights, and periods spent on the ground. It’s that last category that Prosser and her team were most interested in, hypothesizing that birds on the ground posed the greatest risk to poultry facilities. The data helped Prosser’s team drill down the precise regions and times when wild waterfowl were most likely to spend time in close proximity with poultry facilities. While grounded, “they’re feeding in wetlands and wet areas, they’re picking up potential virus particles that are in the water and sediment, and then they’re eventually defecating,” Prosser said. “So if they’ve got [avian flu], they could be shedding virus in the environment.” Researchers then compared the ducks’ movements against a USDA map of poultry farms across the country, including both commercial facilities and backyard farmers, and chicken and turkey producers. Put together, all this data helped Prosser and her team drill down the precise regions and times in which wild waterfowl were most likely to spend time in close proximity with poultry facilities. Here’s what they found: Commercial chicken facilities in the South (defined as regions south of the 40th parallel) appeared to face the highest risk of pathogen spillover during spring migration in April and May. In contrast, commercial chicken and turkey facilities further north seemed to face the greatest overlap with waterfowl during fall migration, between mid-September and mid-November. “Our results suggest that [avian flu] spillover risk from [blue-winged teal ducks] to commercial chicken facilities may be elevated during the spring and autumn migrations when wild birds stopover near poultry operations while in route to breeding or overwintering habitats,” the authors wrote. “Every flyway is basically a disease highway.” This lends further evidence to a phenomenon that researchers have long suspected—that avian flu risks are highest when wild birds are in migratory mode. In the case of the 2014-2015 outbreak, experts noted, cases appeared to cluster together along the intersection of the Central and Mississippi flyways, two common flight routes for migratory birds. “Every flyway is basically a disease highway,” said George Thomas Tabler, an extension professor specializing in poultry at Mississippi State University. Tabler offers guidance to chicken farmers on disease prevention, and stresses that sanitizing equipment and even shoes before entering farms can help minimize the risk of transferring the virus from one place to another. “Where avian influenza is concerned, nobody can be too careful.” As for Prosser’s research, she stresses that there remains a lot more to learn about the relationship between waterfowl and poultry farms. After all, this recent study looked at just one species of waterfowl. There’s a sky full of other ducks and geese still unstudied and free from pesky location-tracking devices. Maybe some of them are taking off right now, headed south for the winter. Chances are, they have different migratory patterns and susceptibilities to avian flu-causing viruses from one another. “It’s a much more complex picture,” Prosser said. “This is kind of the first step in a work process.” Animal welfare Science Also tagged avian flu, chickens, influenza, migratory patterns, outbreak, poultry, science, tracking Jessica Fu is a staff writer for The Counter.

News With flu season starting in Alabama, here’s what you need to know about the flu, COVID-19 vaccines by: Jen Cardone Posted: Oct 1, 2021 / 05:44 AM CDT Updated: Oct 1, 2021 / 05:44 AM CDT by: Jen Cardone Posted: Oct 1, 2021 / 05:44 AM CDT Updated: Oct 1, 2021 / 05:44 AM CDT SHARE MOUNTAIN BROOK, Ala. (WIAT) – With the start of this year’s flu season coming to Alabama Friday, health officials expect to see higher cases of influenza this year. At Ritch’s Pharmacy in Mountain Brook, owner and pharmacist Ralph Sorrell said they average about 2,000 vaccine doses for the flu in a season. Sorrell said that so far, they’ve given over 10,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. “We have been doing flu shots at this pharmacy since pharmacists were allowed to,” Sorrell said. Lincoln High wins first game after death of assistant coach Ritch’s just recently started giving out its flu shot this season. Sorrell said it’s best to get one now through two weeks before Thanksgiving. “You’ll start building protective antibodies the minute you get the shot, but in about two weeks you’ll be at your full protection level,” he said. According to public health officials, the injection is even more important to get this season. “Every life is important; every life is precious,” assistant state health officer Dr. Karen Landers said. Officials with the Alabama Department of Public Health said that in 2018, 257 adults died from the flu. Last year, it was only 22. It says about half of Alabamians got their flu vaccine in 2020 – in a typical year the state averages 40% or less. “We need to do the same things for influenza that we’re trying to do for COVID and that is to reduce our ways to contract influenza,” Landers said during the Medical Association of the State of Alabama’s weekly COVID-19 update Thursday. Authorities investigating after officer shot in Warrior This includes best practices like wearing masks and extra hand washing. “These days people are out and about more, and you see fewer masks out in public,” Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama senior medical director Dr. Anne Schmidt said. “We know that those things that help to prevent COVID also help to prevent the flu.” Schmidt wanted to remind folks that the CDC does say it’s safe to get your COVID-19 and influenza vaccination simultaneously. “We had a lot of people who were admitted to hospitals with a COVID diagnosis, we don’t want to see the same thing with flu and the most effective way you can prevent that is to get your flu vaccine,” Schmidt said. She stressed that it’s never too late to get either shot. “The more we can vaccinate the safer we’ll be,” Sorrell said. All vaccines have four components – including two A and two B strains. You can get your COVID or influenza vaccine at Ritch’s Pharmacy six days a week to protect yourself from either virus this season. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)APBy Katherine Rodriguez | NJ Advance Media for NJ.comAlthough the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public health agencies have been focused on getting people vaccinated for COVID-19, health experts are also stressing not to skip a flu shot this year.Flu cases dropped to historic lows last year in the U.S. during the height of the pandemic, according to the CDC.But with schools and businesses reopening, and international travel restrictions loosening, the flu could make a comeback along with the existing COVID-19 pandemic.Here is what you need to know about getting your flu shot if you already had or if you have COVID-19.Can I get a flu shot if I already had COVID-19?Individuals are able to “receive the flu shot if they previously had COVID,” Dr. Sandra Adams, a virologist and biology professor at Montclair State University told NJ Advance Media.Dr. Adams also added that catching COVID does not protect you from getting the flu, as they are two separate viruses.“The antibodies produced against COVID are specific to the virus that causes COVID,” she said. “They offer no protection against influenza.”But you can catch COVID and the flu at the same time, and be susceptible to respiratory failure or pneumonia, if you do not protect yourself in advance.Can I get the flu shot while I have COVID?Dr. Adams told NJ Advance Media that “you should postpone receiving the flu shot for at least 10 days after the initial positive test for COVID.”Related stories about the flu and COVID-19:Where can I get a flu shot?

Ayurvedic Drug Fifatrol Can Help Check Viral Infection, Dengue, Influenza, Claims Ayurveda Experts Written by Satata Karmakar |Updated : September 27, 2021 12:25 PM IST At a time when India is fighting its biggest healthcare battle against deadly coronavirus, vector-borne diseases like dengue, influenza, and viral fever cases are also rising across the states. However, in a major relief experts on Sunday claimed that herbal drugs like Fifatrol can help in boosting immunity and hasten recovery from these diseases. Speaking to the media, professor K N Dwivedi of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) said that there are some herbs and concoctions which can prevent the progression of infections due to seasonal flu and vectors such as mosquitoes and eliminate them gradually.Fifatrol 'The Ayurvedic Concoction' Prof. Dwivedi pointed out that the Ayurvedic medicine Fifatrol which is a formulation of time-tested immunity strengthening herbo-mineral preparations like guduchi, daruharidra, apamarga, chirayata, karanja, kutaki, tulsi, godanti, mrityunjaya rasa, tribhuvana kriti rasa and sanjivani vati, has been found to help fight infection, flu and cold.Developed by AIMIL Pharma, Fifatrol is a herbal drug that has also received recommendations from Ayurveda experts for even dengue and viral flu patients. Fifatrol has also shown effective results in treating vector-borne diseases. "During a trial on dengue patients at AIIMS, Bhopal, Fifatrol was found to have increased blood platelet count significantly," an Ayurvedic expert quoted as saying.

Serotype-TwoIn serotype-two dengue infection, platelet count drops rapidly, and the body's immune response becomes hyperactive leading to a cytokine storm that can damage the organs. This variant of dengue also impacts the kidneys, he said. "But this drug (Fifatrol), being enriched with immune-enhancing herbo-mineral preparations, can fight bacteria, viruses, and allergens and provides fast relief from nasal congestion, sore throat, body ache, and headache."Fifatrol For CoronavirusAyurvedic herb Fifatrol has also been mentioned in nearly 200 technologies and research activities evaluated by experts in a compendium for combating coronavirus as compiled by the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC). It offers an improved immune system to fight viral, bacterial, and other infections, normalises raised body temperature, fastens recovery, and eases the associated symptoms like flu, cold, and congestion, said Sanchit Sharma, Executive Director of AIMIL Pharma.

Covid more common than ‘long flu’, study suggestsThe team estimated symptoms linked to long Covid were around 50% more common among those who had a Covid-19 infection compared to those who had flu.Published Sep 28, 2021People who get flu could have prolonged symptoms which are similar to those seen in some patients with long Covid, a new study suggests.But lasting symptoms occur to a lesser extent among those who have had a bout of flu, academics said.The study examined how many patients experienced long-lasting symptoms after having Covid-19 and other contributing factors – such as whether different age groups or genders are affected more.“We found in a cohort of patients with influenza that the same symptoms also tend to occur, but they tend to occur at lower rates,” said NIHR academic clinical fellow Dr Max Taquet, who led the analysis.The team estimated that symptoms linked to long Covid were around 50% more common among those who had a Covid-19 infection compared to those who had flu.The study, which analysed health records of more than 273,000 people who had Covid-19 and 114,000 who had flu in the US, outlined nine long Covid symptoms and the proportion of people who were suffering between 90 and 180 days after initial infection:– Abnormal breathing – 8%– Abdominal symptoms – 8%– Anxiety/depression – 15%– Chesthroat pain – 6%– Cognitive problems such as ‘brain fog’ – 4%– Fatigue – 6%– Headache – 5%– Muscle pain – 1.5%– Other pain – 7%All nine symptoms were more frequently reported after Covid-19 than after influenza.The analysis found that around 30% of people who had flu experienced some sort of symptoms three to six months later compared to around 42% of those who had Covid-19.When looking solely at Covid-19, the researchers also found that different groups were affected by long-lasting symptoms in different ways.For instance older people and men had more breathing difficulties and cognitive problems, whereas young people and women had more headaches, abdominal symptoms and anxiety or depression.Patients admitted to hospital were more likely to suffer cognitive problems like brain fog and fatigue compared to people who did not need to be admitted, and people who did not need hospital care were more likely to have headaches than those who needed to be admitted.When taking all factors into account, the research team estimated that 37% of people who had a Covid-19 infection had at least one long Covid symptom three to six months after infection.But the authors stressed there were “important caveats” which meant the results might not be generalised – namely that people included in the study with both flu and Covid could have been “iller” than those in the general population because they had sought medical help for their symptoms.Dr Taquet said: “Over one third of patients were diagnosed with at least one of the long Covid symptoms between three and six months after their Covid-19 illness.“The severity of the illness, age and sex affected the incidence and profile of long Covid symptoms.“Similar symptoms were seen in people after influenza but they occur and co-occur less commonly.”Health officials have warned that this year’s flu season could be particularly troublesome as immunity to influenza viruses waned during the pandemic.The Government is hoping that more people than ever will get their flu jab, with over-50s and clinically vulnerable people being called forward to get a vaccine.Professor Paul Harrison, who headed the study which has been published in the journal PLOS Medicine, from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Oxford, said: “There are various post-viral conditions recognised and many of us who have experienced flu know how you don’t always feel completely better as quickly as you’ve been hoping or expecting to.”The Office for National Statistics estimates that 970,000 British people are suffering ongoing symptoms after a Covid-19 infection.The figures, based on self-reported symptoms, also suggest 384,000 people are still living with symptoms a year after infection.Separate ONS estimates, based on data from participants of the Coronavirus Infection Survey who had a lab-confirmed case of Covid-19, suggest that between 3% and 12% of people have symptoms 12 weeks after infection.Sorry, we are not accepting comments on this article.Similar storiesWhat the

This autumn, the Safety, Security, Health and Environment Department (SSHE) is offering this free and voluntary service to ETH employees in collaboration with the Centre for Occupational Health, Ergonomics and Hygiene (AEH). 27.09.2021 volume_upRead mode_comment Number of comments Once again this year, ETH employees can get vaccinated against seasonal flu free of charge. (Image: ETH Zurich) This year, the flu vaccination is being made available exclusively to ETH employees. The background to this is that the pandemic has made the conditions for implementing a vaccination campaign very difficult. In line with the Swiss government’s vaccination strategy, the available resources are therefore to be used specifically for active employees. Accordingly, an e-mail with a link to the registration website will be sent to employees only. Retired members of the ETH community and students who are eligible for a flu vaccination should request one from their general practitioner or at a pharmacy. Who should get vaccinated? Information on who can benefit from the flu vaccination can be found at the external page FOPH flu vaccination check. ETH employees should register for the ETH vaccination only if they have a positive vaccination check result. According to the Swiss government’s vaccination strategy, the goal is not to achieve 100 percent vaccination coverage, but rather to protect certain groups: Individuals at increased risk of complications from influenza Anyone aged 65 and over Pregnant women Patients in old people’s and nursing homes Individuals with chronic conditions Vaccination is also recommended for people who have regular contact with one of the abovementioned groups as part of their family or professional activities. Flu vaccination is particularly recommended for people working in the medical field and crèche employees. Please note: Only people who have been free of flu symptoms for two weeks will be vaccinated. There must be a minimum interval of two weeks from other vaccinations. This also applies to the COVID-19 vaccine. The flu vaccination should not be given between the first and second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Those who do not meet the above requirements cannot be vaccinated and will therefore be turned away on site. COVID-19 To provide you with a safe vaccination, we adhere to the COVID-19 rules set out by the FOPH and by ETH: Masks are compulsory for the entire visit. The safety concept must be adhered to. Sites and registration Once again this year, flu vaccinations will be administered on two days each at the Zentrum (Alumni Pavilion) and Hönggerberg (HPH building) Campuses and on one day in Basel (BSA building). Detailed information and the registration page can be found on the SSHE Department website. Where else can students and retired members of the ETH community get vaccinated? Students and retired members of the ETH community can get vaccinated on external page National Flu Vaccination Day on Friday, 5 November 2021 for a reduced price of CHF 30. Pharmacies and general practitioners also offer the vaccination. The costs for anyone with an increased risk of complications are covered by basic health insurance. Any costs incurred with out-of-town providers or through direct visits to the Centre for Occupational Health, Ergonomics and Hygiene (AEH) will not be covered.

Some are localised (epidemic), confined in a relatively small geographical area, while others are widespread, all-out pandemics. Such outbreaks had been well documented — and have shaped medical science. Virologists point to three conditions for a pandemic to occur: It causes disease in humans. It is highly transmissible. People have no pre-existing immunity to it. It’s been said that in times of distress and trials, there’s no greater blessing than patience. Among those imbued with this virtue are the people who spend countless hours caring for the sick and the dying (sometimes paying with their own lives); and those who spend countless hours in labs to find the cause, discover remedy and help end man’s plight. Image Credit: Statista, CDC, NIH, The Lancet, Jay Hilotin / Gulf News PESTILENCE Pestilence refers to a deadly and overwhelming disease that affects an entire community. The Black Death, a disease that killed an estimated 200 million people, about 30% percent of Europe's population, is the worst example that perfectly fits that description. Some of the deadly outbreaks that plagued mankind and how they ended: [1] PLAGUE OF JUSTINIAN (541 AD) The Plague of Justinian, named after the ruling Roman emperor of the time, was the earliest large-scale plague recorded. Image Credit: Pierart dou Tielt/Public domain DEATH TOLL: 30-50 million WHAT HAPPENED: This plague arrived in Constantinople, the Byzantine Empire’s capital, in 541 CE. Historians say plague-ridden fleas hitched a ride from Egypt on the black rats that snacked on the grain taken as a tribute to Emperor Justinian. The plague crippled Constantinople (now Istanbul) and spread like wildfire across Europe, Asia, North Africa and Arabia. HOW IT ENDED: The best guess by medical historians is that the majority of people somehow survive, and those who survive have developed immunity. [2] BLACK DEATH: (1347 to 1351) The same bacterium, Yersinia pestis, that caused the Justinian Plague is behind “Black Death”, which came 800 years later. DEATH TOLL: 200 million WHAT HAPPENED: The Bubonic Plague (also known as the Pestilence, the Great Mortality or the Plague) hit Europe and North Africa hard. The Black Death was said to have killed at least a third of Europe’s population. The same bacterium, Yersinia pestis, that caused the Justinian Plague is behind “Black Death”, which came 800 years later. The disease was likely transmitted from rodents to humans by the bite of infected fleas. This was when “quarantine” was invented. HOW IT ENDED: One popular theory: quarantines (from the world “quarenta”, i.e. 40 days of isolation, usually referring to ships). The uninfected would typically remain in their homes and only leave when it was necessary, while those who could afford to do so would leave the more densely populated areas and live in greater isolation. [3] ANTONINE PLAGUE (165-180 AD) DEATH TOLL: 5 million WHAT HAPPENED: It erupted during the height of the Roman power throughout the Mediterranean during reign of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (161-180 CE). It’s also known as the Plague of Galen — after Galen, the physician who described it. It’s the first known pandemic impacting the Roman Empire. It was first reported in Seleucia (present-day Baghdad in Iraq). Medical historians theorise that it was probably “smallpox”, and that the disease was contracted and spread by soldiers who were returning from campaigns in the Near East. Roman physician Galen (c. 129–199 C.E.), a skilled medical researcher, kept a record of the plague. His notes describe a disease with symptoms that resemble smallpox — and a possible mutant strain. Historians estimate that the plague killed 7–10% of the population; among armies and the densely populated cities, the mortality rate probably reached 13–15%. HOW IT ENDED: With the death of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, the Antonine plague also died down. On its wake, 10% of Rome's population reported perished. According to other some historians, The plague did not end in 180. Just nine years after it died down, it suddenly reappeared and continued to cause deaths up until 270. Deadly germs • Medical records show several of the deadliest pandemics in the past were caused by a single bacterium, Yersinia pestis, a fatal infection also known as “the plague”.• Some of the earliest pandemics faded by wiping out huge parts of the population. Advances in medical science and human behavioural change have helped curb disease spread.• Today, urbanisation and global travel play a huge part in the spread of disease. Today, intercontinental flights help spread infections far and wide. [4] 17th CENTURY GREAT PLAGUES ( 1348 to 1665) DEATH TOLL: 3 million WHAT HAPPENED: It’s a continuous affliction stretching over 300 years. From 1348 to 1665, the plague resurfaced roughly every 10 years, such that there were 40 recorded outbreaks in over 300 years. By the early 1500s, England imposed the first laws to separate and isolate the sick. HOW IT ENDED: Historians say the plague did not have a clear end. London saw 40 such episodes from 1348 to 1665 (one every 10 years). And with each new plague, 20% of the men, women and children living in the British capital were killed. The Great Plague of 1665 was the last — and one of the worst of the centuries-long outbreaks. All public entertainment was banned and victims were forcibly shut into their homes to prevent the spread of the disease. Red crosses were painted on their doors along with a plea for forgiveness: “Lord have mercy upon us.” [5] SMALLPOX PANDEMIC (1520) DEATH TOLL: 30% of people infected; 10 million in Mexico/North America WHAT HAPPENED: For hundreds of years, smallpox was endemic to Europe, Asia and Arabia. It’s a constant health threat that killed 30% of people it infected — and left the rest with pockmarked scars. However, deaths wrought on native populations in North America (“New World”) that came in the 15th century with the first European explorers. The indigenous populations of modern-day Mexico and the US had zero natural immunity; smallpox decimated up to 95% over a period of 100 years. HOW IT ENDED: In the late 18th-century, Edward Jenner, a British doctor, discovered that milkmaids infected with a milder virus called “cowpox” seemed immune to smallpox. Jenner famously inoculated his gardener’s 8-year-old son with cowpox and then exposed him to the smallpox virus — with no ill effect. That was the world’s first vaccine. Jenner is known as the father of vaccinology. “[T]he annihilation of the smallpox, the most dreadful scourge of the human species, must be the final result of this practice,” wrote Jenner in 1801.

HOW IT ENDED: Over time, those who contracted the virus developed an immunity to the new strand of flu virus, and life returned to normal by the early 1920s. EARLIEST RECORD: The earliest well-attested cases of Spanish flu were reported among army recruits in military camps in the USA in March 1918, and it was widespread throughout the world within a short period after World War I.

Image Credit: Library of Congress, Geography and Map Division DEATH TOLL: Up to 1 million WHAT HAPPENED: The pandemic caused painful conjunctivitis and inflamed lungs, among others. It was often referred to as the “Asiatic flu”, and also as the “Russian Flu”, as the epidemic had broken out in St Petersburg in November, 1889. A Lancet report in 2020 quoted earlier editions of the journal in which doctors reported what they saw in clinical practice. The best-known Russian Flu invalids in the UK were male — including the then-British PM and Foreign Secretary Lord Salisbury, Liberal Party leader and (later) PM Lord Rosebery. The neurological conditions observed after this affliction were given many names: neuralgia, neurasthenia, neuritis, nerve exhaustion, “grippe catalepsy”, “post-grippal numbness”, psychoses, “prostration”, “inertia”, anxiety, and paranoia. HOW IT ENDED: The Lancet quoted the “1889–92 epidemic” report prepared by H Franklin Parsons, medical investigator for England's Local Government Board, who stated that “severe recrudescences” were observed in 1893, 1895, 1898, and 1899–1900. “The official end of the pandemic, therefore, did not mean the end of illness but was merely the prelude to a longue durée of baffling sequelae,” the journal reported. [8] SWINE FLU PANDEMIC (April 2009 to AUGUST 2010) DEATH TOLL: 575,400 (CDC estimate) WHAT HAPPENED: Officially, it was known as the (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. Swine flu pandemic is caused by a strain of influenza virus that usually only infects pigs. Transmission usually occurs from person to person. Swine flu is very contagious: An estimated 10% of the world's population caught disease. The disease is transmitted through aerosol, saliva and mucus particles. People may spread it by sneezing, coughing, touching a virus-covered surface, and then touching their eyes or nose. Then, about six months into the pandemic, a vaccine was available. CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection.

Picture taken November 5, 2020. Image Credit: Reuters HOW IT ENDED: The US CDC stated that two doses same flu vaccine (separated by 4 weeks) that protects against seasonal flu also protects against the (H1N1)pdm09 swine flu virus strain. It is administered via intramuscular injection or via nasal spray. Also, two antiviral drugs were recommended to treat swine flu: the oral drugs oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). As flu viruses can develop resistance to these drugs, however, the medications were reserved for people who were at high risk for the flu complications. People who are otherwise generally healthy and get swine flu will be able to fight the infection on their own. On August 10, 2010, WHO declared an end to the global 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. “However, (H1N1)pdm09 virus continues to circulate as a seasonal flu virus, and cause illness, hospitalisation, and deaths worldwide every year,” CDC reported. [9] HONG KONG FLU (1968-1970) The Hong Kong flu killed up 4 million people globally, at a time when intercontinental travel was on the upswing (1969 was the year the Boeing 747 first flew). The H3N2 strain of the influenza A virus was seen behind the pandemic. Note the proteinaceous coat, or capsid, surrounding each virion (whole virus cell), and the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase spikes, which differ in terms of their molecular make-up from strain to strain. All known subtypes of influenza A viruses can be found in birds. DEATH TOLL: 4 million WHAT HAPPENED: The first record of the outbreak in Hong Kong appeared on July 13, 1968. It followed a previous outbreak about 11 years years earlier (1957) caused by the H2N2, which medical literature also called a “pandemic”. By the end of July 1968, extensive outbreaks were reported in Vietnam and Singapore. Caused by the H3N2 strain of the influenza A virus, the 1968 ‘Hong Kong Flu’ was a global outbreak that may have caused the deaths of up to four million, worldwide. By the end of December the virus had spread throughout Southeast Asia, the US, UK and western Europe. Air travel by an estimated 160 million persons during the pandemic facilitated rapid transmission worldwide, according to a report by the US National Institutes of Health. HOW IT ENDED: It’s not clear a clear ending. A global effort led by the US and the UK saw a highly effective vaccine being manufactured as early as November 1969. Some 15 million global doses were available by the pandemic’s early peak, in January 1969. Powerful new antivirals were used to fight the virus, too. Scientists say the H3N2 virus that caused the 1968 Hong Kong pandemic is still in circulation today, according to virologists. It is considered to be a strain of seasonal influenza. In the 1990s a closely-related H3N2 virus was isolated from swine. Scientists suspect that the human H3N2 virus jumped to pigs; infected animals may show symptoms of swine flu.

SNS | New Delhi | September 27, 2021 3:12 pm (Representational Image: iStock) A herbal drug is being recommended by Ayurveda experts for quite a long time for patients affected by dengue and viral flu as they find it to be very effective. As Covid-19 battered India grapples with influenza, viral fever and dengue, certain Ayurveda experts have claimed that immunity-boosting herbal drugs like Fifatrol can help not only hasten the recovery from the infection but also strengthen the immunity of the patient. Prof KN Dwivedi from the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) said that even though the virus has no cure so far, in Ayurveda there are some herbs and preparations that can prevent the progression of the infections due to seasonal influenza and mosquitoes and gradually eliminate them. Advertisement In this connection, he pointed out that Fifatrol, developed by AIMIL pharma, a formulation of time-tested immunity strengthening herbo-mineral preparations like guduchi, daruharidra, apamarga, chirayata, karanja, kutaki, tulsi, godanti (bhasam), mrityunjaya rasa, tribhuvana kriti rasa and sanjivani vati has been found to help fight infections, flu and cold. Prof Dwivedi explained, there are four types of dengue — serotypes 1 to 4 at play. The prevalence of serotype-2 has been growing very fast across the states, he added. This is more severe than other types of dengue fever. In serotype-2 dengue infections, platelets drop rapidly and the body’s immune response is hyperactive, resulting in a cytokine storm that can damage the organs. This variant of dengue also impacts the kidneys. “But this drug (Fifatrol) being enriched with immune-enhancing herbo-mineral preparations can fight bacteria, viruses and allergens and provides fast relief from nasal congestion, sore throat, body ache, headache.” In fact, the herbal drug has also found a mention among nearly 200 technologies and research activities evaluated by experts in a compendium for combating coronavirus as compiled by the National Research Development Corporation. “The drug offers an improved immune system in top-notch form to fight off viral, bacterial and other infections, normalises raised body temperature, fastens recovery and eases the associated symptoms like flu, cold and congestion,” added Sanchit Sharma, Executive Director, AIMIL Pharma. According to the WHO estimates, one in every five people worldwide can become infected with viral fever and vector-borne disease during the peak of the season in a year.

A clinical trial found that reported side effects were mainly mild to moderate. There were also no negative impacts on the immune response produced by either vaccine when both were given on the same day, in opposite arms. The Combining Influenza and Covid-19 Vaccination (ComFluCov) study looked at whether it was safe to give both jabs together. Researchers say the results reinforce current coronavirus booster vaccine guidance which is for both jabs to be given together where it is practically possible. Dr Rajeka Lazarus is consultant in infectious diseases and microbiology at University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust (UHBW) and chief investigator for the ComFluCov study. She said: “By conducting this study we have been able to establish that it is possible to protect people from both Covid-19 and flu at the same appointment." Two Covid and three flu vaccines were tested, meaning six combinations in all. Study participants were over the age of 18 and had already received one dose of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, and were awaiting their second dose. A total of 679 volunteers took part in the study across 12 NHS sites in England and Wales. They were randomly allocated to either receive their second dose of the Covid vaccine and the flu vaccine at their first study visit, then a placebo at their second visit A second group received their second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and a placebo at their first visit and then the flu vaccine at their second visit. Participants also attended a third study visit to discuss any side effects and give a blood sample. The most common side effects were pain around the injection site and fatigue. Some combinations saw an increase in the number of people who reported at least one side effect when both Covid-19 and flu vaccine were given together, but the reactions were mostly mild or moderate, researchers found. According to the study, the immune responses to both the flu and Covid-19 vaccine were preserved when given together, and 97% of participants said they would be willing to have two vaccines at the same appointment in the future. Professor Andrew Ustianowski, NIHR clinical lead for the Covid-19 vaccination programme and joint national infection specialty lead, said: “This research has quickly provided important and reassuring results." The study was led by researchers at the Bristol Trials Centre, UHBW, and supported by the Clinical Research Network (CRN) West of England. For more stories from where you live, visit InYourArea.

Access your plan Fair Work Commission throws out request from sacked worker who refused vaccination by Sean Wilson | Sep 30, 2021 | Fines & Prosecutions, HR News, Law Updates | 0 comments The Fair Work Commission has thrown out a request from an ambulance paramedic sacked for refusing the influenza vaccination to refer purported questions of law to the Federal Court. The paramedic’s employer, St John Ambulance Western Australia Ltd, imposed a mandatory flu vaccination policy after the State Government in April last year promulgated the now-revoked Visitors to Residential Aged Care Directions (Directions). The paramedic objected to the vaccination “because of a deep sense of morality and desire to maintain my bodily integrity is not punishable by the termination of one’s employment” saying it had been harsh to dismiss her. She claimed St John had been willing to make reasonable adjustments and “allowances” for other workers deemed unable to fulfil the inherent requirements of their roles. “Some examples include medical conditions, such as diabetes or epilepsy, hypertension or sleep apnea. “Other examples include criminal causes; loss of driving license due to convictions related to either drug or alcohol intoxication whilst controlling a motor vehicle”. But the employer said in response to her submissions in the unfair dismissal case that its hand had been forced by the chief health officer’s direction, which made it compulsory for anyone entering a residential aged care facility to have a current influenza vaccination. It noted that exemptions are available where a person is responding to an emergency, a vaccination is not reasonably available, or there is a medical contraindication. The paramedic sought an exemption on unspecified medical grounds and a conscientious objection, but St John rejected it and directed her in August last year to comply with the vaccination policy. After the paramedic confirmed in April this year that she did intend to be inoculated, St John issued a show cause notice for her alleged failure to follow a lawful and reasonable direction and her inability to meet inherent requirements of her role due to her non-vaccinated status. It dismissed her in June and the paramedic lodged a dismissal claim that was listed the matter for hearing on October 8. However, the paramedic early this month asked the President to refer six purported questions of law to the Federal Court. Vice President Adam Hatcher, acting to determine the matter under delegated authority from President Iain Ross, said the paramedic had made “extensive submissions” to support referral, which he outlined in his ruling. He concluded that the questions of law put forward by the paramedic “are better characterised as tendentious propositions, masquerading as questions, raised in support of her case that she could not lawfully and reasonably be directed to comply” with the mandatory vaccination policy. “None of them arises independently as a question of law which necessarily requires determination in the proceeding before the Commissioner. “And, because they are (at best) simply facets of the larger question as to whether St John’s direction for [the paramedic] to comply with the [vaccination] policy was lawful and reasonable, the ‘questions’ are not, either individually or collectively, necessarily determinative of that significant question. “Nor, for the same reason, can the questions be determined without findings being made as to the facts bearing on the lawfulness and reasonableness of the direction to comply with the policy.” Vice President Hatcher said a “significant question arising” in the case involves whether the employer’s requirement that the paramedic comply with the vaccination amounts to a lawful and reasonable employment direction, so that her refusal might give rise to a valid reason for dismissal. “That is not of itself a question of law; it requires the application of a legal standard to the facts of the particular case, and is therefore a mixed question of fact and law,” he said. “Whether a direction is lawful and reasonable cannot be determined in vacuo but only by reference to the subject matter and context. “Accordingly, no determination can be made as to whether a particular direction is lawful and reasonable until the relevant factual findings have been made,” he said.
