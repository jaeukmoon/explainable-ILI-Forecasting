21, 2020 • By B Traxinger Seasonal flu epidemics in the United states cause up to 45 million illnesses and 67,000 deaths annually, and emerging, hyper-virulent strains can result in increased infection and mortality. To monitor seasonal dynamics and to recognize and characterize emerging viruses, active surveillance of influenza is necessary. However, existing influenza surveillance systems rely on medically attended influenza cases, which may fail to capture many influenza infections in people who fail to present for care. Therefore, a community-wide testing program is necessary detect early cases of influenza and other respiratory viruses and to establish a pipeline for outbreak containment and pandemic response. The Seattle Flu Study (SFS), a collaboration between the Brotman Baty Institute, Fred Hutch, University of Washington, and Seattle Childrenâs, was implemented during the 2018-2019 season to characterize how influenza enters and spreads within the community. This ongoing, multi-arm study enrolls participants with acute respiratory illness (ARI)-associated symptoms from various clinical and community sites in the Seattle area and collects and tests nasal samples for infection with influenza and other respiratory viruses. The results of these tests are linked to patient demographics and illness characteristics to further define influenza prevalence and transmission patterns, and influenza-positive samples are further sequenced to inform molecular epidemiology modeling of Seattle influenza outbreaks.Â A recent publication in BMJ Open, led by Dr. Helen Y. Chu (University of Washington Medicine), along with collaborators from the Fred Hutch Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, details the protocol for the SFS. This work demonstrates that an integrated surveillance system can more comprehensively estimate influenza prevalence from both clinical and community settings, and model transmission dynamics, presenting a paradigm for pandemic preparedness. Of course, having been first assembled more than two years ago, the authors could not have anticipated the timeliness of this study ahead of the Seattle SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and later pandemic, of 2020. As the SFS was already in place to detect early respiratory infections, the platform identified the first community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States in early 2020. Since then, the study has now been adapted to further characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Seattle. âFollowing the start of the pandemic in the U.S., the Seattle Flu Study team quickly pivoted to providing at-home SARS-CoV-2 testing through the launch of the greater Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN). The study has since partnered with community-based organizations to expand testing to underserved and minority populations in the Seattle metropolitan area,â explained Jennifer Logue, the research coordinator for the Seattle Flu Study. Additionally, during the 2019-2020 season, the SFS âenrolled just over 300 households into a prospective longitudinal observational study, where participants submitted weekly symptom questionnaires and sent in self-collected nasal swabs in the event of an acute respiratory illness (ARI),â Logue said. âAs part of year 2 of this study, we are testing swabs collected during ARI events for SARS-CoV-2 and studying transmission of COVID-19 within households,â she continued. Laboratory pipeline for samples included in the Seattle Flu Study from time of collection through sequencing. Figure from publication. âThis work presents a replicable study design for the large-scale assessment of acute respiratory infections,â said Dr. Chu. âThis framework can be implemented for pathogen surveillance across a major metropolitan area and allows for targeted public health interventions and the early detection of novel pathogens - which was demonstrated by the Seattle Flu Studyâs detection of the first known community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. Furthermore, the study design and infrastructure are scalable in a global pandemic setting and can provide early transmission mapping and wide-scale at-home community-based testing,â Dr. Chu explained. Going forward, the researchers behind the SFS hope to test whether âthis study design (can) be used to provide testing and public health interventions to underserved or rural populations,â said Dr. Chu. Pilot studies have been launched to survey respiratory virus prevalence in Seattle homeless shelters, and these studies âhave continued into the 2020-2021 season and will help to inform the feasibility and effectiveness of surveying and mitigating the spread of respiratory pathogens within a high-risk population,â Dr. Chu explained. Additionally, the SFS has been adapted to collect samples from asymptomatic people to determine the role that asymptomatic transmission of respiratory pathogens plays in the community.Â This work was supported by Gates Ventures.

WaxmanDecember 21, 2020 12:00 PM ESTOn Dec. 14, the U.S. death toll from COVID-19 reached a grim, new milestone: 300,000 Americans killed. That’s nearly half of the 675,000 Americans killed a century ago during the 1918 flu, the deadliest pandemic in the 20th century, as historian Christopher Nichols pointed out on Twitter. The current wave of COVID-19 infections is the worst it’s been nationwide and, as TIME reported, cases are expected to continue to rise after Christmas and New Year’s Eve.The rapid spread today is in stark contrast to this time more than a century ago in 1918. After a first wave in the spring, a deadlier and more contagious second wave hit in early fall. Cities that quickly implemented control measures (mask mandates, closures of schools and public places, etc.) and kept them in place longer, saw lower death rates compared to cities that took fewer of these steps and for a shorter amount of time, a 2007 JAMA study found. In cities in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest, the virus seemed much less threatening by the 1918 holidays, to the point where Americans thought they could gather safely. In the western U.S. however, the virus hit later in the fall, and so the 1918 flu posed a bigger threat to those on the West Coast than the East Coast in November and December.When looking at the parallels between the COVID-19 pandemic and the 1918 flu pandemic, history offers several lessons on how —and how to not— spend these holidays.“History is not a perfect template,” says J. Alexander Navarro, Assistant Director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan and the Co-Editor in Chief of The American Influenza Epidemic of 1918-1919: A Digital Encyclopedia. “These are different epidemics, different timelines, and two very different diseases. Although they are both respiratory diseases, COVID is much more contagious than 1918 influenza was… By 1918 when you get to Thanksgiving and then Christmas, the worst of it is over, the large-scale gathering bans and business closures, closing places of public amusements are essentially over. Most communities went ahead and had Christmas services.”Despite the fact that the two viruses are very different, then, as now, spikes occurred after small family holiday gatherings.Columbus, Ohio, health officials traced a 27-case flare-up to a Thanksgiving dinner hosted by an elderly woman and attended by her seven married sons and daughters. The Dec. 5 Ohio State Journal reported that the acting state health commissioner said the flu was “one-fourth” as fatal as it was in that October, and mostly appearing in children, attributing the decreased fatality rate to “People have learned how to treat an attack, namely, by going to bed and staying there until fully recovered.”Public health officials also urged those who did gather in person to keep their distance. “You want to be a little careful whose relatives you kiss, is the state health commissioner’s Christmas advice to girls,” reported the Dec. 21, 1918, Ohio State Journal article headlined “Flu Fighters for Kissless Holiday: Beware of Mistletoe and Be Careful in Osculatory Indulgence, Health Chief Warns.” “His counsel to young men is the same, except a little more emphatic, because more important—some girls still adhering to the custom of ante-feminist days of letting the fellow make the first move. Beware the mistletoe, is his warning to all.”“Public health officials figured out what tools worked in 1918,” says Christopher Nichols, director of the Oregon State University Center for the Humanities. “They are being cautious about unduly leaping in or being too proactive. They’re following data and disease much better than before, you can see that in the city records. They’ve learned what works and what doesn’t work.”“It is not in the crowded street cars especially that danger lies, but in the indiscriminate visiting to homes in which there are or have been persons ill with influenza,” Dr. M. Victor Safford of Boston’s health department said in a Dec. 12, 1918 Boston Globe article. “Most of the influenza cases reported in Boston today are traceable to visits to homes of persons who have been or are ill with influenza.”“Do the people of Milwaukee want a Christmas this year?” was the lede of the Dec. 16 Milwaukee Sentinel. The city’s health commissioner George Ruhland said, “‘Because the health department did not specifically rule against such social gatherings, some people seem to think they are at liberty to follow their own wishes. This is unfair. It means seeking private pleasure when the health of the community is at stake.'”“To me, the most cogent lesson is that most people in 1918 did celebrate Christmas holidays with their family. And to me, the result was the so-called third wave that began in mid-January,” says Howard Markel, physician and director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan and the Co-Editor in Chief of The American Influenza Epidemic of 1918-1919: A Digital Encyclopedia. “[G]athering while that virus was still circulating was not a good thing. It led to more cases and more deaths. And similarly today, you gather not only at your own risk, but also at the risk of many others around you.”He also points out that people weren’t getting on airplanes to travel, as many families lived in the same town and multigenerational homes.Though 1918 health officials didn’t know if they were fighting a virus or a bacterial infection, they did know that masks, when combined with social distancing and frequent hand-washing, slowed the spread of the virus.That knowledge is clear in the (featured above) cartoon, published on Dec. 6, 1918, on the front page of Indiana’s Fort Wayne Sentinel, which shows two flu bugs unable to infect masked holiday shoppers. The Chicago Tribune also published the below guidelines for shoppers in the Dec. 16, 1918, issue:“For your healths’ sake do your Christmas shopping early. Take things easy this year; don’t try to do too much in one day. Keep out of department store crowds by using the early morning hours to shop when the sun is shining… Don’t be afraid of the ‘flu,’ but conserve your strength, get all the fresh air you can, avoid excesses, avoid assembly places that are overheated and poorly ventilated.”There was a surge of shoppers weary of wartime rationing and quarantining in Salt Lake City, the Dec. 21, 1918, Salt Lake Tribune reported: “Thrift and economy have been practiced to a very considerable extent during the past year, and the Spanish influenza hurt business to an almost alarming extent. But the holiday spirit is abroad in the land, and the ‘flu’ is not so much of a menace as it was a few weeks ago.”In Los Angeles, the health commissioner blamed Christmas shopping for a surge of new cases.“No special uneasiness may be felt over the increase in the number of cases—in fact the local health authorities predicted it and are pleased that it is no larger,” the Los Angeles Times reported on Dec. 28, 1918. “After Thanksgiving, before the quarantine law went into effect, the cases nearly doubled for a few days. The quarantine has shown its effectiveness in controlling the situation here and a strict observance of its rules will soon bring the bugs to time again.”Similarly, the format of New Year’s Eve celebrations ranged depending on the state of the epidemic in a given city. Social clubs in Denver cancelled New Year’s Eve balls and holiday parties. In Dayton, Ohio, the newspapers reported that life carried on as if the flu hadn’t happened; cabarets, theaters, and hotels flung open their doors, per the Dec. 31 edition of the Dayton Daily News. The Dec. 31 edition of Omaha Daily Bee reported that “New Year’s Eve will be gay with watch parties” because the city was lifting the bans on parties, but keeping a ban on dancing, and social clubs hurried to organize gatherings to entertain soldiers.While Americans had much to celebrate over the 1918 holidays, between the perceived containment of the virus and the armistice of World War I, not everyone could muster the usual holiday cheer with empty place settings at holiday dinners, either because of those serving abroad, or loved ones who had passed away in the pandemic.The day after Christmas, the Salt Lake Tribune reported that, “Observance of the day was possessed of a quiet dignity everywhere that reflected the deep feeling of the city’s dwellers. Not [a] few homes were saddened to a degree darker than their history had before recorded because of the ravages of the influenza epidemic.”Because the greatest number of 1918 flu deaths were in the 20-40 age range, many children had lost their parents by Christmas. “On a special train, 100 real, live, Christmas dolls were dispatched from New York the other day to many homes throughout the West,” read the caption for a group of children holding their toys that ran on the front-page of the Dec. 13 Indianapolis Star article “Tots Made Orphans by Ravages of ‘Flu’ Come as Christmas Gifts to New Homes.”The 1918 flu dragged on through the winter of 1919, and some cities facing spikes of new cases after the holidays reimposed public mask mandates.In San Francisco, an “Anti-Mask League” formed in mid-January 1919 in response to one such a mandate imposed after 600 new influenza cases were reported on January 10. While some people were definitely fed up with wearing masks, it wasn’t as politicized as it is today.“People are [currently] rejecting these recommendations,” Tom Ewing, professor of History at Virginia Tech, says. “Not because they have any scientific basis for doing so. But because they don’t like either being told what to do, or they don’t believe the people who are saying this, or there’s a political motivation. And that was not the case in 1918. There’s only people who didn’t follow instructions. And there were people who said, ‘the government can’t tell me what to do,’ but not in this organized way that we’re seeing in 2020.”Globally, about 500 million people were infected with the 1918 flu— or about a third of the population— and at least 50 million died. As Markel and Navarro previously told TIME, the 1918-1919 pandemic is believed to have ended because of what’s referred to today as “herd immunity,” meaning that the virus had infected enough people so that there weren’t enough susceptible people for the virus to continue spreading at pandemic levels.Though COVID-19 vaccines are beginning to be administered worldwide, many will have to wait several months to be vaccinated. Public health officials are urging Americans to keep up mask-wearing and social distancing, so that as many Americans as possible can celebrate the holidays next year. Mask-wearing, social-distancing, and avoiding indoor gatherings small and large were crucial to slowing the spread of the virus in 1918.As Nichols puts it, “The December holiday season was a culmination of lessons learned in 1918. The implicit subtext of that is, shouldn’t it be in 2020?”More Must-Reads from TIMEHow Donald Trump WonThe Best Inventions of 2024Why Sleep Is the Key to Living LongerRobert Zemeckis Just Wants to Move YouHow to Break 8 Toxic Communication HabitsNicola Coughlan Bet on Herself—And WonWhy Vinegar Is So Good for YouMeet TIME's Newest Class of Next Generation LeadersWrite to Olivia B.

English 日本語 简体字 繁體字 Français Español العربية Русский Every year, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare publishes weekly figures of influenza cases from September until May of the following year. Since week 36 of 2020, the 15-week period spanning from August 31 to December 13 has seen only 383 cases recorded nationwide. The average for the same period over the past five years is around 90,000, or more than 200 times as many as in the 2020–21 season so far. There is considerable variation in the number of cases as the occurrence of influenza epidemics differs from year to year. In 2019, the number already topped 3,000 when the first week figures were compiled, and rose sharply from week 45. On the other hand, in 2015, the number of cases only rose above 1,000 in week 49, but this was still more than for 2020 at the same period. MHLW records show that the latest start for a flu epidemic was in the third week of the following year (seasons 2004–05 and 2006–07). This means that there is still a possibility that the number of flu cases will increase sharply, yet the number of cases has been conspicuously low so far. It is also conceivable that the ongoing measures taken since the spring against COVID-19 have played a role in influenza prevention.

Tweet Share Share Comment Tweet Share Share Comment This, of course, is not the first holiday season in the United States to take place during a pandemic. As Christmas neared in 1918, people were cautiously optimistic, because that winter’s “grippe” (as they sometimes called it) seemed a bit milder than the preceding year’s. They were elated, because World War I was over, and America was on the winning side; they were feeling patriotic and ready to spend money. They were exhausted and sad; they were ready to move on. Meanwhile, the flu continued to spread. In the Influenza Encyclopedia—a project edited by historian Howard Markel and produced by the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine—you can read newspaper coverage of that flu Christmas. These scanned pages do an excellent job at conveying the weird mix of fear and optimism Americans felt, in this same season of their own pandemic. Here are some of the things people were reading, in December of that bad/good year. Baltimore Sun, Dec. 4, 1918 Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement York, Pa. Dec. 3.—The influenza is sweeping the county and closing the schools in all sections. It is the opinion of many physicians that it emanates directly from the county teachers’ institute held in York last week. … Reports are coming in from all sections of the county of teachers having the disease. York, Pa., Dec. 8.—The Red Lion schools will only be closed one day this year for the Christmas holidays. Heretofore it was customary to close the schools for 10 days. The board decided to close only one day this year in order to make up some of the time lost during the influenza epidemic. Here’s the Influenza Encyclopedia’s article about Baltimore’s experience with the flu. Advertisement Milwaukee Journal, Dec. 5, 1918 Shorewood school was closed Wednesday night on account of the influenza and will remain closed until after the holidays. Arrangements will be made for home study by the pupils. The Nunnemacher hospital appealed to the Red Cross to supply additional nurses. …The influenza epidemic may interfere seriously with the handling of the Christmas mail. Every department of the post office has been affected. Postmaster Frank H. Schutz urges prompt mailing of all presents and cards. Milwaukee and the flu. Advertisement Advertisement Boston Globe, Dec. 12, 1918 Precautions as to visiting are urged by the Boston Health Department to guard against the further spread of the grippe during the Christmas holidays so that there may not be the same aftermath that characterized the days following the Victory Day crowds and the Thanksgiving celebrations. Boston and the flu. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Grand Rapids Herald, Dec. 17, 1918 There have been few to answer the appeal of Director Davidson of the welfare department for volunteers for nursing in the homes of the poor. The nurses and student nurses of Mt. Mercy Sisters of Mercy, 1425 Bridge Street, offered their services Monday and they will be engaged. …All society and education functions of the churches, including Christmas exercises are banned, Dr. Slemons announced Monday. Only purely religious services will be permitted. …Reports were received by the Health Department Monday that in some instances theaters have been violating the order which denies children under 16 years of age to attend. “The theater proprietors cannot accept the statements of children or their parents as to their ages,” Dr. Slemons said, “and those who attempt to throw the responsibility on the children will be punished. Their places will be closed for the period of the epidemic.” Grand Rapids, Michigan, and the flu. Advertisement Advertisement Spokesman-Review (Spokane, Washington), Dec. 20, 1918 Miss Elizabeth Newbery, commandant of the Spokane Red Cross motor corps, has filed her resignation as head of the motor corps with R.G. McClintock, chairman of the Spokane chapter, effective January 1. While Miss Newbery gave no reason for her resignation, it is understood by her friends that the increased demands upon her during the influenza epidemic have been taxing. Advertisement Reports of crowding in the stores by holiday shoppers reached the city health office yesterday. Dr. Anderson will ask the stores to maintain an inspector, sworn in by the city and paid by the store, to see that shoppers do not congest the aisles. …Christmas dances and large café dinner parties are to continue under the ban. The effect of Christmas merry making forms the only uncertainty as to controlling influenza. With this danger passed the restrictions probably will be removed. Spokane and the flu. Advertisement Advertisement Salt Lake Tribune, Dec. 21, 1918 Advertisement Advertisement Thrift and economy have been practiced to a very considerable extent during the past year, and the Spanish influenza hurt business to an almost alarming extent. But the holiday spirit is abroad in the land, and the “flu” is not as much of a menace as it was a few weeks ago. So the merchants of the United States, in Utah and Salt Lake as well as in other portions of the country, are being patronized as never before. …Shoppers are crowding the streets and stores of this city, and the hustling buyers are taking the greatest possible amount of pleasure in purchasing gifts for their families and friends and ordering the best there is in the market for next Wednesday’s feast. …We can all afford to let out a few links at this season of the year. The Lord has prospered us as a nation, and we do not need to pinch and scrape and lock up both purse and heart during the holidays. But let us not forget that the Red Cross needs money with which to carry on its great work. Salt Lake City and the flu.

ElrickNeal RubinObserver & EccentricUSA TODAY Detroit's 1918 holiday season was fairly average. Ours won't be.Darcie Moran | Detroit Free PressA mother, having lost her husband to the pandemic two weeks prior, found herself at the mercy of a Wayne County probate court on Christmas Eve, trying to get access to $680 in the bank for Christmas.“Last Christmas my husband filled the stockings. I thought, maybe – ” she stopped short while addressing a court worker.The woman wasn’t named in the Detroit Free Press’ Christmas Day newspaper in 1918, when her story first ran in a brief entry several pages in, while returning World War I soldiers relayed tales of female German gunners, aghast, on the front page. But a little over 100 years after influenza and pneumonia took her spouse, the woman’s story echoes in a different year of pandemic woes and economic concerns, even as the holidays are set to look starkly different.In a number of American cities in 1918, not unlike 2020, Christmas meant reminders to take precautions against the spread, said Dr. Howard Markel, director of the University of Michigan’s Center for the History of Medicine and co-editor of "The American Influenza Epidemic of 1918-1919: A Digital Encyclopedia."But in 1918, unlike what’s expected for 2020, holiday celebrations were fairly on-par with other years and newspapers covered the celebrations and church services, historian J. Alex Navarro, assistant director of the center and encyclopedia co-editor, said.The front page for the Free Press included a military club announcement for a grand feast for returning soldiers.The Grand Rapids Herald reported a "real Christmas," "the merriest, brightest, and most thankful Christmas the world has ever known," according to documentation in the flu encyclopedia.Podcast: Second wave of coronavirus deaths could be worse if history is any indicationMore: Michiganders can unite to fight the pandemic. We've done it before.There was a decrease in flu cases in the Eastern and Midwestern United States between late November and mid-December, Markel said.The worst was indeed over for many parts of the country, Navarro said.But a happy holiday did not, perhaps, translate into a happy next year.Markel pointed to a mid-December and then January rise in cases across the regions that enjoyed low holiday case counts, saying the timing indicates holiday plans contributed to cases. Data in the encyclopedia doesn’t show this in Detroit in January, but he noted some data sets aren’t as good as others.Looking forward to 2020, there’s a lesson there, he said.“To me, the lesson is that congregating during the holidays, then and now for a casually, easily transmitted respiratory virus, is not a good idea,” he said. “Now, I don't mean to be the Grinch who stole Christmas, although I have been called that on Twitter lately.”Navarro agreed Christmas 2020 is a bad time to congregate but isn’t quite convinced when it comes to the spike that occurred following the 1918 holiday, because it just wasn’t as bad as before and deaths were declining in some cases. He suspects family gatherings could have contributed to the increase, but also said that lifting responsive restrictions allowed cases to creep up, he said.Looking forward to the novel coronavirus in 2020, Navarro warned the 1918 pandemic isn’t always comparable. It’s not the same disease or the same circumstances, he said.“I don't want to give people the impression that because they went ahead, and most people had a ‘normal Thanksgiving and Christmas’ in 1918, that we can do so today safely,” he said. “We're in the midst of a really bad surge of cases of COVID-19 today and this is not the time to be having family gatherings.”There were similarities in the responses to the pandemics.Both pandemics reached the presidency, The Washington Post reported.Officials in Michigan grappled with pushback and weighed needs for bans, business closures and canceled classes, the flu encyclopedia showed. Teachers came to the rescue in one capacity or another (in 1918, canvassing for illnesses and aiding families).There was an “Anti-Mask League” in San Francisco in 1918, though the anti-mask sentiment was not so widespread or seemingly tied to political ideologies as 2020, Navarro said. And though a massive volunteer effort in 1918 took the place of nurses being used for war efforts and to aid neighbors, Americans still sought to support each other and volunteer in 2020, he said. The biggest difference likely felt during the holidays in 1918 was for those who lost a loved one, Navarro said.“Just as for families today grieving over the loss of loved ones from COVID-19, Christmas was not the same for them,” he said.The unnamed woman in that Dec. 25, 1918, Free Press story got the slightest bit of a reprieve amid her grief.The court worker tracked down a youthful-looking probate judge, a father himself, who appointed the mother a special administrator of the estate, with powers to pull money from the bank. “From the bank, she was seen going toward a toy store,” the Free Press reported.More than 11,000 Michiganders and more than 320,000 Americans, total, have died of COVID-19. The flu pandemic of 1918 was estimated to have killed 650,000 Americans.Darcie Moran is a breaking news reporter and podcaster for the Detroit Free Press. Contact Moran: dmoran@freepress.com.

YonhapSouth Korea said Monday that it has expanded disinfection operations at major wild bird habitats and poultry farms to cope with the rising number of highly pathogenic bird flu cases."Due to the influx of migratory birds into the country, contaminants can get into local farms at anytime," the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said in a statement."As we are facing a grave situation, there will be zero tolerance of any violation of the quarantine guidelines," it added.Local authorities are using 958 units of vehicles and drones to carry out disinfection operations in surrounding areas of poultry farms.The agricultural ministry also advised farms to apply disinfectants around their farms and clean floors on a daily basis. They are also requested the changing of shoes when moving among sheds.The country has so far reported 18 highly pathogenic bird flu cases from poultry farms, including at a private park, since late November. No suspected cases were under investigation as of early Monday.A chicken farm in Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province, is being disinfected on Dec. 16 after pathogens found from there were confirmed those of avian influenza. YonhapThe virus has especially spread at a faster pace in South Jeolla Province, which accounted for six infections. Four were from North Jeolla Province.The spread of the virus has led authorities to cull 6.1 million poultry so far, including 4 million chickens and 1.2 million quails. Under local law, poultry within a 3-kilometer radius of farms infected with highly pathogenic cases must be destroyed.The country reported this year's first highly pathogenic avian influenza case from wild birds in late October. A total of 30 cases was confirmed from wild bird habitats across the country.The ministry, meanwhile, said the latest cases of bird flu have had only a limited impact on the local market for poultry and eggs."The price of eggs has recently increased around 7.3 percent compared to the yearly average," the ministry said, pointing out that retailers also have sufficient volumes of poultry products in stock.

YonhapSouth Korea's agricultural ministry said Wednesday it has issued a standstill order in Gyeonggi Province that surrounds Seoul, along with the central city of Sejong and adjacent provinces of Chungcheong, due to a series of highly pathogenic bird flu cases identified from poultry farms.The 24-hour order, which will run through 1:00 a.m. Thursday, will ban travel of all livestock, workers and automobiles working for poultry farms in the regions, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.Violators of the standstill order will face up to one year in prison or fines of 10 million won (US$9,000).The measure came a day after an egg farm in Yeoju, 105 kilometers south of Seoul, reported the country's 19th farm-related highly pathogenic avian influenza case.Officials also launched investigations after suspected cases were reported from a duck farm in North Chungcheong Province, along with another egg farm in Hwaseong, which also lies south of the capital city.South Korea reported this year's first highly pathogenic avian influenza case from wild birds in late October. A total of 33 cases were confirmed from wild bird habitats across the country.
