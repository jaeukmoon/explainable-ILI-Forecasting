1. Influenza virus outbreaks pose significant risks to global health, and public health authorities rely on clinical surveillance to locate and monitor cases and outbreaks.
2. Wastewater surveillance (WWS) is being explored as a less resource-intensive method to complement clinical surveillance for monitoring influenza outbreaks.
3. By analyzing viral fragments in wastewater, researchers have shown that influenza virus targets are stable in wastewater and can be quantified, typed, and subtyped.
4. WWS has the potential to provide an early warning of flu outbreaks, as demonstrated in a study where a citywide flu outbreak was forecasted with a 17-day lead time using wastewater analysis.
5. WWS can also provide population-level viral subtyping in near real-time, offering valuable information for public health response.
6. WWS is a promising tool for influenza surveillance at both the municipal and neighborhood levels, requiring minimal resources and infrastructure.
7. WWS can provide anonymous and aggregated data quickly and at low cost, supporting and complementing clinical surveillance programs and enhancing health emergency response.
