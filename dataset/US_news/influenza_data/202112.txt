Here we show that computationally designed, two-component nanoparticle immunogens2 induce potently neutralizing and broadly protective antibody responses against a wide variety of influenza viruses. The nanoparticle immunogens contain 20 haemagglutinin glycoprotein trimers in an ordered array, and their assembly in vitro enables the precisely controlled co-display of multiple distinct haemagglutinin proteins in defined ratios. Nanoparticle immunogens that co-display the four haemagglutinins of licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines elicited antibody responses in several animal models against vaccine-matched strains that were equivalent to or better than commercial quadrivalent influenza vaccines, and simultaneously induced broadly protective antibody responses to heterologous viruses by targeting the subdominant yet conserved haemagglutinin stem. The combination of potent receptor-blocking and cross-reactive stem-directed antibodies induced by the nanoparticle immunogens makes them attractive candidates for a supraseasonal influenza vaccine candidate with the potential to replace conventional seasonal vaccines3.

Evaluating the usefulness of influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance systems and developing approaches for forecasting future trends is important for pandemic preparedness. We applied and compared a range of robust statistical and machine learning models including random forest (RF) regression, support vector machines (SVM) regression, multivariable linear regression and ARIMA models to forecast 2012 to 2018 trends of reported ILI cases in Cameroon, using Google searches for influenza symptoms, treatments, natural or traditional remedies as well as, infectious diseases with a high burden (i.e., AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis). The R2 and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) were statistically similar across most of the methods, however, RF and SVM had the highest average R2 (0.78 and 0.88, respectively) for predicting ILI per 100,000 persons at the country level. This study demonstrates the need for developing contextualized approaches when using digital data for disease surveillance and the usefulness of search data for monitoring ILI in sub-Saharan African countries.

Every year, there are about 650,000 deaths globally and three to five million respiratory illnesses due to the influenza virus2. In Africa, acute respiratory infections are thought to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality3,4, despite considerable under-reporting and sparsity of precise assessments of the total health and economic burden across the continent3,5.The 2009 influenza pandemic reinforced the necessity for developing robust influenza surveillance systems globally6. Studies published right after the pandemic noted that many countries in Africa were not equipped with sufficient data on the epidemiology and risk factors of influenza to put in place the necessary approaches for influenza prevention and control7,8. This gap in global early-detection and response measures has motivated extensive research towards improving influenza surveillance using both traditional and non-traditional data streams9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19, as well as the development of a global standard for influenza surveillance by the World Health Organization (WHO)20. Though influenza surveillance data from Africa has improved in recent years, data quality is still lagging behind those implemented in other regions of the world. This lagging is mainly due to limited capacity for laboratory confirmation of influenza diagnoses and timely reporting of virological and epidemiological data. From a global perspective, understanding influenza dynamics in the tropics is important for pandemic planning and response since poor surveillance capabilities can delay the detection of novel viruses7,21. Although more than a billion people are living in tropical regions, there are no sufficient data on influenza-related mortality and morbidity21.Digital epidemiology has enabled the use of non-traditional data sources (e.g., social media, Internet search queries) to monitor the spread of influenza-like illness (ILI)9,10,16,22,23,24,25. However, to our knowledge, no studies have focused on applying digital epidemiology to ILI surveillance in a sub-Saharan African country using data collected by a national surveillance system. Here, we seek to demonstrate that the adoption of digital data for public health surveillance in African countries requires a contextualized approach26,27. For example, cultural and societal practices unique to the sub-Saharan African context demands a rethinking of what search terms should be included in models used for surveillance. An individual with influenza-like symptoms might search for terms such as, “cold” or “catarrh”, but might also search for traditional or natural remedies and diseases such as HIV, TB and malaria, which have a high burden across sub-Saharan Africa and are well-known.In this paper we aim to model and nowcast (hereafter referred to as, forecast) ILI in Cameroon using data from a surveillance system for influenza and ILI implemented by the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Cameroon28. Recent studies on influenza and ILI surveillance in Cameroon have focused on viral identification29, understanding genetic diversity30,31, and seasonality of circulating viruses32. Here, we focus on providing a framework for forecasting future trends, which could be invaluable for public health planning and response. Specifically, we considered a range of robust regression modeling approaches that have been previously used for forecasting influenza trends11,12,33: random forest regression, support vector regression, multivariable linear regression and ARIMA models. We fitted the models to six years of weekly reported ILI cases and google search data and used one year of data, not used for model fitting, for model cross-validation and comparison. The modeling approaches with the best fit were then used in one-week ahead forecasting.ResultsThe weekly number of reported ILI cases and attack rate per 100,000 people from 2012 to 2018, collected by the Cameroon sentinel surveillance system, were obtained from the Ministry of Health (Fig. 1A). The number of reported ILI cases varied across the ten regions in Cameroon. The neighboring East and Adamaoua regions (Fig. 1B) had the highest number of reported cases; 17.1 (95% CI, 15.9–18.3) and 16.4 (95% CI, 15.7–17.1) reports per 100,000 people, respectively. The major economic regions, Littoral and Centre regions which had the most consistent reporting, had different attack rates: 8.3 (95% CI, 7.8–8.9) and 12.6 (95% CI, 12.1–13.1), respectively. There were no distinct regional groupings in reporting patterns.Figure 1Distribution of ILI reports across the timespan of the study. (A) Attack Rate per 100,000 people (mean and 95% confidence interval) for each of the ten regions. (B) Map of Cameroon with regions for reference. The map was created in R version 4.0.2.Full size imageOut-of-sample predictionsOut-of-sample predictions are predictions made by a model on data not used for model fitting. It is a cross-validation approach whereby at each modeling step, data excluded from model fitting are used in the model validation (comparing out-of-sample model predictions to data). We estimated the rate of ILI per 100,000 individuals using the following models: random forest regression (RF), support vector regression (SVM), multivariable linear regression and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. The Google search data were used as explanatory variables in all models except one set of ARIMA models, which were used as ‘baseline’ models to compare the model performance with and without Google search data. We used a leave-one-year-out approach (described in the “Methods”) to assess the usefulness of our approach for long term forecasting. Out-of-sample predictions based on the leave-1-year-out approach produced varying results across the regions. At the national level, search terms (SI Table 1) that had correlations of 0.3 or greater with ILI were used as explanatory variables in the models. These included, catarrh, pain, douleur (pain), transpire (sweat), gingembre (ginger), miel (honey), tea, malaria, paludisme (malaria), TB, AIDS, and HIV. SVM had the lowest mean RMSE and the highest mean R2—1.078 and 0.877, respectively (Fig. 2A,B). RF had a mean RMSE of 1.41 and R2 of 0.781. The ARIMA model that did not include the search terms as explanatory variables had comparable RMSE and R2 to Random Forest and the ARIMA model with explanatory variables. The R2 for SVM was statistically significantly different when compared to the multivariable and ARIMA models using the Nemenyi multiple comparison test at the 0.05 significance level. However, the RMSE for SVM was not statistically different when compared to the ARIMA model with covariates and the out-of-sample RMSE was only significantly different between SVM and the ARIMA model without covariates, and between the ARIMA models. Furthermore, the corresponding RMSE range for out-of-sample predictions using SVM was wider when compared to the other models (Fig. 2C); suggesting that SVM might not perform well in long range forecasts.Figure 2Comparison of models at the national level. (A) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of fitted values, (B) model R-squared and (C) RMSE of out-of-sample predictions. The models are Support Vector Machines Regression (SVM), Random Forest Regression, Multivariable linear regression, and ARIMA with [i.e., ARIMA (covariates)] and without (i.e., ARIMA) search data as explanatory variables.Full size imageThe regional models for Littoral performed similarly to the national models. The mean RMSE for SVM and RF were 2.412 and 2.876, respectively (Fig. 3A). While the corresponding average R2 were 0.791 and 0.691 (Fig. 3B). The mean R2 for the ARIMA models were 0.720 and 0.708 for the models with and without the Google search data, respectively. The respective mean RMSE were also in a similar range—2.73, and 2.80. The mean out-of-sample RMSE (Fig. 3C) was lower for the ARIMA model, and the ranges for models with search terms as explanatory variables were broader. The R2 and RMSE for SVM were slightly better than RF (p = 0.0115) and significantly better than multivariable regression (p < 0.005). However, the out-of-sample RMSE was not statistically significantly different. The search terms included in all the models were rhume (cold), cough, douleur (pain), aloe vera, citron (lemon), gingembre (ginger), miel (honey), malaria, TB, AIDS and HIV.Figure 3Comparison of models fitted to data for the Littoral region. (A) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of fitted values, (B) model R-squared and (C) RMSE of out-of-sample predictions. The models include Support Vector Machines Regression (SVM), Random Forest Regression, Multivariable linear regression, and ARIMA with [i.e., ARIMA (covariates)] and without (i.e., ARIMA) search data as explanatory variables.Full size imageIn contrast to the Littoral and national models, only three search terms were included in models for the Centre region; gingembre (ginger), lemon and AIDS. The data was noisier, the RMSE was higher for all models (Fig. 4A) and the highest variance explained was 55.5%; much lower compared to the national and Littoral models (Fig. 4B). The autoregressive models performed similarly, while the multivariable linear regression models had the poorest goodness of fit (mean R2 = 0.190) (Fig. 4C). The R2 for the ARIMA models were statistically significantly better than the multivariable model. The RMSE for the ARIMA models were also statistically better than the other model and out-of-sample RMSE was statistically better than that for RF and SVM.Figure 4Comparison of models fitted to data for the Centre region. (A) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of fitted values, (B) model R-squared and (C) RMSE of out-of-sample predictions. The models are Support Vector Machines Regression (SVM), Random Forest Regression, Multivariable linear regression, and ARIMA with [i.e., ARIMA (covariates)] and without (i.e., ARIMA) search data as explanatory variables.Full size imageThese differences across the three regions show variability in data quality and highlight the need for regional models that capture underlying trends in reporting.One-week-ahead forecastsThe same models used in out-of-sample predictions were also evaluated for one-week ahead forecasts of the rate of ILI per 100,000 individuals. The Google search data were also used as explanatory variables in all models except the baseline model. The correlation between the national rate of ILI per 100,000 individuals and forecasted values were 72.9% and 66.8% using the SVM and Random Forest models, respectively (Fig. 5). The search terms by order of importance in the Random Forest model were as follows: AIDS, catarrh, HIV, paludisme, gingembre, tea, miel (honey), malaria, transpire (sweat), douleur (pain), TB, and pain. Similar results were obtained for the Littoral region, where the correlation between the predicted ILI values and the reported rate of ILI per 100,000 individuals was 80.9% and 60.29% for SVM and Random Forest, respectively (Fig. 6). While the point estimates using the SVM model were more aligned with the reported ILI values, the confidence intervals for Random Forest were more robust. Furthermore, the ARIMA models also had similar performance as the SVM and Random Forest models for both the national (62.4% and 58.9%) and Littoral (71.1% and 71.1%) regions, however, the confidence intervals were not robust. In contrast, the best forecast for the Centre region was based on the ARIMA model using solely ILI data. The correlation between the forecasted values and the ILI data was 44.6%.Figure 595% Confidence Intervals (CI) for 1-week-ahead predictions of rate of ILI per 100,000 inhabitants at the national level.

However, despite its global significance, influenza surveillance systems in sub-Saharan Africa are lagging behind those in other regions of the world. National surveillance systems can fill in this gap in monitoring influenza-like illnesses, including emerging viruses, if the systems are well-designed, maintained and regularly evaluated. However, as noted across several countries including the United States, ILI reports from official sources such as, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can be delayed9,34. Digital data sources can be used to supplement data from official sources.In this study, we have shown that health information seeking trends on the Internet could be accurate predictors of disease trend in sub-Saharan African countries. Our results highlight two important public health opportunities for sub-Saharan Africa. First, health information seeking trends on the Internet are useful for monitoring health information needs in sub-Saharan African countries27. So, as mobile phone and Internet usage increases across the continent, data produced using these technologies can provide a supplementary approach for monitoring disease trends. However, the local context is important in both research and interpretation of findings. Search terms commonly associated with specific infectious diseases (such as, influenza or COVID-19) in western countries might not be associated with those diseases in sub-Saharan African countries35. For example: ginger, lemon, malaria, and AIDS were shown to be associated with ILI in Cameroon, where this is likely not ne the case in western countries. Second, our study also highlights a need for public health education about influenza and influenza-like illness in Cameroon. Africans, like people in other regions of the world, use the Internet for information seeking. Understanding how different Internet platforms are used can be useful for designing appropriate public health interventions, including disease prevention measures and education on the causes and treatment of diseases26,27,36.Our findings suggest that search data related to influenza symptoms, treatments, natural or traditional remedies as well as infectious diseases with a high burden (i.e., AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis) in sub-Saharan countries could be useful for tracking ILI trends. Specifically, terms such as, cold, catarrh, and pain, and home remedies such as, tea, ginger and honey, were important predictors of ILI trends. Searches for AIDS and HIV might be due to HIV confirmed individuals searching if ILI symptoms are considered HIV symptoms. Studies have shown that individuals prefer using search engines to seek information on stigmatized topics37.Also, our methods perform best in short-term forecasting, but also suggest some usability for long-term forecasting as demonstrated in the leave-1-year-out evaluation. Furthermore, ARIMA models using previous values of ILI to predict current values achieved reasonable accuracy suggesting that previously observed ILI trends can be used for predicting current and future trends. The machine learning regression methods, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines, performed similarly with some minor differences. The confidence intervals in the SVM model were more heavily influenced by variability in the search data and the ILI reports, when compared to the Random Forest estimates. Future studies will focus on developing ensemble approaches involving the consensus of multiple algorithms for real-time forecasting.Syndromic and pre-diagnostic healthcare data (e.g., school absenteeism, pharmacy sales) in conjunction with statistical methods to monitor and characterize epidemics earlier than traditional public health systems and to provide situational awareness for ongoing outbreaks has been shown to be useful38,39. However, clear definitions of disease symptoms are important, especially when many diseases can cause influenza-like symptoms. To accomplish this, interventions including education on the causes and treatments of influenza-like disease are needed. These non-traditional methods can supplement traditional surveillance, however, the need for developing reliable surveillance systems remains. Additionally, consistent data collection procedures and case definition are necessary for evaluation of ILI surveillance systems. ILI cases are most likely severely underreported in Cameroon, and there is not sufficient information to adjust the data accordingly. To use these data and methods in reliable real-time weekly forecasting of ILI cases, these limitations in the data and collection systems need to be addressed.Another challenge with forecasting ILI trends in subtropical and tropical regions is that seasonality is less defined; some regions experience semi-annual epidemics or annual influenza activity without a well-defined season while others have yearly epidemics that correspond with the rainy season17,40. Indoor crowding during the rainy season has been suggested as a possible driver of influenza epidemics in the tropics21,41. Moreover, a recent modeling study on Influenza seasonality in the tropics and subtropics showed that absolute humidity and temperature, respectively, have a bimodal and nonlinear effect on influenza transmission in Hong Kong,42 whereas previous modeling studies have shown that a unimodal effect of absolute humidity on transmission can accurately forecast the dynamics of seasonal influenza in temperate regions43,44. In the temperate regions of the world, influenza has marked seasonal patterns with increased rates during the winter months, followed by low activity during the warmer months45,46.There are also limitations in the use of search data for disease surveillance. For instance, methods addressing spurious spikes in searches due to other factors such as, media coverage or reports of deaths, are needed47. This is especially relevant when developing approaches for monitoring emerging diseases such as the COVID-19, where media coverage and digital platforms have influenced the dissemination of information and population response.48 Search data is also not always representative of the entire population due to factors such as, variability in internet penetration, access and socioeconomic factors36,49. Furthermore, integrating these data with data from other digital sources can help to mitigate limitations inherent in each individual data source10.Despite these limitations, these data have the potential to improve the timely detection of outbreaks and surges in unusual disease activity requiring further public health investigation. A lack of comprehensive health data in most sub-Saharan African countries is a major roadblock to disease control. The most effective approach to mitigating a potential pandemic is to stem disease emergence at its location of origin, the success of which depends on efficient disease surveillance systems. Addressing gaps in surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa should be a priority in our global preparedness and response strategies for influenza and other acute respiratory infections. Data from digital sources could support the development of up-to-date disease surveillance systems.MethodsILI dataThe Cameroon sentinel surveillance system aims to detect the current type of influenza viruses and involves 22 health facilities across the country. The system also involves influenza-like illness surveillance based on symptom definition and is designed for early warning detections of surges. ILI was defined as sudden onset of fever (temperature > 38 °C) and cough or sore throat, with the onset of symptoms within the five days before presentation at a health facility based on the WHO’s Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR)50. The Cameroon sentinel surveillance system provided a weekly number of cases reported each week to the Cameroon Ministry of Health (MOH) in Yaoundé from January 2012 to December 2018.Google Search DataWe obtained the weekly volume of Google searches for 65 terms (see SI Table 1) in both French and English from the Google API at the national level, and for the Centre and Littoral regions from January 2012 to December 2018. Data was sparser for the other regions. The Google search terms consisted of ILI symptoms, home remedies typically used in Cameroon for colds, and inquiries for malaria, HIV/AIDs, and TB. We were particularly interested in home remedies because it captures a context-specific approach to managing ILI symptoms. Next, we excluded all search terms that had zero variance or had a Pearson correlation of less than 0.3, with weekly ILI reports from our data so we could focus our analysis on the most relevant terms. This resulted in three, eleven and twelve terms separately for the Centre region, Littoral region and the whole country. The Google search data represents aggregated anonymized queries that are normalized based on the geographical location and time. The searches are divided by the total volume of searches for that region and specific time range51. This suggests that zeroes in the data might not necessarily represent zero searches in a particular time period.Statistical analysisWe used statistical and machine learning to models to nowcast ILI trends in Cameroon using weekly reported ILI cases and google search data from January 2012 to December 2018. To assess the potential usefulness of our approach for public health decision making in Cameroon, we performed two sets of analysis. First, we used a cross-validation approach whereby at each modeling step, one year of data is excluded from the fitting and used in the model validation. Since there were seven years of data, this implies seven different models were fitted. Next, the best modeling approach based on the model R2 and the root mean squared error (RMSE) were used in one-week ahead forecasting. This allows for forecasting the current reported rate of ILI per 100,000 inhabitants. Because Google search data were sparse for most regions of the country, the analyses were performed only for the Centre and Littoral regions, and the whole country.We evaluated several multivariable regression models with the search data as explanatory variables and the ILI as the dependent variable. Regression models are traditional statistical models that are widely used to analyze quantitative data and make predictions about future values of the data. Here, we considered a range of robust regression modeling approaches that have been previously used for forecasting influenza trends11,12,33: random forest regression, support vector regression, multivariable linear regression and ARIMA models.Random Forest is an ensemble of regression trees created by using bootstrap samples of the data and random feature selection in tree induction. To construct regression trees each node is split using the best split among a subset of predictors randomly chosen at that node. It is an extension of bagging—bootstrap aggregating—a method for combining several predictors to decrease the variance of the prediction function52,53,54. There are several advantages to random forests including, high accuracy, robustness to overfitting, and estimation of important variables54. These are useful for identifying which covariates are most significant in the model54. To address bias in Random Forest, we applied the linear model correction conceptually described in Zhang and Lu (2012)55.Regression with Support Vector Machines (SVM) involves mapping the independent variables into a high-dimensional feature space using a linear or non-linear kernel function56. SVM regression with the linear kernel is akin to multivariate linear regression models. We used a radial kernel in SVM, since it fitted best to the data trend, and was selected using the tuning function in R57,58. The confidence intervals for SVM and RF were obtained using quantile SVM regression and quantile regression forests, respectively59.ARIMA models are represented as ARIMA(p,d,q), where p denotes the autoregressive (AR) order, d the differencing order and q the moving average (MA) order. ARIMA models are widely used in time series forecasting. The model assumes that the time series is stationary60,61,62. The ARIMA models were implemented using the auto.arima function in the forecast package in R63 to select the model with the best fit based on the AIC and BIC at each time point . We used the Friedman test and Nemenyi multiple comparison test to compare the R2, and RMSE across the models at the 0.05 significance level64,65.The ARIMA, random forest, SVM, and multivariable linear regression models involved fitting ILI to the Google search terms as explanatory variables. To capture the potential delay between the time when an individual with symptoms searches for information online, and when they visit a healthcare facility, we lagged some search terms for up to four weeks in the regression models based on prior examination of the cross correlations between the ILI data and search terms. We also applied LOESS (Local Polynomial Regression Fitting) smoothing to the search terms to capture the overall data trend, while reducing the noise introduced by weeks with zero searches. Similar approaches have been used in studies using digital data for disease modeling66,67. The LOESS parameter was set at 0.045. ReferencesFischer, W.

There is increasing evidence that immunologic processes are involved in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.1 Greater increases in circulating plasma interleukin-6 1 day after seasonal influenza vaccination have been reported to be associated with greater mood disturbance on post-vaccine days in healthy volunteers, specifically depressed mood and cognitive symptoms.2 Here, a case report is presented of a patient who experienced a sudden relapse of bipolar depression within a few hours of receiving seasonal influenza vaccination. Case Report A 49-year-old white woman who has a history of bipolar depression well controlled on her regimen of medications, which included buspirone 15 mg twice/d, lurasidone 20 mg/d, oxcarbazepine 300 mg twice/day, trazodone 50 mg at bedtime, and lisdexamfetamine 30 mg in the morning (for comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), was seen for a routine follow-up visit. At that time, her depression was in full remission, and she had scored 0 on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).3 Two weeks later, she returned to the clinic for an urgent, unscheduled visit due to escalating depression, which was rated as 18/27 on the PHQ-9 (a score of 15–19 is considered moderately severe). She said that a week earlier, she had received a seasonal flu vaccine injection and within a couple of hours started feeling depressed and became tearful. These symptoms were followed a couple of days later with aches and pains, which escalated over the subsequent days. She complained of joint pain, burning pains in her small joints, and myalgia. She rated her pain as 6/10. She also noticed ringing in her ears for the previous 2 days. We discussed the possibility that her depression might be a reaction to the flu vaccine. On the assumption that her relapse of depression was related to an immune response, we agreed to a trial of celecoxib 200 mg twice/d, and she was asked to return in a week if her condition did not improve. She returned to the clinic 8 weeks later for a previously scheduled appointment and reported having experienced a dramatic response to celecoxib. Her depression had remitted rapidly, and she scored 0/27 on the PHQ-9. She reported an additional benefit of improved interpersonal interactions. Discussion This patient experienced a rapid relapse of her bipolar depression within a couple of hours after receiving a seasonal flu vaccine injection. Her depression resolved when treated with celecoxib, and she continues to feel better on celecoxib. This case seems to be consistent with a recent report of celecoxib improving treatment-resistant bipolar depression.4 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, flu vaccination coverage among adults ≥ 18 years for the 2018–2019 season was 45.3%, an increase of 8.2 percentage points from the 2017–2018 flu season.5 As we approach the next flu season, we can expect a higher rate of participation in receiving vaccinations, given the current heightened concern about the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Should our bipolar patients experience vaccination-induced relapse of depression, adding celecoxib to their treatment regimen could be helpful. Published online: March 25, 2021.

Second, Dr Andrade should have warned readers that Bacloville’s results are most questionable, lacking robustness. Although he cited us,3 he overlooked the evidence we provided indicating that the Bacloville article4 was published without acknowledging major changes to the initial protocol, affecting the primary outcome. Coincidentally (although as skeptics, we do not believe in coincidence), the initial statistical team was changed when data were sold to the French pharmaceutical company applying for the marketing authorization in France. As Ronald H. Coase warned, “If you torture the data long enough, it will confess.” Related Articles × Close Table Of Contents × CloseWill COVID-19 vaccines need to be adapted reg | EurekAlert!

Peer-Reviewed Publication Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin image: Just like the phylogenetic tree of the influenza virus subtype H3N2 (right), the phylogenetic tree of the 'common cold' coronavirus 229E (left) shows an asymmetrical shape, indicating a shift towards evasion of the immune system (antigenic drift). Scale: Mutations per nucleotide (genetic building block). view more Credit: Image: Jó/Charité Influenza vaccines need to be evaluated every year to ensure they remain effective against new influenza viruses. Will the same apply to COVID-19 vaccines? In order to gauge whether and to what extent this may be necessary, a team of researchers from Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin compared the evolution of endemic 'common cold' coronaviruses with that of influenza viruses. The researchers predict that, while the pandemic is ongoing, vaccines will need to undergo regular updates. A few years into the post-pandemic period, however, vaccines are likely to remain effective for longer. This study has been published in Virus Evolution*. Influenza viruses are masters at evading the human immune system. They undergo such rapid changes that antibodies produced by the immune system in response to a previous infection or vaccination become unable to neutralize them. This is why the complex task of evaluating and updating the seasonal influenza vaccine has to be repeated every year. Mutations within SARS-CoV-2 have already produced a number of variants, some of which (such as the South African variant) partially evade the body's immune response. As a result, some vaccine manufacturers have already started to develop new versions of their vaccines. What does this mean for the future? Will COVID-19 vaccines mirror influenza vaccines in requiring regular updates? In order to gauge whether, over the long term, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to demonstrate an immune evasion capability on par with that of influenza viruses, Charité virologists have studied the genetic evolution of the four currently known 'common cold' coronaviruses. These relatively harmless coronaviruses are known to be responsible for approximately 10 percent of common colds in the world and have been in circulation in humans significantly longer than SARS-CoV-2. Just like SARS-CoV-2, they enter human cells using the 'spike protein', a surface protein which gives the virus its characteristic crown-like appearance (and name). The spike protein also forms the target of all current COVID-19 vaccines. For their study, the researchers focused on the two longest-known coronaviruses (termed 229E and OC43), tracing changes in the spike gene approximately 40 years into the past. The researchers started by comparing sequences from a range of old samples which had been deposited in a genetic sequence data bank. Based on the mutations which had emerged over time, they then produced phylogenetic trees for both coronaviruses. The researchers compared their findings with the phylogenetic tree of H3N2, an influenza subtype which is particularly effective at evading the human immune response. The researchers' calculations revealed one feature which was common to the phylogenetic reconstructions of both the coronaviruses and the influenza virus: all three had a pronounced ladder-like shape. "An asymmetrical tree of this kind likely results from the repeated replacement of one circulating virus variant by another which carried a fitness advantage," explains the study's first author, Dr. Wendy K. Jó from Charité's Institute of Virology. "This is evidence of 'antigenic drift', a continuous process involving changes to surface structures which enable viruses to evade the human immune response. It means that these endemic coronaviruses also evade the immune system, just like the influenza virus. However, one also has to look at the speed with which this evolutionary adaptation happens." For this step, the researchers determined the three viruses' evolutionary rates. While the influenza virus accumulated 25 mutations per 10,000 nucleotides (genetic building blocks) per year, the coronaviruses accumulated approximately 6 such mutations in the same timeframe. The rate of change of the endemic coronaviruses was therefore four times slower than that of the influenza virus. "As far as SARS-CoV-2 is concerned, this is good news," summarizes Prof. Dr. Christian Drosten, Director of the Institute of Virology and a researcher at the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF). SARS-CoV-2 is currently estimated to change at a rate of approximately 10 mutations per 10,000 nucleotides per year, meaning the speed at which it evolves is substantially higher than that of the endemic coronaviruses. "This rapid genetic change in SARS-CoV-2 is reflected in the emergence of numerous virus variants across the globe," explains study lead Prof. Dr. Jan Felix Drexler, a researcher at both the Institute of Virology and the DZIF. "This, however, is likely due to the high rates of infection seen during the pandemic. When infection numbers are so high, a virus is able to evolve more rapidly. Based on the rates of evolution seen in the endemic common cold coronaviruses, we expect that SARS-CoV-2 will start to change more slowly once infections start to die down - meaning once a large proportion of the global population has developed immunity either as a result of infection or through vaccination. We expect therefore that COVID-19 vaccines will need to be monitored regularly throughout the pandemic and updated where necessary. Once the situation has stabilized, vaccines are likely to remain effective for longer." *Jo WK et al. The evolutionary dynamics of endemic human coronaviruses.

State and local officials enact a slate of social-distancing measures, gathering bans, closure orders and mask mandates in an effort to stem the tide of cases and deaths. The public responds with widespread compliance mixed with more than a hint of grumbling, pushback and even outright defiance. As the days turn into weeks turn into months, the strictures become harder to tolerate. Theater and dance hall owners complain about their financial losses. Clergy bemoan church closures while offices, factories and in some cases even saloons are allowed to remain open. Officials argue whether children are safer in classrooms or at home. No mask, no service on streetcar in 1918. Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Many citizens refuse to don face masks while in public, some complaining that they’re uncomfortable and others arguing that the government has no right to infringe on their civil liberties. As familiar as it all may sound in 2021, these are real descriptions of the U.S. during the deadly 1918 influenza pandemic. In my research as a historian of medicine, I’ve seen again and again the many ways our current pandemic has mirrored the one experienced by our forebears a century ago. As the COVID-19 pandemic enters its second year, many people want to know when life will go back to how it was before the coronavirus. History, of course, isn’t an exact template for what the future holds. But the way Americans emerged from the earlier pandemic could suggest what post-pandemic life will be like this time around. Sick and tired, ready for pandemic’s end Like COVID-19, the 1918 influenza pandemic hit hard and fast, going from a handful of reported cases in a few cities to a nationwide outbreak within a few weeks. Many communities issued several rounds of various closure orders – corresponding to the ebbs and flows of their epidemics – in an attempt to keep the disease in check. These social-distancing orders worked to reduce cases and deaths. Just as today, however, they often proved difficult to maintain. By the late autumn, just weeks after the social-distancing orders went into effect, the pandemic seemed to be coming to an end as the number of new infections declined. People were ready to be done with masks as soon as it looked like the flu was receding. PhotoQuest/Archive Photos via Getty Images People clamored to return to their normal lives. Businesses pressed officials to be allowed to reopen. Believing the pandemic was over, state and local authorities began rescinding public health edicts. The nation turned its efforts to addressing the devastation influenza had wrought. For the friends, families and co-workers of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who had died, post-pandemic life was filled with sadness and grief. Many of those still recovering from their bouts with the malady required support and care as they recuperated. At a time when there was no federal or state safety net, charitable organizations sprang into action to provide resources for families who had lost their breadwinners, or to take in the countless children left orphaned by the disease. For the vast majority of Americans, though, life after the pandemic seemed to be a headlong rush to normalcy. Starved for weeks of their nights on the town, sporting events, religious services, classroom interactions and family gatherings, many were eager to return to their old lives. Taking their cues from officials who had – somewhat prematurely – declared an end to the pandemic, Americans overwhelmingly hurried to return to their pre-pandemic routines. They packed into movie theaters and dance halls, crowded in stores and shops, and gathered with friends and family. Officials had warned the nation that cases and deaths likely would continue for months to come. The burden of public health, however, now rested not on policy but rather on individual responsibility. Predictably, the pandemic wore on, stretching into a third deadly wave that lasted through the spring of 1919, with a fourth wave hitting in the winter of 1920. Some officials blamed the resurgence on careless Americans. Others downplayed the new cases or turned their attention to more routine public health matters, including other diseases, restaurant inspections and sanitation. Despite the persistence of the pandemic, influenza quickly became old news. Once a regular feature of front pages, reportage rapidly dwindled to small, sporadic clippings buried in the backs of the nation’s newspapers. The nation carried on, inured to the toll the pandemic had taken and the deaths yet to come. People were largely unwilling to return to socially and economically disruptive public health measures. No matter the era, aspects of daily life go on even during a pandemic. Chicago History Museum/Archive Photos via Getty Images It’s hard to hang in there Our predecessors might be forgiven for not staying the course longer. First, the nation was eager to celebrate the recent end of World War I, an event that perhaps loomed larger in the lives of Americans than even the pandemic. Second, death from disease was a much larger part of life in the early 20th century, and scourges such as diphtheria, measles, tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, scarlet fever and pneumonia each routinely killed tens of thousands of Americans every year. Moreover, neither the cause nor the epidemiology of influenza was well understood, and many experts remained unconvinced that social distancing measures had any measurable impact. Finally, there were no effective flu vaccines to rescue the world from the ravages of the disease. In fact, the influenza virus would not be discovered for another 15 years, and a safe and effective vaccine was not available for the general population until 1945. Given the limited information they had and the tools at their disposal, Americans perhaps endured the public health restrictions for as long as they reasonably could. A century later, and a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, it is understandable that people now are all too eager to return to their old lives. The end of this pandemic inevitably will come, as it has with every previous one humankind has experienced. If we have anything to learn from the history of the 1918 influenza pandemic, as well as our experience thus far with COVID-19, however, it is that a premature return to pre-pandemic life risks more cases and more deaths. And today’s Americans have significant advantages over those of a century ago. We have a much better understanding of virology and epidemiology. We know that social distancing and masking work to help save lives. Most critically, we have multiple safe and effective vaccines that are being deployed, with the pace of vaccinations increasingly weekly. Sticking with all these coronavirus-fighting factors or easing off on them could mean the difference between a new disease surge and a quicker end to the pandemic. COVID-19 is much more transmissible than influenza, and several troubling SARS-CoV-2 variants are already spreading around the globe. The deadly third wave of influenza in 1919 shows what can happen when people prematurely relax their guard. [Deep knowledge, daily.

Social distancing Part of the The Coronavirus Update series March 25, 2021 7 min read Andres Mendoza ’23 wondered whether Harvard was heeding the lessons from history when it ordered students to evacuate the campus last March as the COVID-19 outbreak began to spread. The then-first-year, who returned to his native Panama as the campus began to shut down, wanted to find out how the University had dealt with the 1918 influenza pandemic. And he chose to do what any curious student would do: He wrote a paper about it. Events can be better understood from a historical lens, he wrote in his paper “Addressing Pandemics: 1918” for his expository writing class. Learning about the pandemic a century ago gave him insights into our current one, and along the way he learned something else. “The biggest takeaway for me was that we should not ignore history,” Mendoza said on a Zoom call from Panama. “What we can learn from past history is the knowledge and ability to look back to inform our decisions and actions toward the future.” As Mendoza plunged into his research, he became fascinated by the similarities and differences between past and present, including the controversies over the decisions taken 100 years apart. “It was interesting to study something that was being repeated,” he said. In both cases Harvard decided to carry on with classes. But in 1918 students remained on campus; last March, students were sent home, and campus closed. More than 2,100 were enrolled for the 1918‒1919 academic year, according to University records. Abbott Lawrence Lowell, President of Harvard (1909‒1933), justified his decision, saying the University was “acting under the best medical advice.” In fact, in a letter to a student who questioned his decision, Lowell explained that his first concern was actually their health and safety. “The medical men thought it was better not to close the college; that to send the men here back to their towns would have a bad effect; that they could be better looked after here than they could if dispersed,” Lowell wrote. The University implemented measures to contain transmission of the virus on campus. Classes were kept small, barracks uncrowded, and administrators focused on “careful supervision and treatment of students.” Lowell ordered that anyone who sneezed or coughed during lectures had to be quarantined. The measures helped keep the epidemic under control. In his report to Lowell, Professor of Hygiene Roger I. Lee wrote, “The entire college population was examined, and quarantine and isolation measures were adopted when necessary. While these precautions did not eradicate influenza from the University, nevertheless the University suffered much less than most communities.” A report by College physician Marshall H. Bailey provided more details about the effects of the pandemic on students. Bailey said 258 were treated for influenza on campus at the Stillman Infirmary. Sixty-one students developed pneumonia, and six died. Bailey attributed the low mortality to the “Harvard system of medical supervision.” “With few exceptions these 258 students sick with influenza were put to bed before they felt much ill,” said Bailey, “often before they were willing to go until the importance of early care was explained to them.” Mendoza relished digging into the archives of The Harvard Crimson, papers published in public health and medical journals, and other old records, but the highlights of his findings were the letters and accounts written by Lowell. “You could basically see that he wasn’t sure what decision to take,” he said. Reflecting on President Larry Bacow’s decision to send students home last March, Mendoza said in the beginning he was frustrated, like many students, but after his research, he agreed that it was the right thing to do. “What I learned is that the sooner you act and intervene and restrict social gatherings, the sooner you will be able to get on with post-pandemic life,” said Mendoza. Mendoza, who spent part of his freshman year and all of last fall in Panama, returned to campus this spring. The Cabot House resident said he very much looks forward to the fall.

(Supplied: Seqirus)Professor Booy said the advantage of using cell-based technology is that it enables scientists to grow influenza viruses without them mutating."Whereas you often find that for the influenza virus to survive in eggs, it has to change a little, it has to mutate," he said.Because the virus doesn't mutate, the cell-based technology produces a vaccine that is a "better match" to the four strains recommended annually by the WHO. It's "much less likely to be contaminated in any way," he said."It's a closed biological system."So when they grow the virus, the change of any contamination is reduced, it's faster, you get a bigger yield."Dr Pearce said the main advantage of cell-based influenza technology was that experts could design the vaccine to mirror specific strains better than using traditional technology."We're expecting [the cell-based vaccine] to be maybe 5 or 10 per cent more effective," he said.The immunisation rolloutBoth the traditional egg-based vaccine and the new cell-based technology contains four influenza virus strains — two influenza A subtypes and two influenza B lineages.Read more about COVID-19 vaccines:The 'concerning' divide in Australians' attitudes to vaccinesTracking Australia's COVID vaccine rolloutIn Australia, vaccination for certain groups of people (such as older adults, pregnant women and babies) is funded under the National Immunisation Program (NIP).To get the cell-based jab in Australia, patients need to specifically request it from their GP, and as it's not funded under the NIP, it's likely to set someone back about $40.Vaccines using traditional egg-based technology have between 70 per cent and 90 per cent strain-specific effectiveness in healthy adults, and are free for those eligible under the NIP.Professor Booy said the US started using cell-based flu vaccines about 10 years ago, and it was "about time" Australia caught up."A hundred million people in the US have had the [cell-based] vaccine, so we know it works and we know it’s safe," he said.Dr Pearce said in the next five years, he would expect cell-based technology to be "standard" for the flu jab in Australia."We would expect that we will move away from making them in eggs to making them more cellular based," he said.ABC Health in your Instagram feedFollow @abchealth on Instagram, where we're busting myths and sharing practical, smart health advice.Jonathan Anderson, the medical director from Seqirus, the company behind the cell-based jab, said they had been upscaling the manufacturing process to meet the potential demand."It's taken a while for us to improve the manufacturing so that we could produce the quantities that might be required in a country like Australia," he said."Now we're able to have a consistent supply."But as this new technology is "slightly more expensive" than what's already on the market, Dr Pearce says he anticipates that authorities will watch how efficacious it is at preventing the flu in real-world populations before committing to a large purchase.COVID-19 vaccine timingThe Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) has advised people wait two weeks between getting the flu vaccine and the COVID-19 jab, although it doesn’t matter which one you get first.With the cell-based influenza vaccine, the advice is no different from the traditional flu jab.For planning purposes, ATAGI says people in earlier phases of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout should get that jab as soon they can, and then plan their influenza vaccination.Those in phases later phases are urged to get their influenza vaccine as soon as they can, and then have the COVID-19 vaccine.Influenza vaccines will be available in Australia from April 2021.Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicAsk us your coronavirus questionsPosted Fri 26 Mar 2021 at 7:00pmFriday 26 Mar 2021 at 7:00pmFri 26 Mar 2021 at 7:00pm, updated Sun 28 Mar 2021 at 11:43amSunday 28 Mar 2021 at 11:43amSun 28 Mar 2021 at 11:43amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesDonald Trump calls Vladimir Putin and urges him not to escalate Ukraine war, media reportsTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Close up of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in conversation Dutton is already testing Trump's campaign slogans.

We use a common measure ‘years of life lost’ to describe what each death meant. Download article as PDF Key points Myth 1: ‘Those who die from COVID-19 would have died soon anyway’ In the first year of COVID-19 (5 March 2020 to 5 March 2021), 1.5 million potential years of life were lost in the UK as a result of people dying with the virus. In England and Wales alone this figure is 1.4 million. On average, each of the 146,000 people who died with COVID-19 lost 10.2 years of life. Myth 2: ‘It’s just a bad flu season’ In a bad flu year on average around 30,000 people in the UK die from flu and pneumonia, with a loss of around 250,000 life years. This is a sixth of the life years lost to COVID-19. We have more detailed data for England and Wales. This shows us that, even looking only at those aged older than 75 (who account for most COVID-19 and flu deaths) – COVID-19 has been much more deadly. In 2018, a bad flu year, around 25,000 people older than 75 died from flu or pneumonia. These people lost a total of 140,000 years of life – 5.75 years each on average. This is about a quarter of the life years lost among those older than 75 from COVID-19. More years of men's lives have been lost in the pandemic than women’s. Again, looking at England and Wales, women older than 75 lost around four-times more years of life than for a bad flu season; for men it was five times higher. Myth 3: ‘COVID-19 is the great leveller – we are all equally at risk’ COVID-19 was not the great leveller. People in the 20% most deprived parts of England were twice as likely to die from COVID-19 as those in the least deprived areas. They also died at younger ages, so may have lost more years of life. While existing health inequalities mean these people may have had lower life expectancy, the analysis found that in total, 35% more lives were lost in the 20% most deprived areas than the least, with 45% more years of life lost in total. On average, each person who died in the most deprived quintile lost 11 years of their life, compared with 10 years in the least deprived. Introduction It's been a year since COVID-19 took hold in the UK, and we have produced three charts highlighting some of the myths that were prevalent at the very start of the pandemic – around who would die, how COVID-19 compared to flu, and that COVID-19 would kill ‘indiscriminately’, paying no attention to wealth or ethnicity. For each chart we use a common measure ‘years of life lost’, to describe what each death meant. What do we mean by 'years of life lost'? Years of life lost is a way of estimating how long someone would have lived, had they not died from COVID-19. To calculate it, we use life tables. These tables tell us the life expectancy of someone at each age – for example, they tell us that a man aged 80 in England or Wales could expect to live 8.2 more years, a woman 9.7. If a man aged 80 died from COVID-19 we therefore assume he has ‘lost’ 8.2 years of life. By summing all these lost years we come up with an overall estimate of the total years lost due to COVID-19. There are limitations to this method. Primarily, we have used average life expectancies at each age – when we know it is likely that those who died from COVID-19 were more likely to have co-morbidities than their peers, and therefore may have had lower life expectancies. We may therefore have overestimated the number of years of life lost. However, our estimates do not include the additional deaths that occurred during the pandemic but were not directly caused by COVID-19. Myth 1: ‘Those who died from COVID-19 would have died soon anyway’ In the year since the start of March 2020, around 1.5 million years of life have been lost from COVID-19 in the UK. On average, each person who died with COVID-19 lost 10.2 years of life. Looking at England and Wales alone the years of life lost was 1.4 million years, with a greater loss for men (around 750,000 years lost, 55% of the total), than for women (around 600,000 years lost, 45%). While women can expect to live longer than men (so would ‘lose’ more years of life if they died at the same age) men have been up to around twice as likely to die from COVID –19 as women of the same age. Even if we look only at deaths among people older than age 75, a total of 600,000 years of life have been lost – around 6.5 years for each death. Myth 2: ‘It’s just a bad flu season’ In a particularly bad flu year on average around 30,000 people in the UK die from flu and pneumonia, with a loss of around 250,000 life years. This is just a sixth of the life years lost to COVID-19. We have more detailed data for England and Wales. This shows us that, even looking only at those aged older than 75 (who account for most COVID and flu deaths), COVID-19 has been much more deadly. Take 2018, a ‘bad’ flu year, when around 25,000 of those older than 75 died. They lost a total of 140,000 years of life, an average of 5.75 years per person. This is less than a quarter of the life years lost among those older than 75 from COVID-19. And that is despite the huge mitigation measures – lockdowns etc – used to manage COVID-19. Had we treated COVID-19 like we treat flu, and not introduced those measures, the death toll would have been much higher. In terms of mortality, COVID-19 was particularly bad for men, compared with flu. The years of life lost for men older than 75 was around five times higher than in 2018’s bad flu year; for women it was four times higher. Myth 3: ‘COVID-19 is the great leveller – we are all equally at risk’ People living in the most deprived fifth of areas of England were two to three times more likely to die than people of the same age living in the least deprived areas. This inequality is also seen in numbers of deaths, which are 35% higher in the poorest areas than in the wealthiest. This is despite the fact that more deprived areas tend to have younger populations, so would be expected to have fewer deaths. Looking at the years of life lost, we see that, on average, those dying from COVID-19 in the poorest fifth of areas lost 11 years of life, compared with 10 years lost in the wealthiest areas. This difference is because those dying in the poorest areas were younger. Putting this together with the higher number of deaths in the poorest areas, we estimate that the poorest areas have lost 45% more life years than the wealthiest.

Here, we show that endogenous lipids released from virus-infected host cells activate lung γδ T cells to produce interleukin 17 A (IL-17A) for early protection against H1N1 influenza infection. During infection, the lung γδ T cell pool is constantly supplemented by thymic output, with recent emigrants infiltrating into the lung parenchyma and airway to acquire tissue-resident feature. Single-cell studies identify IL-17A-producing γδ T (Tγδ17) cells with a phenotype of TCRγδhiCD3hiAQP3hiCXCR6hi in both infected mice and patients with pneumonia. Mechanistically, host cell-released lipids during viral infection are presented by lung infiltrating CD1d+ B-1a cells to activate IL-17A production in γδ T cells via γδTCR-mediated IRF4-dependent transcription. Reduced IL-17A production in γδ T cells is detected in mice either lacking B-1a cells or with ablated CD1d in B cells. Our findings identify a local host-immune crosstalk and define important cellular and molecular mediators for early innate defense against lung viral infection.

An appropriate induction of immune responses in the lung is necessary for virus elimination and host recovery. The pulmonary immune system harbors a unique environment gathering a group of special cell subsets and molecular components, which are necessary for the maintenance of immunological homeostasis and pathogen clearance in the lung1. Recent studies with systems-level analysis indicate that a series of host components such as lipids and metabolites can modulate the proinflammatory response of lung epithelial cells against either 1918 or 2009 human pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1) influenza viruses2. In addition, the ratio of specific species of lipids was found to be markers of influenza virus pathogenicity in mice3. However, it is unclear how lipids regulate early immune protection against influenza infection.Various innate and adaptive immune components are activated to mediate the clearance of respiratory viral infections, especially those with rapid kinetics of antiviral responses during primary infection. In both humans and mice, γδ T cells represent a major T cell population in the barrier sites, suggesting their crucial involvement in barrier surveillance and first-line defense4. This preferential distribution of γδ T cells favors their “kick-starting” activities5 in driving immunity against invasive pathogens in situ by secreting proinflammatory cytokines including IL-17A5,6, IFN-γ7, M-CSF8, IL-99, or Amphiregulin10 upon activation. Mounting evidence indicates that both human and mouse γδ T cells exert protective function in control infections by different strains of the influenza virus, such as seasonal H1N1, H5N1, and H9N2 viruses7,11,12,13,14. Moreover, drug-induced expansion of human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells is critically involved in elimination of influenza virus in humanized mice15. We have also found that γδ T cells rapidly infiltrate into lung tissue and produce IL-17A in response to H1N1 (A/PR/8/34) infection6,16. However, it is largely unclear how γδ T cells are rapidly activated in the lung during influenza infection as well as the underlying mechanisms. Moreover, the cellular heterogenicity and effector function of lung γδ T cells against influenza viruses remain poorly characterized.Available evidence on the multifaceted contributions of γδ T cells indicates that γδ T cells comprise subpopulations and readily differentiate under pathological settings4,17. Although hemagglutinin (HA) from H5N1, but not H1N1, influenza is found to directly trigger γδ T cells to produce IFN-γ by binding to sialic acid receptors on the cells7, many γδ T cells utilize a relatively limited repertoire to recognize nonpeptide antigens and stress-induced ligands presented upon the major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC)-class-I-like molecule CD1d18,19. Moreover, productive T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-ligand interactions are prone to trigger microbiota associated-IL-17A production in γδ T cells20,21. Up to date, it remains obscure how influenza viruses activate CD1d-dependent T cells despite an apparent lack of virus-derived CD1d ligands22.Increasing evidence indicates a critical role of innate B-1 cells in antiviral immune responses. We have shown that CD1d-expressing B-1a cells, a subset of innate B-1 cells, rapidly infiltrate into the lung tissue and secrete natural antibodies, paralleling to early IL-17A production during influenza infection6. We and others have also found that autoreactive B cells can present endogenous lipid antigens23 or glycolipid antigens on the surface of Sphingomonas species, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Streptococcus pneumoniae24,25, to activate NKT cells in a CD1d-dependent manner22,24. Thus, it remains to be established how these infiltrated B-1 cells interact with other immune cells during early innate response. Therefore, further identification of early activated immune cells in the lung parenchyma and underlying molecular mechanisms in host defense is vital to developing effective treatment strategies.In this study, we provide in vivo evidence of an early pulmonary immune response against pdmH1N1 influenza virus dominated by Tγδ17 cells starting from day 1 of respiratory exposure in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of lung-infiltrating γδ T cells revealed that respiratory influenza virus infection-induced activation of TCRγδhiCD3hiAQP3hiCXCR6hi cells with a dominant IL-17A signature, a population maintained by thymic output and acquires tissue-resident feature after pulmonary imprinting. Moreover, lung-infiltrating B-1a cells present lung tissue-derived lipid antigens to γδ T cells and elicit IL-17A production by γδ T cells via IRF4. Importantly, complementary analysis on pneumonia patients identified positive associations between Vγ9Vδ2 cells, accumulation of cardiolipin (CL) lipids in respiratory tract and disease severity. Together, our results reveal both cellular and molecular mechanisms of local host-immune crosstalk occurring immediately after infection that orchestrates innate B–T interaction for early defense against influenza virus.ResultsPdmH1N1 infection induces γδ T cell infiltration into lung tissueTo investigate γδ T cell response to lung viral infection, we infected C57BL/6 mice with pdmH1N1 influenza virus. As early as 1 day post-infection (dpi), we observed a significant increase in both frequency and number of γδ T cells (Fig. 1a), whereas the accumulation of other innate responding immune cells such as NK and NKT cells were only increased from 3 dpi onwards (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Intravenously (i.v.) transferred γδ T cells significantly increased the survival rate and markedly reduced lung pathology of lethally infected mice (Fig. 1b, c). On the contrary, targeting γδ T cells in vivo using an anti-TCRγδ monoclonal antibody (mAb, clone GL3)8,26 before onset of the infection resulted in significantly reduced survival of mice compared with isotype control antibody-treated mice (Fig. 1d). These data indicated that γδ T cells play a protective role against pdmH1N1 infection in mice.Fig. 1: PdmH1N1 infection induces infiltration of thymus-derived γδ T cells into lung.a Representative plots (left) and frequency and number (right) of γδ T cells in lungs of pdmH1N1-infected mice (n = 9). b, c Mice at 1 dpi were i.v. transferred with or without 2 × 106 γδ T cells purified from mice at 4 dpi. b Kaplan–Meier survival rate (n = 9, 10). c Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histology (left) and scoring (right) of lungs from mice at 5 dpi (n = 3).

Mice were perfused with PBS and tissues were harvested and analysed. Since MedLN is only detectable from 2 dpi onwards, and γδ T cells are only detectable in BLF of infected mice, analysis of γδ T cells in MedLN and BLF was conducted only with infected mice. Representative plots (h) and frequency pie charts (i) showing circulating γδ T (CD45+) or parenchyma-associated γδ T cells (CD45−) in gated CD3+TCRγδ+ cells (n = 5). Data are combined from two or three independent experiments and presented as mean ± SEM. P values were determined using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test (c, g, h), Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon Test (b, d) or one-way ANOVA (a, f). Source data are included in Source Data file.Full size imageγδ T cells constitute the major subset of resident T cells that is closely aligned with innate immunity in mucosa barriers like skin4. However, their exchange between tissues and lung-specific adaptation remains poorly understood. To examine whether tissue recruitment contributes to lung γδ T cell pool after infection, we treated mice with FTY720, a sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist that blocks egress of lymphocytes from lymphoid organs and stops cell trafficking from circulation into lung tissues (Fig. 1e, f). After FTY720 treatment, the frequency and number of lung γδ T cells in virus-infected mice were considerably reduced while those of thymic counterparts were dramatically increased. In contrast, the frequencies and numbers of γδ T cells in mediastinal lymph node (MedLN), pleural cavity, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) remained unchanged (Fig. 1f). Importantly, thymectomy in mice 24 h before viral infection substantially reduced the frequencies and total numbers of γδ T cells at 4 dpi (Fig. 1e, g), providing strong evidence that the maintenance of lung γδ T cell population during influenza infection is highly dependent on new migrants from the thymus.The lungs are highly vascularized, and a large proportion of immune cells are actually circulating cells trapped in the capillary beds that surround the air sacs27. To examine the localization of lung γδ T cells within distinct anatomical niches, namely the vasculature, airway and interstitial spaces, we i.v. injected fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled mAb against CD45 into mock- or influenza-infected mice and assessed its binding to γδ T cells as a criterion to discriminate circulating cells from parenchyma-bound cells. Single-cell suspensions from various organs of PBS-perfused mice were stained for TCRγδ and analysed by flow cytometry. γδ T cells were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BLF) of infected but not naïve mice, suggesting entry of γδ T cells into the bronchoalveolar space upon infection (Fig. 1h). We assessed CD45+ cells proceeding from the vasculature and CD45− cells residing in the parenchyma of various organs. Following infection, the proportion of CD45− γδ T cells in the parenchyma among total γδ T cells in the lung markedly increased. In contrast, the proportions of CD45+ and CD45− γδ T cells remained largely unchanged in the spleen and pleural cavity, and only very small proportions of γδ T cells in MedLN and BLF stained positive for anti-CD45 mAb (Fig. 1h, i). These data suggest that the majority of γδ T cells in lungs originally circulate in the blood during steady state and rapidly migrate into the lung parenchyma and then into respiratory tract upon viral infection.Lung γδ T cells protect against pdmH1N1 infection by producing IL-17AWhen we analysed the cytokine profile and other effector molecules expressed by lung-infiltrating γδ T cells by flow cytometry, we found the cells predominantly expressed IL-17A and barely other cytokines such as IL-10, IL-4, IL-6, IL21, and IFN-γ, indicating that IL-17A is a signature cytokine of lung γδ T cells upon influenza infection (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Since our previous studies showed that IL-17A protects against influenza infection6,16, we next asked if γδ T cells mediate such protection by producing IL-17A. We found that the frequency of lung Tγδ17 cells among total IL-17A-producing cells was significantly higher than those of counterparts in MedLN, thymus and spleen (Fig. 2a). The frequency of IL-17A-producing cells within the γδ T cell population was also significantly higher in the lung than those of counterparts in other organs examined (Fig. 2b), suggesting γδ T cells are the major source of IL-17A in the lung at early stage of infection. Moreover, pdmH1N1 infection induced a significant increase of IL-17A production in lung-infiltrating γδ T cells (Fig. 2c). Lung γδ T cells also exhibited a Vγ chain usage pattern, which was distinct from those utilized by γδ T cells present in other organs (Fig. 2d). Consistent with an important role for IL-17A in protection against influenza infection, pdmH1N1-infected IL-17A-deficient (Il17a−/−) mice showed significantly reduced survival rate, increased weight loss and lung injury when compared with infected wild-type mice. Furthermore, transfer of wild-type but not Il17a−/− γδ T cells markedly rescued ll17a−/− mice from death (Fig. 2e–g). Together, these data suggest that IL-17A produced by γδ T cells is required to protect against pdmH1N1 infection in mice.Fig. 2: Lung γδ T cells protect against pdmH1N1 by producing IL-17A.a Representative plots showing IL-17A+ cells (left) and cumulative data (right) showing frequencies of IL-17A+ γδ T cells in IL-17A+ population (n = 10) and cell numbers of γδ T cells (n = 10, 6, 6, 10) at 5 dpi. b Plots (left) and cumulative data (right) showing IL-17A+ γδ T cells at 5 dpi (n = 10, 6, 6, 10). c Plots (left) and cumulative data (right) showing IL-17A+ γδ T cells at 5 dpi (n = 10). d Flow cytometry analysis of Vγ chain usage and IL-17A expression by γδ T cell subtypes (n = 6). e–g PdmH1N1-infected Il17a−/− mice at 1 dpi were i.v. transferred with 2 × 106 γδ T cells purified from infected wild-type (WT) or Il17a−/− mice at 4 dpi.

Data are combined from two or three independent experiments and presented as mean ± SEM. P values were determined using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test (c, h–l), Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon Test (e), one-way ANOVA (a, b, g), or two-way ANOVA (f). Source data are included in Source Data file.Full size imageWe next investigated the phenotypic feature and differentiation state of lung Tγδ17 cells. Compared to their IL-17A− counterparts, lung Tγδ17 cells expressed high levels of CD25, CD69, NKG2D, CD44, CD24, PD-1, IL-7R, and CD62L, and a low level of NKG2A, indicating a more active state of lung Tγδ17 cells. In addition, Tγδ17 cells also expressed low levels of NK1.1, CD40, and CD27, which are known as fate determinants of functional diversities responsible for cytotoxicity, antigen presentation and IFN-γ expression, respectively28 (Supplementary Fig. 1c). To further investigate whether the unique microenvironments influence Tγδ17 cell biology, we compared the expression of canonical markers CD11a, CD69, and CD103 associated with tissue retention of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells on Tγδ17 cells in different compartments of the lung29,30,31. By i.v. injecting FITC-labeled mAb against CD45, flow cytometric analysis detected markedly increased frequencies of Tγδ17 cells with respect to total γδ T cells in the parenchyma of infected lungs (Fig. 2h). CD11a was found highly expressed but comparable in Tγδ17 cells in blood and lung tissues (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Intermediate levels of CD69 and CD103 expression were detected on Tγδ17 cells from the MedLN, spleen and pleural cavity but much higher levels of CD69 and CD103 expression were found on their counterparts in the lung and BLF (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Upon infection, frequencies of CD69+CD103+ Tγδ17 cells with respect to total Tγδ17 cells significantly increased in the parenchyma of lung and BLF with the highest frequencies in the latter. The frequency of these cells in the vasculature was, however, unaffected (Fig. 2i). Additionally, we found that a short pretreatment of pertussis toxin (PTX), an inhibitor of chemokine receptor signaling32, prevented the migration of γδ T cells into the lung parenchyma (Fig. 2j). Consistent with a reduction of lung γδ T cells in mice removed thymus, thymectomy surgery substantially reduced the frequency and number of lung Tγδ17 at 4 dpi (Fig. 2k). Using a parabiosis approach with CD45.1 and CD45.2 congenic mice, the conjoined mice developed expected high levels of chimerism in circulating and lung Tγδ17 cells before viral infection. However, there was minimal chimerism in lung Tγδ17 cells in the respective parabionts following infection (Fig. 2l). Collectively, these results suggest that at the early stage of influenza infection, thymic output via circulation continually sustains the γδ T cell pool in the lung parenchyma and airway. Following trafficking, these cells progressively adapt to the microenvironment and acquire tissue-resident features.Lung Tγδ17 cells exhibit distinct transcriptome of functional maturityTo characterize the molecular features of lung γδ T population during influenza infection, we purified CD19−CD3+TCRγδ+ cells from lung tissues at 4 dpi for scRNA-seq analysis. After initial quality control procedures, 7863 single cells expressing a median of 1043 genes passed the threshold and were used for clustering analysis via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Four primary clusters of distinct cell types were recovered from this analysis and were assigned identifiers based on their expression of known marker genes, including activated, Tγδ17, cytotoxic, and naïve clusters (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2b). While some differences in the expression of classical cell cycle (Pcna, Hmgb2) or apoptosis (Bax, Casp3)-related genes were observed among the clusters, these were not key drivers of cluster formation (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Instead, direct comparison of the clusters showed that Tγδ17 cells were highly enriched for 22 genes in terms of both expression and detection rate, and a significant proportion of the cells positive for each marker were also Il17ahi (Supplementary Fig. 2d). While known transcription factors (Rorc, Sox13) and surface markers (Ccr6, Il23r) associated with the known phenotype of Tγδ17 cells, other less well-characterized markers such as Aqp3, and Tmem176a were actually more prominently identified (Fig. 3b). Since droplet-based scRNA-seq data are highly prone to technical dropout, we then utilized a graph-based imputation method to clarify the potential relations between them. Consistent with our expectations, the imputed data revealed strong correlations in the expression profiles of the markers we identified with both Il17a and Rorc, while showing no relationship with the unrelated cluster marker Gzmb (Fig. 3c). In order to validate that these markers are indeed robust, we then used flow cytometry to clarify the correlations on a protein level, wherein we observed a clear relationship between AQP3 expression and IL-17A+ status (Fig. 3d), establishing it as a useful phenotype marker.Fig. 3: Lung Tγδ17 cells have a distinct transcriptome indicative of functional maturity.a Sorting-purified single γδ T cells from lungs at 4 dpi were subjected to scRNA-seq. UMAP clustering following dimension reduction based on highly variable genes across the 7863 single cells recovered revealed the formation of 4 primary clusters of distinct cell types that were then assigned identifiers based on their expression profiles. b, c Visualization of the expression profiles for key genes previously reported to be associated with Tγδ17 in a. d Representative flow cytometric plots showing expression of AQP3 and IL-17A in gated CD3+TCRγδ+ cells from pdmH1N1-infected lungs at 4 dpi. e Heatmap visualization of the expression patterns of the most varied genes in each cluster across each cell in the cluster. These highly varied genes were used to help annotate the clusters. f Representative GSEA results generated using distinct gene list databases (KEGG, Hallmark, Reactome) as visualized through UMAP confirmed that the substantial heterogeneity observed between the γδ T clusters was driven by significant differences in gene expression along unique biological pathways/processes. Eight significantly variant pathways between the activated and Tγδ17 clusters are shown here as these 2 clusters are highly separated within the UMAP space and in GSEA analysis. g, h UMAP plots show the expression profiles of genes associated with Tγδ17 in a. i Correlation analysis of scRNA-seq data with previously published sequencing of Tγδ17 cells (GSE123400) as shown visually through UMAP following canonical correlation analysis. j UMAP visualization of the expression levels of prominent genes associated with Tγδ17 cells. k, l Violin plots of the expression profiles of markers associated with Tγδ17 in i.Full size imageBeyond this preliminary marker analysis, we also explored possible functional differences between the clusters. Heatmap visualization of the differentially expressed genes between the clusters demonstrated that the Tγδ17 cluster had much less prominent expression of several chemokines, interferon, and cytotoxic factors (Fig. 3e). However, representative geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA) results derived from averaged bulk expression profiles of each cluster demonstrated Tγδ17 cells had enhanced expression of a number of cytokine and chemokine receptors and also displayed enrichment for mitochondrial respiratory capacity (Fig. 3f, and Supplementary Fig. 2e, f). Indeed, the elevated expression of these cytokine receptors and decreased ribosomal RNA levels relative to the other clusters (Fig. 3g) is consistent with a recognized role of ribosomal capacity during T cell functional maturation33, a trend also observable via independent assessment of each cell for markers of T cell naivety or activation (Fig. 3h).In order to explore the generality of the cell phenotype observed, we also further performed paired analysis of our data with existing scRNA-seq results on γδ T cells (GSE123400)34. Canonical correlational analysis between the sets demonstrated that the two datasets could fit reasonably well together, with a region of the combined data including Tγδ17 cells (Fig. 3i, j). Violin plots confirmed that lung Tγδ17 cell cluster was closely aligned to their counterparts in thymus and lymph nodes (Fig. 3k). Notably, this subset included Tγδ17 cells from all three origins, and these latter cells featured high expression of Aqp3, suggesting that it was not a lung-specific marker, but more broadly associated with the Tγδ17 phenotype (Fig. 3l). As MedLN is only clearly visible after 2 dpi, these findings suggest γδ T cells may undergo differentiation after emigrating from thymus. Overall, lung Tγδ17 cells represent a distinct γδ T cell subtype with a unique transcriptome reflective of functional maturity.The γδTCR-IRF4 axis regulates IL-17A production in lung γδ T cellsTo understand the development path followed by lung γδ T cells during infection, we next performed trajectory analysis of the Tγδ17 cells identified in our scRNA-seq data. Trajectory and pseudotime mapping of the subset showed that two distinct progenitor states and two end states were followed by the cells, with progression through a joint intermediate state (Fig. 4a, b). Differential gene expression analysis revealed that expression of the inhibitory transcription factor Tcf7 and STAT-signaling inhibitor Socs3 both decreased as a function of the pseudotime, confirming correctness of the time direction since downregulation of above genes with functional maturity of T cells and hence pseudotime is expected (Supplementary Fig. 3a). While Il17a expression monotonically increased over pseudotime, Aqp3 displayed an almost linear correlation with pseudotime progression, suggesting that it may be able to predict the developmental maturation of IL-17A-secreting cells (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 3b). On a regulatory level, Irf4 was more highly expressed in both of the end states in a similar fashion as Il17a, and exhibited a transient induction among many of the common transcription factors reported to be involved in IL-17A production35. Furthermore, the total expression levels of its known target genes also exhibited a trend towards being increased in Il17ahi cells, with this trend being observable following independent pseudotime algorithms (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 3c–e). Interestingly, these Il17ahi cells exhibit elevated expression of Cd3g (Fig. 4e).Fig. 4: The γδTCR-IRF4 axis regulates IL-17A production in lung γδ T cells.a, b Trajectory map generated using DDTree reduction as implemented through Monocle on a list of 1224 genes with detectable expression and significant dispersion within the Tγδ17 subset. c Pseudotime mapping of gene expression levels within the Tγδ17 subset. d UMAP visualization of IRF4 targeted genes that enrich in the Tγδ17 subset. e Violin plots of the gene expression of Il17a and Cd3g separated by the projected cell state demonstrates that state 4, which has progressed the furthest along pseudotime, is composed of cells that highly express those 2 genes. f IRF4 expression in γδ T cells in mouse lungs at 5 dpi.

ChIP quantification of IRF4 binding to the Il17a promoter was performed using quantitative PCR (n = 3). n IL-17A production in WT and Irf4−/− bone marrow chimera were analysed at 5 dpi (n = 6). Data are combined from two or three independent experiments and represented as mean ± SEM. P-values were determined using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test (j, l, m, n) or one-way ANOVA (k). Source data are included in Source Data file.Full size imageConsistent with preceding correction data, flow cytometric analysis confirmed that lung Tγδ17 cells expressed higher protein levels of IRF4 (Fig. 4f). These cells also displayed elevated levels of TCRγδ and CD3 than their IL-17A− counterparts (Fig. 4g). Intracellular calcium flux in γδ T cells after stimulation with anti-CD3ε and anti-CD28 mAbs also showed a close correlation between the signaling intensity and the levels of TCRγδ expression, suggesting an association between the expression level and signal strength of TCRγδ (Fig. 4h). Remarkably, Tγδ17 cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exhibited similar TCRγδhiCD3hi phenotype and were enriched in the Vγ9+ population (Fig. 4i). Notably, IL-17A expression was also correlated with higher IRF4 expression in human γδ T cells, displaying similar molecular features of human Tγδ17 cells to murine counterparts (Fig. 4j). Both antigen dose and TCR signal strength were previously shown to influence the thymocyte fate and the effector differentiation of T cells36,37, possibly by regulating the expression intensity of key transcription factors38. Previous findings that IRF4 is a crucial transcription factor for sensing the intensity of TCR receptor signaling to scale the expression amount of itself and coordinate CD4+ T cell polarization38,39 prompted us to investigate whether IRF4 mediated effector differentiation of γδ T cells. Indeed, IRF4 was induced by anti-CD3ε mAb in a concentration-dependent manner stimulating increasing TCR signal strength (Fig. 4k, Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). IL-17A expression also increased upon TCR signaling intensity in a similar dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4l). Notably, IRF4 deficiency in γδ T cells completely abrogated IL-17A induction by anti-CD3ε, suggesting that IRF4 is required for γδTCR ligation-induced IL-17A production in γδ T cells (Fig. 4l). Interestingly, IRF4 was induced upon weak TCR stimulation (0.5 μg/mL of anti-CD3ε) whereas IL-17A was induced upon stronger TCR stimulation (1 μg/mL of anti-CD3ε) (Fig. 4k, l), suggesting the magnitude of IRF4 expression is highly sensitive to TCR signal strength while a certain TCR signal threshold is required to initiate IL-17A production. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) analysis demonstrated that IRF4 bound directly to the promoter of Il17a gene in a manner dependent on TCR signal strength. Binding of IRF4 to the −1175 to −1352 locus of the Il17a gene promoter was only observed at high TCR signal strength (5 μg/mL of anti-CD3ε). However, the binding of IRF4 at the −1408 to −1602 locus was achieved at lower TCR signal strength (1.5 μg/mL of anti-CD3ε) (Fig. 4m), suggesting that this locus contains high-affinity IRF4-binding sites. Thus, abundance of IRF4 expression determined by strength of TCR signaling is key to regulating Il17a transcription in γδ T cells. In addition, because IRF4-binding sites on the Il17a promoter varied in affinity for the transcription factor, the site binding of IRF4 with low affinity requires stronger TCR ligation. Taken together, these data reveal a crucial requirement of TCR-mediated signaling for IL-17A induction in γδ T cells.To determine whether IRF4 affects IL-17A expression and hence survival from influenza infection in vivo, IRF4-heterozygous (Irf4+/−) and deficient (Irf4−/−) mice were infected with pdmH1N1 virus. Irf4−/− mice exhibited significantly reduced survival and increased body weight loss and developed more severe lung pathology compared with Irf4+/− controls (Supplementary Fig. 4c–e), suggesting an important role for IRF4 in protective immunity against pdmH1N1 infection. Further characterization of pdmH1N1-infected Irf4−/− mice revealed significantly reduced IL-17A production by γδ T cells in the lung, MedLN, thymus, spleen and blood compared with Irf4+/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 4f). Next, we generated chimeras by reconstituting lethally irradiated wild-type (CD45.1+) recipient mice with congenitally marked bone marrow cells from Irf4−/− (CD45.2+) donor mice and wild-type (CD45.1+) donor mice at a 1:1 ratio. At 5 dpi, γδ T cells of Irf4−/− origin exhibited a significantly lower frequency of IL-17A+ population than those of wild-type origin (Fig. 4n), indicating a T cell-intrinsic function for IRF4 in promoting Tγδ17 cell differentiation.To rule out the possibility that the impaired Tγδ17 differentiation of Irf4−/− γδ T cells was due to aberrant development of γδ T cells, we characterized Tγδ17 subsets in the chimeras. Although the frequency of γδ T subsets of Irf4−/− origin was consistently lower than that of wild-type origin, we did not observe an appreciable difference between their composition of Vγ chain usage (Supplementary Fig. 4g). Moreover, the frequency of IL-17A+ γδ T cells of Irf4−/− origin was significantly lower than that of wild-type origin (Supplementary Fig. 4h). Overall, these data demonstrate that γδTCR-IRF4 pathway is indispensable for early IL-17A production in lung γδ T cells during influenza virus infection.Infection-induced endogenous lipids promote γδ T cell IL-17A productionHost-derived molecules released by cells under stress from virus-induced lung tissue damage may contribute to γδ T cell activation. Since CLs were previously identified as CD1d-presenting lipid antigen19, we next profiled and structurally characterized CLs fractions extracted from BLF of mock- and pdmH1N1-infected mice at 5 dpi by reverse phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was applied for quantitation of CL molecules due to the presence of isomeric molecules. Eight different CL lipid molecules were detected with CL(36:4/36:4) being dominantly represented (Fig. 5a–c and Supplementary Fig. 5). CLs are a class of dimeric phospholipids that support mitochondrial cristae formation and ATP synthase function, and can be released by stressed cells acting as a “danger signal” during autoimmunity or infections40,41. The influenza-infected BLF profile resembled that typically found in murine mitochondria42, suggesting the release of CLs possibly from mitochondria of infected lung cells. Moreover, the double-bond distribution in CLs of BLFs from influenza-infected mice showed a certain degree of mild shifting towards less unsaturated molecules compared with those from mock-infected controls (Fig. 5d). CL species such as CL(36:4/36:4) are significantly increased in BLF of infected mice when compared to mock controls (Fig. 5e). We also assessed total CL levels in the BLFs of mice infected intranasally (i.n.) with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and found that, compared with those of mock-infected controls, BLFs of LCMV-infected mice had profoundly increased CL (Fig. 5f), suggesting that increased CLs could be a common characteristic of lung viral infections.Fig. 5: Infection-induced endogenous lipids promote γδ T IL-17A production.a–e LC-MS/MS assessment of CL species in BLF from infected mice at 5 dpi (n = 5). a CL elution profile. b Abundance of identified CLs with various carbon chain length and double-bond components.

Subjecting cells to hypoxic conditions (1% O2) also induced release of CL to the culture medium (Fig. 5g). In accordance with CL being derived from damaged mitochondria, ultrastructural alterations of mitochondria were observed in influenza-infected cells as shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (Fig. 5h). In assessing alterations of core mitochondrial metabolic functions, we found that influenza infection of MDCK cells culminated in a 40% decrease in extracellular ATP levels (Fig. 5i), consistent with increased mitochondrial superoxide and membrane potential loss as reflected by signals from MitoSOX Red and JC-1 (Fig. 5j, k). These results indicate that influenza infection induces metabolic stress and hypoxia, resulting in release of endogenous lipids from host cells in the lung.Since mouse γδ T cells were previously shown to respond to CLs presented by CD1d expressed on antigen-presenting cell (APCs)19,21, we next determined whether CD1d-associated lipid antigens such as CLs can induce γδ T cells to produce IL-17A in vivo by injecting mixed forms of CL species intraperitoneally (i.p.) into pdmH1N1-infected mice. Administration of CLs significantly increased IL-17A production by lung γδ T cells when compared with injection of vehicle control (Fig. 5l). Moreover, treatment of anti-CD1d blocking mAb markedly inhibited IL-17A production by γδ T cells in infected mice (Fig. 5m). As both influenza virus and LCMV do not carry lipids, we next examine if microbiota-derived lipids play a role in activating γδ T cells for IL-17A production. Mice were treated by antibiotics via both intranasal and oral routes (Fig. 5n). However, although antibiotics remarkably reduced bacterial load in stool and airways (Fig. 5o), IL-17A production and number of γδ T cells were not affected (Fig. 5p). Taken together, our results indicate the involvement of endogenous lipids in mediating γδ T cell activation and IL-17A production via CD1d-dependent presentation.γδ T cell IL-17A production requires CD1d-dependent antigen presentationTo identify the key cellular components acting as lipid antigen-presenting cells for γδ T cell activation, we examined CD1d expression on different immune cell types in the lung tissue of pdmH1N1-infected mice and found most highly expressed CD1d on B-1a cells among conventional B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, and macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 6a–c). Among B cell subsets, lung B-1a cells and splenic marginal zone (MZ) B cells were found to express the highest levels of CD1d (Supplementary Fig. 6d, e). However, MZ B cells were present only in the spleens but not lungs, MedLNs or peritoneal cavities of infected mice (Supplementary Fig. 6f). When CFSE-labelled cavity B-1a cells were i.v. transferred into infected mice at 1 dpi, we detected upregulated CD1d expression on CFSE+ B-1a cells following their migration into lung tissues (Supplementary Fig. 6g, h).Since B-1a cells were proximally close to γδ T cells in lung tissue of influenza-infected mice as evidenced by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 6a), we investigated a possible role for B-1a cells in activating Tγδ17 cells in vivo. B-1a cells were preloaded with CL and i.v. transferred into infected C57BL/6 mice at 1 dpi. Four days post-transfer, lung γδ T cells in mice receiving CL-loaded B-1a cells produced significantly more IL-17A than those in control mice receiving no B-1a cells (Fig. 6b). To further verify the critical involvement of B-1a cells in γδ T cell activation, we depleted B-1a cells via i.p. injection of monoclonal anti-IgM antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 6i). Consistently, B-1a depletion resulted in significantly reduced IL-17A production in γδ T cells when compared with control mice upon viral infection (Fig. 6c). Furthermore, we analysed CD19-deficient (Cd19−/−) mice that lack B-1a cells43,44. Following influenza infection, significantly reduced IL-17A production was detected in lung γδ T cells from Cd19−/− mice when compared to wild-type controls (Fig. 6d). The IL-17A production in γδ T cells was also significantly reduced in Cd1d1f/fCd19Cre/+ mice compared with control animals, indicating that other immune cells cannot compensate for the absence of CD1d expression on B cells (Fig. 6e). In vitro, B-1a cells preloaded with CL promoted substantially more IL-17A production by co-cultured γδ T cells than CL or B-1a cells alone, and this was abrogated by the addition of anti-CD1d blocking mAb (Fig. 6f). Together, these results strongly suggest that B-1a cells can directly activate γδ T cells to produce IL-17A via CD1d-mediated self-lipid antigen presentation in vivo.Fig. 6: γδ T IL-17A production requires CD1d-dependent antigen presentation.a Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of lungs from pdmH1N1-infected mice at 3 dpi, stained for B220 (green), CD43 (red), TCRγδ (purple), and DAPI (blue).

Source data are included in Source Data file.Full size imageAmong B cell subsets involved in early antibody production in the lungs of infected mice, we identified CD19+CD43+CD5+ B-1a cells as the predominant B cell subset present in lung infiltrates and producing IgM specific for influenza surface protein HA at 4 dpi when IgM was the major isotype, in contrast to HA+IgG1+ B-1a cells that were barely detected. Moreover, lung HA+IgM+ B-1a cells displayed a CD38+CD138+/−GL-7− plasmablast phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 7a). When γδ T cells were silenced via injection of anti-γδTCR mAb 3 days (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c) or thymectomy was performed 24 h, before viral infection, differentiation of B-1a cells was severely impaired in mice as revealed by marked decline in frequencies of CD19+CD43+CD5+IgM+HA+ (Supplementary Fig. 7d) and CD38+CD138+HA+ (Supplementary Fig. 7e) B-1a cell populations in the infected lungs. Consistently, we found that infection-induced total IgM, flu-specific, and phosphorylcholine (PC)-specific IgM titers were substantially reduced in the airways of anti-γδTCR-treated or thymectomized mice (Supplementary Fig. 7f), suggesting an overall impairment of natural antibody response in these mice. In addition, we asked if γδ T-cell-derived IL-17A is important for the observed plasmacytic differentiation of B-1a cells. We found that following infection, Il17a−/− mice, compared with wild-type mice, had significantly decreased frequencies of lung HA+ B-1a cells (Supplementary Fig. 7g) and HA+CD138+ B-1a (Supplementary Fig. 7h). Transfer of wild-type but not Il17a−/− γδ T cells into infected Il17a−/− mice restored the number of lung HA+ B-1a cells (Supplementary Fig. 7g) and their CD138 expression (Supplementary Fig. 7h). Analysis of single-cell suspensions from infected lung tissue by ELISPOT assay confirmed significantly increased influenza virus-specific and total IgM-secreting cells in mice that received wild-type but not Il17a−/− γδ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 7i). Serum titers of virus-specific and total IgM were also greater in Il17a−/− mice that received wild-type but not Il17a−/− γδ T cells or mice that received no cell transfer (Supplementary Fig. 7j). Together, these data identify an important role of Tγδ17 cells in promoting plasmacytic differentiation of B-1a cells and their natural antibody production in response to lung viral infection.Human lung γδ T cells correlate with pneumonia severityTo determine whether the protective role for γδ Τ cells during infection in mice might extend to humans, we analysed γδ T cells from PBMCs and BLF of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and examined their frequency and relationship with CAP severity. Vγ9Vδ2 cells, a major IL-17A-producing γδ T cell population in human (Fig. 4i), significantly increased in BLF, associated negatively with pneumonia severity (Fig. 7a,b). We compared the phenotype of blood and BLF B-1 cells from pneumonia patients and detected B-1 cells from both sites exhibiting a phenotype of CD19+CD20+CD27+CD43+CD70− (Fig. 7c, d)45. Compared to PBMCs, the frequency of B-1 cells in BLF also significantly increased (Fig. 7e). In BLF, B-1 cells expressed increased levels of CD1d compared with B-2 cells (Fig. 7f). Moreover, we observed ultrastructural alterations of mitochondria in influenza-infected lungs from patients as shown by TEM analysis (Fig. 7g, h). Consistently, CL content detected in the BLF from severe CAP was significantly higher than that from moderate CAP (Fig. 7i), suggesting a correlation between tissue damage and CL release. We further performed scRNA-seq with pooled T cells from 5 CAP patients. UMAP clustering (Fig. 7j) and heatmap of the highly variable genes (Fig. 7k) of human γδ T cells present in the BLF of pneumonia patients revealed the presence of three main populations, including naïveot yet activated cells, activated cells with cytotoxic potential, and Tγδ17 cells that were highly enriched for usage of Vγ9 and Vδ2. UMAP clustering using the genes found to be variably expressed in mouse γδ T cells illustrated that key drivers behind the 3 observed clusters included a significant degree of conservation between mouse and human (Fig. 7l). A small portion of these cells in population two are AQP3+IL23R+ and RORC+, suggestive of Tγδ17 identity (Fig. 7m). Pseudotime trajectory analysis of cluster Tγδ17 further showed that IRF4 and IL23R expression were tightly correlated, while RORC and BATF were not appreciably linked (Fig. 7n and Supplementary Fig. 8). Therefore, these correlations may possibly indicate a similar mechanism for Tγδ17 cell activation mediated by B-1 cells in lungs of pneumonia patients.Fig. 7: Correlations between human lung γδ T cells and pneumonia severity.a Representative plots (left) and cumulative data (right) showing prevalence of Vγ9Vδ2 cells in Blood (n = 18) and BLF (n = 57, paired samples n = 10) of pneumonia patients.

Here we reveal that thymus-derived γδ T cells arise in the lung from day 1 following pdmH1N1 influenza infection and act as the predominant producers of local IL-17A. IL-17A production by lung γδ T cells is induced by endogenous lipids presented by B-1a cells and regulated by a T cell-intrinsic TCR-IRF4 axis. Reciprocally, lung Tγδ17 cells promote plasmacytic differentiation of B-1a cells and enhance their natural antibody production. Together, these findings define a role of host-derived lipids that function as danger signals in the setting of influenza virus infection and orchestrate the functional interaction between lung γδ T cells and B-1a cells in a feed forward loop to provide an early innate protection.Studies have shown that levels of lipid constituents are increased in respiratory tract and play a proinflammatory role in lung epithelial cells during influenza infection2,3. Here, we reveal that endogenous lipids can be released into the extracellular milieu during influenza infection and subsequently activate γδ T cells for rapid IL-17A induction. Our findings are particularly important in light of recent evidence showing that during influenza viral infection, lipid components from unknown source are involved in NKT-cell activation in MedLN22. Previous studies demonstrated that influenza virus PB1-F2 induces apoptosis, increased mitochondrial permeability and content release46,47. CLs, derived from stressed cells or microbiota, could potentially be presented by APCs during infection and inflammation19,21,40,41. Here we show that influenza infection directly induces the release of endogenous CLs from both host cells in vivo and epithelial cells in vitro, which is consistent with ruptured structure of mitochondria in pdmH1N1-infected cells by TEM analysis. Moreover, LCMV infection also induces the release of CL in BLF, suggesting the possibility of a general mechanism across pulmonary viral infections. Antibiotics treatment does not affect lipids-mediated IL-17A production in γδ T cells, further supporting the endogenous nature of the lipids. Compared with the CL species identified in BLF of mock-infected controls, CLs in BLF of infected mice show mild shifting towards less unsaturated status regarding carbon double bonds distribution in their structure, hence suggesting a high degree of saturation in that of infected mice. Moreover, hypoxic condition results in increased CL release from MDCK cells, indicating a possible role of hypoxia in inducing CL release during lung infections. It is reported that the types of lipid antigens recognized by TCRs of γδ T or NKT cells are profoundly different18. Indeed, the identification of endogenous lipids that initiate Tγδ17 cell response in lung tissues at very early stage of influenza infection may provide a possible mechanistic explanation for the activation of NKT cells at a later stage in MedLN22. In addition to CLs, other lipid components may be involved in the activation of γδ T cells in lung under the influenza infection condition. Thus, further elucidation on the exact mechanism that mediates lipids release and the glycolipid antigen repertoire recognized by γδ T cells should provide new insight in understanding the immune responses induced by live attenuated vaccines delivered via the mucosal route.To determine molecular and phenotypic features of lung γδ T cells, our scRNA-seq analysis shows that lung Tγδ17 cells exhibit a unique transcriptome suggestive of functional maturity associated with TCR activation and thymic origin. The high levels of TCRγδ and CD3 expression on Tγδ17 cells prompted us to investigate whether TCR signaling plays a critical role in determining differentiation of γδ T cells. Unlike MHC molecules presenting peptide antigens, CD1 family molecules present lipids and microbial metabolites, thereby providing a broad survey of self and foreign antigens encountered by the host48. Recent advances have been made in the identification of natural lipid antigens derived from either host (endogenous) or foreign (exogenous) pathogens18. Thus, the γδ T cell receptors, when presented with the lipid ligands in the context of CD1d, more closely resemble pattern recognition receptors, rather than the adaptive αβ T cell receptors with high diversity and specificity.The transcription factor IRF4 is required for both development and function of various immune cells, including plasma cells, regulatory T cells and several helper T cell subsets38,49,50. IRF4 expression is strictly controlled by TCR affinity and acts to regulate T cell functions in a dose-dependent manner51,52. IRF4 can directly bind to the Il17a promotor and induce Il17a and Rorγt gene expression in CD4+ T cells52. However, it has been unclear whether and how the strength of TCR signaling regulates the abundance of IRF4 expression and IL-17A production. Here we show that Irf4−/− mice fail to mount a productive pulmonary Tγδ17 cell response during influenza challenge. Moreover, we demonstrate that IRF4 expression is tightly controlled by TCR signaling strength in γδ T cells and IRF4 promotes IL-17A production in a manner dependent on TCR strength. These results demonstrate that the TCR-IRF4 axis critically regulates IL-17A production. Although other mechanisms may be involved in mediating IL-17A production in γδ T cells, this study has identified γδTCR-IRF4 axis as the crucial mechanism of Tγδ17 induction in the context of influenza infection. Here, we have also observed considerable variations of Tγδ17 cell frequencies in infected lung tissues compared with other lymphoid organs, which may reflect the functional heterogeneity of different γδ T cell subsets with distinctive cytokine production or usage of specific Vγ chain segments, a notion further supported by our current findings that lung γδ T cells have much higher frequencies of Vγ4, Vγ5 and Vγ6 subsets enriched in Tγδ17 cells.Analysis at the single-cell level confirmed a functional heterogeneity and demonstrated that the expression of CXCR6, a receptor involved in relocating tissue-resident T cells to the airways and assists in their retaining in the tissue53, identifies Tγδ17 cells. Interestingly, we also identified a strong link between AQP3 and IL-17A in γδ T cells, which has been independently associated with tissue origins. AQP3 is one of thirteen members of the aquaglyceroporin family that transports water and other small molecules, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and glycogen, across the cell membrane54. It has been shown that AQP3-mediated H2O2 uptake regulates trafficking of CD4+ T cells in cutaneous immune reactions55. AQP3 has also been reported to mediate H2O2-dependent expression of IL-6 and TNF in colonic epithelial cells in response to environmental stress, a condition linked to epithelial wound repair, defense against infections, and inflammation56. Notably, Aqp3 is among the top ranking genes that are induced following the in vitro exposure of naïve T cells to Th17 polarizing conditions including transforming growth factor β1 and IL-657. Thus, further investigation is warranted to determine whether AQP3 mediates the adaptation of γδ T cells to hypoxic conditions in influenza-infected lungs.Many studies have reported the presentation of lipid antigens by CD1d-expressing APCs, including DCs, macrophages, neutrophils and B cells19,20,21,23,58,59,60. B cells are known to use multiple pathways to capture lipid antigens. Previous studies have shown that BCR-mediated uptake of the prototypical NKT-cell antigen, α-GalCer, elicits cognate NKT help for lipid-specific B cells in vivo and in vitro24,61. However, B cells also capture, internalize and present lipid antigens to NKT cells via apolipoprotein E (apoE), and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R), which initiates innate help by NKT cells to stimulate polyclonal B cell activation60. In this study, we show that presentation of lipid antigen by lung B-1a cells to γδ T cells induces concomitant differentiation of both virus-specific and PC (a hapten present on both mammalian cells and many bacteria)-specific B-1a cells into CD138-expressing plasmablasts62,63. Thus, consistent with previous findings that B-1a response in MedLN lacked antigen specificity in response to influenza infection64, it is plausible to reason that B-1a-γδ T interaction preferentially favors innate and noncognate types of immune responses. As a result, B-1a and γδ T cells cooperate to generate an innate humoral response preceding a more specific and evolved adaptive response. Nevertheless, future studies are needed to determine whether lung Tγδ17 cells exert any adaptive property in terms of their homeostatic maintenance and secondary response to the same stimulus.It has been proposed that layers of progressively more advanced populations of lymphocytes create an evolutionarily “layered immune system”, in which B-1a and γδ T cells appear to occupy equivalent positions with their adaptive counterparts in primitive layer and are expected to respond rapidly to invading pathogens65. Here, we show that innate B-1a and Tγδ17 cells interact in a fashion reminiscent of adaptive B-2 and Th17 cells. Recent studies have provided supportive evidence for such B-1a-γδ T interaction. First, the antigen receptor repertoires of B-1a and γδ T cells are conserved yet overlapping to recognize similar ligands such as certain phospholipids, and this allows the two cell types to influence the immune responses of each other66,67,68. Second, B-1a cells express the MHC I-like molecule CD1d, which can be recognized by γδTCR19,21. Third, both B-1a and γδ T cells, unlike their adaptive counterparts, acquire a semi-activated state under homeostatic conditions and produce respectively natural antibodies and cytokines, but can undergo further differentiation during infection and inflammation5,6,69, which enable them to provide immediate help to each other under both naïve and inflammatory conditions. However, to what extent this innate B–T interaction requires cognate recognition and whether co-stimulatory signals such as CD40L-CD40 and B-7-CD28 are involved remain to be investigated. Addressing these key questions may facilitate the development of new strategies to modulate innate B–T interaction for therapeutic benefits in infection, autoimmunity, and vaccine development.MethodsMiceFemale mice between 6 and 8 weeks of age on C57BL/6 background were used. IL-17A-deficient (Il17a−/−) mice were obtained from Dr. Yoichiro Iwakura at The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Japan. IRF4-deficient (Irf4−/−) mice were provided by Dr. Tak Wah Mak at University Health Network, Toronto. C57BL/6 wild-type mice, B6.SJL-PtrcaPep3b/BoyJ (CD45.1) mice, C.Cg-Cd19tm1(cre)CgnIghb/J (Cd19−/−), Cd1d1f/f, and Cd19Cre/+ mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). All the mice were housed and bred under specific pathogen-free conditions at the animal facilities of The University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen University School of Medicine, or Bioprocessing Technology Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions with a 12 h light/dark cycle, at a temperature of 22 ± 2 °C, and a relative humidity of 50 ± 5%. Mice were fed a standard mouse chow diet.Virus preparation and infectionInfluenza type A virus, mouse-adopted mutant strain of pandemic H1N1 (HK/415742/09-Mut), was provided by Dr. Bo-Jian Zheng at Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, and propagated in the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old embryonated hens’ eggs at 37 °C with 65% humidity for 48 h. Allantoic fluid was collected and stored in aliquots. For influenza virus challenge experiments, mice were housed in biosafety level-2 individual ventilation cages and given free access to food and water. The 50% lethal dose (LD50) of pdmH1N1 was determined in C57BL/6 mice after serial dilution of the viral stock from embryonated hens’ eggs, and LD50 of pdmH1N1 was adopted in viral challenge experiments. After anesthetized with isoflurane, mice were i.n. challenged with 30 μL of virus diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Weight loss and survival were monitored for 14 successive days. Mice were sacrificed at the indicated time points for examination. For LCMV infection, mice were infected with 1 × 106 PFU and 5 × 105 PFU of LCMV-clone13 via the i.v. and i.n. routes, respectively. All animal experiments were approved by Institutional Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research of The University of Hong Kong, Animal Ethical and Welfare Committee of Medical College at Shenzhen University, or A*STAR Biological Resource Centre Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.To prepare inactivated virus, the allantoic fluid was concentrated and purified in a 10–50% sucrose gradient by centrifugation at 25,000 × g, 4 °C for 2 h. The purified virus was inactivated with 0.25% formalin (v/v) at 4 °C for 7 days. Further purification was performed with Amicon Ultra Membrane (4208) (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), with a molecular weight cutoff at 30 kDa. The products were resuspended in PBS. Inactivation of the virus was confirmed by the absence of cytopathic effects and detectable HA in the supernatant of two consecutive 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assays.Human samplesThe participants of the study were a part of the patients’ cohort we have previously reported70. Information on selected patients is described in Supplementary Table 1. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Centre. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy operations were performed according to the International Ethical Guidelines for Research Involving Human Subjects as stated in the Helsinki Declaration. The legal guardians of all participants provided informed written consents. Healthy PBMCs were isolated from buffy coat blood from healthy donors collected by the Hong Kong Red Cross with written consent. All experiments using PBMCs from healthy donors were approved by Institutional Review Board of The University of Hong Kong/ Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster Institutional Review Board (HKU/ HA HKW IRB).Mouse injectionMice were given i.p. injection of 200 μg of anti-CD1d (1B1, Biolegend) blocking antibody diluted in 200 μL of PBS, and intrapleural injections of 150 μg of anti-CD1d blocking antibody diluted in 60 μL of PBS to each side at 1 dpi. Mice that received injections of isotype-matched antibody served as controls. Mice were sacrificed and lung tissues were collected at 4 dpi. Mice were i.p. injected 200 μg of anti-TCRγδ (GL3, Biolegend) or isotype control antibodies 3 days before pdmH1N1 infection. B-1a cell depletion was achieved using protocols previously reported with some modifications71,72. Briefly, 6-week-old mice were treated with i.p. injections of 3 mL water daily for two days, and control mice received the same volume of PBS. The next day of the second water injection, mice were given i.p. injection of 200 μg of purified anti-mouse IgM (RMM-1, Biolegend) antibody diluted in 200 μL of PBS, and intrapleural injections of 150 μg of purified anti-mouse IgM (RMM-1) diluted in 60 μL of PBS to each side. Mice that received injections of isotype-matched antibody served as controls. Mice were allowed for 4 days to rest for influenza infection and another 4 days for flow cytometric analysis. The efficiency and specificity of B-1a depletion in various organs were examined at 4 dpi.Bone marrow chimerasRecipient B6.SJL-PtrcaPep3b/BoyJ (CD45.1) mice were given 700 cGy whole-body irradiation and allowed to rest for 7 h, followed by bone marrow reconstitution. Recipient mice were reconstituted with 5 × 106 bone marrow cells including a 1:1 ratio of wild-type CD45.1+ and Irf4−/− CD45.2+ bone marrow cells. This reconstitution mixture resulted in mice in which all the CD45.2+ cells were deficient in IRF4 and all the CD45.1+ cells were IRF4 sufficient. Graft reconstitution was evaluated by peripheral blood analysis of congenic markers expressed by lymphocytes. Recipient mice were allowed 8–10 weeks for reconstitution before infection with influenza virus.Quantitative RT-PCRγδ T cells were subjected to RLT lysis buffer followed by RNA extraction using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentrations were measured using Thermo Scientific NanoDrop™ spectrophotometers. RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the PrimeScriptTM RT reagent kit (TaKaRa). Quantitative RT-PCR was conducted with the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System, using SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM (Perfect Real Time) (TaKaRa). The expression of mRNA encoding detected genes was normalized relative to that of the mRNA encoding the internal standard hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt). All experiments were related to controls via the ΔΔ CT method.Flow cytometry and antibodiesSingle-cell suspensions of mouse spleen, lymph node, thymus and lung were treated with red blood cell lysis buffer, then blocked with purified anti-mouse CD16/32 (clone 93) to reduce nonspecific labeling, and the cells were thereafter stained with Live/Dead Zombie Aqua™ Fixable Viability dye (Biolegend) to stain for dead cells. Total lung lymphocytes were enriched by Percoll density centrifugation and collected from the interface of the 40/70% Percoll gradient. Anti-TCR Vγ7 (GL1.7) was a gift from Dr. Rebecca L. O’Brien (National Jewish Health, Denver, CO) and mAb 17D1 was a gift from Dr. Robert E Tigelaar and Dr. Julia M. Lewis (Yale School of Medicine, Connecticut, USA). FITC-conjugated goat antibody to rat (anti-rat) IgM (MRM-47) for detecting mAb 17D1, and normal hamster IgG for blocking were purchased from BioLegend. In the absence of other antibodies to TCR, mAb 17D1 binds to an epitope formed by the combination of Vγ5 and Vδ1 but does not bind either of these V regions individually. However, if anti-Vδ (GL3) binds the TCR first, an epitope on Vγ6Vδ1 TCRs that can bind mAb 17D1 is exposed73. Antibody dilution of 1:100–1:400 was used for flow cytometry analysis. Intracellular staining and intranuclear staining were performed using the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm™ Fixation/Permeabilization Kit and FoxP3 staining kit (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, respectively. For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were stimulated with PMA (200 ng/mL, Sigma), Ionomycin (500 ng/mL, Sigma), and monensin (1:1000 dilution, Biolegend) at 37 °C for 4 h, followed by fixation with the Fixation/Permeabilization buffer solution. Antibody information is summarized in Supplementary Table 2. Stained cells were acquired on a BD FACSAria SORP (Becton Dickinson) and analysed using FlowJo software (TreeStar). Debris and dead cells with lower FSC and SSC were excluded. FSC-H versus FSC-A was used to identify the singlet events. The Live/Dead Zombie Aqua™ Fixable Viability dye (Biolegend) negative live cells were used for further subgating (Figure exemplifies the gating strategy is provided in the Supplementary Fig. 6a).CHIP assayFreshly purified γδ T cells stimulated with plate-bound antibody to the co-receptor CD28 (1 μg/mL anti-CD28) and various concentrations of anti-CD3ε were prepared for CHIP assay using ChIP Assay Kit (Beyotime) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cell lysates were sonicated, followed by precipitation with anti-IRF4 or control rabbit IgG. Quantification of IRF4 binding to the putative binding sites of Il17a promoter was performed using quantitative RT-PCR with the primers provided in Supplementary Table 3.ELISA and ELISPOTAntibody concentrations in BLF and antibody-producing B cells were monitored throughout the experiment by ELISA and ELISPOT assays, respectively. Total IgM was captured with purified anti-mouse IgM (Biolegend). Anti-influenza antibody was captured with inactivated influenza virus. For ELISA assay, all antibodies were detected with HRP-conjugated secondary anti-mouse IgM (Biolegend). TMB substrate (BioLegend) was used as a substrate for the HRP enzyme. For ELISPOT assay, all antibodies were detected with AP-conjugated anti-mouse IgM antibody (Biolegend). SIGMAFASTTM BCIP/NBT (Sigma–Aldrich) was used as a substrate for the AP enzyme.Preparation of cardiolipinLyophilized CL sodium salt from bovine heart (Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in chloroform (CHCl3) at 5 mg/mL. Aliquots of dissolved CL or CHCl3 alone (vehicle control) were dried down in a glass tube under nitrogen gas. The CL was resuspended in serum-free RPMI1640 medium or PBS, vortexed vigorously for at least 1–2 min and sonicated for 20 min at 37 °C. CL was freshly prepared and vortexed well before use. For in vitro culture experiments, isolated mouse B-1a cells were pulsed with or without 0.2 μM CL in serum-free RPMI1640 for 1 h at 37 °C. After lipid loading, cells were centrifuged and subjected to B-1a-γδ T cell cocultures in 96-well round bottom plates for 3 days at 37 °C. Blocking experiments were performed using 10 μg/mL purified CD1d blocking antibody (1B1, Biolegend). For in vivo transfer, isolated B-1a were cultured with 20 μM CL or vehicle in serum-free RPMI1640 for 1 h at 37 °C. After being washed with PBS, CL or vehicle-pulsed B-1a cells (5 × 105) were injected i.v. into mice. For in vivo injection, pdmH1N1-infected C57BL/6 mice at 1 dpi were treated with a single i.p. injection of CL (100 μg/kg) or vehicle resuspended in 200 μL of PBS.Calcium mobilization analysisFor calcium mobilization analysis, single-cell suspensions were harvested from thymus and lung of infected C57BL/6 mice at 4 dpi and were negatively selected to enrich γδ T cells. Briefly, B220+, TCRβ+, and CD11c+ cells were labeled with biotinylated antibodies, magnetically labeled with Anti-Biotin MicroBeads and then negatively depleted over a MACS® Column (Miltenyi Biotec) which was placed in the magnetic field of a MACS Separator. The enriched γδ T cells (>95% purity) were stained with anti-γδTCR-Brilliant Violet 421 and then loaded with 2 μM Fluo-4-AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium at a density of 2 × 106 cells/mL. Each sample was heated to 37 °C before analysis. Baseline measurements were achieved by running the samples without stimulation for 30 sec. Dynabeads® Mouse T-Activator CD3/CD28 (Life Techologies) was then added. Data were collected for 600 sec. At 40 sec, ionomycin (500 ng/mL) was added as a calcium-flux control. FlowJo software (TreeStar) was used for data analysis.Histology and confocal fluorescence microscopyLungs were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and embedded in OCT (Sakuru) for sectioning without further fixation. Lung tissues were cut into 6-μm thin sections using a cryostat microtome/vibratome (Leica). The sections were fixed in ice-cold acetone for 5 min and washed in PBS. Nonspecific binding in tissues was blocked for 30 min with 5% goat serum (Dako) in PBS, followed by washing with PBS and staining for 1 h with the appropriate antibodies. The following antibodies from Biolegend were used for histology examination: anti-mouse CD3ε PE (clone 145-2C11), anti-mouse TCR γ/δ FITC (clone GL3), anti-mouse/human CD45R/B220 PE (clone RA3-6B2), and anti-mouse CD43 APC (clone 1B11). Images were analysed using Carl Zeiss LSM 780 Microscopy and ZEN offline Analysis Software. For histological assessment, lung tissues were placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 24 h before processing and embedding. Lung tissues were sectioned at 6-μm thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological evaluation. Slides were examined in a blinded manner and scored with a semi-quantitative system according to the relative degree of inflammation and tissue damage. Briefly, the cumulative scores of inflammatory infiltration, degeneration and necrosis provided the total score per animal. Lung infiltration of inflammatory cells was scored as follows: 0, no inflammation; 1, mild peribronchial and peribronchiolar infiltrates, extending throughout <10% of the lung; 2, moderate inflammation covering 10–50% of the lung; 3, severe inflammation involving over one-half of the lung. Degeneration was scored as follows: 0, no degeneration; 1, little vacuolar degeneration of bronchi and bronchiole epithelium cells, normal pulmonary alveoli; 2, mild necrosis of bronchi and bronchiolar epithelium, mild alveoli damage; 3, severe degeneration. Necrosis was scored as follows: 0, no necrosis; 1, mild necrosis with scant exudate; 2, marked necrosis with abundant exudate; 3, severe interstitial edema around blood vessels, apparent injured parenchyma and degenerated alveolar epithelial cells with greater infiltration of inflammatory cells6,16. Images were collected using a light microscope.Lipid extraction and derivatizationFor lipid extraction from BLF of mice, both cells and insoluble components in the freshly collected BLF samples were removed by high-speed centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. Samples were then dried and resuspended in 1365 μL of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)/Methanol (MeOH) /2 N HCl (v/v/v 200/60/13). The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 15 min, with 30-second vortex every 5 min. Another 250 μL of 0.1 N HCl was added, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min for phase separation. The upper organic phase was immediately transferred to a new tube and dried by nitrogen gas at room temperature. Dried lipid extracts were resuspended using 400 μL MTBE/MeOH (v/v 200/60). Then 50 μL TMS-diazomethane (2 M in hexane) was added and incubated for 20 min at RT. The reactions were terminated by adding 5 μL of glacial acetic acid and then another 92 μL HPLC-grade water was added. After further centrifugation (12,000 × g, 20 min at RT), the upper phase was transferred into a new tube for LC-MS/MS analysis.LC-MS/MS method for lipid analysisCortecs C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, Waters) was applied in the analysis. Mobile phase A was made by mixing 400 mL of HPLC-grade water containing 0.77 g of ammonium acetate with 600 mL of HPLC-grade acetonitrile. Mobile phase B contained 10% acetonitrile and 90% isopropanol (v/v). The gradient was as follows: 0 min, 40% B; 3.0 min, 40% B; 23 min, 98% B; 30 min, 98% B; 30.5 min, 40% B; 35 min, 40% B. Data were acquired using Q Exactive orbitrap mass spectrometer (QEHF, Thermo Fisher, USA). Resolution of 60,000 and 30,000 was used for MS and MS/MS acquisition. The detailed mass spectrometer parameters are as follows: spray voltage, 3.2 kV for positive; capillary temperature, 320 °C; aux gas flow rate (arb),10; mass range (m/z), 240–2000 for positive mode. Lipids were identified and quantified using Tracefinder 3.2 (Thermo Fisher, USA). In-house database containing 780 methylated CL molecules, which is compatible with Tracerfinder, was applied for lipid identification.PRM analysis for targeted cardiolipinsPRM was performed to analyze methylated CL lipids using Q Exactive orbitrap (QEHF, Thermo Fisher, USA) with resolutions of 45,000 in positive ion mode. Eight targeted cardiolipin molecules and one internal standard were included in PRM list with following precursor mass/charge ratios: m/z 1449.05300 for CL(34:1/34:2); m/z 1475.06865 for CL(34:1/36:3); m/z 1473.05300 for CL(34:1/36:4); m/z 1473.05300 for CL(34:2/36:3); m/z 1469.0217 for CL(34:2/36:5); m/z 1469.0217 for CL(34:3/36:4); m/z 1499.06865 for CL(36:3/36:3); m/z 1495.03735 for CL(36:4/36:4); m/z 1286.91105 for internal standard CL(14:0/14:0/14:0/14:0). Isolation window of 2.0 m/z was set in the analysis. Stepped normalized collision energy (NCE) of 18, 20, and 22 was used for fragmentation. The parameters of ESI source were as follows: spray voltage, 3.2 kV in positive ion mode; heated capillary temperature, 320 °C; Sheath gas flow rate (Arb), 35; aux gas flow rate (arb), 10. Lipids were identified and quantified using Tracefinder 3.2 (Thermo, CA). The featured fragments of m/z 575.50366, 577.51947, 599.50391, 575.50366, 597.48816, 573.48785, 601.51959 and 599.50391 were applied for quantitation of CL(34:1/34:2), CL(34:1/36:3), CL(34:1/36:4), CL(34:2/36:3), CL(34:2/36:5), CL(34:3/36:4), CL(36:3/36:3), and CL(36:4/36:4).Antibiotics treatment and quantification of bacterial loadMice were exposed to 1% Enrofloxacin (Baytril) ad libitum in drinking water for 13 days. Intranasal administration of 200 μg of Vancomycin (Sigma) and 200 μg of Neomycin (Sigma) in 25 μg of PBS or the equivalent volume of vehicle every other day were performed starting from eight days before pdmH1N1 infection. DNA extractions from BLF and stool samples were done using QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit and QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) for detection of pathogens in stool and BLF samples. To perform an absolute quantification, qPCR experiment was performed on a LightCycler 480 (Roche Applied Science) using broad universal primers 63 F and 355 R designed to quantify the 16 S ribosomal DNA gene of the bacteria74,75. A standard curve was constructed by amplifying serial dilutions of known quantities of E. coli DNA.ScRNA-seq and data analysisSingle cells isolated using the methods described in the manuscript were loaded into individual oil droplets following manufacturer’s protocol (10× Genomics®) and processed using the 3’ sequencing kit. The cells were merged into one sample for sequencing via Illumina Hiseq2500. Individually barcoded data were recovered using CellRanger and then loaded into Seurat for initial processing following the standard pipeline. The list of variable genes was used for dimension reduction and UMAP clustering, leading to the identification of the clusters of cells. Functional analyses of differentially expressed genes between the clusters were performed using GSEA, and UMAP visualization of the genesets was performed by summing the contributions of the upregulated factors in each of the genesets identified. Canonical correlation analysis was also performed in Seurat using the standard pipeline. Data on the cells in the Tγδ17 cluster were exported into Monocle for trajectory analyses. Scripts of all of the codes run in this paper are available upon request.StatisticsStatistical analysis was performed with GraphPad PRISM 7 software using the two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test for two groups analysis and one-way or two-way ANOVA for multiple groups analysis. Nonparametric data were analysed by Mann–Whitney test. Survival curve of influenza virus-infected mice was determined using Kaplan–Meier analysis. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

(The Borealis Gallery )Social SharingHow will COVID-19 be remembered? For clues, historians have looked at the the impact of the 1918-1919 Spanish flu pandemic. "The history of epidemics often ends when the epidemic ends, but I've always thought it was important to look at what happens to people afterwards," says Esyllt Jones, a professor at the University of Manitoba and as an infectious disease historian.Jones has written about the impacts of the century-old Great Influenza pandemic in Canada, where 55,000 people died. As well as writing the book Influenza 1918: Death, Disease and Struggle in Winnipeg, she edited a collection of works, Epidemic Encounters: Influenza, Society, and Culture in Canada, 1918-20.Esyllt Jones, a University of Manitoba professor and infectious disease historian, has written about the impacts of the 1918-1919 flu pandemic in Canada. (Submitted by Esyllt Jones)The profiles of the people who died in each pandemic differ greatly.In the 20th-century flu, "in the 20-to-40 age cohort, there were some pretty significant familial impacts," says Jones. Jones says there will be familial impacts from COVID-19, "but they won't be the same ones."It won't be, 'How do we support women who have lost breadwinners. The familial impacts are going to be around the care of our elders."Roaring 2020s?"There has been conversation about whether we'll have another kind of Great Gatsby era … like the 1920s," says Jones, referring to the Roaring 20s in which growth and prosperity were rampant for some."This notion ... is a little bit of a misunderstanding of the 1920s for the majority of Canadians. We're very familiar with the poverty of the 1930s, but we tend to discount the poverty of the 1920s."There's a sobering lesson from the post-pandemic period. Many people were advocating for progressive social changes, increases in wages, and better trade union rights from 1919 on. Very few of these things came to pass. It took a few decades for the federal government to really step up."A nurse takes the pulse of a patient in the influenza ward of the Walter Reed hospital in Washington, D.C. The Great Influenza was responsible for the deaths of at least 50 million people worldwide. (Harris & Ewing/Library of Congress/The Associated Press)First person accountsThere are photographs and newspaper records from the Spanish flu, but relatively few personal accounts from working-class and immigrant families in Canada."I actually had a lot of difficulty finding anything like journalling," says Jones.In the years following the Spanish flu, much of the public commemoration was directed toward the First World War, according to Jones."People who were living at the time maybe didn't think [the Spanish flu] was all that important in a big public history sense. That damaged the capacity of the society to preserve its memory."Jones is working with archivists on how to preserve records from COVID-19, "especially digital media records, which are kind of ephemeral."There's a need to really try to keep track of what people are doing through the pandemic, and not just slide by it when it's over and not really think or talk about it for more than 50 years."You can't just pull the disease event out of people's lives and write about it in a narrow way. People's memory is based on everyday life, not just big public events."'The poor and the marginalized ... are usually the ones who are the most affected' by pandemics, says Lorie Laroche, who teaches the history of health care at the University of Ottawa. (Supplied by Lucie Laroche)Lessons in public healthLorie Laroche is a social worker and part-time instructor at the University of Ottawa, says plagues and epidemics "have played a very significant role in the development of health care."Laroche teaches the history of health care through the faculty of health sciences, and the Spanish flu is an important component of the course. "It was really interesting to see the parallels," says Laroche. "The poor and the marginalized ... are usually the ones who are the most affected by these epidemics."Laroche sees similarities in how Canadians are coming together now to fight COVID-19, as they did in 1918-1919 in the battle against the Spanish flu, which "was quicker in killing people and actually killed the most healthy," says Laroche.The Spanish flu also helped drive scientific advances so relevant today."It really pushed forward studies of virology, epidemiology, improvements in sanitation and vaccinology," says Laroche. "There were a lot of good things that came out of [the Spanish flu] that are helping us now."Guidance on how to prevent Influenza, published in the Illustrated Current News, on Oct. 18, 1918. (National Library of Medicine)Wearing masks became common during the Spanish flu, and continues today as a prime way to prevent COVID-19 exposure. "Physically distancing and avoiding crowds? All that stuff they discovered" at the time, says Laroche. Laroche points out another parallel: the urge to get out of the city into the countryside to escape the worst of the pandemic, and the discovery that travel was one of the ways viruses propagate.Social isolation during an epidemic didn't start with COVID-19. There were harmful side-effects of isolation during the Spanish flu, made worse by a lack of a social safety net. "Because of the lockdown, the poor and the elderly," says Laroche. "Some of them didn't die from the Spanish flu. Some of them died from starvation because nobody was delivering food."Men wear masks in Alberta during the pandemic of 1918. (National Archives of Canada)There is even a record of impacts to mental health during the Spanish flu, according to Laroche."Increases in starvation, suicides [and increased] drinking rates."And like some during COVID-19, there were those who felt the authorities were overreacting."There were even then people who didn't believe that it was that bad, who believed that it was fabricated, that it was propaganda," says Laroche. "Same thing as we see now."

Partners View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger As the nights begin to close in and the temperatures cool, it’s clear winter is approaching again. With the winter season comes the risk of the usual winter lurgies, most of which result from respiratory infections. Some of the usual suspects include rhinoviruses (the common cold), RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), and influenza. This year, of course, we’re also contending with the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) could escape from its quarantine status and circulate alongside these other viruses. We don’t know yet how the winter season will play out in terms of respiratory viruses. But one important way we can prepare for it is by getting a flu vaccine. What will winter bring? In 2020 there was a paucity of seasonal winter viruses. Only rhinoviruses circulated widely, while the others were either vastly reduced (for example, we saw a very minimal flu season) or very delayed (RSV circulated later than usual in some states until spring or even summer). So what’s going to happen in 2021? Will it be similar to 2020, or will it be like 2019, which saw very high levels of influenza? Or perhaps something completely different? We simply don’t know for sure. With COVID-related restrictions having eased in all Australian states and territories — albeit to varying degrees — people are free to move around, come together in crowds, and attend schools, universities and offices. These activities promote the transmission of respiratory viruses, which explains why we saw such different trends in the usual winter lurgies last year, when we were mixing much less. Read more: RSV is a common winter illness in children. Why did it see a summer surge in Australia this year? But the virus circulation needs to start from somewhere. While some viruses are happy to circulate domestically, like rhinoviruses and adenoviruses, others, like influenza, are largely transported into the country each year. So it’s possible that if Australia’s international borders remain closed through winter, we may again have a less serious flu season in 2021. On the other hand, if borders are opened and the flu does take hold, people might have reduced immunity to the viruses given the missed season last year, and be more susceptible. Last winter we saw significantly fewer cases of the flu than usual. Shutterstock A vaccine is your best bet In the face of this uncertainty, the usual adage prevails: “prevention is better than cure”. The best measure we can take is to get our influenza vaccine. The flu vaccines available in Australia in 2021 under the National Immunisation Program are: for children aged six months to five years — Vaxigrip Tetra® (Sanofi) and Fluarix® Tetra (GSK) for children and adults aged five to 64 years — Vaxigrip Tetra®, Fluarix® Tetra and Afluria® Quad (Seqirus) for adults aged 65 and over — Vaxigrip Tetra®, Fluarix® Tetra, Afluria® Quad and Fluad® Quad (Seqirus). The Fluad® Quad vaccine, which is slightly different and more potent than the others, is the preferred vaccine for the over-65 age group. It contains a component called an adjuvant, which helps boost the immune response in elderly people. This season’s flu vaccines are made up of four different viruses — two influenza A types and two influenza B types. The 2021 vaccines have two changes (both in the influenza A types) from the 2020 influenza vaccines. It’s very hard to predict in advance which strains will circulate, but the World Health Organization provides guidance on this every year, and recommends which components of the vaccine should be updated accordingly. All the influenza vaccines used in Australia are inactivated virus vaccines, meaning the virus contained in the vaccine doesn’t replicate, so you can’t get the flu from the vaccination. Read more: Flu vaccines are updated every year. We can learn from this process as we respond to COVID variants In addition to the flu vaccines under the National Immunisation Program, a new vaccine called Flucelvax® Quad (Seqirus) is available through retail outlets, like pharmacies, for people aged nine years and older. This vaccine is the first influenza vaccine available in Australia which has been produced entirely in cell culture, rather than chickens eggs. This new vaccine may have some benefits over the traditional egg-based vaccines for certain people, for example those with severe egg allergies. How effective are flu vaccines? Flu vaccines are only moderately effective at preventing infection with influenza. On average, they offer around 60% protection across the population, although rates can often be higher in children. While this is lower than we’d like, it’s the best measure we currently have to protect us from influenza infections. There’s also evidence it reduces the more severe consequences of being infected, such as being hospitalized or dying. Scientists are continuing to work on new flu vaccines that may offer greater protection. The COVID vaccine rollout might somewhat complicate the flu vaccine rollout this year. HEALTH QLD/AAP The practicalities This year’s vaccines are already becoming available through pharmacies and some GP clinics, and will be available under the National Immunisation Program from GPs and other providers, such as workplace immunisation programs, in April. The flu season generally starts in earnest around June, so it’s reasonable to get your vaccine any time between now and then. Under the National Immunisation Program, some groups are eligible to receive the influenza vaccine for free. These include: adults 65 and older all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians six months and older children aged six months to five years pregnant women people with certain medical conditions. For people who don’t fall into these groups, the vaccine costs as little as A$14.99. Read more: You can't get influenza from a flu shot – here's how it works Influenza vaccines are being rolled out this year alongside the COVID-19 vaccines. With both programs operating at the same time, there may be some confusion and logistical challenges. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation have recommended a 14-day gap between the COVID and flu vaccinations, regardless of which one you have first. This is something both individuals and providers will need to keep in mind and will mean some extra planning this year.

Belonging to diverse families, respiratory viruses differ in how easy they spread (transmissibility) and the mechanism (modes) of transmission. Transmissibility as estimated by the basic reproduction number (R0) or secondary attack rate is heterogeneous for the same virus. Respiratory viruses can be transmitted via four major modes of transmission: direct (physical) contact, indirect contact (fomite), (large) droplets and (fine) aerosols. We know little about the relative contribution of each mode to the transmission of a particular virus in different settings, and how its variation affects transmissibility and transmission dynamics. Discussion on the particle size threshold between droplets and aerosols and the importance of aerosol transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus is ongoing. Mechanistic evidence supports the efficacies of non-pharmaceutical interventions with regard to virus reduction; however, more data are needed on their effectiveness in reducing transmission. Understanding the relative contribution of different modes to transmission is crucial to inform the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the population. Intervening against multiple modes of transmission should be more effective than acting on a single mode.

Respiratory virus infections often cannot be differentiated clinically. Respiratory viruses belong to diverse virus families that differ in viral and genomic structures, populations susceptible to infection, disease severity, seasonality of circulation, transmissibility and modes of transmission. Together, they contribute to substantial morbidity1, mortality2 and concomitant economic losses3 annually worldwide. In addition, occasional pandemics cause extreme disruption to societies and economies as exemplified by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Until effective treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 are available, we have to rely heavily on population-based and individual-based public health measures to mitigate transmission. The effectiveness and the suitability of a non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) to mitigate transmission depends substantially on the ease of transmission (transmissibility) and the mechanism of transmission (modes of transmission) specific to that virus, as these interventions can target some but not all potential modes of transmission. Therefore, understanding how to evaluate the transmissibility and evidence supporting different modes of transmission will aid in the control of respiratory virus transmission.Previous reviews and commentaries discussed the transmissibility of influenza virus4,5; methods for studying transmission, including animal models4,5,6,7, human models6,8 and epidemiological studies9; the mechanism and evidence for different modes of transmission4,6,7,9,10,11,12; factors affecting transmission4,5,11,13; controversies regarding the relative importance of different modes of transmission14,15; pharmaceutical interventions4 and NPIs11,16,17,18 for mitigating transmission16,17,18,19; and guidelines from public health agencies on infection prevention and control recommendations for respiratory viruses9,15. These various aspects of transmissibility and transmission have been more comprehensively studied for influenza virus4,5,6,7,10,14,17,19 than for other respiratory viruses9,11,12,15,16,18. In this Review, I will bring these discussions together to provide a broad overview of the transmissibility and modes of transmission of respiratory viruses, the approaches used to make these assessments, the viral, host and environmental determinants of transmission, and common NPIs for mitigating respiratory virus transmission, in the hope of illustrating the common approaches for studying respiratory virus transmission as well as the interconnection and differences between these discussions. I also discuss recent controversies regarding the role of aerosols in transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the difficulties in evaluating the relative contribution of each mode to the transmission of respiratory viruses.TransmissibilityIn the control of a novel pandemic, one of the most important early questions is how easily the disease will spread from an infected person to a susceptible person; that is, how transmissible the disease is. Transmissibility is determined by the infectivity of the pathogen, the contagiousness of the infected individual, the susceptibility of the exposed individual, the contact patterns between the infected individual and the exposed individual, and the environmental stress exerted on the pathogen during transmission. These will determine the scale and intensity of control measures needed to suppress transmission. In animal models, volunteer transmission studies, modelling studies and observational as well as interventional epidemiological studies, although the number of successful transmission events (that is, infection in the exposed individual) is often used as an outcome measure, these study designs answer different research questions when evaluating the transmissibility of a respiratory virus.Evaluating transmissibility in animals and volunteersAnimal models are often used to compare the transmissibility of respiratory viruses with different naturally occurring or engineered genomic constructs to identify viral molecular determinants of increased transmissibility, or to compare the transmissibility between different modes of transmission (Box 1). For example, for influenza virus, animal transmission studies have been used to evaluate the molecular determinants of transmissibility20, the airborne transmission potential of emerging viruses21 or drug-resistant viruses22, the relative importance of droplets and aerosols to transmission23 and the anatomical site that drives the different routes of transmission24. Alternatively, volunteer transmission studies, where transmission is observed in susceptible volunteers who are exposed to other volunteers who are either experimentally or naturally infected8, may be used to provide important information on the effectiveness of interventions and the importance of presymptomatic or asymptomatic transmission in a controlled setting25. However, these studies can be challenging and expensive to conduct, and may be criticized as too artificial8.Box 1 Evaluating transmissibility in animal transmission studiesIn the simplest form of animal transmission studies, naive (‘infector’ or ‘donor’) animals are first inoculated with a candidate virus, with infection confirmed by the recovery of virus in respiratory specimens; other naive (‘infectee’ or ‘contact’) animals are then co-housed with the infected animals for some period to observe whether the contact animal subsequently acquires infection. The number of donor and contact animals used may vary, or multiple donor–contact pairs of animals are used, and transmissibility is assessed by counting the proportion of contact animals infected204. This basic design can be adjusted to study transmissibility for different modes of transmission: direct contact transmission studies are done by co-housing donor and contact animals in the same cage to allow all major modes of transmission to occur; airborne transmission studies are done by physically separating the donor and contact animals usually by an air-permeable barrier, with some distance between the cages or no distance, so only aerosol route, with or without the droplet route, of transmission can occur205; and fomite transmission studies are done by putting contact animals in the cage that was previously used to house the donor animals108. Depending on the specific respiratory virus studied, costs, availability of reagents and desired pathogenesis, different animal models are available for transmission studies204,206,207, including mice, guinea pigs, ferrets, Syrian hamsters and non-human primates. Transgenic or transduced mouse models may also be used to better mimic human pathogenesis when access to non-human primates is limited; for example, transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor as a model for coronavirus infection208. In animal transmission studies, it has been suggested that a minimum of four pairs of donor–contact animals per group is required for sufficient power to detect differences in transmissibility between experimental groups209, and this is usually considered as an accepted number to report in studies of influenza virus210.Evaluating transmissibility in the populationMathematical or statistical models are often used to estimate transmissibility of a respiratory virus in the population, especially during pandemics to assess the extent of transmission. With use of data from surveillance, observational and interventional epidemiological studies, or simulation from modelling studies, transmissibility is usually assessed by the estimation of the basic reproduction number (R0) or secondary attack rate (SAR) (Box 2). In addition, by comparing the two simultaneously, one can assess the role of specific populations (for example, households or schools)26 or superspreading events27 in driving community transmission.Box 2 Basic reproduction number and secondary attack rateBasic reproduction numberThe reproduction number (denoted as R) is defined as the average number of successful transmissions per infectious individual in a population and can be estimated from mathematical models that describe the natural history of disease. The effective reproduction number (Rt) represents R at any time (t) during an epidemic. The basic reproduction number (R0) is R at the start of an epidemic and represents the average number of secondary infections caused by a primary infection after its introduction to a completely susceptible population211. Therefore, R0 is an important quantity that reflects the capacity of a virus to be transmitted (that is, transmissibility) and will inform the potential ease or difficulty in controlling transmission of the disease. Reported estimates of R0 were heterogenous between viruses and even for the same virus: R0 for rhinovirus212,213, parainfluenza virus212 and adenovirus212,214 was usually slightly above 1 to 5, R0 for coronaviruses213,215 could be up to 8 (also based on a recent preprint213), whereas R0 for respiratory syncytial virus212,213, influenza viruses216, varicella zoster virus217 and measles virus218 may be as low as around 1 but could go up to above 5 or even above 10 (Table 1). Advanced model structures (for example, ‘susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered’) or further compartmentation (for example, age, contact patterns or vaccination status) allow a more complex description of disease or transmission dynamics (for example, presymptomatic transmission95, asymptomatic infection, waning immunity219 or seasonality or contact patterns220), the prediction of impacts of interventions, or identifying the key factors required for such predictions221. Incorporation of phylogenetic data into epidemiological models has identified important factors that drive influenza virus transmission at the population level222,223 and evaluated the transmissibility of emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants224. Furthermore, the effect of superspreading events on transmission may be described by a dispersion parameter (k), where for a disease with low dispersion most secondary infections are from only a small number of the most infectious individuals225,226, and estimating ‘individual-based’ R instead of ‘population-based (mean)’ R could account for individual variations in contagiousness225. Therefore, R0 takes on different values for different populations and scenarios216,217,218 and whether superspreading events are considered227, and comparing transmissibility between respiratory viruses directly on the basis of R0 estimated from different studies will be challenging. An important application of R0 is determining the herd immunity threshold needed for an epidemic to end228. During an epidemic when Rt < 1, which occurs when the proportion of immune individuals in the population reaches the herd immunity threshold, transmission decreases over time and the epidemic eventually ends. The modes of transmission and their virus, host and environmental determinants211 influence transmissibility by modulating how effective the contact allows transmission, once contact between susceptible and infectious individuals is established.Secondary attack rateThe secondary attack rate (SAR) is defined as the proportion infected among those susceptible in contact with the primary case229. Some suggested calling it ‘secondary infection risk’, as the quantity refers to a proportion and not a rate230, because infection may not necessarily lead to symptomatic illness, and ‘symptomatic secondary infection risk’ could be used instead when one is referring to the risk of symptomatic infection231. SAR is most frequently used to estimate the transmission risk in households232,233, and sometimes in outbreaks if the index (primary) cases introducing the infection are known and supplemented with contact tracing27,234; that is, case-ascertained studies where exposed individuals are followed up to observe them for infection once a primary case is ascertained235, either by identifying symptomatic illness or by systematic collection of a respiratory or serum specimen regardless of symptoms for laboratory-confirmed infection. The proportion of exposed household contacts with infection (that is, the household SAR) is then used to describe the transmission risk from the index member to household members. Similarly to R0, reported estimates of household SAR were heterogenous, ranging between 1% and 38% for influenza virus230, and estimates were lower if infections were ascertained only in contacts with symptomatic illness excluding asymptomatic infections231,236,237, or if only laboratory-confirmed illnesses were included238. For other respiratory viruses, household SARs for respiratory syncytial virus237,239 and coronaviruses240 generally fall in a similar range as for influenza virus, and are higher for rhinovirus238, parainfluenza virus237,241, varicella zoster virus232,242 and measles virus232,243 (Table 1), but direct comparison between viruses is again challenging. Case-ascertained studies can be used to evaluate factors affecting transmission — for example, virus type/subtype, age, types of contact244, asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission244,245 and pre-infection immunity237,238,242,245 — or the effectiveness of interventions, such as the postexposure prophylaxis use of antivirals246 and non-pharmaceutical interventions125, and vaccine efficacy247. Individual-based hazard models and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques can account for multiple index cases, unobserved transmission or multiple covariates, for example, incorporating symptom onset data to estimate transmission risk within households versus outside households248, or viral shedding data to estimate the effectiveness of face masks and hand hygiene in reducing transmission249.Modes of transmissionRespiratory viruses are transmitted between individuals when the virus is released from the respiratory tract of an infected person and is transferred through the environment, leading to infection of the respiratory tract of an exposed and susceptible person. There are a number of different routes (or modes) through which transmission could occur, the chance of which is modified by viral, host and environmental factors. Although there is evidence in support of individual modes of transmission, the relative contribution of different modes to a successful transmission event, and the relative effect of each factor on each mode or multiple modes simultaneously, is often unknown.Direct contact, indirect contact, droplet and aerosolRespiratory viruses can be transmitted via respiratory secretions over multiple routes independently and simultaneously. Traditionally, it is believed that respiratory viruses are transmitted directly via physical contact between an infected individual (infector) and a susceptible individual (infectee), indirectly via contact with contaminated surfaces or objects (fomites) or directly through the air from one respiratory tract to another via large respiratory droplets or via fine respiratory aerosols6,7 (Fig. 1). These four major modes of transmission (direct contact, indirect contact/fomite, droplet and aerosol) are often the foci of transmission control; for example, infection prevention and control measures in health-care settings are designed specifically for each mode28. Some respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses, coronaviruses and rhinoviruses, can be recovered from faeces29,30 or infect cells in the gastrointestinal tract29, suggesting infection may spread via faeces; for example, via aerosolization during toilet flushing31. Studies have shown SARS-CoV-2 in ocular secretions32 and influenza virus infection by ocular exposure33, suggesting respiratory viruses might also be transmitted via exposure to the eyes.Fig. 1: Major modes of transmission of respiratory viruses during short-range and long-range transmission.During an acute respiratory virus infection, an infected individual (infector; red) may shed virus in exhaled breath droplets and aerosols, and may also contaminate their immediate bodily surfaces (for example, skin and clothes) or surrounding objects and surfaces (for example, tables) with their respiratory secretions. In general, if a susceptible individual (infectee; grey) is close to the infector, short-range transmission may occur when the infectee breathes in the virus-laden droplets or aerosols released by the infector, during direct (physical) contact with the infector or during physical contact with objects or surfaces contaminated (fomite) by the infector. If the infectee is at a distance from the infector, long-range transmission may occur when the infectee breathes in the virus-laden aerosols released by the infector or during physical contact with a fomite. However, the terminology and the defining features of each mode of respiratory virus transmission, especially regarding redefining the particle size threshold between droplets and aerosols, is under active discussion (see the section Terminology and defining features of modes of transmission).Full size imageTerminology and defining features of each mode of transmissionThe lack of standardization of terminology and the defining features of each major mode of respiratory virus transmission, in particular the difficulty to differentiate between ‘droplets’ and ‘aerosols’, has caused much confusion34. Although the direct contact route traditionally refers to transmission via direct physical contact between infectors and infectees6,7,9, some consider exposure to infectious (large) droplets as an additional form of contact transmission28,35,36, sometimes using the term ‘droplet contact’ to describe transmission via droplets37 and ‘direct contact’35 or ‘close contact’36 to describe transmission via both physical contact and exposure to droplets. The WHO uses ‘direct, indirect, or close contact’ to describe ‘contact and droplet transmission’, although it is unclear whether ‘close contact’ refers to transmission via droplets alone, direct (physical) contact alone or both38,39. Some attempted to define ‘close contact transmission’ by proposing three subroutes as ‘short-range airborne’, ‘large droplets’ and ‘immediate body-surface contact’ to describe transmission in close proximity, where the last refers to an infectee in contact with the infector’s immediate contaminated bodily surfaces (for example, skin and clothes), and is to be distinguished from the (distant) fomite route, which involves delayed and less frequent touching from a greater distance40. Some use ‘airborne’ to describe transmission via droplets and aerosols as both can travel through the air9, whereas others use it to describe transmission via aerosols only6,12,28,39,41.In the 1930s, William F. Wells, who studied air bacteriology and the transmission of respiratory tuberculosis, proposed that the particle size of exhaled respiratory droplets influences how they are transported in the air, and could be classified as ‘aerosols’ or ‘droplets’, with different implications to disease transmission42 (Box 3). Subsequently, animal studies, experimental volunteer studies and observational epidemiological studies were conducted to study the transmission of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus and influenza virus in homes and health-care settings43,44. In recent years, on the basis of different aspects of particle behaviours45, various particle size cut-offs, often in the range between 5 and 20 µm, have been used to differentiate particles as ‘aerosols’ or ‘droplets’. For example, the cut-off at 5 µm used by many regulatory bodies35,38 is based on early studies of pulmonary tuberculosis that believed particles smaller than 5 µm would deposit in the pulmonary/alveolar region of the lung by settlement and initiate infection, whereas particles larger than 5 µm deposit in the nasal cavity by centrifugal force28,46,47. Other studies put similar emphasis on the region of particle deposition in the human respiratory tract, and suggested that particles smaller than 10 µm reach and deposit in the pulmonary region12,45,48,49, and particles of size between 10 and 100 µm are inspired but deposit in the head airways or tracheobronchial regions49,50. Some consider particles smaller than 20 µm important for aerosol transmission as particles of 20 µm were estimated to take 4 minutes to settle on the ground from a height of 3 m, whereas particles smaller than 3 µm practically do not settle due to regular resuspension by air currents51.A recent workshop on the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 suggested referring to ‘aerosols’ as a stable suspension of solid and/or liquid particles in air, with a particle size cut-off set to an order of magnitude larger than previously thought (that is, ~30–100 µm), and ‘droplets’ as liquid particles that are larger than aerosols52. Some argued such dichotomization based on particle size alone has not accounted for the influence of expiratory activities on particle behaviour and proposed a turbulent gas cloud model to describe exhaled particle behaviour53. The model describes exhaled air as primarily a multiphase turbulent gas cloud (‘puff’) that consists of clusters of exhaled particles mixed with ambient air, where the particles have sizes on a continuous scale and are carried forwards by the momentum of expiratory activities53. The behaviour of exhaled particles is then influenced by conditions of both the ambient and the exhaled air, such as composition, temperature, humidity and airflow, highlighting the chance of larger droplets to be propelled further away than would be expected on the basis of particle size alone53,54.Box 3 Initial recognition of the importance of aerosols in disease transmissionEngineers coined the term ‘aerosol’ in the 1920s and defined it as a two-phase system consisting of a collection of solid or liquid particles and the gas in which they are suspended, exemplified by a wide range of products from combustion processes or meteorological phenomena such as dust, fume, mist and clouds, with particle size ranges from about 0.002 µm to more than 100 µm (in aerodynamic diameter)48. A related term, ‘bioaerosol’, describes aerosols of biological origin such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, fungal spores and pollen48. The term ‘aerosol’ is commonly used when ‘bioaerosol’ is actually meant; for example, the transmission of virus-laden aerosol particles is referred to as ‘aerosol transmission’. In the 1930s William F. Wells, who studied air bacteriology and the transmission of respiratory tuberculosis, proposed the differences between droplets and aerosols and their implications for transmission42. Wells suggested respiratory droplets expelled from the nose or mouth undergo evaporation, with smaller droplets evaporating almost immediately, while larger droplets (which may also be referred to as ‘drops’34) settle to the ground rapidly without much evaporation42. He therefore hypothesized that “Transmission of infection through the air may therefore take one of two forms, depending on the size of the infected droplet. The more obvious form, recognized by Flügge, is droplet infection proper. It applies to droplets larger than 0.1 mm in diameter, which are rapidly removed from the air by gravity before they can dry and within a short distance from the source. The second form may be called air-borne infection and deals with the dried residues of infected droplets, or droplet nuclei, derived directly from droplets less than 0.1 mm in diameter, depending primarily on air for the buoyancy that keeps them suspended for longer times and carries them longer distances”250. In the 1940s he subsequently demonstrated the use of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation to prevent airborne transmission of measles in schools196, and in the 1950s together with Richard L. Riley demonstrated the airborne transmission of tuberculosis168.Increased concern for aerosol transmissionTo many, bioaerosols (Box 3) pose particular concerns in transmission control. As bioaerosols can remain airborne for a prolonged period and travel through the air over long distances55,56,57,58,59,60, this potentiates disease transmission over long distances and therefore requires additional measures (for example, larger spatial separation between hospital beds28). Individuals with higher bioaerosol production might contribute to superspreading events61,62. Some hypothesize that the propensity of aerosol deposition in the lower respiratory tract45 might require a lower infectious dose and lead to severer disease. Volunteer challenge studies showed that influenza virus and adenovirus infection initiated by the inhalation of infectious bioaerosols required a lower infectious dose51,63,64, whereas rhinovirus might require a similar or a higher infectious dose51. Infection initiated by inhaling infectious influenza virus bioaerosols led to higher risk of fever compared with intranasal inoculation65, although some studies alternatively suggested that infection initiated by droplets leads to severer disease due to a higher infectious dose66. Alternatively, a narrower bottleneck of the minimum infectious virions required for transmission via aerosols may reduce virus diversity in the population and therefore the chance of a pandemic strain emerging67, whereas a wider bottleneck via the contact route may allow the propagation of minor variants, such as drug-resistant viruses68.Determinants of transmissionVirus, host and environmental factors influence whether a successful transmission occurs by governing the infectivity of the respiratory virus, the contagiousness of the infector, the susceptibility of the exposed individual and the environmental stress on the virus (Fig. 2). These determinants may have different relative effects on each mode of transmission69.Fig. 2: Viral, environmental and host determinants of respiratory virus transmission.Virus, environmental and host factors influence whether a successful transmission occurs by governing the infectivity of the respiratory virus, the contagiousness of the infected person, the environmental stress on the virus, which affects its persistence and survival during transmission, and the susceptibility of the exposed person.Full size imageViral determinantsThe propensity for respiratory viruses to be transmitted is affected by virus stability under environmental stress70,71, which in turn is influenced by the composition and structure of the virus envelope72,73, capsid74, internal proteins and genomes75 as well as the formation of viral aggregates76. For instance, DNA viruses such as herpesviruses (for example, varicella zoster virus (VZV)) with a more densely packaged genome have a stronger capsid structure that may prevent premature release of the viral genome before infection77. RNA virus genomes such as those of influenza virus have higher mutation rates, giving rise to diverse viral genomic variants (quasispecies) in infected individuals78, which may allow faster host adaptation of a virus strain that is efficiently transmitted via respiratory droplets79. In addition to virus stability, other viral factors, such as viral protein expression and modification, also influence transmission. Viral surface and internal proteins can affect transmissibility by determining the site of infection and interacting with specific host receptors with differing binding specificity and affinity. In studies of the pandemic potential of avian influenza viruses, human adapted haemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase subunit PB2, which exhibit a preferential binding to ɑ2,6-linked sialic acids and support viral genome replication in the lower-temperature environment of the mammalian airway, respectively, conferred efficient transmission over the respiratory droplet route in ferrets80. Similarly, an optimal ratio of HA to neuraminidase (NA) was essential for efficient transmission over the respiratory droplet route20, which is hypothesized to be associated with the release of single viral particles instead of aggregates with increased NA activity81. The loss of glycosylation sites at specific HA amino acid positions also conferred transmissibility to an avian influenza virus in a mammalian model82, thereby increasing its pandemic potential.Environmental determinantsEnvironmental determinants could, on one hand, affect transmissibility by influencing the survival and persistence of respiratory viruses in respiratory droplets or fomites after their release to the environment, or on the other hand, modulate transmission by modulating host factors such as viral shedding and human behaviour. These effects could differ across different transmission modes and settings, and may favour one mode over another. As demonstrated mostly for influenza virus, environmental factors that may affect virus survival include temperature, humidity, salinity, pH, the medium or materials of the contaminated objects or surfaces, ventilation, airflow and ultraviolet radiation83,84. Their effects on survival may differ between viruses85, and their effects on transmission may be assessed in animal, epidemiological or modelling studies86. Interestingly, although a higher temperature is usually associated with lower influenza virus survival, different studies have suggested that the association between influenza virus survival and relative humidity may follow a monotonic inverse or a U-shaped relationship13. For transmission, transmission risk assessment suggested non-fabric surface materials, compared with fabric surfaces, favour fomite transmission for RSV and rhinovirus but not for influenza virus in hospital rooms and aircraft cabins87. In guinea pig models, a cold and dry environment was shown to favour influenza virus transmission, with the contact route dominating at higher temperatures88. Alternatively, to explain the difference in seasonality of influenza virus circulation across regions with temperate, subtropical and tropical climates, ecological studies suggested that influenza virus transmission was favoured in a cold-and-dry climate if a lower threshold of humidity and temperature was reached; otherwise transmission was favoured in a humid-and-rainy climate when precipitation was greatest89. However, it was unclear how much was due to changes in virus survival, host susceptibility, indoor crowding or the dominant route of transmission89,90.Host determinantsHost determinants in both infectors and infectees could affect the propensity of transmission or the preferential routes of transmission. For infectors, tissue and cellular tropism for productive virus replication in the respiratory tract determines the site of release of virus progeny. Compared with SARS-CoV, which replicates mainly in alveolar epithelium, SARS-CoV-2 replicates extensively in both bronchial and alveolar epithelia, which, together with other factors, might explain its more efficient transmission91. Host viral shedding could determine the contagiousness of the infector. However, nasal or throat viral shedding alone was inadequate to explain influenza A virus transmission in households92, suggesting the importance of other host factors (for example, variability in symptom presentation93 or lung function94) that may lead to heterogeneity in contagiousness and partially explain the presence of superspreaders and superspreading events. For SARS-CoV-2, some studies showed presymptomatic viral shedding and transmission95, and similar levels of viral shedding96 in asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals, demonstrating substantial ‘silent’ presymptomatic transmission or transmission from a substantial fraction of infected individuals who are asymptomatic97 is possible. Pre-existing immunity98 and vaccination history93,99 may also modulate virus shedding in infectors. For infectees, tissue-specific expression of viral receptors100 or glycosylation and glycan expression101 along the respiratory tract determines the site of infection and may affect the preferential route of infection. Interestingly, despite the aerodynamic tendency of aerosols to deposit in the lower respiratory tract102, a preferential expression of ACE2 and the observation that virus-laden aerosols deposited mostly in the nose may indicate that virus-laden aerosols may initiate SARS-CoV-2 infection in the nasal cavity100. Although host genetics is suggested to modulate infection severity upon virus exposure, less evidence is available for its role in the transmissibility and modes of transmission of respiratory viruses103. At the population level, heterogeneous social contacts and age-related mixing patterns between infected and susceptible individuals drives transmission in specific groups or favours a particular route of transmission in different settings104.Evidence and relative importance of modes of transmissionVarious approaches, including environmental sampling, experimental animal and volunteer transmission studies, and epidemiological observations (mostly from outbreak investigations), have been used to provide evidence in support of each individual mode of transmission for different respiratory viruses, although for each, some may criticize their relevance6,7. Furthermore, although attempts have been made to classify each mode as ‘obligate’, ‘preferential’ or ‘opportunistic’15,50, limited research was done to quantify the relative importance of each mode to transmission9.Evidence supporting individual modes of transmissionThere are different types of evidence in support of individual modes of transmission of common respiratory viruses in humans (Table 1). For the direct (physical) contact and the fomite routes, experimental studies demonstrated the survival of respiratory viruses on surfaces, although higher viral doses than would usually be identified in natural settings are usually used105,106. Virus genetic material, and much less often infectious viruses, were recovered from patients’ hands or naturally contaminated objects in homes, workplaces, day-care centres, nursing homes and hospitals105,106,107. Experimental animal studies68,108 and limited experimental human109,110,111 or epidemiological112 studies were able to demonstrate disease transmission via fomites in the absence of direct contact, droplets and aerosols. For the droplet and aerosol routes, collection of exhaled breath from healthy individuals suggested human expiratory activities release respiratory droplet particles in a continuum of particle size, covering droplets or aerosols, via the mouth and nose. The particle sizes and their respective concentrations depend on the expiratory activities involved and the original sites of particle generation in the respiratory tract113. Although many recognize the generation of respiratory droplets and aerosols via talking, coughing and sneezing, additionally studies have demonstrated the exhalation of aerosols during normal breathing; such generation varies considerably between individuals94,113,114. Furthermore, studies showed that exhaled particles could contain respiratory viruses115. Viral RNA (for example, influenza virus, rhinovirus and coronavirus RNA) was recovered from both exhaled breath droplets and aerosols of symptomatic infected individuals93,99,115, but infectious virus has so far been only found in aerosols and not in droplets for influenza virus93,99,116. Experimental animal studies of influenza virus108, experimental human studies of rhinovirus117 and epidemiological studies of SARS-CoV118 have demonstrated transmission via respiratory droplets (including both droplets and aerosols); however, experimental animal studies of influenza virus23,119 and SARS-CoV-2 (ref.120), experimental human studies of Coxsackie virus63 (which belongs to the same family as rhinovirus) and epidemiological studies of influenza virus121 and rhinovirus122 have demonstrated that transmission likely occurs via aerosols. Epidemiological studies observed reduced SARS-CoV transmission associated with the use of masks and respirators in health-care settings123 and reduced influenza virus transmission after disinfection of room air by ultraviolet light124, suggestive of the role of aerosols and/or droplets in the transmission. Notably, few studies have demonstrated transmission via droplets only in the absence of aerosols, direct physical contact and fomites7,62.Table 1 Transmissibility of, modes of transmission of and transmission-based precautions for common respiratory viruses in humansFull size tableRelative importance of modes of transmissionVery few experimental human transmission or epidemiological studies have evaluated the relative importance of different modes of transmission in the same study25,117,125. In a human challenge transmission study of rhinovirus, the authors observed that droplet and aerosol routes alone were sufficient to allow rhinovirus transmission to occur, whereas transmission via fomites was not observed (in the article ‘aerosols’ probably refers to both droplets and aerosols)117. In a recent similar study of influenza virus25, by attributing its failure to achieve the targeted SAR to a higher ventilation rate when compared with an earlier proof-of-concept study126, the authors suggested aerosol transmission was more important than transmission via the large droplet and contact routes.Alternatively, the relative importance of different modes of transmission in different circumstances may be evaluated using mathematical mechanistic models, simulations and risk analyses; for example, outbreaks in aircraft36, on cruise ships127 and in health-care settings61 or during patient care128 (for example, in households49,129). By describing the efficiency of virus transfer at each step of a transmission route and coupled with a dose–response model with reference to the minimal infectious virus dose needed to initiate infection, one may estimate the relative infection risk between routes, thereby identifying the major transmission route in a particular circumstance. Furthermore, these approaches can also inform the likely values of the impact of individual determinants130 on each route, and the potential effectiveness of route-specific interventions such as face coverings128, and allow comparison of the major transmission modes between viruses36. However, a particular challenge for this approach is to identify the minimal infectious dose required for the virus to establish infection via a specific transmission mode.Aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virusHistorically, national and international agencies commonly consider respiratory viruses to be transmitted over the contact and/or droplet route, and exercise caution when one is considering the possibility of aerosol transmission28,131. However in recent years, more researchers have advocated the recognition of the importance of aerosol transmission12,132. The recent controversy regarding aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 reflects the perspectives and long-standing challenges in evaluating the relative importance of each mode of transmission for respiratory viruses.The report by the WHO–China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (ref.133) published on 28 February 2020 stated that “airborne spread has not been reported for COVID-19 and it is not believed to be a major driver of transmission based on available evidence; however, it can be envisaged if certain aerosol-generating procedures are conducted in health-care facilities”. The initial perception was that droplets and fomites were the major routes of transmission for SARS-CoV-2. However, as more data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission became available, on 27 March, the WHO published another scientific brief specifically on the modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission38. It described droplet transmission as transmission that occurs through infective respiratory droplets of diameter larger than 5 µm to 10 µm or fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person, and airborne transmission through infective droplet nuclei smaller than 5 µm (ref.38). Addressing the findings of SARS-CoV-2 remaining infectious in artificially generated aerosols for 3 hours or more134 and the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in a small number of air samples collected near symptomatic individuals with COVID-19 (refs135,136), the WHO continued to recommend droplet and contact precautions in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures (that is, airborne transmission was not considered to be a major route).On 6 July 2020, a group of 239 multidisciplinary scientists published an open letter advocating the recognition of potential airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (ref.132), citing the latest studies of SARS-CoV-2 as well as previous studies of influenza virus, coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses. These studies included mechanistic evidence showing generation of (non-virus-containing) aerosols from human expiratory activities113,137, infectious influenza virus in cough aerosols99,138, that exhaled droplets of 60–100 µm can be carried less than 1 m away by breathing and more than 2 m by coughing139, and survival of SARS-CoV-2 in artificially generated aerosols (the same study referenced by the WHO)134. Furthermore, these studies provided evidence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA140, or infectious RSV141, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus142 and SARS-CoV-2 (ref.143) in aerosols from the air near infected individuals. They also cited epidemiological observations of outbreaks or infection clusters of SARS and COVID-19, sometimes supported by additional modelling studies, which suggested transmission occurs mainly via aerosols. These studies included the large community outbreak of SARS in Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong59; clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a restaurant in Guangzhou54,144 and a shopping mall in Wenzhou145, China, and a choir in Skagit County, Washington, United States144,146,147; and a modelling study with tracer gas measurement to simulate the spread of exhaled respiratory droplets from the suspected index patient for the SARS-CoV-2 restaurant outbreak in Guangzhou148. Some argued149,150 that the current epidemiological data and clinical observations for COVID-19 do not support the letter’s claim of the importance of aerosols in SARS-CoV-2 transmission; for example, the lack of observed long-range transmission or observed increased risk of infection among health-care workers in the absence of airborne precautions150, which the authors of the open letter responded to151. On 9 July, the WHO issued a updated scientific brief39, citing some of the evidence described in the open letter132 and extensive subsequent evidence on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Addressing studies that identified low quantities of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the exhaled breath of infected individuals152 or in air samples collected from health-care facilities in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures140,153,154,155,156, the WHO commented these do not necessarily indicate a sufficient dose of infectious virus for transmission to occur157. Addressing outbreak reports54,147,158,159, the WHO acknowledged possible SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosols in indoor crowded spaces in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures, although transmission through droplets or fomites cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the WHO concluded that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily through direct, indirect or close contact with infected persons or their respiratory droplets that are expelled during coughing, sneezing, talking or singing, that transmission via fomites is likely and that transmission via aerosols is possible in indoor crowded spaces39.This is not the first time that the same evidence base has led different scientists or regulatory bodies to different conclusions on the importance of the aerosol route of transmission, with a similar discussion for influenza virus6,10,14,160, where there is evidence both for and against the importance of aerosol transmission. In support, infectious influenza virus was detected in aerosols in exhaled breath and coughs93,99 and in the air161, infectious aerosols could initiate infection in volunteers51,64, long-range transmission followed airflow162 and epidemiological studies showed increased transmission with less ventilation121 or decreased transmission with upper air disinfection by ultraviolet light124. Additional evidence includes influenza virus survival in artificially generated aerosols163, suggestive of infectiousness in aerosols in nature; however, this work has been criticized as being too artificial6, and influenza virus RNA recovery in the air in both community settings164 and health-care settings55,56,165 (even beyond 1.5 m from the source55,56) has been criticized because infectious virus was not identified. Some argued that there is insufficient evidence of influenza virus aerosol transmission6, such as evidence for infectious virus recovery far from the source, infection initiated by inhaling air from patient rooms, transmission over long distances, association between airflow and disease spread after removal of the source patient, and effectiveness of ultraviolet irradiation in reducing transmission; moreover, aerosol transmission is argued against as outbreaks in aircraft still occur despite their being well ventilated. Some researchers have explicitly considered that transmission via the aerosol route is essentially a long-range transmission6 and have argued that influenza virus transmission is mostly observed at close range and particularly with prolonged close contact. Importantly, some researchers have argued that since the goal of recognizing the importance of aerosol transmission is to minimize the risk of transmission in health-care settings by airborne precautions15, such recognition may be counterproductive due to resource limitations, logistics challenges and low compliance6.In summary, some researchers argued that the ability to be transmitted over long distances is a prerequisite for aerosol transmission6, as was shown for measles virus57,58, VZV166,167 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis168, the three respiratory pathogens that are widely accepted to be transmitted mainly via aerosols12. They also require evidence of transmission via aerosols in the absence of all other routes6. The latest WHO scientific brief on modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also reflects the emphasis of identifying infectious virus, and not viral RNA alone, in air samples39. However, although transmission over longer distances through the air is possible for some respiratory viruses57,166, this would require large numbers of viruses to be produced at the source and could be prevented by air dilution via ventilation or virus inactivation by environmental determinants. A failure to observe long-range transmission is therefore not evidence against aerosol transmission7, as it could also be explained by low rates of virus emission at the source or by effective dilution or inactivation. The observation that influenza virus viral load in aerosols decreased substantially with increasing distance from the source, possibly because of dilution of virus concentration further from the source56,169, suggests that if aerosol transmission does occur, it will occur mostly at close range and rarely at long range170. Furthermore, transmission via the droplet route in the absence of all other routes has yet to be observed (Table 1), raising the concern of the available evidence that supports placing relatively more emphasis on droplets over aerosols.Non-pharmaceutical interventionsAt the early stage of pandemics, virus-specific pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines and therapeutics are not available, and in resource-limited settings, such interventions are rarely readily available. Furthermore, owing to constant viral evolution, new viral strains emerge or resistance is gained such that pharmaceutical interventions can soon become outdated. Therefore, at the early stages of a pandemic, NPIs become the most important public health measures that individuals or communities can adopt to reduce respiratory virus transmission. Common NPIs include the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) or hygiene practices at the individual level, environmental disinfection or dilution at a systemic level, and social distancing measures at the community level, which reduce transmission by interfering with a single mode or multiple modes of transmission. In particular, in health-care settings, different NPIs constitute part of standard precautions or transmission-based precautions (that is, contact, droplet or airborne precautions) (Table 1), which represent different sets of practices and PPE that health-care workers adopt to lower the risk of nosocomial transmission. Although many NPIs have demonstrated mechanistically the ability to inactivate or reduce the amount of respiratory viruses in experimental or natural settings, the effectiveness of these NPIs in preventing infection at the individual level or mitigating transmission at the population level depends on a number of factors: the overall risk of transmission in a specific setting (for example, dining in restaurants versus playing sports outdoor) or population group (for example, health-care workers versus institutionalized individuals); the risk of transmission through the specific modes which the NPIs act on, and whether the virus could be transmitted via alternative modes after intervention; and individual adherence or population-wide adoption of the NPIs (Table 2).Table 2 Mechanistic evidence and effectiveness of common non-pharmaceutical interventionsFull size tablePPE and personal hygiene practicesHand hygiene: soaps and alcohol-based hand sanitizersSince Semmelweis first demonstrated in the 1840s that health-care workers, by adopting hand hygiene practices, reduced mortality in parturient women, hand hygiene has probably been the most widely adopted NPI for mitigating disease transmission (targeting the physical contact route) and is recommended as part of standard precautions for all patient care in health-care facilities171. Common hand hygiene practices used in health-care and community settings include handwashing with plain (non-antimicrobial) soaps or hand rub using alcohol-based hand sanitizers172 (Table 2). Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are useful in situations where sinks are not readily available, but are not recommended when hands are visibly dirty171. There is mechanistic evidence demonstrating bacterium or virus inactivation by hand hygiene173, and a number of systematic reviews of observational studies or randomized trials together suggest that hand hygiene alone is significantly associated with reducing respiratory illnesses; however, it is unclear whether hand hygiene is effective against laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections17,18,19, possibly due to insufficiently large study sample size or weak adherence to the intervention125,174.Face coverings: cloth masks, surgical masks, respirators, face shields and eye protectionSurgical face masks, face shields and eye protection are commonly used by health-care workers during routine patient care or when they are performing high-risk procedures as protection against splashes of bodily fluids or respiratory secretions, and respirators are commonly used as protection against aerosols15,131,175. In the community, the COVID-19 pandemic has not only led to community-wide adoption of surgical face masks; the extremely high demand has also resulted in (reusable) cloth masks being advocated as an alternative to surgical masks176. Apart from mitigating droplet and aerosol transmission, these face coverings might also reduce contact transmission by reducing the frequency of hands touching respiratory mucosa177. Mechanistically, face coverings can act either as protection against infection by reducing exposure to a virus when worn by a healthy individual or as source control by filtration93 and deflection when worn by an infected person178,179 (Table 2). On the basis of systematic reviews of observational studies123,180 and randomized trials16,18,123, many believe there is sufficient evidence supporting the effectiveness of the use of face coverings alone, or in combination with other NPIs, in reducing the risk of respiratory illness or virus transmission in health-care settings123,180 and high-risk community settings16, whereas some do not18. Mechanistic data from one study preliminarily suggest the effectiveness of surgical face masks may differ between viruses93. The relatively lower infection risk in the community compared with health-care settings, the requirement for fit testing and lower adherence argue against the use of respirators in the community181. Although surgical face masks as source control are likely applicable to most settings, as protection against infection they may have more utility in close encounters178 and crowded indoor settings; however, more research is needed. More research on the use of reusable masks, including cloth masks, in community settings either as source control or as protection is also urgently needed, including key parameters for assessment and standardization to address the diversity of materials available.Environmental disinfection and dilutionSurface cleaningSurface cleaning by disinfectants used in health-care settings182 or household cleaning agents183 (Table 2) mitigates transmission via the fomite route and might also block the droplet or aerosol route by reducing fomites available for resuspension due to various activities (for example, walking or door opening)184. Although supported by mechanistic evidence on virus inactivation, limited epidemiological studies have evaluated its effectiveness in reducing respiratory virus transmission17. One randomized trial in day-care nurseries suggested biweekly disinfection of toys significantly reduced the detection of adenovirus, rhinovirus and RSV, but not common cold coronaviruses, parainfluenza virus and bocavirus, in the environment; however, surface cleaning did not reduce the incidence of respiratory illness185, suggesting transmission may have occurred via routes other than the fomite route.Air dilution by ventilation and directional airflowVentilation and directional airflow, although usually used to provide thermal comfort and clean air, could also help in mitigating droplet and aerosol transmission by dilution, especially indoors. Ventilation is an intentional mechanical or natural introduction of outdoor air into a building (Table 2). Natural ventilation, if properly designed, is valuable especially in resource-limited settings, but can be used only in locations where climatic conditions are favourable186. The ventilation rate is usually described as either per building or per room as the number of air changes per hour, or per occupant in the space as outdoor air rate per person. The minimal ventilation required differs depending on the level of infection risk expected or protection needed; for example, six air changes per hour in patient rooms and 12 air changes per hour in airborne-infection isolation rooms187. Separately, directional airflow provides clean air from the cleanest patient care areas to less clean patient care areas. Although limited data demonstrate reduced virus recovery in the air with increased ventilation or the presence of directional airflow122, it has been suggested there is ‘strong and sufficient’ evidence supporting the association between ventilation and airflow patterns in buildings and transmission of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV, influenza virus, measles virus and VZV41,188, although this may require further validation by intervention studies or randomized trials86. Furthermore, directional airflow may reduce the risk of airborne infection in vulnerable individuals or nosocomial transmission in health-care settings187,189, and also in community settings (for example, aircraft cabins190). Some suggested that for high levels of virus exposure in crowded indoor areas, increasing indoor mechanical ventilation may be less effective or less cost-effective to achieve sufficient risk reduction191, and that it might increase aerosol dispersion and infection risk for individuals further away from the source190; an uninterrupted air stream from the source to the exhaust may then have a more important role in reducing transmission192.Air and surface disinfection by ultraviolet germicidal irradiationConcern over aerosol and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has renewed interest in the use of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI)193 — that is, the use of ultraviolet light in the germicidal range of wavelengths (200–320 nm) — for the disinfection of air and surfaces194. For air disinfection, upper-room UVGI and in-duct UVGI are usually used195 (Table 2). The use of UVGI to prevent airborne transmission was pioneered by Wells for the control of tuberculosis; Wells also demonstrated its use to prevent measles virus transmission in schools196. Upper-room UVGI was associated with reduced influenza virus infections among individuals with tuberculosis124. Surface disinfection with UVGI was initially used for bacterial decontamination197. Studies evaluating the inactivation of respiratory viruses on surfaces using UVGI in experimental settings198 are scarce and would be strengthened by studies using infectious virus recovery from naturally contaminated surfaces as the outcome measure. Randomized trials evaluating the effectiveness of UVGI for air or surface disinfection in reducing respiratory virus transmission are also lacking. Some proposed disinfecting surgical masks and respirators199 with UVGI to allow their reuse in resource-limited settings200. Although UVGI is not considered carcinogenic, its domestic use (for example, consumer products advertised for control of COVID-19) is cautioned against as it requires expert knowledge of the dosage required, and the efficacies of these consumer products are in doubt201.ConclusionsThe complexity of the control of respiratory virus transmission is reflected by the cross-disciplinary efforts to estimate the transmissibility of a respiratory virus, to evaluate the relative importance of modes of transmission and factors affecting transmission, to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of NPIs in different settings, and in turn how these translate to reduced transmissibility in the general and specific populations. Although population-based estimates of transmissibility (R0) could inform the combined effectiveness of multiple interventions in reducing transmission, the household-based estimates (SAR) in randomized trials could inform the effectiveness of individual interventions. As shown, relative transmissibility between respiratory viruses may be different depending on whether R0 or SAR is used to describe transmissibility, amid heterogeneities in estimates of the same virus (Table 1). Studies comparing the transmissibility of different respiratory viruses in parallel in the same study, perhaps in case-ascertained household studies, where study settings are more controlled, would be useful to identify which respiratory viruses are more transmissible than others.The controversies regarding the role of aerosols in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus highlight our very limited understanding on the relative importance of different modes of transmission. This includes the lack of consensus on the defining features of each mode of transmission, especially the difficulty in differentiating between droplets and aerosols; the different levels of scrutiny when evidence supporting each mode is being evaluated; the technical challenges in recovering infectious virus from the environment; the challenges in identifying the minimal infectious dose required to establish infection in susceptible or immunized individuals; and the lack of quantitative risk assessment for different modes of transmission. Given the different types of qualitative evidence available in support of individual modes of transmission (Table 1), discussion may be warranted in assigning priority or strength of evidence to these different types of evidence in support of each mode; for example, whether the demonstration of transmission via aerosols alone in the absence of other routes is essential to support the importance of the aerosol route, as suggested for measles virus57 and VZV166, but which was not done in support of the importance of the droplet route for RSV. These study designs may be possible for aerosols and fomites, but it will be more challenging to demonstrate transmission via direct contact and droplets in the absence of (close-range) aerosols. For rhinovirus, airborne precautions are not required despite the evidence of aerosol transmission in the absence of other routes63,117; in addition, as rhinovirus transmission has been demonstrated independently via direct contact202, fomite109 and aerosols63,117, efforts should be made to quantitatively evaluate the relative contribution of each mode to transmission and their determinants in different settings130. However, the relative contribution of different modes at the population level likely varies between different settings, populations and interventions in place, and at the individual level varies between individuals due to heterogeneity in contagiousness and susceptibility, which also changes over time. There is also minimal research on the modes of transmission of bocavirus and metapneumovirus (Supplementary Table 1). In general, there is a lack of studies demonstrating droplet transmission alone in the absence of other routes for all respiratory viruses (Table 1), and such studies are urgently needed to support the importance of droplets over aerosols and will have important implications for the choice of NPIs for mitigating transmission. Alternatively, aerosol transmission does not necessarily indicate a higher intrinsic transmissibility of the virus (Table 1) nor long-range transmission, as transmissibility depends on multiple factors, including the degree of presymptomatic transmission, the contagiousness of the infector, the susceptibility of the infectee, the contact patterns between them and the environmental determinants of transmission in the shared space; and long-range transmission depends on rates of virus emission at the source or effective dilution or inactivation by environmental determinants. Moving beyond deciding on the adoption of an NPI mostly on the basis of the perceived importance of a particular mode of transmission would provide an incentive for public health practitioners to recognize the importance of aerosol transmission.For common NPIs, although we have mechanistic evidence supporting their efficacy with regard to virus reduction or inactivation, we have limited knowledge of their effectiveness in reducing transmission in the population both in health-care settings and in community settings. This may be because we do not yet know the relative contribution of different modes of transmission in a particular setting and whether the different modes can partially compensate for each other if a mode is absent174. If the latter is true, studies evaluating the effectiveness of one intervention alone, which targets a specific mode, may underestimate its potential effectiveness because a reduction in transmission via a specific mode by the NPI might be compensated by transmission via another mode174. Given effectiveness is demonstrated, the eventual adoption of NPIs would also depend on the perceived severity of the disease15, the infection risk in a particular setting175,180, the accessibility of the resources, the purpose of interventions6 and the economic or societal costs of implementing the intervention. In particular, the choice of which transmission-based precautions to adopt for a particular respiratory virus in health-care settings depends on the perceived major modes of transmission for the pathogen15, the level of caution and the resources likely available if the recommendation is made15, and therefore could differ between countries. Intervening against multiple modes of transmission would be more effective than acting against a single mode. For example, although effectiveness of the use of face masks or hand hygiene alone in mitigating community transmission of laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection was not demonstrated, possibly due to various experimental challenges, their combined use has been shown to be effective in reducing influenza virus transmission and should be considered203. A clear public health message accounting for these uncertainties will help to gain public confidence and support public health efforts. ReferencesJames, S. L. et al.

Here we propose a consistent picture of the wave pattern based on the epidemic Renormalisation Group (eRG) framework, which is guided by the global symmetries of the system under time rescaling. We show that the rate of spreading of the disease can be interpreted as a time-dilation symmetry, while the final stage of an epidemic episode corresponds to reaching a time scale-invariant state. We find that the endemic period between two waves is a sign of instability in the system, associated to near-breaking of the time scale-invariance. This phenomenon can be described in terms of an eRG model featuring complex fixed points. Our results demonstrate that the key to control the arrival of the next wave of a pandemic is in the strolling period in between waves, i.e. when the number of infections grows linearly. Thus, limiting the virus diffusion in this period is the most effective way to prevent or delay the arrival of the next wave. In this work we establish a new guiding principle for the formulation of mid-term governmental strategies to curb pandemics and avoid recurrent waves of infections, deleterious in terms of human life loss and economic damage.

There is, however, no consensus on the origin of this pattern, which may originate from human behaviour rather than from the virus diffusion itself. Time-honoured models of the SIR type2 or others based on complex networks3,4,5 describe well the exponential spread of the disease, but cannot naturally accommodate the wave pattern. Nevertheless, understanding this time-structure is of paramount importance in designing effective prevention measures. Here we propose a consistent picture of the wave pattern based on the epidemic Renormalisation Group (eRG) framework6,7, which is guided by the global symmetries of the system under time rescaling. We show that the rate of spreading of the disease can be interpreted as a time-dilation symmetry, while the final stage of an epidemic episode corresponds to reaching a time scale-invariant state. We find that the endemic period between two waves is a sign of instability in the system, associated to near-breaking of the time scale-invariance. This phenomenon can be described in terms of an eRG model featuring complex fixed points8. Our results demonstrate that the key to control the arrival of the next wave of a pandemic is in the strolling period in between waves, i.e. when the number of infections grows linearly. Thus, limiting the virus diffusion in this period is the most effective way to prevent or delay the arrival of the next wave. In this work we establish a new guiding principle for the formulation of mid-term governmental strategies to curb pandemics and avoid recurrent waves of infections, deleterious in terms of human life loss and economic damage.As it emerged from the Spanish Influenza that hit the World in three consecutive waves between spring 1918 and the early months of 1919, virus-driven pandemics can feature a wave pattern, even though the origin of this behaviour is not understood1. The very recent pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is showing a similar pattern, with a first wave hitting in the spring of 2020, and following ones still raging various regions of the World. Reliable algorithms were used at the beginning of the pandemic to predict the evolution of the number of cases affected by the COVID-19 disease9,10,11, however it has proven difficult to predict the arrival of a second wave in the fall 202012. With the exception of a few countries like China, Vietnam and New Zealand, all regions of the World are suffering from multiple waves of COVID-19 infections.The diffusion of the virus can be described by various time-honoured models, like compartmental models of the SIR type2 and complex networks3,4,5. These mathematical frameworks account for the exponential growth of the number of new infected cases, and the slowing down of the spreading once most of the susceptible individuals are infected. However, it is not a simple task to generate a wave pattern. For instance, in SIR models, one could induce a second wave either by injecting by hand new individuals in the susceptible sub-population, or by including a probability that the removed individuals may return to the state of susceptible. The latter case cannot apply to the COVID-19, as very few cases of recovered individuals being infected again have been recorded.In an article first posted at the beginning of August13, we successfully predicted the occurrence of a second wave in Europe starting in September–October. The analysis is based on the eRG framework6, extended by interactions between various countries7. The approach is based on the analysis of the time evolution of the total number of infected cases and the symmetries that this epidemic curve reveals, allowing to extract reliable information from the data independently on the specific conditions met in each country. In fact, all the elements that can influence the velocity of the disease spreading are included in a single parameter, which contains the effect of local conditions, non-pharmaceutical interventions and socio-demographical characteristics. The eRG, therefore, can provide complementary information to studies that analyse in detail the effect of various measures14,15,16,17,18. As an example, the eRG framework has been used to study the effect of mobility reduction in Europe and the US during the first wave19, highlighting a universal time-frame of 2–4 weeks before an observable effect can be detected in the virus diffusion. For comparison, detailed studies of the mobility in the US20 have been able to identify the locations and events that foster the infection of new individuals and ignite hotspots.In this work we focus on the total number of infected cases, as this is the most reliable tracker of the time-evolution of the pandemics. In fact, other data, like the number of deaths and of hospitalisations, depend on factors like the age distribution and medical pre-conditions of the infected individuals, which can influence the delay between the infection and the time-stamp in the data. The master multiwave equation for the time-evolution of the total number of infected cases \(I_{j} (t)\) in a region j reads:$$\begin{aligned} - \beta _\text{multiwaves} (I_j) = \frac{1}{A_j} \frac{d I_j(t)}{\gamma _j\ d t} = \frac{I_j}{A_j} \left[ \left( 1 - \frac{I_j}{A_j} \right) ^2 - \delta _{j,0} \right] ^{p_{j,0}} \; \prod _{\rho =1}^w \left[ \left( 1-\zeta _{j,\rho } \frac{I_j}{A_j} \right) ^2 - \delta _{j,\rho } \right] ^{p_{j,\rho }} +\ \sum _l \frac{k_{jl}}{\gamma _j\ n_{m j}} \frac{ {I}_l - {I}_j}{A_j}, \end{aligned}$$ (1) where the first term on the right-hand side is a generalisation for \(w+1\) consecutive waves of the CeRG equations8 and the second term contains the interactions between regions7. Here, we will always consider the number of cases per million inhabitants in order to compare different regions. In the master equation, most of the parameters are explicitly independent on the normalisation, as \(I_j(t)\) always appears divided by the total number of cases at the end of the first wave, \(A_j\): the only exception is the interaction term, which also depends on the population of the regions (\(n_{m j}\) measures the population of region-j in millions). The parameters \(\gamma _j\) measure the effective velocity of the virus in each regions, and can be associated to an effective infection rate. This parameter can be eliminated from the equation by measuring the time in terms of a region-dependent scale, \(\tau _j = \gamma _j t\), once the couplings \(k_{jl}\) are also rescaled: \(\gamma _j\) can therefore be interpreted as a local time-dilation, characteristic of each region and taking into account all the non-pharmaceutical measures and local conditions in each region. These parameters can be extracted from the data at the beginning of the epidemic diffusion in each region, independently on the normalisation of the number of cases, which is very sensitive to the testing strategies21 changing during the pandemic. More details on the equations, and on the meaning of other parameters can be found in the Supplementary Information.The master equation (1) encodes the multiwave pattern in two ways: in the first term, the parameters \(\delta _{j,\rho }\) destabilise the fixed points at \(I_j (\tau ^*_\rho ) = A_j/\zeta _\rho\); in the second term, the interactions with other regions, or with an external source, can also destabilise the system and drive a new growth of \(I_j\) towards the next fixed point. In fact, for \(\delta _{j,\rho } = 0\), the number of infected will grow until \(I_j (\tau _\rho ^*) = A_j/\zeta _\rho\), where the growth stops because of the vanishing of the beta function. This is a steady-state, independent of time, which signals the end of the infection. For \(\delta _{j,\rho } < 0\), the zero is moved on the complex plane and cannot be reached, thus driving an endemic state with linear growth, which we call strolling in honour to the application of this formalism in high energy physics8. The second term has been used13 to predict the European second wave of September 2020, where \(k_{jl}\) was associated to an estimated number of travellers between each country. In general, both effects are expected to be present: as we will see, the instability due to \(\delta\) provides a maximal delay for the arrival of the next wave, which is directly related to the number of new cases recorded during the strolling period between waves. The presence of a large interaction can induce an early arrival of the new wave.Thus, effective measures to prevent and control the next wave of a pandemic like COVID-19 can only go via a strict control of the number of cases inside the country or region, combined to effective tracking of new infected individuals traveling in. This is precisely the strategy followed by China, Vietnam and New Zealand, leading to an early extinction of the disease and the absence of a second wave.ResultsFigure 1Illustration and validation of the CeRG multiwave model. The panel (a) shows sample solutions of the CeRG multiwave equation for \(w=1\), with \(\delta _1 = 0\), so that the epidemic episode is extinguished after two waves. The total number of cases, normalised to the first peak, is shown in solid, while the normalised new cases are shown in dashed. In the panel (b) we show the dependence of the delay between the two peaks of new infections, \(\Delta \tau _\text{peak}\) measured in the local time, as a function of \(S_\text{t}\). The CeRG parameters are fixed to the following values, unless specified: \(p_0 = 0.5,\ p_1 = 0.65,\ \zeta _1 = 0.5\). Panel (c) shows the CeRG model applied to the second and third wave in Japan (blue) as compared to the data (red) and the eRG fits of the two waves (orange). In panel (d) we show the value of the geographical uniformity indicator as defined in the text for a sample of countries, showing that the virus is more equally spread in the various regions during the second wave, in most cases.Full size imageThe CeRG multiwave model, corresponding to (1) without the interaction terms, can be used to effectively describe a pandemic episode in multiple subsequent waves. To illustrate the model, in the top panels of Fig. 1 we show some features of the solutions for an isolated region with only two waves, corresponding to \(w=1\) and \(\delta _1 = 0\). The latter condition ensures that the epidemic is extinguished after the second wave. All results are shown for number of cases normalised to the first wave, and expressed in the local time \(\tau = \gamma t\). Panel (a) shows three solutions (solid lines) together with the corresponding new cases (dashed lines), for three values of \(p_0\). We can clearly see the two-wave structure emerging in the solution, the fact that the second peak tends to be flatter than the first (for \(\zeta _1 = 1/2\)). Furthermore, larger values of the exponent \(p_0\) tend to delay the second peak and flatten it. An important factor in controlling the arrival of a future wave is the number of new cases during the intermediate strolling phase, which we encode in the parameter$$\begin{aligned} S_\text{t} = \left. \frac{1}{A \gamma } \frac{d\ I}{d\ t} \right| _\text{strol}, \end{aligned}$$ (2) normalised to the total number of infected cases after the first wave, A, and expressed in terms of the local time. For the CeRG multiwave model in Eq. (1), the parameter \(S_t\) for each interwave period can be expressed as$$\begin{aligned} S_{t,k} = (-\delta _k)^{p_k} \prod _{\rho \ne k} (1-\zeta _\rho )^{p_\rho }, \end{aligned}$$ (3) for the strolling phase after the kth wave. This is a crucial parameter in controlling the timing of the second wave, as illustrated in panel (b) of Fig. 1 where we show the peak delay \(\Delta \tau _\text{peak}\) (in local time) as a function of \(S_\text{t}\). For \(S_\text{t} \rightarrow 1\), the delay goes to zero as the two waves merge into a single one, while it grows for smaller values following a power law that depends on \(p_0\). The peak delays also depend strongly on \(\zeta _1\), which encodes the height of the second peak, being more delayed for decreasing \(\zeta _1\): for values above 0.8, however, the second wave becomes too small, thus the solution looses physical relevance.To connect the result in Fig. 1b to a specific country or region, it is enough to fit the values of A and \(\gamma\) from the current wave, and appropriately rescaling the values of \(S_t\) and \(\Delta \tau _\text{peak}\): the delay in real time is \(\Delta t_\text{peak} = \Delta \tau _\text{peak}/\gamma\) while the new daily number of cases during the strolling is \(A \gamma S_t\). In the left panel of Fig. 2 we provide a template for a countryegion with \(A=50,000\) and \(\gamma = 0.1\) (inverse days). The band, which can be considered an error on the prediction, comes from varying \(p_0\). This plot shows that controlling the number of daily new cases during the endemic strolling phase below 10 could be enough to push the next wave peak beyond 40 weeks. In the right panel we show the same plot for 5 European countries, obtained by fitting the epidemiological data of the current wave.Comparing the predictions of the CeRG multiwave model to data is not an easy task: in fact, the number of detected infections, collected via the positivity of the tests done in each country, depends crucially on the number of tests done each day21 and on the specific testing policy adopted over time. For instance, during the first wave, many countries did fewer tests while focusing on hospitalised cases, while a more extensive testing campaign occurred starting in the summer months. As a consequence, quantities that depend on the number of cases, like the delay between peaks, cannot be computed accurately as a bias between two waves is present in the data. We, therefore, will apply the model to the second wave and following ones. As an example, in panel (c) of Fig. 1 we show the data for Japan compared to a scenario based on the CeRG multiwave model. Japan is an ideal candidate for this model since, being an island, the frontiers can be well-controlled, and one can consider the country as an isolated system. Furthermore, the second wave has already ended, followed by a two-month period of strolling with around 450 new infected cases detected each day. The CeRG model, shown in blue, provides a good quantitative and qualitative description of the data, and predicts that the third wave will peak at the beginning of December and be slightly higher than the second (\(\zeta _1 = 0.4\)). Between the first and second waves, instead, no significant strolling was observed. This scenario could be interpreted in the following way: after the first wave, the virus diffusion was strongly limited by the enacted measures. However, new infected cases may have entered the country from abroad and/or spontaneous emergence of local hotspots inside the country (parametrised by the k-interactions). After the second wave, the virus kept spreading geographically within the population triggering at a later stage the third wave. The latter phase can be described by the CeRG model, while the transition between the first and second wave is due to external interactions. We do not attempt to unify the three waves because of the bias in the counting.Testing the geographical diffusion of the virus in each country can provide useful indications on the mechanism behind each wave. For this purpose, we define a uniformity indicator, \(\chi ^2\), which encodes how far is the distribution of new cases in regions of the country from a completely flat one. Smaller values of \(\chi ^2\) indicate a more uniform distribution. For Japan, we considered the new cases in the various prefectures (where we exclude Okinawa for the geographical distance from the mainland) during the first and second waves, as shown in red in Fig.1d. The second wave has a larger \(\chi ^2\), which could be interpreted as more localised diffusion due to hotspots or travellers returning to their home cities. We also report the indicator for the month of November, which we would expect to be reduced if the strolling plays an important role in creating the third wave. The result is too preliminary, as Japan is still far from the peak of the third wave and the indicator is found to be minimised at the peak.Having validated the CeRG approach, we can now apply it to understand and predict the next wave in various regions of the World. As a caveat, we should recall that the interactions between regions and the presence of hotspots can also affect the results and anticipate the insurgence of the next wave.Figure 2Strolling control to delay the next wave. Delay of the next peak (in real time weeks) as a function of the strolling severity, expressed in terms of the daily number of new infected cases per million inhabitants (\(A \gamma S_t\)). In the right panel, we show the results for the CeRG model applied to France, Italy, the UK, Germany and Spain. In the left panel we show the result for a template country with \(A=50,000\) and \(\gamma = 0.1\). The band is given by varying \(p_0\) between 0.5 and 0.6.Full size imageTable 1 Numerical results for the eRG fit of the current wave and the CeRG forecast for the next wave. Columns 2 and 3 contain the results for the fit of the current wave using the eRG model6, where A is given in number of cases per million inhabitants and \(\gamma _\text{eRG}\) in inverse days. The current wave corresponds to the second one for all countries, except for South Africa, Bolivia and Saudi Arabia for which it is the first. In the last three columns we show the expected peak dates (within a 1 week error) of the current and next waves and the expected value of the number of daily new cases per million inhabitants \(I'_\text{strol}\) during the inter-wave strolling period. Except for Australia, South Africa, Bolivia, Saudi Arabia, Japan and South Korea, we fix \(S_\text{t} = 0.01\), \(p_0 = 0.55\), \(p_1 = 0.6\) and \(\zeta _1 = 1/2\), while \(\gamma\) and \(A_0\) are chosen to fit the second wave (first for South Africa, Bolivia, Saudi Arabia). For countries currently in the strolling period, all the parameters of the CeRG model are fitted.Full size tableFigure 3Strolling as a precursor of a COVID-19 third wave. Most European countries are still undergoing a second wave of COVID-19. In this figure we show how a strolling period, consistent on a fixed number of new infections per day (indicated in each panel) could lead to a third wave, as indicated by the solid band. The prediction corresponds to \(S_\text{t} = 0.01\), and is compared to the data (adjourned to November 23) and the eRG fit from Table 1 (dashed orange). The plot includes France, Italy, Germany and the UK.Full size imageFigure 4Strolling as a precursor of a new COVID-19 wave. The top panels shows Spain and Denmark, while the remaining European countries included in this study are shown in the Supplementary Information. In the bottom panels we show two sample countries from other regions of the World. In both cases, currently the epidemic is in the strolling regime after the first wave, indicating an imminent restart of the epidemic. In cases with an ongoing strolling, \(S_t\) is fitted to reproduce the data.Full size imageEurope: Most of the European countries are being hit by a second wave of the COVID-19. A general trend we observe is that the infection rate during the second wave is smaller than the one of the first wave, as shown by the values of \(\gamma _\text{eRG}\) in Supplementary Table T1 in the Supplementary Information. The comparison is done by fitting the two waves independently by use of the eRG model. Moreover, the expected cumulative number of infected cases during the second wave is much larger than that for the first wave, even taking into account the higher number of tests performed during the second wave. The emergence of the second wave was explained as arising from the interactions between countries13, nevertheless the presence of strolling between the two waves indicates that both effects participated. The decrease of the geographical uniformity indicator, shown in Fig. 1d, indicates that the strolling had an important role in diffusing the virus across the countries (for England, the uniformity was present since the first wave). The geographical diffusion may also be the reason behind the fact that the second wave has infected a larger portion of the population.The CeRG model cannot be applied straightforwardly to the first two waves, due to the uncertainty in their relative normalisation, while it can be used to estimate when a third wave will hit starting from the data of the current (second) wave. The result is shown in Table 1, and in Fig. 3 and the top row of Fig. 4 (additional plots are provided in the Supplementary Information). The timing of the next wave peak depends crucially on the time-dilation parameter \(\gamma\), and on the amount of strolling in the intermediate endemic phase: in the projections, we fitted \(\gamma\) to reproduce the second wave and fixed \(S_\text{t} = 0.01\), with the corresponding total number of new cases, expected during the strolling, reported in the figures. The last column of Table 1 shows that a wide range of peak timings are expected, ranging from March to November 2021, where we associated an error of 1 week to the projection due to a variation of 10% in the infection rate. These results show clearly that controlling the infection rates and reducing the level of strolling after the end of the second wave are keys to delaying the next wave. Another element that should be included is the number of travellers across various countries13, which can help propagate the wave from country to country, thus affecting the ones with pronounced delayed projections.In the right panel of Fig. 2 we show the delay between the current and next waves (in weeks) for 5 European countries, as a function of the daily number of new cases during the strolling. Thus, to delay the next wave peak beyond 40 weeks from the current one, it would suffice to keep the number of new cases below 10 per day. Delays beyond 20 weeks can be obtained with 100 new cases per day per million inhabitants. France has comparatively larger delays due to the smaller \(\gamma\) obtained from the data.The US: The US has already seen two waves in April and July–August, and is undergoing a third. However, the first two waves are geographically distinct, with the episode in April mainly involving New York and New England, and the second spreading all over the remaining states. This is well illustrated by the geographical uniformity indicator in Fig. 1d, which sharply drops between the two episodes. The third point, based on the data of November, is still preliminary and will decrease as the third wave approaches its peak. To analyse the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US, a dedicated study which takes into account sub-regions is required. The uniformity analysis suggests that the first two episodes should be described in terms of interactions between states, while the third one may be originated by the strolling. Results of this analysis and projections for the future waves in the US will be presented in a separated article22.Other countries: We included in our analysis a selection of countries for other regions of the World, selected in order to represent all continents. Note that we retained only countries for which the multiwave analysis is best explained in terms of the CeRG model, i.e. where diffusion of the virus in sub-regions do not produce features that would require a multi-region analysis. The latter situation can be tackled within coupled CeRG equations, but this analysis goes beyond the scope of the present work.In Table 1 we show the results for the selected countries, also illustrated in the bottom row of Fig. 4 for South Africa and Saudi Arabia. In most selected cases, the country is in the strolling regime, following the end of the first or second wave, thus allowing us to tune the CeRG parameters to reproduce the strolling and give a more reliable forecast for the following wave. In some cases, like South Africa, the high level of strolling indicates that a new wave is imminent. As we are not trying to perform a fit, due to the many uncertainties in the social distancing and testing policies, the scenario we present should be considered as a probable one. Yet, it should be noted that the model does not leave much room to modify the expected number of total infected cases during the future wave nor change the timing substantially, without drastic pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions.DiscussionWe provide a mathematical understanding of the wave pattern for pandemics, like the COVID-19 one. The approach is employed to forecast the timing of a future wave based on the number of new infections during the intermediate endemic phase. The timing of the new wave is related to a newly introduced parameter, \(S_t\), that can be easily deduced from the cumulative number of infected cases. We studied several countries in different regions of the World and, in absence of any pharmaceutical interventions, we estimate the timing of the next wave of infections. We found countries where a new wave will start in December 2020, like South Africa, and countries where it could start as late as October 2021, like in France. Our predictions will be affected by the border control regulations with the generic effect of inducing an early increase in the number of infections.Our understanding of the wave structure of the COVID-19 pandemic draws the attention to the inter-wave strolling period. We discover that controlling the number of new infections during the strolling period is necessary to delay the beginning of a future wave. This amounts to imposing social distancing measures and break potential chains of infections after the end of the wave in order to keep \(S_t\) as low as possible. Delaying the next wave is crucial in order to have enough time to realise an effective vaccine campaign.Our results can effectively guide policymakers to time (non)pharmaceutical interventions to delay or reduce the impact of future COVID-19 waves. Until now, most measures are taken when the number of new infected cases has already grown substantially. At this point in time one can only contain the wave, not avoid it, with serious impact for the loss of human lives as well as the economy. We prove that intervening during the strolling period of endemic diffusion is essential to delay or avoid a new wave while buying time for pharmaceutical interventions, like an effective vaccine campaign. More specifically, to maximise the delay, the strolling parameter must be kept small, \(S_t \approx 10^{-5}\) for an optimal use of the enacted measures. In most countries, this implies that the number of new cases at the end of the wave should be kept at the level of 10 cases per million inhabitants per day. This effect can be achieved by keeping or introducing new measures after the end of the wave, in the form that is more appropriate for the local conditions. ReferencesTaubenberger, J. K. & Morens, D.

In a recent study, Bai et al. reported that preinfection of influenza A virus enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, calling for the development of a pan-flu-COVID-19 vaccine to combat infection of IAV, SARS-CoV-2, or their coinfection.The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, may become even more serious by the emergence of variants with altered transmissibility, pathogenesis, and virulence, or a combination, under evolutionary pressure. In addition, antibodies in COVID-19 convalescents or vaccinees may drive SARS-CoV-2 to further adapt and mutate into escape variants. It is anticipated that COVID-19 may transit into endemicity like seasonal flu and the common cold caused by other human coronaviruses (HCoVs).1 This is a matter of concern on the combined effect of coinfection between SARS-CoV-2 and other common viruses, especially the influenza A virus (IAV), which causes respiratory symptoms similar to some coronaviruses.In a recent report in Cell Research, Bai et al.2 found that cells, whether susceptible or not to SARS-CoV-2, became significantly more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 after infection with IAV (A/WSN/1933(H1N1)). In addition, coinfection of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 in mice resulted in increased viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and more severe lung damage. These findings are consistent with results from other groups. For instance, Yuen and colleagues also found that simultaneous or sequential coinfection by SARS-CoV-2 and IAV (A/H1N1/pdm09) caused more weight loss, more severe lung inflammatory damage, and increased tissue cytokine/chemokine expression when compared to infection by either virus alone in hamsters.3 In addition, sequential infection with IAV (A/HKx31(X31, H3N2)), followed by SARS-CoV-2, leads to more severe lung damage and encephalitis, while exacerbating extrapulmonary manifestations in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice.4 The similarity of findings in these different animal models portends that coinfection of IAV and SARS-CoV may also cause more severe disease in human. Therefore, potential coinfection of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 should be a driver of increased clinical awareness.Bai et al.2 also found that other respiratory viruses, such as human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human parainfluenzavirus (HPIV), and human rhinovirus 3 (HRV3), did not appear to promote SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus providing a tentative diagnostic basis for pathogen co-monitoring, alongside SARS-CoV-2, in the clinic. This study also reported that the auxo-action of IAV to SARS-CoV-2 infection may come from the elevated ACE2 expression induced by IAV (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infectivity induced by IAV infection is independent of interferon (IFN) signaling although ACE2 has been reported to be an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) in human airway epithelial cells.5 The addition of IFNα even significantly inhibited pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cells susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that IFN may have contradictory functions of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection and increasing its infection by promoting the expression of ACE2, among which the inhibitory effect may be more dominant in these cell lines. If confirmed, such pathway could serve as a therapeutic target to block the synergistic effect of IAV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection.Fig. 1: Schematic diagram of auxo-action of IAV to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the mechanism of action of a pan-flu-COVID-19 vaccine.The infection of IAV can enhance the expression of ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, on host cells, resulting in more SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells for coinfection. Inoculation of a pan-flu-COVID-19 vaccine can induce neutralizing antibodies against both IAV and SARS-CoV-2, which can protect host from the infection by divergent IAVs, SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, or IAV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection.Full size imageOddly, however, the 2020 flu season did not bring an increased mortality of COVID-19. According to the data from UK, the number of flu sufferers in England plunged by > 95% to levels not seen for 130 years because of lockdowns and new health habits due to the COVID-19 epidemic.6 This could explain why further surges of COVID-19 were not seen as a result of IAV coinfection. Nonetheless, as vaccination increases and restrictions relax, we may experience COVID-19 transition to endemicity, making it essential to develop a pan-flu-COVID-19 vaccine to prevent IAV infection, SARS-CoV-2 infection, or IAV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection.Successful combined vaccines have been developed, e.g., Tdap vaccine (for adult tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis) and MMR vaccine (for measles, mumps and rubella). Nevertheless, IAV contains many subtypes, and new HxNy IAVs may emerge in the future.7 It has been recently reported that the first human case of H5N8 avian influenza occurred in Russia.8 Therefore, a pan-flu-COVID-19 vaccine needs to contain a pan-IAV vaccine. For example, we and collaborators have found that a 2’,3’-cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP)-based adjuvant can boost the ability of the IAV H1N1 vaccine to elicit strong cross-protection against distant IAV H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 strains.9 Therefore, we hypothesized the possibility of developing a pan-flu-COVID-19 vaccine by combining a seasonal flu vaccine, a licensed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and a cGAMP analog as an adjuvant. Our most recent study has also shown that the neutralizing antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 RBD linked with a human IgG Fc fragment (RBD-Fc) could cross-neutralize infection by SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.10 These findings suggest the possibility of designing a pan-flu-COVID-19 vaccine by combining a seasonal flu vaccine, an RBD-Fc-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and a cGAMP analog as an adjuvant, which could be further developed for prevention of infection by divergent IAVs, SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, or IAV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection (Fig. 1).

(Jeff Walters/CBC)Social SharingThe Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre (TBRHSC) has a guide for the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally written in 2005, the Pandemic Influenza Plan was updated in 2017 and could provide a framework for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.The guide states "...the planning assumptions have been updated to set the best course of action in an uncertain environment by identifying, assessing, acting on and communicating risks."The hospital's Pandemic Influenza Plan states "...this plan should be considered a 'living document' as it will be updated with new information as further details are considered."'Everything is going in the right direction': Thunder Bay hospital provides update on COVID-19 casesThunder Bay hospital increasing access to priority surgeryThe 92-page document is a far ranging guide touching on a number of areas dealing with the hospital's planning approach, assumptions and processes. According to the guide, these essential planning components include: Pandemic planning assumptions (i.e., course of a pandemic, extent and severity of illness, access to vaccines and antivirals). Internal and external pandemic and emergency response planning structures. Ethical framework (e.g., decision-making principles, core ethical values). Legislative authority. The Pandemic Influenza Plan states the "...spread of influenza will be primarily through the community from person-to-person rather than in a healthcare setting ... a pandemic wave will sweep across Canada in 1-2 months affecting multiple locations simultaneously ... the influenza pandemic will occur in two or more waves. In any locality, the length of each wave of illness will be 6 to 8 weeks and the influenza pandemic will last 12 to 18 months and more than one wave may occur within a 12-month period."The Pandemic Influenza Plan lays out a number of scenarios based on an estimated population of 146,048 for the Thunder Bay District based on the 2016 census. The plan provides three different attack rates of 15%, 25% and 35%. Using the worst-case scenario of 35%, over 51,117 will be ill enough to stay at home. Of those people 20,932 can manage the illness through self-care, 29,051 will require an outpatient visit to the hospital and 1,082 will be admitted to hospital. Within the 35% attack rate scenario there will be 173 fatal cases. Under an attack rate of 15%, the plan projects the number of deaths at 74 cases.The Pandemic Influenza Plan also outlines its role in the event of a pandemic. The hospital does not act alone and as the plan notes "...the Canadian pandemic planning framework includes coordination and collaboration among government and jurisdictions at all levels: internationally, nationally, provincially, and locally." The plan goes on to further say "each level of government has different roles and responsibilities depending on their jurisdictional authority."In Thunder Bay, one of the other key organization during a pandemic is the Thunder Bay District Health Unit, and within the plan there are numerous references to the health unit.Thunder Bay District Health Unit pandemic plan'Terrible sadness': Company confirms 25 COVID-19 cases, including 1 death, connected to Lac des Iles mineUnder the Infection Control Practices section of the Pandemic Influenza Plan, there is an explanation of the risk assessment the hospital will use to ensure that all employees are protected, including the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). The plan states that "...TBRHSC will have/has a stockpile of PPE such as gloves, gowns and N95 masks to last four weeks in a pandemic. The province will provide another four weeks supply once that supply is exhausted."The pandemic plan states shortages are possible, and to be expected, depending on the pandemic.If a shortage were to exist, the hospital is to prioritize PPE for staff as follows as listed in the Pandemic Influenza Plan: Care for patients with active pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis. Aerosol-generating procedures on patients with influenza. Resuscitation of patients with influenza (emergency intubation, CPR). Care of patients with influenza-related pneumonia and other complications of influenza, if the person is still thought to be contagious. Dr. Stewart Kennedy heads up the COVID-19 response team at the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre. (Nicole Ireland/CBC)Dr. Stewart Kennedy, who heads up the TBRHSC's COVID-19 response team, told CBC News the facility has a supply of face shields, goggles, surgical masks and gloves that will last several months.In an earlier statement, Kennedy also noted that the hospital is already preserving its N95 masks, which may be sterilized and reused.The Pandemic Influenza Plan states "...hygiene and Personal Protective Equipment may be the only significant preventive measures available, particularly early in a pandemic."The pandemic plan also states an off-site assessment facility would be set up, so patients would not be showing up at the emergency department.That facility is designated as the 55-Plus Centre on River Street, which would be followed by other assessment centres at the West Thunder Community Centre and Current River Rec Centre.The plan itself also calls for Public Health Ontario labs, as well as the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg to analyze testing samples to confirm cases of the pandemic virus.Face masks becoming mandatory at Thunder Bay hospital this weekCOVID-19 test results in Kenora available within 48 hoursIn order to deal with the expected increase in hospitalization of cases due to the pandemic, the hospital also looks at its current capacity and how it will deal with a surge in patients.In the 2017 Pandemic Influenza Plan, the TBRHSC states it has 386 beds, included in that count are 26 negative pressure rooms. These types of rooms are the preferred location for any influenza patients as air from the room is vented to the outside rather than back into the corridors.The plan says that once negative pressure rooms become full, pandemic influenza patients will be placed into private rooms.The pandemic plan warns that "...the TBRHSC operates already at full capacity with little accommodation for surge capacity," so the hospital's plan includes information on how it would increase physical capacity. As outlined in the Pandemic Influenza Plan, those measure include: Defer any services for non life- or limb cases where no severe adverse health consequences are anticipated from the delay. Discharge Alternate Level of Care (ALC) patients to Long-Term Care homes when beds are immediately available. Discharge acute inpatients to home care when care can be provided safely in that environment. Discharge acute patients to family and self-care when care can be provided safely in that environment. Deploy freed-up beds for influenza patients. Cohort infectious patients and non-infectious patients. Cohorting of infectious (influenza) patients will take place on the "B" pods. Patients in the ICU would be re-assessed every four hours to see if they could be moved off of the unit.The 2B unit would be the first to be utilized, followed by 3B. Currently, the dedicated COVID-19 unit is on 3A.The Occupational Health and Safety section of the Pandemic Influenza Plan, deals with the health and safety of both healthcare workers and those for whom they care. The plan states no vaccine for a virus would be available during the first phase of the pandemic, however it may be available for the second.In line with the lack of a vaccine until later in the pandemic, the hospital notes that it keeps a 60-day stockpile of antiviral medications on hand. While that medication would not prevent the virus from taking hold of patients, it may reduce the length of stay required, freeing up beds if needed.Staffing is another area considered under the pandemic plan.To accommodate staffing shortages, the TBRHSC keeps a record of its retirees from the past five years, along with their skill sets, and would call past employees to assist in the pandemic.Even current staff, who may be considered unfit for work due to an illness could also be called in during an extreme shortage to provide care.Criteria for COVID-19 testing expanded at Thunder Bay hospitalThunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre to have separate COVID-19 ward ready in 3 to 5 daysOne of the final sections of the hospital's Pandemic Influenza Plan deals with assessment and treatment. Within that section of the plan, it deals with emergency services at the TBRHSC which will likely be challenged due to increased volumes of going to the emergency department, and how the hospital will handle critical care triage."It is important to note that critical care triage is NOT the same triage as routinely practiced in the emergency department," the plan noted.Under the Pandemic Influenza Plan three key principles are listed when it comes to critical care triage: All patients will be cared for. This does not mean that all patients will receive critical care services, but will ensure that those not appropriate will still be cared for at an alternate level of care. Triage protocol will ensure that the criterion is clear and transparent and will protect individuals from inequities. Critical care triage is not a first step towards rationing under ordinary circumstances and will be used only under extraordinary circumstances. The hospital's pandemic plan goes into further detail about its inclusion and exclusion criteria, meaning the plan helps "...identify those patients that may benefit from admission to critical care and those that will not.""Inclusion criteria are based primarily on respiratory failure because the ability to provide ventilator support is what differentiates the ICU from other areas of the hospital."According to the Pandemic Influenza Plan, the exclusion criteria are divided into three categories: People with a poor prognosis/chance of survival even when treated aggressively in an ICU. People that will need a level of resource that can't be met during a pandemic. People with underlying significant and advanced medical illnesses whose underlying illness has a poor prognosis with high short-term mortality even without their current concomitant critical illness.

The story has been updated with exact wording from the 2017 Pandemic Influenza Plan. A previous version of this story also stated that patients with a poor prognosis being admitted to hospital would be left to die. In fact, that is not stated in the plan nor did CBC Thunder Bay practice due diligence in reaching out to the hospital for clarification on any aspect of the 92 page document.Mar 15, 2021 1:51 PM ETABOUT THE AUTHORJeff WaltersFormer CBC reporter Born and raised in Thunder Bay, Jeff worked in his hometown, as well as throughout northwestern Ontario.

Part of the The Coronavirus Update series March 25, 2021 4 min read Collins English Dictionary, Merriam-Webster Dictionary, and the Oxford English Dictionary, the three main English-language dictionaries, added social distancing to their lists last year, a product of the coronavirus pandemic that swept the globe in 2020. But the practice of “maintaining a greater than usual physical distance” goes back to the 14th century, when ships arriving to Venice during an outbreak of the Black Death were forced to quarantine, or sit at anchor, for 40 days. The measure aimed to protect the city from the bubonic plague, which killed an estimated 25 million people in Europe. It may have been the earliest public health measure ever recorded, said David Jones, M.D. ’01, Ph.D. ’01, the inaugural A. Bernard Ackerman Professor of the Culture of Medicine, Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Faculty of Medicine. But there may have been even earlier measures, as suggested by biblical accounts of communities expelling people with leprosy from their towns and villages. “Humans have been dealing with epidemics for a very long time, and for millennia, they have had a series of informal practices by which they responded to these threats,” said Jones, who is trained as a psychiatrist and historian of science. “Isolation, quarantine, and other measures that we now call social distancing have been part of people’s intuitive reactions to protect themselves from infectious diseases.” Examples of such precautions may also be found in Colonial history. In 2004, Jones wrote a book about epidemics that decimated Indigenous populations in Colonial America. During his research, he came across an account of a 18th-century meeting between British soldiers and Indigenous leaders in North Carolina that was called off by the Natives for fear of contracting smallpox. “American Indians had intuitions about how to respond to these menaces,” said Jones. “And often they used what we would now call social distancing: They would leave from the afflicted areas.” David Jones studied early examples of public health measures going back to the Bible. Kris Snibbe/Harvard Staff Photographer But it wasn’t until the early 19th century that local governments in the U.S. began formalizing public health laws and regulating quarantine and isolation. Now, even as COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out across the country, experts still advise social distancing, along with wearing masks and avoiding gatherings, to stem the spread of the disease. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, has urged people to continue wearing masks and following social distancing guidelines even after getting vaccinated. Vaccines are not a “substitution for public health measures,” Fauci said, but “a complement to public health measures.” Those public health measures were called “non-pharmaceutical interventions” during the 1918 influenza pandemic, estimated to have killed about 675,000 people in the U.S. and about 50 million around the world. The strategies were intended to reduce transmission of disease by banning indoor public gatherings, closing schools, churches, and theaters, and requiring that infected people be placed in quarantine or isolation. To hammer the message home to the general public, newspapers of the era ran public-service ads cautioning people to cover their faces when coughing or sneezing, wear masks, and avoid gatherings. Towns and cities published notices of local quarantines and “flu bans,” and ordered assemblies or gatherings to cease “until further orders.” One such announcement included two warnings: “Do not stand close to another person while conversing,” and “Avoid crowds, especially within doors.” Analyses of 1918 public health responses found that interventions in U.S. cities helped reduce influenza transmission and lower mortality rates when they were implemented early in the pandemic. In a 2007 article, researchers examined data from 17 U.S. cities and included a graph that compared the mortality rates of Philadelphia and St. Louis, based on the timing of social-distancing measures. Philadelphia, which waited more than two weeks after the first cases were reported — even allowing a city-wide parade — reported 748 deaths per 100,000. St. Louis, which rushed to ban public gatherings two days after the first cases were detected, ended up with 358 deaths per 100,000. During the Spanish Influenza epidemic, Seattle conductors would not allow riders to get on trolly cars unless they were wearing a mask. Courtesy of National Archives Historians and epidemiologists agree that the early application of social-distancing measures helped reduce mortality rates during the 1918 pandemic, but their implementation proved difficult. In a 2010 article, historian Nancy Tomes of Stony Brook University found that social distancing in big cities posed a “massive public health challenge” due to resistance from businesses afraid of losing revenue and from workers who feared losing their jobs. The role of social distancing was even more central to the 1918 pandemic than it is today, said Erez Manela, who studies modern U.S. history. “Today we have ventilators, antibiotics, and vaccines,” said Manela. “All of that was off the table back in 1918. Social distancing was really most of what they had back then.” As the nation struggled to react to the so-called Spanish flu pandemic amid World War I, the response was left to cities, towns, and counties. President Woodrow Wilson, who apparently caught the flu, didn’t lead a government response, and both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health were years from being founded. What is most striking is that once the epidemic ended, it was quickly forgotten, a fact that was highlighted in the book “America’s Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918” written by historian Alfred Crosby more than 30 years ago. In the book, Crosby wrote that the pandemic was remembered by individuals who lost loved ones, but it wasn’t memorialized at the societal level in art, literature, or public policy. “There is no Influenza Day that we celebrate,” said Manela. “Crosby thought that the main reason why the influenza pandemic was forgotten was because it coincided with the war, even though the pandemic was much deadlier, in retrospect, than the war. The war covered up the influenza pandemic.” “The lesson is that people need to pay attention, both those who make decisions about budgets and preparedness and those who elect them, because this pandemic was known in advance. We could have been prepared for it had we cared to do so.” Erez Manela, historian Now, officials are taking a different approach. On Feb. 22, President Biden held a memorial as the country reached the grim milestone of 500,000 deaths, a number that is creeping up on the U.S. toll from the 1918 pandemic. History holds lessons, said Manela, but only if people remember it. “The lesson is that people need to pay attention, both those who make decisions about budgets and preparedness and those who elect them, because this pandemic was known in advance,” said Manela. “We could have been prepared for it had we cared to do so.” For Jones, another big lesson from the 1918 flu, the deadliest pandemic in history, is the value of social distancing and other public health measures to control the spread of infectious diseases. “In 1918, this was a disease that, to the extent that it was controlled, it was done entirely by public health measures of social distancing,” said Jones. “Some skeptics may say, ‘There were 50 million deaths around the world. Why would you even suggest that social distancing was helpful?’ A lot of people died. We’re not going to deny that. Social distancing did not cure the disease and did not prevent it. Mortality was still appalling, but it would have been worse if not for public health measures.” According to John Hopkins University on Tuesday March 16, so far COVID-19 has infected more 120 million people and killed over 2.6 million around the world. Nearly 30 million confirmed cases have been reported in the U.S., with more than 530,000 deaths. In an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Jones appraised the situation with a sober warning, “The history of epidemics offers considerable advice, but only if people know the history and respond with wisdom.” Share this article Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Email article Print/PDF You might like Nation & World Did Trump election signal start of new political era?

These approaches could be especially effective in combination with other strategies to modify the viral content in respiratory tracts, according to the report.Potential antiviral agents for intranasal use include xylitol and grapefruit seed extract (GSE), corticosteroids, and hydrogen peroxide, according to the study. Xylitol is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol, but it demonstrates antiviral properties when administered orally and intranasally. GSE is known to inhibit bacteria growth and its antiviral properties were recently evaluated in vitro with viruses such as the avian influenza virus.In a recent article published by Go et al, 3 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 were administered xylitol and GSE in a nasal spray. Investigators noted a reduction of clinical course and improvements in symptoms as early as day 4. Furthermore, on day 7, patients tested negative on a repeat RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab instead of the average 14-day period.Intranasal corticosteroids are a first-line therapy for allergic rhinitis and have well-established safety and efficacy. Adverse effects are limited, occurring in approximately 5% to 10% of patients, and include dryness, burning, stinging, sneezing, headache, and nasal bleeding.The Allergic Rhinitic and Its Impact on Asthma Initiative—The European Academy of Allergy & Clinical Immunology (ARIA-EAACI) published a statement regarding the use of intranasal corticosteroids for COVID-19 patients with allergic rhinitis, in which they recommended these patients continue use of the treatment. The statement mentioned that sneezing could worsen if patients were to stop using intranasal corticosteroids, which could lead to the spread of the virus.Finally, an in vitro study of hydrogen peroxide vapor, a vapor-phase disinfection method that is commonly used for intranasal and gargling, has shown that it has virucidal properties for structurally distinct viruses in inanimate surfaces, suggesting that it could be useful for minimizing COVID-19 infections, according to the study authors. Despite multiple studies and trials, however, the report said larger randomized trials are needed to further validate these findings.“Limited strategies are currently accessible in modifying the viral content in infected patients’ respiratory tracts, justifying the need for novel therapeutic interventions targeting the principal route of infection,” the authors wrote. “We propose that intranasal administration of virucidal and antiviral therapies may be a novel strategy to provide an added clinical benefit by decreasing the viral activity in the nasal pathway, thus preventing disease transmission, managing the disease severity and limiting complications.”REFERENCEGo C, Pandav K, Somagutta M, Go J, et al.

Smith Mar 24, 2021 Share Getting your shot has never been more top-of-mind for Canadians. Although most are currently focused on the COVID-19 vaccine, it’s not the only vaccine your doctor probably wants you to take this year. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world over the past year and has increased awareness of health and safety practices that can help prevent airborne viruses such as the one that causes COVID-19. Increased hand sanitizing, the wearing of masks, and physical distancing have all been promoted as ways to curb the coronavirus. These were methods already recommended as ways to mitigate the spread of another disease that was commonly spread in workplaces and other public areas before the pandemic — influenza. Influenza, or “the flu,” has taken a back seat to COVID-19 in recent months, but it’s still a serious disease that causes up to 3,500 deaths annually and more than 12,000 hospitalizations in Canada, federal government numbers reveal. The safety measures in place to minimize the spread of COVID-19 have helped reduce the spread of the flu this year, but it doesn’t mean people should forget about it. Employers must be conscious of the threat of the flu, as workplaces are areas that can easily spread respiratory diseases. During the pandemic, numerous employees have been working from home for this reason, but many will be returning post-COVID. This will open the doors to a potential resurgence of the flu, as it’s easily spread in the workplace and, with strains constantly changing, there is always a risk and a need for annual vaccinations. This is where workplace immunization clinics come in. A recent Canadian study, COVID-19 pandemic impact on patients’ attitudes about the influenza season and vaccination, found that 73 per cent of employees want to have flu vaccines available at their workplace. Immunization clinics are a cost-effective way for employees to receive a flu shot and the topic of the webinar: Flu immunization in your workplace, an integral part of health and safety. Providing an onsite immunization clinic for employees needs certain elements to make it successful. One of the biggest mistakes employers make is not planning early enough. Experts recommend starting discussions with senior leadership in the Spring in order to determine important elements such as whether partnering with an immunization provider is necessary and what is involved in setting up an onsite clinic. This allows an employer to secure a date for the clinic before the flu season begins in the autumn. Partnering with an immunization clinic provider is usually the most convenient option, as this ensures the safe and comprehensive delivery of service by experienced health-care professionals and brings to the table one of the two keys to success for a good workplace influenza immunization program — good clinic management. The other key is effective planning and communication, which includes internal communication, appointment reminders, and educational posters that ensure employees are aware of onsite clinics.

People with asthma are being encouraged to continue taking their regular asthma medicines. The new update to the Australian Asthma Handbook has confirmed that monoclonal antibody therapies, such as omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab and dupilumab – often referred to as biologics – do not interfere with the coronavirus vaccines. Professor Nick Zwar, GP and Chair of the Guidelines Committee, told newsGP that GPs should advise patients with asthma to continue taking their regular medicines, including the time at which they would get vaccinated. ‘This includes oral corticosteroids used short term to manage asthma flare-ups in people with asthma, or long term to manage severe asthma in a very small proportion of patients,’ he said. However, Professor Zwar says GPs should avoid administering biologics on the same day as a COVID vaccine, where possible. ‘If someone’s got severe asthma, try not to give their injectable biological on the same day as a COVID vaccine,’ he said. ‘Not that there’s a danger in that. It’s just that if you had a reaction, you wouldn’t know which one it was to. ‘We’ve just said not on the same day, so that would probably be a few days or something like that. But just try to avoid the same day.’ The handbook also reiterates that unless unavoidable, nebulisers should not be used to administer inhaled medicines. The new recommendations were released to coincide with the commencement of phase 1b of the rollout of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine. The handbook also advises GPs to reassure their patients that having asthma or allergic rhinitis does not prevent them from having a coronavirus vaccination or increase the risk of adverse reactions. Professor Zwar says the National Asthma Council Australia is encouraging people with asthma to be vaccinated by their GP as soon as adequate doses are available. ‘As we know, vaccine hesitancy is clearly an issue among some people,’ he said. ‘[So] we are advising health professionals to reassure their patients that having asthma, including severe asthma or allergic rhinitis, does not prevent someone having a COVID-19 vaccination or increase the risk of adverse reactions.’ According to the Federal Government’s vaccine roadmap, people with chronic lung disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis and interstitial lung disease are eligible under phase 1b. However, those with mild-to-moderate asthma will have to wait a while longer. Professor Zwar says this is an opportunity for GPs to discuss with their patients the best time to get the influenza vaccination. ‘GPs are dealing with a whole lot of questions about where people are prioritised, and that’s tricky for everybody because some people would like to be further up the priority list than the rollout has them positioned for that,’ he said. ‘Health professionals should reassure their asthma patients that they don’t need to wait until they have the COVID-19 vaccine to get the flu vaccine. ‘Given that supply of COVID-19 vaccines is limited, it is likely that [the] flu vaccine will become available first. ‘GPs can also best advise their asthma patients on the recommended interval between a dose of seasonal influenza vaccine and a dose of COVID-19 vaccine.’ Professor Zwar said while the commencement of the vaccination campaign is a positive for all Australians, that it is a particularly welcome step for those with a long-term health condition such as asthma. ‘Their vulnerability to getting more severely ill with COVID is higher, and that’s something the vaccines seem to be good at; protecting against any sort of severe disease,’ he said. ‘It may not prevent transmission – we’re yet to know that. But they do seem to work well against preventing people getting severe COVID. That’s a great reassurance for all of us.’ Log in below to join the conversation. asthma Asthma Australia Handbook biologics coronavirus COVID-19 vaccine rollout newsGP weekly poll Which of the RACGP GP24 conference’s key themes are you most interested in?

Telegram Facebook Copy Link Shahid Akhter , ETHealthWorld Published On Mar 22, 2021 at 07:37 AM IST Read by: 100 Industry Professionals Read by 100 Industry Professionals Shahid Akhter, editor, ETHealthworld, spoke to Dr. Badri Narayan Patnaik, Head Medical – India and South Asia at Sanofi Pasteur, to know more about the vaccine priorities during the pandemic. As the world fights pandemic- in order to be prepared for a health crisis, should priority be given to R&D for identifying new diseases and vaccine development?Over the past 35 years, around 30 new infectious agents affecting humans have emerged. Most of these infective viruses are zoonotic and their origin significantly correlates with socioeconomic, environmental, and ecological factors. As these factors continue to increase contact with the disease-causing pathogens, there is concern that infectious diseases may continue to present a formidable challenge in the future as well. Constant awareness and pursuance of effective strategies for controlling infectious diseases and disease emergence thus remain crucial. Advt Vaccination is and will continue to be the most important intervention for prevention of infectious disease. Hence, investing in R&D for identifying new diseases and vaccine development remains the top priority. As seen in the past, India time and again faces the outbreak of bird flu. What measures should the poultry industry take in order to minimize the risk of this disease?Over the years, vaccines have been used in avian influenza (AI) control programs to prevent, manage, or eradicate AI from poultry and other birds. It has been observed that the best protection is produced from the humoral response against the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. A variety of vaccines have been developed and tested under experimental conditions, a few of which have received approval for the use of following field demonstration of purity, safety, efficacy, and potency. Current licensed vaccines have predominately inactivated whole AI vaccines, which is typically produced from low pathogenicity (LP) AI virus strains, or occasionally from high pathogenicity AI virus strains. Recently, reverse genetic procedures have been developed that allow construction of vaccine strains using a genetically altered HA and a backbone of internal gene segments for safe, high growth production. Other licensed AI vaccines include recombinant fowl poxvirus vector with an AI H5 insert and a recombinant Newcastle disease virus vector with an AI H5 gene insert. The latter vaccine can be mass administered via aerosol application. So regular and timely AI vaccination can definitely minimize the risk of disease in poultry and prevent outbreak of Avian influenza of Pandemic potential. Advt What steps should be taken to curb these diseases?As mentioned, there are a lot of advantages of AI vaccination and hence, intensive practice of regular and timely AI vaccination should be considered. Furthermore, it is important to include this as a part of Good Poultry Practices (GPP). What are your thoughts about Adult Immunization? Do you think a vaccination program for adults will help to reduce the disease burden of the country?With advance in modern healthcare and increase in number of elderly populations worldwide and in India, there is a definite urgent need to revisit the National Immunization Program. The program should also include vulnerable elderly population and the one’s living with co-morbid conditions for regular vaccination as part of planned health visits. Adults living with comorbidities and those above 50 years should take seasonal Influenza vaccine as they are at high risk of severe Influenza. Studies over the years have demonstrated that, in the period of 2 weeks, followed by an Influenza infection, they are at extreme high risk of developing stroke (by 12 times) and Myocardial Infarction (by 6 times).India falls in the southern hemisphere season and the ideal time for a taking a flu vaccine will fall between April and June. CDC says getting vaccinated too early, is likely to be associated with reduced protection later in the flu season, particularly among older adults, so timely vaccinations are essential for sustained protection during the peak season.As per one of the study, which was conducted in Delhi among healthy adults, reported that 53% of adults were unprotected; 22% were seen to have only a basic protection against diphtheria; 25% were protected against both diphtheria or pertussis diseases and 47% were susceptible to tetanus.What initiatives will help to bridge the gaps in order to achieve WHO’s mission of universal health coverage?Universal health coverage means ensuring, all people have access to needed health services - including prevention, promotion, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliation of sufficient quality to be effective. It also means to ensure that the use of these services does not expose the user to financial hardship.Hence, the need of the hour is a holistic approach, wherein we see changes in health policy by government and changes in the insurance sector with emphasis on preventive health.

TOKYO -- Researchers in Japan have found that children younger than 10 are prone to infection with cold viruses amid the coronavirus pandemic, with the risk of rhinovirus infections double that of an average year. The discovery was made by a research team led by virology professor Yoshihiro Kawaoka at the University of Tokyo's Institute of Medical Science. Countermeasures against the coronavirus, which have reduced influenza infections, are thought to have played a part in this. Rhinoviruses can cause common colds, triggering inflammation in the upper airways including the nose and throat. The virus can aggravate symptoms with complications such as pneumonia. The team analyzed specimens collected from 2,244 respiratory disease patients, among whom 1,119 were younger than 10, excluding COVID-19 patients, at a medical institute in the city of Yokohama between January 2018 and September 2020, and looked into viruses that cause respiratory diseases. As a result, though the flu virus has rarely been detected in children younger than 10 since the first coronavirus infection was confirmed in Yokohama in February 2020, the rhinovirus detection rate was more than twice as high as that of an average year. Both flu virus and rhinovirus detection rates among people aged 10 or older declined. In general, when people get infected with a virus, their immune system is activated, blocking other viruses. Therefore, there tend to be few rhinovirus infections during flu season. Team member Emi Takashita, a senior research scientist specializing in virology at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, commented, "The spread of influenza has been inhibited by countermeasures against the coronavirus, and as a result, the environment has become such that rhinoviruses can spread easily. Young children in particular aren't immune to rhinoviruses, so they are prone to infection." Takashita explained that while antiseptic solutions such as alcohol can deactivate the coronavirus and influenza viruses by destroying their fatty membranes, known as the "envelope," alcohol does not effectively work for the rhinovirus because it does not have the envelope. She added, "Washing hands with soap is effective against the rhinovirus, too. To protect children from infections, we want people to wash their hands adequately in addition to disinfecting them with alcohol."

That's enough on its own, but what if you add in a pandemic? That can throw it all into chaos, taking a project from routine worries about budgets and schedules to existential concerns about the future of film. Studios might shut down, filming becomes difficult, actors get sick, and suddenly very few people feel safe piling into a movie theater together. Advertisement However, 2020 isn't the first time that the film industry has had to deal with a pandemic caused by a contagious respiratory virus. In 1918, it also faced the threat of the Spanish flu, an extra-infectious and sometimes deadly strain of influenza that affected nearly everyone around the world. According to the CDC, about one-third of people worldwide were infected by the strain. Even healthy people could succumb to the disease, with an estimated 50 million people dead from the disease by the time it more or less faded away in 1919. Like the covid-19 pandemic, the 1918 flu completely upended the movie industry. Yet, while many theaters were closing and studios were struggling to make films, one producer saw an opportunity. He decided to take advantage of the moment, not coincidentally lining his pockets in the process, and proceeded to completely change the movie industry. We're still feeling the effects of his morally dubious actions over a century later. Advertisement The 1918 influenza pandemic devastated the film industry Wikimedia Commons The 1918 flu pandemic dealt a devastating blow to people worldwide. According to History, as the virus infected an estimated 500 million people over 1918 and 1919, alarm began to set in. To combat the strain of this deadly respiratory virus, people everywhere were encouraged to wear masks over their noses and mouths, while businesses and public gathering places were routinely closed. In many places, ordinances and fines were enacted to enforce public health measures. Advertisement Per The Hollywood Reporter, studio heads and theater owners on the west coast of the United States tried, for a time, to pretend that the pandemic wouldn't reach them. Yet, it arrived all the same. The flu began wreaking havoc on theater attendance and made film production very difficult. Then, in October 1918, the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry enacted a month-long embargo on new films. That same month, L.A. closed all "places of amusement" until further notice, which included 83 already-struggling movie theaters. Meanwhile, studios began to either shut down production or modify it to such an extent that people began to fret about the future of the still-young movie industry. According to Deadline, production appears to have more or less stopped from October until November 1918, at least for most California-based studios. Even when these relatively small, independent studios resumed work, they suffered a severe financial hit, with Paramount losing the equivalent of $30 million of today's money over the course of a year. Advertisement Before the pandemic, most movie theaters were independent businesses Library of Congress/Wikimedia Commons Before the 1918 pandemic, the Hollywood film industry was dramatically different than it was today, especially when you compare the audience experiences between then and now. Back then, movie theaters could take on any number of forms, as The Hoya reports. An early 20th century moviegoer might see the latest film in an independent mom-and-pop kind of place, perhaps run out of a small store front. Or, they might go into a large and grand movie palace. Heck, they might even go into a tiny nickelodeon theater with a scattering of chairs and someone providing accompaniment to the short silent film on a piano. While the settings may have varied, however, the business operation was often similar. Most movie theaters from this period were independently run. Advertisement A number of theaters were also owned and operated by women and people of color, who were also often involved in independent studios as well, Deadline reports. They were also frequently involved in the distribution of films, too, making early Hollywood a far sight more diverse than it would become mere decades later. It wasn't long to last, however. The pressures of the influenza pandemic, combined with rising operating costs and the frankly scheming efforts of a producer named Adolph Zukor, dealt punishing blows to the independent operators. With dwindling attendance, municipal orders demanding that they close, and the fear of the influenza pandemic, many independent theaters soon began to struggle mightily beginning around 1918. Advertisement Movie theaters were hit especially hard by the Spanish flu pandemic Wikimedia Commons While Hollywood studios and distributors could find ways to get around restrictions by reducing the number of people on set, movie theaters had a more difficult road ahead. Because influenza is a respiratory disease and because movie theaters are necessarily enclosed spaces where people might be obliged to sit closely together, they were targeted in numerous orders nationwide. Advertisement According to Film School Rejects, some places allowed a few theaters to remain open. To survive, some other theaters tried to enforce health measures, which mask wearing and, in at least one case, publicly shaming coughers and sneezers via slides that would be inserted into the projector mid-movie. Per the Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, others argued that movie theaters could be a useful way to communicate information about the pandemic in an age where computers and smartphones were little more than wild dreams. Yet, as Time reports, these arguments meant little when a large organization like the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry simply stopped sending new films to movie theaters. Though that particular embargo only lasted about a month in late 1918, it was apparently enough to send some in the burgeoning film industry into a panic. A few experimented with outdoor projections, while others called for mask-wearing ordinances, cleaning crews armed with disinfectant, and some simply returned because they missed going to see a movie and forgetting the world outside for an hour or so. Advertisement Adolph Zukor was a film producer who saw opportunity in the midst of disease Wikimedia Commons In the midst of all this confusion and upset, one man in the Hollywood scene saw an opportunity. Or, rather, he saw an opportunity to implement a plan that he'd already begun cooking up long before the Spanish flu had come along and created an opening. Whether or not his actions would be considered morally ambiguous seems not to have mattered to one Adolph Zukor. Advertisement According to Deadline, Zukor was a film producer who had already established himself in the growing American movie industry. The patchwork landscape of independent studios, distributors, and movie theaters apparently bothered him. From an organizational and financial perspective, there were some significant flaws. Moreover, there was an opportunity here to establish a sort of monopoly that would give Zukor and his associates more power and money than others must have dreamed of before. Zukor's idea was, simply enough, to take control of everything. From the studios that made films, to the networks that got them out to theaters, to the theaters themselves — why not manage each aspect of the process? All it would take was a good reserve of money and some on-the-ground work that, not coincidentally, took advantage of struggling business owners in the midst of a worldwide influenza outbreak. Advertisement Zukor came from an obscure background Library of Congress/Wikimedia Commons As PBS reports, Adolph Zukor was born in 1873 Hungary, a time and place that seemed poorly set up to produce a notorious Hollywood film producer. But young Adolph soon proved that he wasn't interested in going along with the plan that had been set for him. He was originally meant to be a rabbi like his uncle, Kalman Liebermann, who had taken in his nephew when the boy was orphaned at only age seven. After much effort, Adolph eventually made it clear to Uncle Kalman that he simply wasn't cut out to be a rabbi. Advertisement The 16-year-old Adolph moved to New York, where he worked a series of jobs that eventually led to him becoming a penny arcade owner. The arcade had early forms of short movies called "nickelodeons”. Those films needed to be shown somewhere, which meant that Zukor and his business partner started making "exhibition halls" that acted as early movie theaters. Ultimately, this led him to the world of theater and film via his own company, The Famous Players Film Company and, more concretely, to California. Whatever you may conclude about his ethics, it's clear that Zukor was a shrewd and persistent businessman. Certainly, that's what other people thought of him as his star rose and rose. By 1935, he was the chairman of Paramount Studios and would win an Academy Award in 1948. Advertisement The film industry takeover helmed by Zukor could get ugly Wikimedia Commons So, the enterprising and clearly energetic Zukor had a plan. According to Deadline, the basic outlines of the said plan involved buying up as many theaters as possible. Zukor and his associates may have thought this would be easy, given that so many of the movie theater operators were hanging on by a thread, if they hadn't closed already. Who wouldn't be tempted to just sell the whole operation, even if Zukor was offering what could be considered an insultingly low price? Advertisement Some owners resisted that temptation. However, that didn't mean Zukor calmly walked away. Struggling movie theater proprietors might then see a newer theater being built directly across the street from them. He wasn't above other tactics either, though, given that they were apparently carried out by lawyers and other colleagues, Zukor could at least have plausible deniability. As the journal Film History reports, some allege that Zukor also stooped to intimidating film exhibitors with threats and perhaps even a bit of violence here and there, too. Confronted with such a show of force from an already powerful Hollywood producer and combined with the grinding economic pressures of the pandemic, it's no wonder that Zukor's scheme was ultimately successful. Advertisement Zukor's acquisitions paved the way for the Hollywood studio system Wikimedia Commons Adolph Zukor may have seemed to be acting on a plan that took advantage of the financial instability kicked off by the Spanish flu, but it was much bigger than the short-term gains he and his colleagues soon enjoyed. As it turned out, Zukor was setting up for one of the biggest changes to come to Hollywood and the film industry in the coming decades. Advertisement As Deadline reports, Zukor's method of snapping up struggling theaters and taking control of the film distribution system paved the way for the rise of the studio system. Handy for him, given that Zukor turned his Famous Player company into Paramount and became, essentially, the head of Hollywood for years. The studio system helped shore up the film industry, as Britannica reports. It also pushed for widespread technological advances, like the rise of the sound-filled "talkies" after rivals like Warner Brothers started sending out records to play with their films. It also created a monopoly that used self-imposed censorship and reigned over creatives with an iron fist. The ultra-restrictive "Production Code" was adopted by the system in 1934 after protests over violence and sexuality in films started to threaten profits. It represented a new and highly codified creative change, as, for example, scriptwriters were forced to write love stories that inevitably lead to marriage and gangster movies that always ended with a moralistic punishment for the baddies. Advertisement One of Zukor's closest Hollywood associates caught the flu Library of Congress/Wikimedia Commons Though Adolph Zukor may have greeted some aspects of the pandemic with glee, in other ways, the deadly influenza pandemic came back to haunt him. While there isn't any evidence that Zukor himself got sick with the 1918 Spanish flu, people close to him certainly did. He may have been especially worried when Mary Pickford became ill with the disease. According to PBS, Pickford was a rising star who agreed to enter into a contract with Zukor. As it turned out, Pickford was pretty great at negotiating her fee over the years, eventually making pretty considerable amounts of money for the time. "Mary was a terrified businessman," Zukor would later say. Coming from him, that would high praise indeed. Advertisement That didn't help her much, however, when she caught the influenza virus. According to Deadline, Pickford became ill in the first months of 1919. So, too, did other stars of the day like Lillian Gish. Though both Pickford and Gish eventually recovered, some actors and other Hollywood professionals succumbed to the disease. In late 1918, up-and-coming actor Harold Lockwood died from pneumonia caused by the Spanish flu, as Silents Are Golden reports. While Pickford went on to become a megastar, Lockwood's name faded into obscurity in part because of his early death. Some would later allege that Zukor's studio system was abusive Wikimedia Commons Though Zukor wasn't directly responsible for the entire Hollywood studio system, he had a hand in establishing the ruthless practices that would make this a notorious time in film history. For, as studios gained a monopoly over the movie industry, the studio system then became rife with abuse for the actors and other creative people who were caught up in the web. Advertisement That's because, with control over how films were made and distributed, down to the very theaters where they were shown, actors became little more than hostages of the system. For instance, as The Guardian reports, a young Judy Garland was effectively forced to take amphetamines by studio executives to keep her energy up for grueling film shoots. And some actresses were forced into abusive, exploitative situations or else faced career-damaging consequences, as when Joan Collins declined to be "nice" to an executive and so lost out on a starring role as Cleopatra. If an actor didn't play along in one way or another, they might be forced to leave the business altogether. And those who stayed still suffered the consequences. Rita Hayworth, who was pressured to drop her original "ethnic" name of Margarita Canseco and who also had to undergo painful electrolysis to raise her hairline, according to The Hairpin, had a tragic story that was undoubtedly influenced by her abusive time in the studio system and at the hands of its executives. Advertisement Though Hollywood has changed, covid-19 has brought back some familiar issues Lorie Shaull/Wikimedia Commons Modern readers will undoubtedly have already drawn parallels between the influenza-wracked film world of 1918 and the 2020 movie industry hit by the covid-19 pandemic. How much has really changed and what has stayed the same? Advertisement Technically speaking, the Hollywood studio system ended in 1948, according to Turner Classic Movies. That's when Paramount was hit with an antitrust case, United States v. Paramount. The studio was forced to divest many of its holdings, including theaters. As a result, actors today are somewhat more independent, though don't tell that to anyone who signed a multi-film deal with massively lucrative film companies like Marvel (via Harvard Business Review). Indeed, actors are still often subject to intense pressures from studios and the film industry in general. Likewise, the covid-19 pandemic has shown numerous weak points in the industry, from studio production to theater showings. Once again, commentators like those at The Conversation are wondering if the world of film is on "life support" because of a novel respiratory virus that has forced people to stay away from crowded indoor spaces. Even mask wearing has become an object of contention, with not all celebrities buying into the public health measure, according to USA Today. Perhaps the old adage is really true, after all: the more things change, the more they stay the same. Maybe, if he were here now, Zukor would be cooking up yet another idea to line his pockets.
