- The study compares the immune responses of individuals receiving repeat vaccinations with different types of influenza vaccines (egg-based, cell culture-based, and recombinant).
- Repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines may enhance antibodies targeting egg-adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses.
- The trial collected sera from healthcare personnel in the 2018-19 and 2019-20 influenza seasons.
- The study found that in the first year, the recombinant vaccine induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell-A(H3N2) virus compared to the cell culture-based and egg-based vaccines.
- In the second year, repeat vaccination with both the recombinant and cell culture-based vaccines further improved antibody responses to circulating viruses, with a decreased ratio of neutralizing antibodies against egg and cell.
- The recombinant vaccine also had higher post-vaccination antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) HA stalk, but there was no significant difference in HA stalk antibody response between vaccine groups.
- Multiple seasons of non-egg-based vaccination may be necessary to redirect antibody responses from immune memory to egg-adapted epitopes and improve vaccine effectiveness against circulating viruses.
