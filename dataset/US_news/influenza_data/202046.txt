All those health crises happen despite previous and recent developments in anti-influenza vaccination, suggesting the need for employing more sophisticated methods to control this malign infection. Main bodyThe innate immunity modules are at the forefront of combating against influenza infection in the respiratory tract, among which, innate T cells, particularly gamma-delta (γδ) T cells, play a critical role in filling the gap needed for adaptive immune cells maturation, linking the innate and adaptive immunity together. Upon infection with influenza virus, production of cytokines and chemokines including CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 from respiratory epithelium recruits γδ T cells at the site of infection in a CCR5 receptor-dependent fashion. Next, γδ T cells become activated in response to influenza virus infection and produce large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, especially IL-17A. Regardless of γδ T cells’ roles in triggering the adaptive arm of the immune system, they also protect the respiratory epithelium by cytolytic and non-cytolytic antiviral mechanisms, as well as by enhancing neutrophils and natural killer cells recruitment to the infection site.ConclusionIn this review, we explored varied strategies of γδ T cells in defense to influenza virus infection and how they can potentially provide balanced protective immune responses against infected cells. The results may provide a potential window for the incorporation of intact or engineered γδ T cells for developing novel antiviral approaches or for immunotherapeutic purposes. BackgroundIt has been fully demonstrated that influenza virus infection is a serious menacing threat to human health, causing over 50,000 death tolls around the world annually [1]. In addition, reassortment of influenza virus genome due to antigenic drift and shift leads to pandemic outbreak, resulting in severe diseases such as that observed in the 1918 pandemic strain with over 50 million deaths during 2 years [2]. Although annual vaccination is substantially considered as an effective strategy against influenza virus infection, poor adherence and low efficacy of employed influenza vaccine strains increase the demands for better understanding of host immune responses [3, 4].Upon influenza virus infection within the cells, the innate compartment of immune system is activated in response to detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), specific of viral infection, by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Of note, the innate immune system employs three distinct groups of PRRs for recognition of influenza virus including RLRs (retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors or RIG-I-like receptors), NLRs (NOD-like receptors), and TLRs (toll-like receptors) [5]. This recognition results in the production of different cytokines and chemokines such as interferons (IFNs), which limits the early viral spread and further mediates adaptive immune response [3, 6]. Activated innate response bestows the first line of cellular defense to protect hosts against influenza virus infection. Each leukocyte such as neutrophils, monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), and gamma-delta (γδ) T cells may contribute to anti-influenza protection through varied strategies.γδ T cells, which based on the usage of either Vδ1 or Vδ2 domains are classified into two major subgroups [7, 8], are important components of both innate and adaptive immunity, however, they just constitute approximately 1–10% of peripheral blood T cells in humans. It has been established that γδ T cells not only exert anti-influenza activity by direct elimination of virus [9, 10], but also inhibit virus replication through the secretion of IFN-γ [11, 12]. Moreover, a pre-clinical study has shown that the proportion of γδ T cells was around 15–30% of the lymphocytes in the BAL between 10 to 15 days following infection, suggesting the possible role of this type of cell in recovery from influenza infection [13]. Besides, a study demonstrated that γδ T cell is required for initiation of effective immune responses and maintenance of lung homeostasis in influenza-infected individuals [14]. It has been regarded that upon encountering non-peptide phosphoantigens, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) or pathogen-associated antigens independent from major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation, γδ T cells become activated, eventually resulting in regulation of immune responses [15, 16]. It is well established that γδ T cells are predominantly considered as innate immune cells but can develop memory-like adaptive responses, bridging the gap between acquired and innate immunity [17], therefore play pivotal roles in protection against virus infection and in anti-tumor immunity [18, 19].The aim of this review is to present a framework for the role of γδ T cells in modulating immune responses against various pathogens, particularly influenza virus, and also to describe their applicability to develop novel therapeutic approaches for viral infections as well as their restrictions.Main textOverview of immune response to influenza infectionInnate cells like neutrophils and macrophages are the first leukocytes infiltrated to the lung upon influenza virus infection and secrete different cytokines, in particular, pro-inflammatory cytokines, causing recruitment of other leukocytes to the infection site [20]. In addition, neutrophil has been shown to present viral antigen on its surface, leading to activation and direction of CD8+ T cells into the influenza infected-lung [21]. Moreover, activated macrophage is able to release several inflammatory cytokines that are capable of influenza virus inhibition [22].Following influenza infection, natural killer cells are recruited into the respiratory tract, mainly through blood, in response to the expression of their chemokine receptors including CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR3 [23,24,25]. NK cells activation contributes to destruction of influenza-infected cells via secretion of perforins, granzyme B, and IFN-γ [26, 27]. Furthermore, in the early stages of influenza virus infection, innate lymphoid cells including cytotoxic NK cells and other innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), innate counterparts of T cells, have been shown to be effective. In particular, ILC1 induces the cytolysis of influenza-infected cells and ILC2 is trafficked into lung upon influenza infection and becomes activated, releasing amphiregulin (Areg), which contributes to repairing the damaged tissue [28, 29].Another pivotal member of innate cells is dendritic cell (DC), a professional antigen-presenting cell (APC), bridging innate and adaptive compartments of immune systems. DCs are generally classified into 2 categories: CD11c+ conventional DCs (cDCs), and CD11c− plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) [30, 31]. Compared to these subtypes of DCs, there are CD103+ cDCs with the ability to uptake viral antigen and migrate to draining lymph nodes (DLNs) and are known to be the most efficient cross-presenters of the immune system [32, 33]. And these cDCs have been shown to process and present influenza A virus (IAV) antigens to CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, both conventional and plasmacytoid DCs act as anti-influenza agents [34].Recently, more studies have focused on other members of innate immunity including mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT), natural killer T (NKT), and γδ T cells that respond to the influenza virus.MAIT cells are evolutionarily-conserved, innate-like lymphocytes constituting 5% of the total T cell pool in humans. MAIT cells express a semi-invariant αβ T cell receptor (TCR), which has been demonstrated to identify bacterial-derived vitamin B2 derivatives presented by the MHC class I-related gene protein (MR1) [35, 36]. Moreover, it has been indicated that MAIT cells contribute to protection against several intracellular bacteria [37, 38]. Accumulating evidence substantiates that a loss and/or efflux of MAIT cells from the blood to the site of infection are observed in patients infected with the influenza virus [39, 40]. These studies manifest that a decrease in the number of MAIT cells during acute influenza infection could impair protective anti-bacterial immunity, leading to the elevation of bacterial co-infection risk that ultimately would result in higher morbidity and mortality [41].Another innate T cell subset is the natural killer T that is restricted by the glycolipid α-galactosylceramide (αGC) presented on MHC class I-like CD1d molecules. In addition to expressing αβ-TCRs, this subset expresses NK cell markers including CD3, CD56 (humans) or NK1.1 (mice), and is broadly classified into 2 groups: type I invariant NKT (iNKT) cells expressing the invariant Vα14-Jα18 TCRα chain paired with either Vβ2, Vβ7, or Vβ8 in mice and Vα24-Jα18/Vβ11 in humans, and type II diverse NKT cells, displaying very diverse αβ-TCR gene pairings [42, 43]. An array of animal studies demonstrated that activation of iNKT cells leads to a reduction of body weight loss and viral lung titers [44, 45]. Similarly, one study showed that the αGC usage as a vaccine adjuvant improved the long-term survival of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, providing heterologous protection in a mouse model of influenza infection [46]. Intriguingly, one pre-clinical study demonstrated that vaccination with inactivated influenza A/PR/8/34 virus adjuvanted with αGC in BALB/c mice elicited IgG and IgA antibodies, which lasted for months and further boosted cellular immunity in comparison to mice immunized just with inactivated PR8 virus [47]. Taking together, this subset of innate T cell is considered as an innate and adaptive immune response modulator based on its role in establishing optimal influenza-specific T and B cell responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments. Another important participant in the immune response against influenza infection is the γδ T cell, which we will talk about later.On the other hand, there is an adaptive immune response that differs from innate immunity. The adaptive immune system-belonging cells present various receptors with precise specificity for antigens derived from particular pathogens. This adaptive immunity constitutes the second line of barrier against influenza virus infection. The adaptive-attributed humoral and cellular immune responses are mediated by virus-specific antibodies and T cells, respectively [48]. Following influenza infection, virus-specific antibodies are elicited and those specific for surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), are directed to these antigens, resulting in virus neutralization and spread limitation, respectively [49, 50]. Of note, this antibody-mediated immune response is predominantly strain-specific [51].Activation of different immune cells upon influenza infection further induces cellular immunity consisting of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Following recognition of virus-derived MHC class II-associated peptides on APCs by CD4+ T cell, this T cell becomes activated and forms either T-helper 1 (Th1) or T-helper 2 (Th2) type T cells [51]. Th2 cells produce IL-4 and IL-13, leading to the promotion of B cell responses [52], whereas, Th1 cells produce IFN-γ and IL-2 that mainly contribute to cellular immune responses [53]. In addition, virus-specific CD8+ T cells, as mentioned before, are recruited at the site of infection and are able to recognize and eliminate influenza virus-infected cells and therefore prevent production of progeny virus [48].Principles of γδ T cellsT lymphocytes are classified structurally into two subgroups based on different glycoprotein chains of T cell receptors known as αβ and γδ, each of which are composed of a variable (V), constant (C), and joining (J) segment generated through VDJ recombination [54, 55]. The γδ-TCR loci gene rearrangement occurs at an early stage in the fetal thymus and prior to αβ-TCR genes rearrangement [56], therefore, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) with γδ-TCR (γδ IELs) are believed to be the initial type of T cells localizing in the epithelium and so play an important role in the immune responses during the perinatal period, prior to TCR αβ T cell activation [57].Among two major subgroups of γδ T cells, defined by the usage of either Vδ1 or Vδ2 TCR, Vδ1 subset, paired with different Vγ chains (comprising Vγ2/3/4/5/8), constitutes the less frequent population and is mainly found in epithelial tissues and mucosae and involves in the first barrier defense against infections, whereas Vδ2 subset, which is uniquely associated with Vγ9 chain (called Vγ9 Vδ2), is more abundant in peripheral blood and plays roles in defense against intracellular and circulating pathogens [58, 59]. By contrast, γδ T cells expressing Vδ3 with either Vγ2 or Vγ3 (termed Vδ3 subset) are the smallest subset of γδ T cells predominantly resident in the liver and take participate in the process of chronic viral infections. Furthermore, the functionality categories of γδ T cells, e.g., IL-17-producing γδ T cells or IFN-γ-producing γδ T cells have been described [59]. There has been accumulating evidence demonstrating γδ T cells are involved in various aspects of the host immune responses ranging from acute and chronic inflammation to killing virus-infected cells, cancerous cells, and stressed cells [60, 61].It has also been confirmed that both naturally IFN-γ- or IL-17-producing γδ T cell subsets express different NK cell receptors [including NK group 2 member D (NKG2D) receptors and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs)] that are responsible for controlling the γδ T cell-mediated immune responses [62]. On the other hand, in order to terminate γδ T cell responses, several inhibitory receptors can exert negative signals, specifically programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) [62].γδ T cell-mediated innate and adaptive immune responsesγδ T cells are regarded to be innate-like lymphocytes with crucial role in immune responses or immune regulations by detecting antigens directly in a MHC-unrestricted priming manner, resulting in response to stress conditions rapidly without the need for clonal selection and differentiation [15]. In the initiation phase of immune responses, γδ T cells may connect innate and adaptive immunities, thereby playing crucial roles in anti-infection, autoimmunity, and antitumor effects [18, 19]. Moreover, they produce a large number of inflammatory molecules, such as granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IFN-γ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [63] and also can stimulate other immune cells including monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells, B lymphocytes, and different subtypes of T cells [64]. In this context, in humans, γδ T cells induce B cell class switching by expressing several factors including: (1) IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines, involved in immunoglobulin class switching; (2) CXCR5, a chemokine receptor localizing B cells in follicles; (3) CD40 ligand (CD40L), promoting B cell activation; (4) IL-21 and IFN-γ cytokines, which are crucial for the development of follicular helper T cells and germinal center-resident B cells, suggesting a direct role for γδ T cells in modulating humoral immunity by helping B lymphocytes to produce different classes of antibodies [65,66,67].In comparison to αβ T cells, γδ T cells not only participate more extensively in innate immunity and homeostatic processes [68], but also actively produce IL-17 and IFN-γ in response to antigenic stimulation in tissues [69]. Several studies have shown that IL-17 demonstrates both protective and pathogenic features in the immune system and the involvement of this cytokine is of importance in host defense against various infectious organisms [70,71,72]. These non-conventional T cells can also promote adaptive-like responses by sharing functions with APCs, pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic effector cells, and immune-regulatory cells [73]. Consequently, before effective expansion and activation of antigen-specific αβ T cells, γδ T cells represent the first line of immune barrier to prevent infection from pathogens [74].γδ T cells role in antiviral immunityDespite the role of NK cells and CD8+ αβ T cells in the early and the late phase of controlling viral infections (respectively), some studies have addressed the imperative role of T lymphocytes expressing the γδ T cell receptor in reducing viral loads by direct lysis of virus-infected cells and by non-cytolytic mechanisms, particularly γδ T cell-induced bystander activation of other immune cells, as summarized in Table 1.Table 1 Antiviral activity of γδ T cell subsets in in various experimental modelsFull size tableIt seems that γδ TCR-bearing T cells can exert their protective role in the killing of virus-infected cells directly through the perforin/granzyme cytotoxic pathway, the apoptosis pathways triggered by death inducible receptors like FAS and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors (TRAIL), the natural killer group 2, members C and D (NKG2C, D)-mediated γδ T cell recognition and destruction, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [9, 10, 75,76,77,78]. In West Nile virus (WNV) infected mice, a trend toward significantly lower perforin expression level was noted in TCRδ−/− mice in comparison with wild type or TCRβ−/− mice, suggesting the ability of γδ T cells to directly produce perforin or their potential to modulate the production of perforin by αβ T cells [75]. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, perforin-mediated HIV-infected CD4+ T cells destruction by Vδ1+ γδ T cells has also been reported [76]. Regarding Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-infection, NKG2D receptor triggering and the cytotoxic pathways of TRAIL and Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) were outlined as the major mechanisms involved in clearing EBV-transformed autologous lymphoblastoid B cell lines by Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocytes [79]. It has also been revealed that an up-regulation of NKG2D ligand expression on the surface of target cells induced by Zika virus (ZIKV) infection makes them more susceptible to lyse by NKG2D+ Vδ2+ T cells through perforin pathway [80]. Although NKG2D is originally known as an activating receptor for NK cells, it also acts as a potent co-stimulatory receptor of human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. Furthermore, NKG2D-mediated cytotoxic function of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells by triggering the release of cytolytic granules through receptor-ligand recognition has been discussed recently [81]. Alternatively, NKG2C (an activating NK cell receptor of the C-type lectin)-mediated cytotoxicity was reported to be involved in the lysis of HIV-infected CD4+ T cells by NKG2C-bearing Vδ1+ γδ T cells [77]. Of importance, the potential role of Fcγ receptor III (CD16)-bearing Vδ2 T cells in the control of HIV type 1 disease through ADCC in the presence of specific antibodies that target antigens expressed on the surface of infected cells has been proposed [78].The mechanisms underlying γδ T cell-mediated non-cytolytic antiviral activity consist of the production of cytokines (notably IFN-γ) and β chemokines like macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES (regulation on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) [82, 83]. Upon infection with viruses like WNV, vaccinia virus (VV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), it has been reported that an early immune response (as a first line of host defense) involving IFN-γ-secreting γδ T cells is critical to control viral infection [75, 83,84,85,86]. IFN-γ presents potent antiviral activity by interfering with the viral replication through the induction of intracellular signaling pathways following interferon binding to its cell-surface receptors and subsequent up-regulation of a set of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) products that directly inhibit key steps of the replicative life cycle of viruses and by inducing the death of target cells through the modulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses [86,87,88]. However, little is known about the mechanism by which IFN-γ-secreting γδ T cells regulate the replication of different viruses.After primary herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection in mice, it has been observed that viral replication is suppressed by IFN-γ-producing γδ T cells and macrophages that infiltrate into the infected trigeminal ganglion (TG). Cross-regulation between these two types of immune cells is required for their accumulation and antiviral functions in the TG. In this manner, synergistic effects of γδ T cell-produced IFN-γ with macrophage-derived TNF-α and nitric oxide (NO)-producing enzymes, i.e., inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOs) can dramatically restrict viral replication [84, 89]. On the other hand, the possible contribution of IFN-γ-producing gamma-delta T cells to induce the neutralizing IgG responses independently of αβ T cell help in αβ T cell-deficient mice infected with either live vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the VSV glycoprotein has been described [82]. Of note, CD16 was also reported to be a TCR-independent activating receptor on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-induced Vdelta2-negative gamma-delta T cells, able to promote antiviral activity against IgG-opsonized HCMV-infected fibroblast cells by antibody-mediated CD16-induced IFN-γ secretion, called antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI) [90].On the other hand, the production of antiviral factors MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES by Vγ9Vδ2-bearing lymphocytes has been shown to block HIV replication in vitro by inhibiting the CCR5 co-receptor that is required for HIV entry [91]. Alternatively, the involvement of NKp30, an activating receptor for NK cells, expressed on activated V delta 1 T cells in inducing β chemokines production, followed by the inhibition of CCR5-tropic HIV-1 strains replication has been described [92]. Taken together, unlike αβ T cells, γδ T cells, which possess innate and adaptive immune characteristics, play a crucial part in the front line of defense against various viral infections.Respiratory γδ T cellsUnlike αβ T cells, the preferential tropism of γδ T cells for non-lymphoid sites such as the skin, respiratory, digestive, and reproductive tracts may be related to their potential role in providing the early protection against invading pathogens and/or in mitigating the tissue-damaging side effects of immune responses in an immune regulatory manner [100, 101]. In this context, there is increasing evidence to reveal the role of γδ TCR-bearing T lymphocytes in maintaining and protecting normal functions of the airway, which has been reviewed in Ref. 100.Heterogeneous populations of γδ T cells (predominantly Vγ1+ and Vγ4+) with distinct functions (mostly immunoregulatory role) are found in the lung [101, 102] and responses of lung-specific γδ T cells have also been reported in a variety of lung diseases including bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, allergic disease, inflammation and fibrosis, and cancer (reviewed in Ref. 101). For instance, during acute respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, the beneficial role of activated γδ T cells as the main source of IL-17A in regulating viral responses and reducing lung inflammation in RSV-infected adult mice has been reported. Compared with adult mice, a significant decrease in γδ T cell-mediated IL-17A responses was noted in RSV-infected neonatal mice during initial infection. On the other hand, increased levels of IL-1β and IL-6 (as activated inflammasome markers) involved in the induction of IL-17A as a product of inflammasome-activated γδ T cells was also only observed in the lungs of RSV-infected adult mice, indicating a defect in inflammasome activation upon neonatal RSV infection. Interestingly, lung pathogenesis in neonates was reduced by exogenous IL-17A administration, while neutralization of IL-17A resulted in increased inflammatory responses in adult mice, suggesting the inflammation-inhibiting effects of IL-17-producing γδ T cells in the mouse model of RSV disease [103].However, the increased recruitment of Vγ4+ γδ T cells to the lung and subsequent production of IFN-γ, TNF, RANTES, IL-10, IL-4, and IL-5 in a time-dependent manner (i.e., γδ T cell-mediated early production of Th1, followed by a late surge of regulatory/Th2 cytokines release) were observed after RSV challenge in BALB/c mice immunized with a live vaccine vector expressing RSV F protein. During the secondary challenge, In vivo depletion of γδ T cells did not affect viral clearance but resulted in reduced lung inflammation and slightly increased peak viral replication in vaccinated mice [104]. Such differences as cytokine profile and/or γδ T cell-mediated disease pathology (e.g. alleviating or inducing lung inflammation) seems to be related to the presence of distinct populations of γδ+ T cells in the lung with specific roles [100].γδ T cell effects in defense against influenza infectionRecently, it has been observed that γδ T cells (mostly GV9-TCRγ-expressing γ9δ2) are able to destruct influenza A virus-infected cells as efficient as CD8+ T cells or NK cells in a polycytotoxic manner and by releasing IFN-γ against infected cells in vitro [61]. Investigation on pigs, as human-like IAV infection models, has substantiated the role of γδ T cells as early defending modules of the innate-like, adaptive immune system in anti-H1N1pdm09 infection activities. Significant augmentation of γδ T cells-induced perforin secretion in IAV-infected pigs’ nasal mucosa along with enhancement of γδ T cells-producing CD8 in respiratory system lymph nodes constitute ample evidence to indicate the effectiveness of γδ T cells in controlling IAV infection [105].IL-17A-producing γδ T cells were shown to be involved in initiating protective immunity and mediating lung homeostasis and repair in a neonatal mouse model of influenza virus. During neonatal influenza (H3N2) virus infection, lung accumulation of IL-17A-producing γδ T cells, associated with the increase in lung epithelial cell-derived IL-33, resulted in IL-17A-dependent IL-33-mediated promotion of local type II immunity and infiltration of group 2 innate lymphoid cells and regulatory T cells to the lung, which thereby led to the augmented amphiregulin secretion and tissue repair [14]. A very recent study has revealed that immediately upon infection with influenza virus, Vγ4+ γδ T cells, infiltrated by means of CXCR3 receptor, undertake the task of providing early defense barrier against infection. This mission is followed by induction of IL-17A production, aimed at activation of protective neutrophils and NK cells in tracheal mucosa and so suppressing invasive viral replication after influenza infection [106]. Similarly, co-culturing H3N2-infected human nasal epithelium with PBMC showed that IAV infection stimulates both NK cells and γδ T cells (especially Vδ2 γδ T cells) against infected targets in vitro [107]. In myxovirus protein 1 (Mx1)-congenic C57BL/6 mice models, those consuming a low-carbohydrate, high fat ketogenic diet (KD) showed lower viral titers and improved survival in response to lethal IAV infection due to IL-17-producing γδ T cell-mediated killing of IAV-infected airway epithelial cells, expanded in response to KD in the lung, and KD-expanded γδ T cell-mediated improved lung barrier integrity [108].In a mouse model of influenza (H3N2) virus infection, it was observed that in the lung of infected mice, the percentage of V gamma 4+ γδ T cells was gradually augmented post-infection, peaked at day 10, which was paralleled by an increase in the number of inflammatory macrophages expressing heat-shock protein (HSP) mRNA. However, V gamma 2+/V gamma 1+ γδ T cells were the dominant γδ T cell phenotype on day 13 after infection, indicating the possible role of some of these lymphocytes in responding to HSP+ cells and resolving inflammatory process upon influenza infection [13]. It was also found that an increased frequency of IL-22-producing retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt)-positive αβ and γδ T cells, and innate lymphoid cells in the initial phase of influenza A (H3N2) virus infection was associated with the limited lung inflammation and so a more controlled secondary bacterial infection. Of note, during lethal and sublethal viral infection, high levels of IL-22 had no effect on the control of virus propagation and the development of virus-specific CD8+ T cell response [109]. Moreover, IL-21 has been shown to have a key modulatory role in controlling γδ T cells propagation in the respiratory tract and its presence is necessary for preventing hyperinflammatory responses of γδ T cells through overexpression of IL-17 and subsequent lung injury [110]. Similarly, depletion of serpinb1a in IAV-infected mice models resulted in augmentation of IL-17+ γδ T cells and CD4+ Th17 cells and so increased the rate of mortality and impaired immune responses among depleted mice, mentioning the anti-inflammatory role of serpinb1a in IAV-driven overproduction of γδ T cells [111]. Nevertheless, in wild-type mice, the detrimental effect of type I IFNs induced during primary nonlethal influenza infection on increased susceptibility to secondary Streptococcus pneumonia infection by negative regulation of lung γδ T cell-mediated IL-17 production and IL-17-induced neutrophil recruitment, involving in lung immunity to bacterial infection, has been reported [112]. In the context of postinfluenza occurrence of lethal pneumococcal pneumonia, it has been shown that IL-27 expression in response to IAV infection hinders IL-17-expressing γδ T cells production by involvement of STAT1 factor and thereby deprives the host from the immunity related to IL-17 expression by γδ T cells after initial influenza infection [113].The non-specific protective role of trehalose 6,6′-dimycolate (TDM) against influenza virus infection by inducing lung accumulation of γδ T cells following intravenous exposure in mice has been described. Depletion of γδ T cells in vivo impaired the resistance of TDM-treated mice to lethal influenza A (H3N2 and H1N1) virus infection, as did depletion of either αβ T cells or NK cells, indicating a complementary role for γδ T cells, αβ T cells and NK cells in protecting mice against influenza virus infection. On the other hand, γδ T cells from TDM-treated mice exhibited a significant role in the host defense against influenza virus infection by recognizing an unprocessed whole HA molecule of either H1 or H3 subtype in a major histocompatibility complex-independent manner [114].Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have recently been reported to activate γδ T cells as the first line of the host immune defense via the trimmers of viral HA proteins, leading to the up-regulation of CD69 as an early activation marker on γδ T cells. This activation depends on both sialic acid receptors on the surface of γδ T cells and the glycosylation of HA proteins. In this manner, the protective activity of HA-induced γδ T cells against HPAI H5N1 virus infection is mediated directly through IFN-γ production or indirectly through the regulation of other immune cells by secretion of immunomodulatory cytokines. Moreover, H5N1 infected TCRδ−/− mice showed an increased mortality rate and more severe lung injury, revealing the important part played by γδ T cells in the infection control. On the other hand, the rapid response of γδ T cells to viral infection, as well as the resistance of γδ T cells to HPAI H5N1infection increase the ability of these lymphocytes to control viral infection over other immune cells [60]. On the contrary, after Vγ4+ γδ T cell subset depletion, the survival rate of mice infected with the influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus was improved by reducing Vγ4+ γδ T cell-mediated IL-17 secretion, lung immunopathology injury, and inflammatory cell infiltration [115]. These contradictory results are likely due to the presence of different γδ T cell subsets in the lung with distinct functions and/or due to the use of different influenza virus strains and treatment methods [60, 100]. In this context, it has also been demonstrated that CD56+ subset of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells show higher degree of cytotoxicity against IAV infection when compared to CD56− equivalent, which is due to the specific CD16-mediated degranulation concomitant with CD56+ Vγ9Vδ2 T cells activity [116].Using a model of A549 cells, human lung alveolar epithelial cells, infected by human (H1N1) influenza virus, it was found that aminobisphosphonate pamidronate (PAM)-expanded Vγ9Vδ2 T cells from PBMC of healthy donors were efficiently able to control influenza pathogenesis by non-cytolytic inhibition of influenza replication and by direct killing of influenza-infected cells through cytolytic pathways of perforin/granzyme B, TRAIL, and Fas-FasL in a NKG2D-mediated cell to cell contact-dependent manner [9]. Regarding the ability of the influenza virus to replicate in human macrophage, human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells that are activated by IPP in vitro have also been demonstrated to have potent cell-killing activity in human (H1N1) and avian (H9N2 or H5N1) influenza virus-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) as the model, suggesting the heterotypic nature of Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocyte responses to influenza A subtypes. The cytotoxic activity of activated-Vγ9Vδ2 T cells requires NKG2D recognition and is mediated by both Fas-FasL and perforin/granzyme B pathways [10]. Furthermore, in an IAV-infected MDMs model, virus-activated Vγ9Vδ2 T cells driven from PBMs of healthy donors were shown to preferentially express the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR5, and CXCR5, among which the CCR5 is associated with the regulation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cell trafficking to virus-infected cells by binding to its ligands (CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5) produced in response to influenza infection. Of note, compared to human (H1N1) influenza virus, considerably higher Vγ9Vδ2 T cell-mediated expression of CCR5 chemokine ligands is stimulated by avian (H5N1 and H9N2) influenza viruses, which may be due to higher severity of infections among avians [11].In young children, the role of γδ TCR+ IFN-γ+ T cells induced by trivalent live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in providing further protective effects against influenza infections, compared with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV), has been proposed [117]. After influenza vaccination, in young recipients, virus-activated γδ T cells were significantly higher than those in elderly group, indicating the possible negative effects of age-induced changes of γδ T cells responses on vaccine efficacy [118]. Interestingly, the frequency of T cells carrying γδ TCR in non-smokers was significantly higher than smokers following LAIV vaccination, indicating inhibitory effects of smoking in LAIV-induced alterations in the percentage of γδ T cells [119]. Concerning the harsh reaction of smokers suffering lung disease to respiratory infections, an intriguing study explored the effect of cigarette smoke on recovery from IAV infection among mice models and revealed that smoke-enhanced IL-17 production in the lung of mice exposed to cigarette smoke hampers the efficient activation of γδ T cells and so significantly decreases the possibility of survival after infection [120]. Additionally, it has been reported that obesity is correlated with the low numbers of γδ T cells in the peripheral blood, as well as reduced homeostasis and antiviral functions of γδ T cells, leading to increase the susceptibility of obese patients to respiratory infections (notably influenza virus) and subsequently higher rate of mortality among them. Also, remnant γδ T cells in obese individuals majorly lack the IL-2Rα and so are unable to be primed efficiently [121].Regarding the possible correlation between variants of chromosome Y and incidence of IAV infection in males, it indicated that a number of particular ChrY consomic mice, like ChrYPWD mice, are more susceptible to IAV infection. Further analysis attributed this phenomenon to higher levels of some IL-17-expressing subsets of γδ T cells (Vγ4+ and Vγ1−Vγ4−) in ChrYPWD mice group without any observed alteration in level of IFN-γ among them, which together increase the fatality rate [122]. Collectively, these studies highlight a crucial role for γδ T cells in conferring protection and recovery from influenza virus infections. γδ T cell-mediated antiviral activities to eliminate influenza-virus-infected respiratory cells are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Also, an overview of IAV-induced γδ T cell responses is summarized in Table 2.Fig. 1Schematic representation of effector mechanisms of γδ T cells in response to influenza virus infection of respiratory epithelium. Upon infection with influenza virus, infected cells secrete CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 chemokines and thereby recruit γδ T cells, harnessing chemokine-binding CCR5 receptor, to the site of infection. Activated effector γδ T cells release cytokines and chemokines such as IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-22, as well as cytolytic proteins including perforin and granzyme B, which can directly lyse the infected cells and can also recruit other immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells and neutrophils to aid killing or healing infected cells. Moreover, γδ T cells expressing IL-17A, binds to IL-17A receptor on lung epithelial cells, producing IL-33 and thereafter drive colonic group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) activation during influenza virus infection. The activated ILC2 produces Amphiregulin (Areg), which participates in pulmonary tissue repair upon influenza infection. In addition, IL-22, released from both γδ T cells and activated NK cells, is effective in preserving the homeostasis of mucosal barrier of influenza-infected respiratory tract and also plays a key regulatory role in microbial host defense after influenza infectionFull size imageFig. 2Cartoon overview of γδ T cells receptor-dependent interaction with influenza virus or influenza-virus-infected respiratory cells. a Activation of γδ T cells by the interaction between NKG2D (natural killer group 2D) receptor of γδ T cells with its ligands, MHC class I chain-related sequence A and B (MICA and MICB), expressed on the surface of influenza-infected epithelial cells, inducing the release of some cytokines and cytolytic proteins, somehow halting the influenza infection. b The interaction of influenza haemagglutinin (HA) on the surface of influenza viruses with sialic acid receptors plays a key role in the activation of γδ T cells, triggering the production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ). c γδ T cells utilize TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) for killing of influenza-infected cells. Infected epithelial cells express death receptors TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2, identifying their ligand (Apo2 ligand) on the surface of influenza infection-activated γδ T cells and undergo apoptosis through Caspase-dependent pathways. d) FAS ligand expressed by γδ T cells, when exposed to FAS receptor available on influenza-infected cells surface activates the pathway of FAS-FASL apoptosis to destroy the infected cellFull size imageTable 2 Anti-influenza mechanisms of γδ T cells in the respiratory tractFull size tableγδ T cell-based emerging therapeutic approachesThere is increasing interest to find alternative strategies aimed to offer a safe and accessible option for treating viral infections. In this context, stimulatory targeting of γδ T cells to activate and allow them to show their effector functions quickly, regardless of virus subtypes and the emergence of drug-resistance viral strains, can be considered as a promising strategy. For instance, in humanized mice, exogenous administration of PAM, a common treatment for osteoporosis and Paget’s disease, has been shown to decrease the disease severity and the number of death caused by H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses by enhancing human Vγ9Vδ2 T cell immunity indirectly through the induction of intracellular accumulation of IPP, a metabolite in the mevalonate pathway that selectively expands human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, suggesting the potential application of PAM in human clinical trials [123]. The potential applicability of PAM-induced activation of human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells to control EBV-induced lymphoproliferative disease has also been reported [79]. Using a co-culture system containing Huh7 hepatoma cells carrying the subgenomic HCV replicon (Rep60 cells) and PBMC of healthy and HCV+ donors, it was also found that treatment with drugs containing non-peptidic antigens [zoledronic acid (ZOL) and bromohydrin pyrophosphate (BrHPP)] could influence HCV replication by expanding IFN-γ-producing Vγ9Vδ2 T cell population, suggesting the feasibility of using non-peptidic drugs as an innovative therapeutic approach in patients suffering from HCV [86].On the other hand, Vδ2+ γδ T cells from HIV-infected individuals were demonstrated to respond strongly to ZOL plus IL-2, leading to rapid expansion of CD16-expressing Vδ2+ subset associated with enhanced ADCC-dependent CD16-mediated antiviral activity of Vδ2+ γδ T cells, suggesting the capacity of ZOL/IL-2-expanded Vδ2+ γδ T cell-based immunotherapy in HIV patients [124]. Modulation of CD16+ Vδ2neg γδ T cell-mediated ADCI by exogenous administration of HCMV-specific IgGs may also provide a promising anti-human CMV strategy [90]. ZOL-mediated human Vδ2 cell targeting that are involved in the control of WNV infection in vitro by both cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic mechanisms may facilitate a novel immunotherapy strategy to the treatment of WNV infection [125].Of note, adoptive immunotherapy using HIV-1-reactive CD4-negative γδ T cells, able to mediate antiviral activity, may be playing a critical role in the control of HIV-1 infection. However, the advancement of γδ T cell-based adoptive cellular immunotherapy for HIV-1 infection has been constrained by the inability to isolate or expand sufficient numbers of viable γδ T cells [126].Concerning the construction of a universal vaccine against distinct subtypes of influenza A virus, Jameson et al. showed that human PBMC-derived Vγ9Vδ2 T cells induce CD25 and CD69 expression and also produce IFN-γ upon IAV infection, promisingly suggest the ability of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in providing effective cross-reactive responses to IAV infection. In addition, they found that incorporation of mevastatin (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor) has a negative effect on γδ T cells activation, emphasizing the role of mevalonate pathway in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells efficiency [12]. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that daily consuming of cranberry alleviates the symptoms of influenza due to inducing γδ T cells proliferation and so reducing the inflammatory cytokines profiles, an akin phenomenon previously observed about aged garlic extracts and L-theanine present in tea beverage [127,128,129,130].In view of what has been previously discussed, it seems that γδ T cell-based immunotherapy may complement the traditional therapeutic regimen currently used for treating viral infections, particularly influenza A infection. Information on the potential applicability of γδ T cells to elicit improved therapeutic approaches is also increasing. In this manner, the strategy of targeting γδ T cell by the commercially available drugs containing non-peptidic antigens, which are currently used in humans, can potentially offer a safe and accessible option for treating viral infections [123]. Of note, one concern regarding the clinical application of phosphoantigen-induced γδ T cells is whether these cells can enrich at the site of infections, such as the lung, upon influenza infection. In this context, the data regarding the impact of chemokines produced by influenza-infected cells on γδ T cell trafficking to the virus-infected site may accelerate their potential for immunotherapy [10]. However, the limitations associated with preparing the adequate number of desired γδ T cells have restricted the development of cell-target immunotherapy aimed to boost γδ T cells to clear infectious agent. Therefore, there is a need for developing additional strategies to overcome this obstacle [126].ConclusionsWhile annual vaccination exerts protection against influenza infection, comprehensive perception of immune system schemes, especially those related to the innate immune system immediately after infection, when confronting influenza virus may help to develop more efficient vaccines or improved anti-infection immunotherapies, resulting in a decline in the threat of influenza infection to human health. In this context, γδ T cells have been observed to be primed and activated upon influenza infection of the respiratory tract and play a mediating role to join the innate immune responses to adaptive ones. However, the efficacy of γδ T cells-induced immunity is dependent on various factors including the predominant subset of γδ T cells at the infection site, the amount of recruited γδ T cells, the host immune system status, and even the genetics of infected patients. Here, we recapitulated and discussed the latest discoveries in γδ T cells’ way of action upon influenza virus infection, aiming at showcasing one of the few but highly potential subsets of innate T cells, which can be considered as a tool for developing novel and improved protective or therapeutic agents.

Part of Springer Nature.How Michiganders united to fight the influenza pandemic of 1918Skip to main content HomeOpinionBrian DickersonNancy KafferSubmit a Letter to the Editor Michiganders can unite to fight the pandemic. We've done it before.Dr. Howard Markel and Dr. J. Alex Navarro | Detroit Free PressLast month, the Michigan Supreme Court struck down Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s authority to declare or extend states of emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic without the consent of the predominantly Republican Legislature, based upon the so-called non-delegation doctrine. In these charged times, where public health has become too politicized for our own good, the ruling was hailed as a major victory by some and by others as a defeat. Despite recent good news about a potentially effective vaccine, as historical epidemiologists, we feel obliged to tell all Michiganders to settle down and pay attention to the clear and present danger.To many Michiganders, Whitmer’s orders were seen as overreaching and unjustified. They were not, however, without historical precedent. More than a century ago, in the fall of 1918, the nation found itself in the midst of an influenza pandemic, the deadliest contagious crisis in human history. Then, as now, there was much debate on how best to halt the spread of the pandemic, or whether the disease could be controlled at all. Hesitant to take statewide action, Albert Sleeper, Michigan’s Republican Governor, and Richard Olin, M.D., the State Board of Health’s executive officer, initially left the public health response to local authorities. Many communities leapt into action, quickly issuing gathering bans and closure orders. Other cities, including Detroit, Flint, and Grand Rapids were slower to respond.More: Coronavirus Watch: Where cases are increasingMore: 'COVID-19 is surging across our state': Spectrum Health nears capacity, CEO saysThe lack of consistent action allowed the pandemic to accelerate like an out of control forest fire. On October 18, 1918, Sleeper called a special meeting of mayors and local and state health officers. The debate was contentious to say the least. Detroit health officials argued that closure orders and gathering bans were useless unless absolute, and if absolute would cripple the state’s economy. The Grand Rapids health officer incorrectly assumed that influenza was not much worse than the common cold, and argued that closure orders were unnecessary. Other health officers disagreed. The Flint health officer, for example, lamented that he had not acted sooner: “We can reduce the chances for infection by reducing the opportunities of the people to congregate.” The next morning, Sleeper issued a sweeping statewide order, “by virtue of the authority vested in [him] as governor of the state,” closing places of public amusement and prohibiting all public gatherings and instructing local health officers to enforce the order.Naturally, there were grumblings over the order especially among the business community. Despite these objections, local officials across Michigan worked quickly to put the governor’s order into effect. In Detroit, Mayor Oscar Marx and health officer James Inches informed residents that the governor’s order would be strictly enforced. Several weeks later, when Detroit’s epidemic appeared to be waning, Inches asked Sleeper to lift the closure order. The governor refused because the epidemic was still raging across the state. Inches acquiesced and told Detroiters, “We have no right to demand favors that might cause trouble in other communities.”His proclamation to the contrary notwithstanding, Sleeper’s orders rested on shaky legal ground. Michigan law did not yet grant either the governor or the state health officer the authority to enact such sweeping public health measures. To rectify this omission, the following year the Michigan Legislature passed Public Act 146 of 1919, explicitly granting the director of the Department of Health the authority to declare an epidemic and to issue closure orders and gathering bans. Some six decades later, the Legislature again revised the state’s public health laws, passing the Public Health Code, Act 368 of 1978. Like its predecessor, this act grants sweeping authority to the director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) to enact and enforce epidemic control measures. Moreover, it also grants such powers to local and county health departments. And remember, these measures are only used when combatting an easily spread and deadly microbial enemy like the influenza of 1918 or today’s CoVID-19.These statutes grant the state broad powers to protect the public’s health. Indeed, the Michigan Supreme Court’s recent decision specifically cites the 1919 law. In the aftermath of that decision, the director of MDHHS has used this authority to issue numerous COVID-19 control measures. Such public health orders rest on overwhelming scientific evidence as well as the solid ground of over a century of legal authority. To be sure, living under such orders is difficult. They are socially and economically restrictive. Masks are uncomfortable to wear. Seven months into this pandemic, we are eager to return to our normal routines. This is especially so as the holiday season is upon us. From the rising number of cases in Michigan, it looks to be a very lonely Thanksgiving and Christmas.Still, these measures are not an unconstitutional infringement on our civil liberties, as some would have us believe. Rather, they are legally valid codifications of our collective obligation to our fellow Michiganders. We should not view them as burdensome orders, but rather as reminders that we must all do our part to better control the pandemic. As we look down the barrel of COVID-19’s third surge, we must continue our social distancing measures to prevent disease and save lives until a vaccine is safe and widely distributed. Michigan’s proud history tells us that we can rise to the occasion by making these necessary sacrifices, just as our forebears did a century ago.Dr. Howard Markel is the director and Dr. J.

In order to enable as many people as possible to be vaccinated against influenza this year, the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) has procured six million extra doses in addition to the 20 million vaccine doses announced by the manufacturers after the needs assessment. This means that in 2020/21 there will be more seasonal doses of vaccine available than in any of the last twelve years, when usually less than 20 million doses per season were available. Experience in recent years has also shown that the available vaccine doses were not completely used up in the respective season, but that unused vaccine doses amounting to several million were destroyed. At the beginning of 2020, the need for influenza vaccines was determined for the first time in accordance with Section 132 e paragraph 2 of the German Social Security Code V (Sozialgesetzbuch V, SGB-V). In accordance with the specifications laid down therein, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut added to the vaccine doses required by the Federal Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (Kassenärztliche Bundesvereinigung, KBV) at the beginning of 2020 as stipulated in the SGB-V. The number of vaccine doses planned by the manufacturers for Germany was adjusted accordingly, resulting in the provision of the above-mentioned 20 million influenza vaccine doses in the 2020/21 season. The determination of requirements at the beginning of the year should also help to improve the planning for the manufacturers producing worldwide as well as the supply being in line with demand in the future. The production of influenza vaccines is complex and requires a high workload. It is not possible to respond spontaneously to an increased demand by quickly re-producing vaccine doses or to provide additional vaccine doses, especially when there is a high demand worldwide. Due to the extensive preparations and the complexity of influenza vaccine production, manufacturers need to know very early in the year what demand they can expect. Currently, there is increasing evidence that significantly more people chose to be vaccinated than in previous years. This would be an important and welcome development and a major step forward for vaccination prevention in Germany. In combination with the infection control measures introduced to contain the coronavirus pandemic, this would offer the opportunity to greatly reduce the annual influenza wave. Of course, this could also lead to bottlenecks - despite the significantly higher number of vaccine doses provided compared to the number of vaccine doses vaccinated in recent years. Priority should therefore be given to vaccinating members of risk groups, as recommended by the Standing Commission on Vaccination (Ständige Impfkommission, STIKO). Influenza vaccines are available from numerous manufacturers in Germany. The Paul-Ehrlich-Institut provides information about these at www.pei.de/influenza-impfstoffe.

Tregoning, The Lancet, 2020) A new flu vaccine grown in plants has been put to the test in two large-scale clinical trials, a first for vaccine research.The vaccine contained virus-like particles which resembled circulating flu strains, extracted from native Australian tobacco relatives that were genetically instructed to produce the viral proteins. The two trials combined involved nearly 23,000 people and the results suggest that the plant-derived vaccine is not only safe, but comparable to current commercial flu vaccines. "To the best of our knowledge, these studies and the clinical development programme that preceded them are the largest demonstration to date of the potential for a plant-based platform to produce a human vaccine that can be safe, immunogenic, and effective," the research team wrote. Every year, the vaccines that protect us against influenza have to be reformulated for the next flu season, which is a huge undertaking. The influenza virus is a chameleon of sorts, constantly changing the protein molecules it displays on its outer surface, and this has researchers feverishly looking for ways to improve our current vaccine technology. Most influenza vaccines are currently made using virus particles grown in and harvested from chicken eggs or lab-grown cells, which takes months even after scientists work out which flu strains (and surface proteins) they need to target. Plants, which can be engineered to produce select proteins and cultivated at scale, could be an alternative, helping to boost our capacity to produce seasonal flu vaccines. The technique might also help to overcome complications encountered in the way current flu vaccines are manufactured that sometimes renders vaccines less effective. In this system, the researchers used an Australian relative of the tobacco plant, Nicotiana benthamiana, engineered to produce just the outer shell of influenza viruses. These virus-like particles are then extracted and purified under strict conditions to make a flu vaccine. The researchers tested their plant-derived vaccine in two clinical trials, funded by the Canadian biotech company which developed the technique, and no major safety concerns were reported. Phase III trials testing safety and efficacy like this are usually one of the last hurdles vaccines need to clear before they can be approved for widespread use. But keep in mind that even if a flu vaccine is approved as safe and effective, any manufacturer needs to be able to produce millions of doses every year, which could be a challenge for vaccine-producing plants. The first trial involved more than 10,100 adults from Asia, Europe and North America, aged 18 to 64 years, and it was designed to show that the vaccine could prevent 70 percent of people in the trial from developing flu-like or other respiratory illnesses in one flu season. Although this high benchmark was not reached in the trial, the vaccine did protect about a third of people from flu strains circulating in the 2017-2018 Northern Hemisphere winter that were a match for the viral particles in this vaccine. That result might sound low, but the efficacy of commercial flu vaccines often varies year to year depending on how well a vaccine matches the different flu strains circulating that winter. The researchers concluded, based on data collected during 2017-2018, that their plant-derived vaccine provided a "broadly similar" level of protection as commercial vaccines used in that particularly long flu season, which is a fair result. The second study recruited another 12,700 people aged 65 years and over. This is quite important because elderly people's immune systems tend to wane with age, making them more vulnerable to contracting infections. "Like other influenza vaccines, antibody responses to the [plant-derived] vaccine also diminished with age," the researchers said. The plant-derived vaccine stimulated less of an antibody response in older people, a somewhat expected result, but it did activate a substantial increase in immune cells ready to respond to flu-like infections. Promisingly, the protection the vaccine granted people from flu-like illnesses in the 2018-2019 flu season was still on par with a commercially available flu vaccine used that season. "The field of plant-derived vaccines has grown a lot in the past 28 years, since it was first shown [in 1992] that viral proteins could be expressed in plants," John Tregoning, an infectious disease researcher from Imperial College London, said in a commentary about the latest trial results. "This is the first time a plant vaccine has been tested in a [human] clinical trial," Tregoning added. "It is a milestone for this technology and sows the seeds for other plant-based vaccines and therapeutics." If all goes well, this research might one day give us another way to manufacture seasonal flu vaccines that could also be scaled up in the event of another flu pandemic. In their paper, the researchers claim that their plant-based system can produce the first doses of a newly designed flu vaccine within two months of identifying an emerging influenza strain. But there is likely still a long road ahead navigating regulatory approvals for this vaccine, so watch this space. The research was published in The Lancet.

Passive administration of antibodies obtained from convalescent patient plasma is a well-established concept (1), for example, as part of the treatment regimen following exposure to rabies virus. Building upon this concept, a number of recombinant mAbs have been developed over the last 25 years for treating viral infections (2). At the time of writing, there are six antibody therapeutics approved for the treatment of viral infections. Two of these antiviral antibody therapies are cocktails of at least two mAbs. As of early November 2020, there are sixteen mAbs in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 that target the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (3). Three of these mAbs are Fc-modified to reduce the likelihood of antibody-dependent enhancement of virus infection, to extend half-life, or to enhance binding to immune-activating receptors.Researchers are always looking for new ways to improve effectiveness of antibody therapy – often by engineering cells to enhance certain immune mechanisms. One such promising mechanism is antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).Following the initial virus challenge, there are a number of processes – such as neutralization and agglutination – by which antibodies directly prevent viral infection. Binding of a virus-antibody complex to an Fc receptor on a phagocyte can trigger phagocytosis, resulting in destruction of the virus (see Figure 1). Binding to the Fc receptors on immune effector cells, such as monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and NK cells, trigger the release of cytotoxic factors (for example, antiviral interferons), creating a microenvironment that is hostile to virus replication. Various research groups (4,5,6,7,8) have demonstrated that broadly-specific neutralizing mAbs targeting highly conserved regions of haemagglutinin (a glycoprotein found on the surface of influenza viruses and integral to their infectivity) require Fc-mediated effector functions, especially ADCC, to protect against influenza virus challenge in vivo. Therefore, enhancing the potency of ADCC could be an effective way of combating influenza virus infection. ADCC may be important in controlling other viral infections too. For example, researchers have successfully treated HIV-1 with broadly-specific mAbs in animal models (9,10,11). They attributed this success to both the neutralization function of the anti-HIV-1 mAbs, as well as their ability to activate ADCC – which removes infected cells. ADCC is also considered a potentially important mechanism for protective immunity in herpes simplex virus infections (12). It has also been shown that serum antibodies against hepatitis C virus E2 protein can mediate ADCC (13,14). Taken as a whole, there is growing evidence that ADCC is a significant component of the adaptive immune response to virus infection, highlighting the importance of strategies that induce and enhance ADCC in vaccine development.Figure 1. Antibody modes of action. Cell lysis through activation of complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); interaction with Fc receptors on effector cells to engage antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC); signaling for ingestion of a pathogen or target cell by a phagocyte. Enhancing ADCCHow might researchers go about enhancing ADCC? The principal receptor for NK cell-mediated ADCC is the low affinity Fc gamma receptor, FcγRIIIa (CD16a). FcγRs bind to a region in the hinge and proximal CH2 region within the Fc fragment of antibodies, with IgG1 and IgG3 interacting most efficiently. This interaction is critically dependent on the glycan at the N297 site in the CH2 region (15). Removal of the entire N-glycan structure reduces the binding of Fc to FcγRs, and reduces or eliminates the associated effector functions. Conversely, eliminating only the fucose residue from the core glycan structure creates an afucosyl mAb and strengthens the binding of a mAb to FcγRIIIa receptors, enhancing ADCC (16,17,18). The strength of Fc-FcγR interactions can also be modulated by mutating the Fc region (19).This mechanism also has support from Desheng Kong and colleagues, who showed that an anti-HIV-1 afucosyl-bispecific antibody had a greater ability to kill HIV-1 infected cells through ADCC than the fucosylated form (20). Another study found that enhanced ADCC was a potential mechanism for protection against Ebola virus infection, with afucosylated mAbs having up-to an approximately 11-fold lower ED50 than fucosylated mAbs (21).The growing evidence for the importance of ADCC in controlling viral infections suggests that mAbs engineered to enhance ADCC (for example, through production in CHO FUT8 knockout variants of the host cell line (such as Lonza’s POTELLIGENT® CHOK1SV®) will become an important element of successfully treating viral infections. Recent studies (22,23) point towards the potential importance of strategies that target effector function pathways. Schäfer and colleagues (22) report that intact Fc effector function is required for protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chakraborty and colleagues (23) report lower Fc fucosylation in antibodies to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in adults with PCR-diagnosed COVID-19 compared to SARS-CoV-2-seropositive children and relative to adults with symptomatic influenza virus infections. This suggests strategies that target FcγRIIIa pathways may have therapeutic benefits. The enhanced ADCC activity of reduced fucose antibodies could contribute to viral clearance through killing and removal of infected cells. As overactive ADCC function may exacerbate symptoms in some cases, it will be important to carefully dose mAbs with high levels of effector function. Recombinant low fucose or afucosyl mAbs produced using CHO cells would form an important element of a strategy to produce mAbs with high-level ADCC effector function.The adaptive immune response to virus infection is complex, involving the production of a broad repertoire of antibodies that interact with a range of Fc- and other receptors. As such, potent Fc-engineered or glycan-engineered mAbs with enhanced ADCC activity may form part of an antibody cocktail that mimics the nuanced in vivo response to virus infection – and a number of mAb-therapies for treating virus infection are already cocktails of at least two mAbs. Such antibody cocktails simultaneously target non-overlapping epitopes minimizing the likelihood that the virus becomes resistant to treatment.The field has come a long way since the approval of the first therapeutic mAb in the 1980s. Today, we may be witnessing, as Alicia Chenoweth and colleagues (24) have alluded to, the “next-gen” of antibody therapies, with researchers taking new findings from immunology and using them to tweak and improve existing treatments. These next-gen biologics may unlock the full potential of antibody immune therapies – bringing new and exciting treatments to patients with difficult- or impossible-to-treat diseases.

The flu folks keep saying so. I've already heard it repeated several times this year and flu season has just started. This is what the Public Health Agency of Canada said in a recent press release: "Every year, between 2,000 and 8,000 Canadians die of the flu and its complications."In a CBC interview a few weeks ago an editor of the Canadian Medical Association Journal said: "Four thousand to 8,000 people die every year of influenza." It comes directly from the desk of Canada's chief public health officer. "The flu is serious," he tells us from his website. "Every year, between 2,000 and 8,000 Canadians die of the flu and its complications."Flu's winter companions include coronavirus, adenovirus and Streptococcus pneumonia. (Vasily Fedosenko/Reuters)Did you ever wonder how they know that? The fact is, they don't know that. "This is a scientific guess. This is not the truth," Dr. Michael Gardam, director of the infection prevention and control unit at the University Health Network in Toronto and a longtime flu watcher, told me.The fact is, no one knows how many people die after being infected with the flu virus. The death estimates are not based on body counts, lab tests or autopsies. "I think people may have the misconception that every person who dies from the flu is somehow counted somewhere, and they're not," Gardam said.The "2,000 to 8,000" numbers are based on computer models — a statistical guess that comes out of the end of a mathematical formula that makes a range of assumptions about death and flu."They're tossing it into a big computer and they're churning out estimates," Gardam said as he scribbled numbers on a white board to show me how the models work.One model counts all respiratory and circulatory deaths — that's death from heart and lung failure — as flu deaths."As an upper limit, they are looking at everybody who died of a heart and lung problem," Gardam said. "So you could imagine this could include people who died of a heart attack that had nothing to do with flu, but the feeling is that anybody who died of flu should be captured in there, plus a lot of other people."At the lower end of that model they count the number of deaths officially listed as "influenza" on the death certificate, plus all deaths from pneumonia — even though not all pneumonia is caused by flu."That is going to include obviously people who died specifically of those, but it might miss people who died of influenza but who didn't get tested, for example," Gardam said.Data can include deaths by poisonAnother model assumes that every extra death that happens in the winter is a flu death. At the risk of oversimplifying, this is the basic formula of that model: winter deaths (minus) summer deaths = death by flu virus.That includes winter deaths from slippery sidewalks, snowy roads, freezing temperatures, plus all the winter heart failure, lung failure and deaths from cancer. In the language of the computer model, all excess mortality in winter is considered "death by flu." The model extrapolates that the flu virus will cause more deaths across all causes, including "disorders of the nervous system," stroke and "disorders of the digestive system." Which means that according to the model, flu causes 33 more "accidental falls" every year, 18 more "accidental poisonings," and 68 more deaths from "psychotic conditions." But what does flu have to do with deaths from accidental poisonings or accidental falls? 'If they don't collect that information, how do they know that their policies will work? This is called faith-based medicine.'— Dr. Tom JeffersonHow reliable are the computer model estimates? "I don't think they're reliable at all," Dr. Tom Jefferson told me. He is a Rome-based researcher with the Cochrane Collaboration, and he spends his days reviewing all the research on acute respiratory infections and vaccines. He said hard data on flu deaths "are difficult to get hold of for obvious reasons. So enter modelling, which is nothing more than guesswork, highly sensitive to the assumptions you feed into the model. 'Give me a model and I will make it say whatever you want,' a colleague of mine always repeats."The models are only as good as the data sets that are fed into them. And death can be complicated. If someone already extremely fragile with heart or lung disease is tipped over the edge with a flu infection, is that a flu death, or a heart death or a lung death? Which database gets to claim it? "The only mortality estimates which have any credibility are those based on post mortem examinations and tests which were done before death," Jefferson said.Flu death statistics not collectedIn a perfect world, the flu death statistic would be based on an actual count of confirmed deaths after infection with the flu virus. But that's difficult to do, because autopsies are almost never done, lab tests for the flu virus are rarely done, and someone could die from the complications of flu even though the virus is no longer detectable in their bodies.The numbers we do have don't even come close to the computer estimates. In Statistics Canada's "deaths and mortality" table, under "cause of death: influenza," there were only about 300 deaths a year between 2000 and 2008. Public health officials don't trust that number. They believe it underestimates the true death toll from flu.But Jefferson believes the models overstate the risk from influenza. "There are no real figures on deaths from influenza. They don't collect that information," he said. "So if they don't collect that information, how do they know it's a threat? And if they don't collect that information, how do they know that their policies will work? This is called faith-based medicine, not evidence-based medicine."Dr. Michael Gardam, an infectious disease expert at Toronto's University Health Network, says estimates of the number of flu deaths each year "vary a great deal depending on which research paper you read." (CBC)"Could the deaths be being caused by other pathogens? It's an important question," Dr. Kumanan Wilson told me. He holds the Canada Research Chair in public health policy at the University of Ottawa. He's also a hospital clinician who has seen many flu seasons. "We see lots of people coming in with upper respiratory infections and we don't know what causes it. Sometimes if they are really sick, we'll test for influenza. We rarely test for anything else."One of the few attempts to check the accuracy of the models in assessing flu deaths was done by one of Wilson's master's students, and her thesis is interesting reading.Using data from three Ottawa hospitals over seven flu seasons, Tiffany Smith did two things. First, she counted the patients who died from flu, according to a doctor's diagnosis. Then, using one of the official flu modelling methods, she ran a computer model to see how close the actual body count matched the statistical estimates. Her result? The statistical model predicted eight times as many deaths from flu as there were actual clinical cases."I have found evidence to suggest that point estimates of influenza burden generated using statistical models may not be reliable," she concluded, "and that more research is required to understand the limitations of this methodology."Remember, that's an unpublished thesis, not a peer-reviewed study. But Wilson said it was a well done paper that posed some important questions. Health Canada resists queries Just as an aside, I tried to contact Tiffany Smith to ask about her thesis, because she is one of the few people to attempt to validate the models. It seemed that she wanted to talk to me. Here's her response to my email: Hi Kelly, I would love to talk to you about my thesis! However, because I work for the Agency, I'm obliged to engage media relations even if it's just for background info. The "Agency" is the federal government, specifically, the Public Health Agency of Canada, a branch of Health Canada. My request for permission to talk to Tiffany about her student thesis was directed all the way up to the chief of media relations for Health Canada. Here is my email to him: Hello. My name is Kelly Crowe and I am the medical sciences correspondent for CBC National TV news and I would like to talk to Tiffany Smith about her graduate thesis, as background research for a story I am doing. She is interested in talking to me, but she has been told that she needs to get permission, and she forwarded me your email address and suggested I contact you. It would be a phone conversation about her master's thesis, and I will not be asking her any questions about her current work. I would not be speaking to her as a representative of a government agency, but only as the author of a student thesis. Thank you, Kelly Crowe He wrote back, declining on Tiffany Smith's behalf, although he did offer me a chance to ask about the official government point of view. His email: Hello, Kelly. Please accept my apologies for not getting back to you yesterday. I was out of the office with a bad cold. I've spoken with Tiffany and she would prefer that you quote from her written thesis as her current workload doesn't leave her a lot of extra time these days. That being said, if you have any questions for PHAC on the subject matter I am happy to have one of our media relations officers get in touch with you. I understand that my colleague Blossom Leung is working with Marijka Hurko already for your piece that is to air this Sunday. Regards, Alastair As a further aside, despite Alastair Sinclair's offer to answer questions, we were refused an on camera interview with anyone from Health Canada about any of this. All we received was a written response to our questions, which I have included at the end of this article. Flu models versus countsGetting back to the question of how deadly influenza really is, fate did offer up a chance to check the model predictions when the flu pandemic hit in 2009, and the world faced a new influenza threat called H1N1.Back then a flu expert told me that the pandemic would be a rare opportunity to check the true death toll from flu, because, for the first time, there was widespread lab testing, a national reporting system, and all eyes were on potential flu-related deaths. The final count: 428 deaths, which is much closer to the seasonal average of around 300 recorded in the vital statistics tables than to the 2,000 to 8,000 deaths estimated for the average flu season by the computer models.So how did the models rate after a real life test? "The predictive models of 2009 of influenza have actually been a complete failure," respiratory-infection expert Jefferson said."Ranges like 2,000 to 4,000 or even 8,000 influenza-related deaths a year are thrown around each flu season, and policy decisions and flu shot campaigns are based on these numbers," Michael Gardam told me. "I think it is important for us to remember that these numbers are estimates and certainly not written in stone. These numbers vary a great deal depending on which research paper you read."There's another point to consider here. Using death estimates is the scariest way to talk about the risk from flu, because 8,000 sounds like a lot of deaths. But if you ask, "8,000 deaths out of how many people?" suddenly the risk seems much smaller. In fact, it would be 8,000 deaths among 35 million Canadians. In other words, in a normal flu season, about 0.02 per cent of Canadians are in danger of dying from the flu, using the highest estimate. Another way to look at it is this: 99.98 per cent of Canadians will not die of flu this year.Undermining flu campaignsSo are the statistical models exaggerating the death toll from flu? "Not enough people have been asking these questions," the University of Ottawa's Wilson said. "These are complicated models. There are multiple ways to calculate the information. Five different analysts with the same data can come up with five different estimates. It depends on how they calculate base line risk, how they define when the season begins, how to run the model. There are lots of potential variables in the model that will influence your answer."Influenza prevention has become an industry fuelled by poor science, says Dr. Tom Jefferson. (CBC)For proof of how models keep changing their estimates, look back at Canada's flu files. More than a decade ago, flu was estimated to kill about 500 to 1,500 Canadians every year. But in 2003 Health Canada changed models, and the estimates jumped to "700 to 2,500 per annum." The 2,500 deaths at the upper end of that range quickly became the lower end, when an even newer model was tried in 2007, pushing the upper limit to 8,000 based on the severe flu seasons of 1997 to 1999."Influenza prevention has become an industry fuelled by poor science and propelled by conflicted decision makers," Jefferson said. "This is the significance of the upward creep that you have been witnessing and the chasm that now exists between policy makers and evidence."The proof of what I am saying is in the answer to the question: How many die every year? Answer: maybe 300 or maybe 9,000. We are not sure. If you do not know, how can you have such a costly policy and most of all how can you evaluate it?"When I asked him if there are consequences from over-stating the mortality impact of flu, Jefferson answered: "Yes. Scaring people justifies evidence-free policies. Yes, no one knows exactly what the threat is. The only certainty are the returns for industry."Wilson is concerned that overstating deaths could undermine the annual flu campaign. "I think this is a potential risk," he said. "It's a good idea to try to capture the number of deaths. People just need to reflect the fact that there is a lot of uncertainty in these numbers and that has not necessarily been conveyed. Even if the estimate is 1,000 or 2,000, it's a big number. A more conservative approach might be better to convince people it's a real disease that we have to take seriously."One expert I talked to suggests that at least some of the cost of the annual flu campaign should be directed at finding out how much death the virus actually causes every year, by using a system of doctors and hospitals to track laboratory confirmation of flu infections and flu mortality. The flu virus has lots of ugly company in the winter — less famous viruses such as RSV (respiratory syncytial virus); the ubiquitous cold bugs, including the coronavirus and the adenovirus; as well as Streptococcus pneumonia and all of its bacterial friends. Influenza is certainly one of the nastiest viruses in the group. It also happens to be the only one with a vaccine."You've got to wonder: The stuff we're attributing to influenza, how much of that is actually true and how much of that is other viruses? We don't know because they haven't been studied," University Health Network's Gardam said.Just 1 death this yearFor the record, how many official deaths from flu have been reported so far this year? One.And finally, as promised, here's the official response I received from the Public Health Agency of Canada:Q1. How are the numbers derived? (i.e., how is it counted? are there any statistical models?) The number of flu related hospitalizations and deaths is not a straightforward estimate, given that influenza is such a non-specific illness and its diagnosis is under-reported. Patients with influenza complications or an exacerbation of their underlying chronic medical condition are often not reported as influenza related.PHAC has taken data collected by Statistics Canada and hospital discharge records from the Canadian Institute of Health Information and applied statistical techniques to provide an estimate of influenza related deaths.Q2. Are the numbers an average over the last 10 years? Have the numbers stabilized?As previously indicated, it is difficult to assess the true burden of influenza in terms of incidence, deaths and hospitalization. However, it is estimated that, on average, the flu and its complications send about 20,000 Canadians to hospital every year, and between 2,000 and 8,000 Canadians die.Q3. Why is it important to inform Canadians about these death statistics?Reporting on these death statistics informs Canadians that infection with influenza can be severe and in some cases result in death. Hence, Canadians should get their seasonal flu shot to prevent infection and to practice infection control measures such as hand washing, cough etiquette and staying home when sick to prevent spread.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Three wild geese found dead at the end of last month at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) at Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, tested positive for the H5N8 strain of avian influenza.Defra said swans that died near Dawlish, Devon and a wild goose in Weymouth, Dorset also tested positive.Public Health England (PHE) advice is that the risk to public health from the strain of the flu is "very low".WWT said it was working with the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), PHE, and Gloucestershire County Council to monitor the situation. The two greylag geese and one Canada goose were sent to APHA for testing, and results show they had the H5N8 strain of avian influenza.H5N8 is the same strain that infected a poultry farm in Frodsham, Cheshire earlier this month, and which has been found recently in Germany and the Netherlands.'Reporting findings'Chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, said it was "important now more than ever" for bird keepers ensure they "maintain and strengthen good biosecurity... to ensure we prevent further outbreaks"."Public Health England has confirmed that the risk to public health is very low and the Food Standards Agency advises that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers."We ask that people continue to report findings of dead wild birds so that we can investigate the extent of infection."A WWT spokesman said staff were following advice, research and a pre-prepared response plan, to ensure the wildlife and people at Slimbridge "have the best protection".The nature reserve has been closed to the public since 5 November in compliance with government coronavirus regulations for the four-week lockdown in England. The risk level of avian influenza incursion in wild birds in Great Britain has been raised to "high" following the unrelated confirmed cases in Gloucestershire and Cheshire.Bird keepers have been urged to "remain alert" for any signs of disease, and report suspected disease immediately.Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The term is derived from the ancient Greek word pandemia, which means “belonging to all the people.” It thus refers to infectious diseases that affect the majority of the population. Pandemics often originate from pathogens transmitted from animals to humans. Our living conditions also contribute their part: worldwide trade, global mobility, or environmental damage favor the development and spread of infectious diseases. If a pandemic spreads, we have to react quickly. What is an epidemic, what is a pandemic? A pandemic refers to the spread of a disease over entire regions, countries, and continents. If the outbreaks of the disease remain spatially and temporally limited, scientists speak of an epidemic. A pandemic is, therefore, a global epidemic. The causes of a pandemic are pathogens that previously have either never been present in the human population or have not been present for a very long time. The human immune system is not prepared for these pathogens and the human body is therefore not sufficiently protected from the disease. These are often strains of viruses or bacteria that were previously only found in animals, for example, bird flu viruses or swine flu viruses. The genetic material of the viruses can change; the viruses mutate. Because of this they also may be transferred to humans and cause serious diseases. Virologist Prof. Dr. Thomas Mettenleiter on species boundaries and transmission paths Audio in German, English translation below “Well, the fact that we can get infected with animal pathogens is not surprising. Biologically, humans are part of the animal kingdom, and for a pathogen, humans are just animals. There are indeed species boundaries, but there is no particular barrier between animals and humans. In other words, considering the differences between animals and humans and between animal species, the barriers are similarly high. So even in this context, humans are nothing special for a pathogen. Any direct or indirect contact can lead to transmission. In direct contact, we have aerosol transmissions, i.e., droplet infection; secretions and excretions also play a role. Then we have vectors, for example, insects, mosquitoes, ticks, and there is direct transmission through bites or injuries, which we know from rabies.” Your browser does not support the audio! The worldwide air transportation network: a global host mobility network. Each node represents an airport location, the links between the nodes are connections between these airports. Due to increased global mobility, the geographical distance to the initial point of an outbreak often no longer correlates with the theoretically expected time of arrival at another location in the world. Mathematical models and algorithms take into account global connectivity. Computer simulations can be used to make statistical predictions on the spatio-temporal pattern of modern, global disease dynamics. Source: Dirk Brockmann, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin / Robert Koch-Institut To model a disease outbreak, often the geographical distance to an initial outbreak location of a pandemic is used. The concept of effective distance takes into account the actual global connectivity. Here, a model of the H1N1 swine flu outbreak in 2009 (A) is compared to a model of the SARS outbreak in 2003 (B). Compared to the actual spread of H1N1 and SARS, models based on effective distance provided more accurate predictions of the rate of spread than models based on geographical distance. Effective distance thus allows better prediction of pandemic arrival times at further locations. Source: Dirk Brockmann, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin / Robert Koch-Institut The plague, for instance, is caused by a bacterium that occurs in rats and mice and is transmitted to humans via fleas. Examples of viruses are human influenza viruses, bird flu viruses, swine flu viruses, SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). According to the current state of knowledge, the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) coronavirus was probably transmitted from bats to humans. The reservoir of the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) coronavirus is considered to be dromedary camels (single-humped camels). These viruses were transmitted to humans either directly or through another animal species (intermediate host). The HI virus probably originates from primates. Some animal diseases, such as African swine fever, are not dangerous for humans. These pathogens cannot reproduce in humans. Prof. Dr. Thomas Mettenleiter on animal pathogens Audio in German, English translation below “There are generalists, and there are specialists among pathogens. SARS-CoV-2, for example, is more of a generalist, which obviously can infect a whole range of different animal species, including humans. It is different from African swine fever, which is a specialist. That pathogen has adapted to the pig as its main host. So it has precisely two animals in which it can reproduce really well. One is the pig, and second, especially in Africa, the leather tick. This means that the pathogen has adapted in these two contexts, but not to other species, other animals.” Your browser does not support the audio! Animal pathogens and new combinations Triggers for a pandemic can also be new virus combinations, so-called reassortants. In this case, genome fragments from at least two different virus strains mix to form a new virus. Such a virus emerges, for example, from the combination of human influenza viruses of different types or of a human influenza virus and an animal-derived virus. Pigs, in particular, can be carriers and vectors of such new combinations. They are considered a “mixing vessel”, as they can be infected with bird, human, and pig influenza viruses. Prof. Dr. Thomas Mettenleiter on pigs as “mixing vessels” for influenza viruses Audio in German, English translation below “This applies to influenza viruses. Influenza viruses have their natural reservoir in wild waterfowl. It means that influenza viruses are part of their ecology and biology. These virus populations need a certain docking point within the host so they can infect in the first place. Animal influenza viruses have different docking sites than human influenza viruses. The pig is characterized by the fact that it has docking sites for both groups of viruses. This means that it has docking sites for both avian viruses and human viruses. If it happens that both dock onto the same cell, these viruses can exchange genetic material. That leads to new combinations of genetic material and, thus, to the creation of, and I put this in quotation marks, actual 'new' viruses. And we can see this happening all the time. Not only in Asia or in distant countries, but also here in our regions.” Your browser does not support the audio! These pathogens can nevertheless only trigger a pandemic if they are not only transmitted from animal to human, but also from human to human. Since such viruses or bacteria are still unknown to the human immune system, the population lacks basic immunity against their infectious potential. This is what makes a pandemic without drugs and vaccines so unpredictable at first. Our living conditions do matter Scientists speak of zoonoses when pathogens are transmitted between animals and humans. The term is derived from the Greek words zoon = living being, and nosos = disease. Zoonoses can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, or prions. Classic examples of zoonoses are plague, rabies, tuberculosis, malaria, or salmonellosis. In the case of salmonellosis, the pathogen usually comes from laying hens and is transmitted via contaminated food. In humans, the pathogen then causes infectious diarrhea. Prof. Dr. Thomas Mettenleiter on zoonoses Audio in German, English translation below “If you read the zoonoses report, it is at least true for Germany that most zoonoses do not come from wild animals, but from farm animals. Most zoonotic infections here in Germany are food-borne infections with Salmonella or Campylobacter bacteria caused by eating contaminated food. New pathogens, in fact, very often come from wild animal reservoirs. This simply has to do with the fact that we know much less about our wild animals and the pathogens they carry than we do about farm animals and their pathogens. And again, every animal species has its own pathogen spectrum, i. e. its own specific pathogens.” Your browser does not support the audio! The conditions under which viruses cross the species barrier are still unclear. However, almost 70 percent of all infectious diseases are caused by pathogens originating from wildlife. The risk of new zoonoses has increased due to our modern living conditions. Factors such as the destruction of nature, mobility, worldwide exchange of goods or population growth favor the development and spread of zoonoses. Humans invade ecosystems, and in areas with adverse socio-economic conditions, humans and animals often live in very close proximity due to poverty. This increases the probability that pathogens spread to humans and infect them. Through global networking, international transport routes, and travel, the pathogens spread very quickly. To illustrate that human, animal, and environmental health are interdependent scientists refer to the “One Health” concept. Prof. Dr. Thomas Mettenleiter on the One Health concept and the role of the environment Audio in German, English translation below “The One Health context is a concept showing that human, animal, and environmental health are very closely related and inseparable. This means that we are moving away from the specialized approach of: there is human medicine, there is veterinary medicine and there is environmental medicine, towards a transdisciplinary approach that unites all three. And that is exactly what we are currently learning in many areas of infectious diseases. The environment plays a multifaceted role in ecology; in other words, how do contact areas between animals and humans develop? The environment plays a significant role here. But of course we also have factors in the environmental field, such as climate change, urbanization, population sizes and population growth, which have a strong and direct influence on the corresponding health care systems and health conditions.” Your browser does not support the audio!

YonhapThe government said Saturday it has confirmed another case of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) in wild birds amid growing concerns over the disease's possible spread to poultry farms. The fourth outbreak of the strain of bird flu this year occurred in Icheon, Gyeonggi Province, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. The disease was found in a sample taken from mandarin ducks captured Tuesday.The administration has banned the entry of people and vehicles within a 500-meter radius of the location where the sample was collected. A transportation ban was issued on farms within a 10-kilometer radius as well. South Korea has raised its guard against the disease since late October, when it found a highly pathogenic H5N8 strain of bird flu near a creek in Cheonan, 92 kilometers south of Seoul. This was the first avian influenza case in the country in 32 months.A few days later, authorities confirmed another case in Yongin, near the capital. The third case was again reported in Cheonan, Tuesday.Highly pathogenic AI is very contagious and can cause severe illness and even death in poultry.The government is currently also investigating six other suspected cases from across the country.

Activity peaks between December and February and can last as late as May. Flu inoculation usually kicks in about two weeks after receiving the shot and lasts about six months.Nationwide, flu-related health care visits last week were only about half the normal rate for early November, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. But the CDC noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has altered patterns when Americans seek medical aid. And it is still early in the season.For more information on free flu shots for veterans, click on the local VA website at charleston.va.gov.USA Today contributed to this story.

The H5N8 avian influenza virus currently poses no risk to humans but the number of outbreaks has been increasing in recent years. This highly pathogenic strain – meaning that it leads to more severe disease in birds rather than it being more easily transmissible – has been identified on several farms in Europe this year and led to the culling of more than 200,000 chickens on a farm in the Netherlands last week. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has also confirmed that three wild geese found dead in Gloucestershire have tested positive for the same highly pathogenic strain of the virus. Experts are currently investigating whether these deaths are linked to the Cheshire outbreak. Defra has raised the risk level for the disease being introduced to poultry premises in the UK from ‘low’ to ‘medium’. The UK’s chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss said the risk to public health is very low and added: “The Food Standards Agency advises that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Bird keepers should remain alert for any signs of disease, report suspected disease immediately and ensure they are maintaining good biosecurity on their premises,” she said. The last outbreak of a highly pathogenic H5N8 hit 29 European countries in 2016-17, including the UK, and led to the culling of millions of poultry across the continent. In Germany alone 900,000 birds were killed. The UK was previously declared free of avian flu in September 2017 and has remained free of highly pathogenic avian influenza since. Northern and eastern Europe is most at risk of an outbreak of H5N8 although the disease may spread to southern and western parts of the continent, the European Centre for Disease Control has said, urging European countries to be on the alert for the disease. The same strain has also been reported in South Korea although experts believe the outbreaks are unlikely to be related. The virus was discovered in samples collected from wild birds last week , the agriculture ministry said in a statement. The ministry said it has ramped up prevention measures to contain a wider spread of bird flu and issued a highly pathogenic avian influenza warning. Dr Holly Shelton, an expert in influenza viruses at the Pirbright Institute, said there had been no significant outbreaks of bird flu in the UK in recent years. But the recent outbreaks in Europe meant the UK was likely to follow the same pattern. “The way bird flu is transmitted is through migratory birds. It’s the prime season for birds summering in Russia and Asia to be making trips to Africa for the winter. A fair number of these paths cross Europe and they stop at various places because it’s a long journey,” she said. She said the authorities have robust measures to tackle outbreaks. “As soon as an outbreak is detected they have a stamping out control method where they isolate the farm, euthanise the birds and put restrictions on animal movements in the local area,” she said. Dr Shelton added that it was important to monitor outbreaks for any potential spread to humans but there have been no recorded cases of this particular strain in humans anywhere in the world. “All influenza viruses have the potential to evolve and generate changes that might cause it to jump into another host species,” she said, adding that these viruses have to undergo multiple changes to make them spread in human populations. “There are no characteristics in H5N8 that give us cause for concern that it might jump from person to person. But we still have to treat the viruses with care as the likelihood of them adapting will increase if they make small jumps into individuals,” she said.

This column analyses the 1918-1920 Spanish flu to gain insights about the expected output losses and downside risks from such an event. It estimates an average output drop of 7% across the globe over the years 1918-1920, increased macroeconomic risks, and an increase in income inequality across countries. The expected real income loss is nearly twice as large for lower-income countries. As for the US, the estimated output fall due to the Spanish flu is small, but the macroeconomic risks are not negligible. Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Authors Wouter Van der Veken Affiliated researcher Ghent University; Analyst National Bank Of Belgium Roberto De Santis Senior Lead Economist, Business Cycle Analysis Division, DG Economics European Central Bank Quantifying the expected output loss due to the spread of Covid-19 and assessing the macroeconomic risks associated with the pandemic are both challenges for the economic profession. In a recent paper (De Santis and Van der Veken 2020), we try to learn from the Great Influenza Pandemic (known also as the Spanish flu), which began in 1918 and persisted until 1920, causing the death of about 40-100 million people across the world (Hatchett et al. 2007, Barro et al. 2020). Pandemic outbreaks are rare events generating non-normal economic effects across countries. Therefore, we employ a non-linear model, covering the vast majority of countries in the world. The model allows us to construct the conditional distribution of real per-capita GDP growth as a function of the Spanish flu mortality rate, which is then used to quantify the impact of the Spanish flu. Impact of the Spanish flu Figure 1 shows the unconditional distribution of real per capita GDP growth using 42 countries on an annual basis. Real per-capita GDP growth is on the horizontal axis and the relative frequency is on the vertical axis. The distributions depicted by the bold and dashed lines use growth rates over the sample period 1901-1929 and the Spanish flu (1918-1920) period, respectively. The distribution over the Spanish flu period is characterised by a relatively higher number of negative growth rates and by a curve, which is more skewed, highlighting the advantage of the non-linear approach. Figure 1 Real per capita GDP growth (%) Source: Figure 1 in De Santis and Van der Veken (2020). By exploiting the death rates across countries due to the Spanish flu and controlling for the death rates due to WWI, Barro et al. (2020) show that the loss in terms of real per-capita GDP for a typical country due to the Spanish flu amounts to 6.0% cumulated over the 1918-1920 period. Using the non-linear model and the same dataset, we corroborate the cumulated drop in economic activity of 7% for the typical country due to the pandemic disease (see expected value in Panel A of Table 1). About 70% of the estimated economic damage occurs in the first year. Table 1 Estimates of the impact of the Spanish flu on real per-capita GDP (%) Source: Tables 1-2 in De Santis and Van der Veken (2020). We also study the downside risks, which ought to be interpreted as output losses in addition to the expected losses. Two measures are computed, associated to a realisation of (1) a ‘bad’ scenario (a draw from the conditional distribution of the GDP growth rate that results in a negative GDP growth rate), and (2) a ‘worse’ scenario (a draw from the 10% worst possible outcomes of the conditional distribution). In the bad scenario, we expect economic activity to drop by 5.5% in 1918 relative to the median, while in the worse scenario, we expect economic activity to drop by an astonishing 19.6% relative to the median (Table 1, Panel A). This is visible in Figure 2, which shows that the left tail of the conditional distribution (i.e. more negative values) of real per-capita GDP growth increases sharply due to the Spanish flu. Figure 2 Estimates of the impact of the Spanish flu on real per capita GDP growth Source: Figure 3 in De Santis and Van der Veken (2020). Impact of the Spanish flu on higher-income and lower-income countries The pandemic flu can increase income inequality across countries, because it has a disproportionate burden on low-skilled workers and because infectious diseases and their associated death toll can spread more rapidly in lower-income countries, given the high healthcare costs and public spending needed to contain the virus. Economists are concerned that pandemic diseases raise inequality. We corroborate this concern. We estimate that the expected real income loss due to the pandemic is twice as large for lower-income countries (9.8%) compared to higher-income countries (4.7%) cumulated between 1918 and 1920 (see expected value in Table 1, Panel B). Furthermore, macroeconomic risks associated with the pandemic, while large for higher-income countries, are immense for lower-income countries (see scenarios in Panel B of Table 1). As for the US, our results (see Panel C of Table 1) are in line with the observation in Burns and Mitchell (1946) and Velde (2020), who argued that the US recession in 1918-1919 was brief and of moderate amplitude. However, the estimates of the macroeconomic risks due to the Spanish flu for the US are not negligible in the case of the worse scenario. Another useful case is Spain, which was one of only a few major European countries to remain neutral during WWI. The media in this country could report freely and in depth on the developments of the pandemic. This explains why the pandemic became commonly known as the ‘Spanish flu’. Our results show that the output loss in Spain was rather large, together with the associated downside risks in economic activity. Death rates used as regressors These results rely on the hypothesis that the death rates during the Spanish flu do not depend on government policies affecting economic activity. To the extent that policies aimed at reducing the spread of the influenza virus caused a drop in output, the impact of the Spanish flu on economic activity would be underestimated. In this case, the estimates would not only reflect the negative impact of death rates on economic activity, but they would also capture the positive relation between both variables induced by the policy measures (e.g. lockdown measures). We believe that this problem during the Spanish flu is negligible for three main reasons related to: (1) the structure of the global economy, which was more dependent on agriculture and manufacturing, and the lack of generalised lockdown measures; (2) communication, including the wartime censorship; and (3) the influence of WWI on economic activity. By searching for detailed information on the US Library of Congress tool ‘Chronicling America’ as well as other public means, we concluded that governments across the globe did not impose the closure of non-essential businesses during the Spanish flu period, but mostly adopted social distancing measures, which affected business activities such as theatres, picture houses, and music halls that accounted for a marginal fraction of real GDP globally. At that time, most of the communication was channelled through newspapers. In several countries, in order to maintain morale, wartime censors refused newspapers to report on the disease and its severity. At the time, WWI was at its end. It was unconceivable to shut down non-essential businesses. Governments could not afford it. There may have been considerable social as well as economic pressures to stay on the job (IMF 2006). In the US, the private sector even asked employees to work on Sundays to fulfil the war-related demand despite the scarcity of labour, as workers became ill. Lessons for the COVID-19 pandemic Studies assessing the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are growing fast. We tried to gain insights from the Spanish flu, an episode for which we estimate a large output loss together with high downside risks. These potential extreme economic losses, which a country could face, can explain the request for swift policy actions by lead economists and policymakers around the world and the prompt for large fiscal and monetary policy interventions globally, after the spread of COVID-19 in 2020. Although the mortality rate due to the COVID-19 pandemic will be much lower, due to the health infrastructure, the stringent lockdown measures, and the general knowledge about the disease, the insights from the Spanish flu should not be dismissed. The risk of a sharp fall in economic activity close to two digits is real. If one could isolate the impact of government macroeconomic policies introduced to counteract the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy, one might even expect a larger output loss, given the adverse impact of the pandemic on international supply chains, due to the restrictions on international travel, and the sizeable role of services in the global economy, which are more affected by social distancing measures. Finally, our results support the view of international economic organisations, such as the World Bank and the United Nation Development Programme (UNDP), which argue that the COVID-19 pandemic will leave deep scars in lower-income countries, unless urgent policy action is taken with support from the international community.

Endnotes 1 The dataset is available on the Harvard website: https://scholar.harvard.edu/barro/publications/barro-ursua-macroeconomic-data 2 The extent to which the expected value of that distribution drops in response to the presence of Spanish flu deaths indicates how strongly one can expect GDP to fall due to the Spanish flu in each particular country and year. Similarly, the extent to which the left tail of this conditional distribution becomes more important as flu deaths arise, allows us to quantify how strongly macroeconomic risk responds to the Spanish flu. For the quantification of macroeconomic risk based on the left tail, we either use the part of the distribution that covers negative growth rates (i.e. ‘bad scenario’, cf. infra) or the part of the distribution that covers the 10% most adverse outcomes (i.e. ‘worse scenario’, cf. infra). 3 The macroeconomic risk is computed by subtracting the median to control for a potential shift of the central tendency. To estimate the impact of the Spanish flu, we subtract from the macroeconomic risk a similar measure conditioning on the observed aggregate war death rates but setting at zero the flu death rates. For technical details see De Santis and Van der Veken (2020). 4 A poll of economists found that the vast majority are concerned that COVID-19 will raise inequality (see http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/inequality-and-the-covid-19-crisis/).

(2020). 6 See https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/ 7 Only one out of 17 US cities declared general business closures (Hatchett 2007). Only prophylactic measures were taken to reduce the spread of the Spanish flu (World Bank 2020, pg. 135). 8 In support of our assumption, Velde (2020) finds that the epidemic and public health interventions had small negative to zero effects on US retail sales, employment, pig-iron production, and bank loans. 9 As far models focusing on output, Ludvigson et al. (2020) quantify the macroeconomic impact of Covid-19 in the US, Chudik et al. (2020) develop a multi-country econometric model, and McKibbin and Fernando (2020) explore the global macroeconomic effects using scenarios analysis. 10 See the collection of articles in Baldwin and di Mauro (2020). 4,094 Reads Authors Wouter Van der Veken Affiliated researcher Ghent University; Analyst National Bank Of Belgium Roberto De Santis Senior Lead Economist, Business Cycle Analysis Division, DG Economics European Central Bank Themes COVID-19 Economic history Keywords Coronavirus Covid-19 Spanish flu Pandemic Influenza Output loss downside risks Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn VoxEU Column Learning lessons from government guarantee programmes for bank lending to firms Jin Cao Linda S.

All rights reserved.wellness9 Ways to Survive Cold and Flu Season, According to a PediatricianBy Dara Katz•Published Nov 13, 2020If the past year taught parents anything, it’s to expect the unexpected. Schools closed? Remote learning it is! Sophia L.’s mom tested positive for COVID-19? Scratch that weekly toddler pod. And who’d have thought you could get your 3-year-old to wear a mask at the playground without throwing it into the sandbox?! But there’s one thing we can always expect come winter: cold and flu season. So, amid all the COVID-19 chaos, how do we also keep our kids safe from these other impending viruses? We chatted with Dr. Allie Effron, MD, pediatrician and co-founder of Greater Cleveland Pediatrics about the smartest ways to get through cold and flu season. Here’s what she told us. (Psst: Dr. Allie’s @askDrAllie Instagram account is also worth a follow for fantastic and easy-to-follow advice.)1. Buy a hand soap your kids love“No, seriously. Handwashing is a proven way of killing germs and staying healthy, so why not make it a little more fun for your kids? Whether it's a fun scent or cool character on the bottle, let your kids pick their favorite so that the next time you say ‘wash your hands,’ they run for the sink. Pro-tip: try a foaming hand soap for new, sensory fun.” 2. Follow the Norwegians“I’m part-Norwegian, and something they say in Norway is, ‘There’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing.’ That’s right, spending time outside, even in chilly weather, is actually good for your health. Studies have shown the positive health effects of spending time in nature, with some research even suggesting that your immune system actually functions better after spending time outdoors. So please, ignore your mother who insists you’ll catch a cold from the cold, and instead have fun exploring the great outdoors. (Just please bundle up to avoid frostbite.)” 3. Get a flu shot“We pediatricians work hard on preventing disease before it happens, and a flu vaccine is one of the best preventative measures you can take for your family this winter. The CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend a flu vaccine for everyone over 6 months old. While we know the vaccine is not 100 percent effective, recent research estimates the influenza vaccine reduces pediatric influenza hospitalizations by 40 to 60 percent. This is especially important right now during the COVID-19 pandemic—decreasing influenza hospitalizations leaves more resources available to combat coronavirus and other healthcare needs.”4. Catch some Zzz’s “I get so many questions about what we can do to ‘boost’ our immune systems. It turns out, one of the most effective ways to keep your immune system functioning at its best is good old-fashioned sleep. Even minor sleep deficits can leave your body more susceptible to infection. While eight hours of sleep per night is the general recommendation for adults, school-aged children may need closer to 12 hours, and toddlers may need even more. So despite everything else going on around us right now, try to prioritize a regular sleep schedule for your family.” 5. Stay hydrated“Your skin is considered the largest organ in your body, and you may be surprised to learn that it plays a big role in your immune system. Staying hydrated helps keep your skin and mucous membranes moist and intact, which means fewer open areas where pathogens can enter and cause infection. This is especially important in children, who are more likely to pick and rub dry noses and lips. Consider a nasal saline spray to keep nasal passages moist and clear, and a lip balm to protect chapped lips.”6. Treat a cough with honey“If your child develops a cough this winter, try reaching for the honey in your kitchen cabinet. Most over-the-counter cough medications are not recommended for children, due to the risk of severe side-effects. While there are some safer options, they nearly all share a common ingredient: honey. Honey, which has known anti-inflammatory properties, has been shown to decrease cough symptoms in kids. While it won’t remove your child’s underlying infection, honey may help keep symptoms mild while their immune system goes to work. (Though be sure to avoid honey in children under 1-year-old due to the risk of botulism.)” 7. Don’t focus too much on the thermometer“With all the focus on temperatures this year, you may find yourself checking your child’s temperature more than usual. Don’t forget, a fever in older, otherwise healthy children is rarely dangerous and is often protective in fighting disease. This means there’s no need to reach for the fever medications if your child is running around and playing, even with a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit. It’s a different story in infants, however, so please call your doctor right away if your infant is 3 months old or younger and has a fever, or if you ever have any concerns about dehydration or lethargy. Check out more information about fevers from the American Academy of Pediatrics.”8. Have a plan“Kids get sick at the most inopportune times. Find out in advance how to reach your child’s medical office after-hours so you’re prepared for any scary symptoms overnight.”9. Don’t forget your mask“Yes, we have all heard about the benefits of mask-wearing for preventing the spread of coronavirus. But did you know that most mask research was actually done on preventing spread of influenza and other respiratory infections? If your kids are having trouble keeping their masks on, try practicing with dolls and stuffed animals. Young children learn best through play, and a mask-wearing doll can provide comfort to a child trying to figure out this new accessory.” RELATED RELATED Where to Buy Face Masks for Kids Dara KatzExecutive EditorLifestyle editor and writer with a knack for long-form piecesHas more than a decade of experience in digital media and lifestyle content on the page, podcast and on-cameraStudied English at University of Michigan, Ann Arborread full bioOp-Ed: Wake Up, America: I Was Young and Healthy.

While the 2020 election is blessedly over, the pandemic sadly is not. Cases are spiking at alarming levels all over the country—increasingly from small family gatherings which will happen more frequently in the coming weeks. I get it, we’re all tired of the pandemic. The endless months of restricted living. The masks, the worry, the terribly inadequate federal response that’s forced each of us to become amateur epidemiologists and virologists in order to calculate the risk of everything from a walk with a friend to the prospect of a flight across the country. It is bone-deep exhausting. And, just when you feel like you can’t take any more, here come the grueling winter months. And the holidays. But here’s the thing: You have to keep doing the right things. You cannot risk ending up in an ICU at peak capacity. You cannot risk a lifetime of permanent health conditions. You cannot risk knowing your actions left someone you love with a lifetime of health problems or worse, ended their life. Being on a ventilator in an intensive care unit even in non-crisis conditions is a terror you shouldn’t wish on anybody. I know. In early 2014, I was young, relatively healthy, and I caught influenza. The flu led to pneumonia, hospitalization, and secondary complications that put me close to death and cost me most of my left leg. I wish I could make people understand the visceral terror of being on a ventilator, of drowning in your own lungs, gasping for your next breath—of the full-body gag of having fluids suctioned out of your chest and the inability to say, do or communicate anything while this happens. I wish people understood the importance of having family in the room at those moments, of having someone you know and love—through the haze of heavy drugs—to hold your hand, pat your head, and just be a presence amidst the surreal nightmare that is you desperately clinging to life. I also wish I could make people understand the importance of having highly-trained, attentive, caring, and well-rested medical staff with you in those intensely tenuous moments—the deep, spiritual relief of knowing the doctors and nurses know you, care about you, are doing everything they can to make you even a tiny bit more comfortable, stable, and able to find the strength to just keep breathing. But as cases climb and hospitals get inundated with COVID patients, that kind of care becomes impossible to deliver. At some point, there simply isn’t enough medical staff to give the intensive care needed to live through and survive the intensive care unit. If you contract coronavirus now, your ICU nurse might really be a labor-and-delivery nurse who’s been reassigned out of desperation and has all of the compassion and dedication in the world, but not the exact training for this moment where you teeter between life and death. The same goes for the doctor or the overworked respiratory staff. This is why “flattening the curve” was so important in the pandemic’s early days and is even more urgent right now. The reason death rates had declined is because time allowed science and doctors to determine better ways of treating the worst cases, and the patients with the worst cases had the benefit of the right doctors with the time to treat them. In no way has this virus lightened up, gone away or otherwise lessened. This virus is as relentless as a midwestern winter. And you still have a target on your back whether you believe all of this or not. People have become numb to the statistics. You see there have been 237,000 victims and it maybe feels no differently than when there were 236,000 victims, or 6,000. But those are people, not statistics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there were 38,000 influenza-associated deaths in the US. If I had become 38,001, you wouldn’t be reading this. But you are, and so hear me out. I very narrowly avoided being just another statistic because I could get the care I needed without the all-encompassing swarm of a pandemic. Loved ones could be with me. Staff was rested, attentive, and able to help me survive in those crucial moments where I almost didn’t. Seem scary? It is. I know you’re tired of this. By now, what you haven’t watched yet on Netflix is a wasteland. Cooking went from novelty to torture. All you want is a night of fun, some hugs, and maybe a good cry on the shoulder of someone who’s not in your “bubble.” I want those things too. I’m not going home for the holidays. I haven’t seen most of my family for nearly a year. I want this to end more than anything but I also want it to end with those I know and love being able to celebrate with me again. So please, please, take this seriously. Believe science, and keep socially distanced. Nothing is worth the risk of dying alone gasping for breath and wishing you could hold someone’s hand one more time. Nothing.

All pupils from Reception to Year 7 are eligible for the free flu vaccination this year, delivered via a quick and painless nasal spray, and parents should return their child’s consent form as soon as possible to ensure they don't miss out. Vaccinations are scheduled to take place throughout the autumn term. Last week, nurses from Vaccination UK visited Goldthorn Park Primary School, Palmers Cross Primary School, Woodfield Primary School, Springdale Primary School, St Michael's Catholic Primary Academy, Warstones Primary School, Bantock Primary School, The Royal School Wolverhampton (Primary) and St Matthias (Year 7). This week they are visiting Merridale Primary School and Nishkam Primary School on Monday 9 November, Uplands Junior School and Westacre Infant School on Tuesday 10 November, Elston Hall Primary School on Wednesday 11 November, St Luke's Church of England Primary School and Wolverhampton Grammar School (primary phase) on Thursday 12 November and Hill Avenue Academy and St Bartholomew's Church of England Primary School on Friday 13 November. Full details of the Vaccination UK schedule, including which schools are due to be visited when, is available at Flu Vaccines. Parents can also download a consent form online if they have mislaid theirs. Any child who has missed their free vaccine at schools which have already been visited by nurses from Vaccination UK can get it at their GP or by attending one of a number of catch-up clinics. These are scheduled to take place at Christ the King Church on 21 November, Park Village Education Centre on 28 November and 19 December and Phoenix Health Centre on 5 December. The award winning Flu Fighters campaign is back for a third year to encourage children to get vaccinated, with free copies of this year's out of this world storybook, Flu Fighters in Close Encounters of the Germed Kind, being distributed to all primary aged pupils. All pupils, including those in Year 7, will also receive consent forms and information about the nasal spray. Councillor Jasbir Jaspal, the City of Wolverhampton Council's Cabinet Member for Public Health and Wellbeing, said: "We're delighted that the flu vaccination campaign is going so well in our schools – and this year, more than ever, it's vital that you ensure your child doesn’t miss out. "Flu can be deadly and easily spread by children and adults. The vaccine is the best way to protect your children and other family members from becoming ill with the flu, particularly more vulnerable relatives like grandparents or those with underlying health conditions. "I would urge parents to return their consent forms as soon as they receive them so that their children can have their free vaccine and become a Flu Fighter!" To find out more about the vaccine, and to read and download free copies of the first two Flu Fighters books, Flu Fighters Versus Chilly, Achy and Snotty and Flu Fighters in The Battle of Planet Bogey, please visit Flu Vaccines. The free nasal spray is also available to children aged 2 and 3, and children aged 11 and over with some long term health conditions, via GPs. Adults people with long-term health conditions, people who were shielding from coronavirus and their families, the over 65s, carers and care staff, people in long-stay care and pregnant women are also eligible for free flu jabs through their GP or pharmacist.

(Screen capture) With flu season underway, officials from the Department of Health will be available to administer the influenza vaccine at three public sites this week and said Monday that the department is putting plans in place to roll out the COVID-19 vaccine. Those plans should be finalized by the end of the month. According to DOH Immunization Director Monife Stout, getting the flu shot helps prevent residents from contracting the flu and COVID-19 simultaneously. “Immunity to influenza is crucial to preventing higher rates of death as a result of COVID-19 infections,” she said at a press briefing on Monday. “Collectively the world is fighting to stop an alarming death rate brought about by COVID-19 infection and as such, it is imperative to get the flu vaccine to avoid co-infection of COVID and influenza.” Stout said the Centers for Disease Control are issuing an additional supply of the influenza vaccine to the territory and across the nation to help with increased outreach efforts as the flu season progresses. Vaccination sites are set up on: – Tuesday, Nov. 10, at the DeCastro Clinic on St. John; – Thursday, Nov. 12, at the Marley and Walter Hodge housing communities on St. Croix; – Friday, Nov. 13, at the center court in Tutu Park Mall. All sites will be open from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The vaccines are free, or available at a nominal fee. Stout made it clear that the territory will follow all CDC guidelines for the release of a COVID-19 vaccine that has been vetted and deemed safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Until then, however, Health is still responsible for helping to develop a rollout plan dealing with establishing locations for distribution, provider participation, the purchasing of necessary equipment and supplies, staffing and data and reporting, among other things. Some manufacturers also require specific storage procedures and handling, which also must be considered during the planning effort, she said. “Vaccination will be conducted in phases, with the most vulnerable populations addressed first, then the wider public and children,” Stout said. “The availability of a vaccine is projected as early as this month, then will increase through the spring of 2021 for the general population.” During the first phase of administration, front-line workers, medical staff, the elderly and those with chronic diseases or preexisting conditions will be eligible to receive the vaccine. The second phase will target specific populations that have challenges with access, such as the chronic homeless. The general population, followed by children, will be included in the third phase, she said. During the news conference, Stout said that so far, the Health Department has tested 25,451 residents and of that amount, 24,012 cases were negative and 1,405 were positive. There are currently 37 active cases territorywide, with 23 reported deaths. Meanwhile, the territory took a step forward on Monday with the reopening of bars and nightclubs, which Government House Communications Director Richard Motta Jr. said could do so in accordance with the following guidelines: – At bars, there should be seated service only, and patrons are not allowed to congregate, stand or sit around the bar area; – Serving alcohol at bar counters is still prohibited. It can be served at tables in designated seating areas only; – In designated seating areas, there should be no more than six people per table, and those tables must be six feet apart; – Alcohol cannot be sold or distributed after 11 p.m., and patrons must leave the establishment by midnight; – Masks and facial coverings are required except when patrons are seated in a designated seating area; – The use of pool tables is permitted, but players must wear a mask and hand sanitizer must be available for them to use; – Live music and DJs are allowed, but only in establishments licensed to do so, and they are not permitted after midnight; – There must be a space of 10 feet between the band and patrons; – Occupancy is capped at 50 percent or 100 customers, whichever is less; and – Cabarets, gentlemen’s clubs and strip clubs will remain closed.

Vaccinations for more than 24,000 Dubai government employees against flu UAE Login / Sign Up Logout Monday, November 11, 2024 Gold / Forex UAE Health People Science Government Education Crime Emergencies Environment Health Transport Weather Ask the Law All Sections Vaccinations for more than 24,000 Dubai government employees against flu The initiative is designed to reduce the risk of influenza during the pandemic Published: November 09, 2020 09:42 Staff report Follow us Image Credit: Supplied In line with Dubai Health Authority’s (DHA) mandate to ensure the safety and well-being of the people of Dubai, the authority is launching an influenza roadshow where it will be visiting 26 government entities in Dubai, with the aim of vaccinating more than 24,000 employees. Dr Hend Al Awadhi, Head of Health Promotion & Education Section at the Public Health Protection Department, DHA, said the roadshow aims to raise awareness about the importance of vaccination amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and encourage more members of the community to get vaccinated, especially those who are at a higher risk of developing influenza complications. “Our main objective is to decrease the burden of influenza and its complications, especially this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our main objective is to decrease the burden of influenza and its complications, especially this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. - Dr Hend Al Awadhi, Head of Health Promotion & Education Section, DHA “We plan to target most government entities in Dubai. So far we have scheduled 26 entities and are aiming to vaccinate 24,113 employees. We will extend the vaccination drive if needed,” said Dr Al Awadhi. The vaccination fee is Dh50 for expats and free of charge for Emirati nationals and residents who are from high-risk groups, which includes: people who are 65 and above, children below five, pregnant women and people of determination. Dr Abdullah Al Rassasi, Head of Preventive Medicine Section at the DHA, said that in addition to vaccinating around 1,114 DHA employees, the DHA’s influenza roadshow has already visited the Public Prosecution - Dubai, Dubai Economy and the Executive Council of Dubai. He added that the DHA team will also be visiting Dubai Customs, Al Bayan Newspaper, Dubai Statistics Centre, Dubai Civil Defence and General Directorate of Residency and Foreign Affairs. Influenza vaccination services at DHA facilities To encourage all members of society to get vaccinated, DHA revealed earlier that it is providing seasonal influenza vaccination across its facilities. DHA is offering vaccinations on an appointment basis in three DHA Medical Fitness Centres - Jumeirah Lake Towers, Uptown Mirdif and City Walk (Smart Salem Centre). The timings are Sunday to Thursday from 7am to 7:30pm. Emiratis and residents can also book an appointment to get vaccinated across a number of DHA primary healthcare centres that include: Al Badaa, Al Lusaily, Al Mankhool, Al Safa, Nad Al Sheba, Zabeel, Mizhar and Twar primary healthcare centres are open Sunday to Thursday from 7:30am to 9:30pm. Al Mamzar Health Centre, which caters to women and pregnant women only is also open from 7:30am to 9:30pm. Al Barsha and Nad Al Hamr 24/7 centres will only offer vaccination services between 7:30am to 9:30pm.Residents can book an appointment for influenza vaccination through the DHA app. For more information they can call the DHA toll-free number 800 342. Vaccination services at private healthcare facilities DHA issued a circular on October 27, 2020, regarding the pricing of flu vaccinations at private health facilities, setting the fee of the seasonal influenza vaccine in private health facilities in Dubai at a maximum of Dh100 inclusive of the related services. This comes in line with the authority’s keenness to make the vaccine available to all members of the community in Dubai. Importance of vaccination Dr Al Awadhi stressed the importance of getting vaccinated as it is the most effective way to prevent influenza and its complications. “Seasonal influenza, which is commonly known as the flu, is an acute viral infection that spreads easily from person-to-person. “Therefore, in addition to getting vaccinated, the best way to prevent it is to avoid close contact with sick people, cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze, wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your eyes or mouth.” Al Awadhi also added that getting a seasonal influenza vaccine (flu shot) is also safe for pregnant women and has many benefits, including preventing influenza and pregnancy complications, decreasing pregnant woman’s risk of being hospitalised by an average of 40 per cent and preventing potential problems that affect the health of the fetus.
