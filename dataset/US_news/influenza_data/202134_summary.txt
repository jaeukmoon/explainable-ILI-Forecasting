Vaccine Recommendations: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine annual influenza vaccination for all individuals aged 6 months and older without contraindications. No preferential recommendation is made for a specific vaccine when multiple licensed and age-appropriate vaccines are available.

Available Vaccines: For the 2021-22 influenza season, inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4s), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) are expected to be available.

COVID-19 Pandemic: The 2021-22 influenza season is expected to overlap with ongoing circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Influenza vaccination can help reduce the prevalence of flu illness, alleviate stress on the healthcare system, and prevent confusion of flu symptoms with COVID-19 symptoms.

Updates: This report reflects discussions and updates from the ACIP public meetings held in October 2020, February 2021, and June 2021. Primary updates include the expectation that all influenza vaccines for the 2021-22 season will be quadrivalent and updates to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) components of the vaccines.

Resources: Additional information on influenza and influenza vaccines can be found through the CDC and ACIP websites, and specific guidance on vaccine planning during the COVID-19 pandemic is available. COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and clinical guidance can also be accessed through the CDC website.
