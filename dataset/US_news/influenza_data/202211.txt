(U.S. Air National Guard photo by Master Sgt. Matt Hecht) News | March 15, 2022 DLA flu vaccine program attributes success to battle rhythm, partnerships By John Dwyer III DLA Troop Support Public Affairs PHILADELPHIA – Thanks to early action and teamwork between Defense Logistics Agency partners, three contracts totaling 3.4 million doses of the influenza vaccine were awarded Feb. 25, meaning DLA will start receiving shipments of the inoculations in August, well ahead of the 2022-2023 flu season. The awards went to three vendors with a total maximum value of $70.4 million and will satisfy the needs of warfighters and eligible dependents around the globe. This year’s award timeline is similar to the 2021-2022 season, including an earlier contract award date that prior years and a steady “battle rhythm” of communication and collaboration with distribution partners, said DLA Troop Support Pharmaceutical Manufacturer and Distributor Division Chief Alex Quinones. Quinones attributed a large part of the success to an earlier timeline for the acquisition process, also used last year, to produce what he called “the most successful season” he’s seen. “The key to all of it was teamwork,” Quinones said. “All the feedback that I got from the [DLA Troop Support Medical] team and the comments from the customers – DHA and the [military] services … they all called it a successful season.” The contracts guarantee a total minimum value of $35.3 million across three vendors – Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline and Seqirus – to ensure Defense Health Agency facilities around the world will have the vaccines in-hand prior to the onset of the flu season. It also gives DLA the flexibility to support emerging requirements such as the 2021 Afghan Medical support mission, Quinones said. “When the Afghan [support] mission came up, we were able to ‘piggyback’ off [the 2021-2022 flu contracts] thanks to the early, multiple awards,” he said. “It allowed a much faster response than a new contract solicitation would have taken by several weeks and stayed within the contracts’ maximum values.”. The other big key to success was good communication and collaboration with DLA Distribution and commercial carriers in making sure the vaccines got to their destinations safely and on time despite COVID-19 impacts on the nation’s distribution networks. “The COVID-19 mission was going on simultaneously with the flu mission … and tied into the Christmas season. They call it the Santa Rush – [commercial carriers] just got bombarded,” DLA Distribution Seasonal Influenza Program Manager Domon Barr said. Taking that into consideration, the DLA team was able to work together to manage orders from the military services within a constrained shipping timeline and keep the mission going, alleviating strain on partners. “By giving [the commercial carrier] that extra day to be able to process other shipments … I think it increased the strength of our partnership,” Barr said. Quinones expressed appreciation to all the partners involved and thinks DLA’s support will continue to improve. “I think knowing how well it went this past year, it’ll be a little easier,” he said. “This is now our regular, routine battle rhythm … the proof is in the pudding.” SHARE PRINT Related Stories DLA ready to ship vaccines for DOD children overseas DLA flu program -

Viral Immunology Volume 13 - 2022 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.722053 Autophagy and Exosome Coordinately Enhance Macrophage M1 Polarization and Recruitment in Influenza A Virus Infection Chengjie Xia1†Weiming Xu1†Xin Ai1Yingqi Zhu1Ping Geng1Yijun Niu1Haiyan Zhu1Wei Zhou2Hai Huang1Xunlong Shi1*1Department of Biological Medicines & Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Immunotherapeutics, Fudan University School of Pharmacy, Shanghai, China2Department of Chemistry, Fudan University, Shanghai, ChinaBackground: Influenza A virus infection results in viral pneumonia, which is often accompanied by the infiltration and recruitment of macrophages, overactivation of inflammatory responses, and obvious cell autophagy and exosome production. However, little is known about the roles of autophagy and exosome production in these inflammatory responses.Methods: In this study, multiple methods, such as flow cytometry, real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immune–fluorescence technology, and western blot, were applied to explore the possible effects of autophagy and exosome production by H1N1-infected host cells.Results: It was observed that a high number of polarized macrophages (CD11b+/F4/80+/CD86+) were recruited to the lung tissues of infected mice, which could be mimicked by tracking the movement of macrophages to H1N1-infected cells in vitro (transwell assays). Furthermore, there was some coordinated upregulation of M1 polarization signs (iNOS/Arg-1 bias) as well as autophagy (LC3) and exosome (CD63) biomarkers in the infected macrophages and epithelial cells. Moreover, exosomes extracted from the supernatant of virus-infected cells were shown to promote the recruitment and polarization of more peritoneal macrophages than the normal group. The fluorescence colocalization of LC3-CD63 and the inhibition of autophagy and exosome signaling pathway further revealed that H1N1 infection seemed to sequentially activate the M1 polarization and recruitment of macrophages via autophagy–exosome dependent pathway.Conclusion: Autophagy and exosome production coordinately enhance the M1 polarization and recruitment of macrophages in influenza virus infection, which also provides potential therapeutic targets.GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT Graphical Abstract In vivo experiment, H1N1 virus infection caused recruitment and M1 polarization of macrophages in the lung, accompanied by the increasement of LC3 and CD63 expression, as autophagy and exosome markers. In vitro experiment, H1N1 virus also promoted the formation of autophagosomes and exosomes in macrophages and epithelial cells. Based on the assumption that autophagosomes could fuse with multivesicular bodies (MVBs) to formulate amphisomes, to induce colocalization of LC3 and CD63 in virus-infected cells. Besides, secreted exosomes were found to induce M1 polarization and recruitment of adjacent macrophages. Moreover, LY294002 and GW4869 inhibited recruitment of macrophages via inhibiting formation/maturation of autophagosomes and exosomes in virus-infected cells.IntroductionInfluenza A viruses (IAVs) are negative-sense, single-stranded, segmented RNA viruses and include several subtypes that are distinguished by the type of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) present on the viral surface. IAVs are a leading cause of respiratory infection and an ongoing threat to public health globally. According to the latest World Health Organization report, annual influenza epidemics are estimated to result in approximately 3–5 million cases of severe illness and approximately 290,000–650,000 respiratory deaths worldwide (1). In extreme cases, primary viral pneumonia with rapid progression leads to lung failure and is associated with a high risk of fatal outcomes (2). Currently available vaccinations and antiviral agents are not effective in tackling this problem (3–5). Therefore, novel and effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of IAV infection are the need of the hour.Overactivation of the host’s innate immune system is a significant factor that causes viral pneumonia (6, 7). Fatal influenza infections activate the innate immune cells of the host, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. These overactivated immune cells secrete numerous inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as IL-6, TNF-α, CXCL1, and CXCL10, which play a crucial role in IAV-induced lung pathology (8–10). Therefore, suppressing these overactivated immune cells could serve as a practical therapeutic approach for viral pneumonia.Macrophages, which are one of the primary sources of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (such as TNF-α and IL6), act as critical modulators of IAV disease severity and the development of lethal pulmonary injury (11–13). Shifts in the phenotype of macrophages between the classically activated (M1, proinflammatory) and alternatively activated (M2, anti-inflammatory) types have been recognized as a crucial factor in the initiation, progression, and termination of numerous inflammatory diseases (14–16), especially influenza virus infection (17–19). In our previous study, we found that a TNF-α inhibitor (20) and a cell autophagy inhibitor (21) were capable of protecting against influenza virus infection, which was possibly related to macrophages. However, the underlying linkage among these factors (influenza, macrophage, autophagy) is yet to be elucidated.This study investigated the possible correlation among macrophage recruitment, M1/M2 polarization, viral replication, autophagy, and exosome production in IAV-infected in vitro and in vivo experimental models.Materials and MethodsChemicals and ReagentsAntibodies against mouse CD11b, F4/80, CD86, and CD206 were obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA). Antibodies against mouse CD63, IL-1β, cleaved IL-1β, caspase-1, and GAPDH were sourced from Affinity Biosciences (Cincinnati, OH, USA). Antibodies against LC3-I/II, p62, and anti-rabbit IgG Fab2 Alexa Fluor® 488 molecular probes were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Antibodies against CD9 (ab92726) and syntenin (ab19903) were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, USA). Unless otherwise specified, HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), and all other chemicals were obtained from Beyotime Biotechnology (Shanghai, China).Experimental H1N1 Infection In VivoMale BALB/c mice (weight: 16-18 g, age: 6-8 weeks) obtained from the Shanghai SLACCAS Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) were housed under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions and provided free access to sterile water and standard mouse chow feed. All experimental protocols were approved by The Animal Experiment Committee of Fudan University (Shanghai, China) (Approval number: 2018-03-WY-SXL-01). All efforts were made to minimize animal pain and discomfort. The number of animals used in the experiment was minimized on a guaranteed basis of sufficient data analysis.The influenza virus A/FM/1/47 (H1N1) was used for the in vivo experiments. This virus strain, isolated from the patients at Fort Monmouth (NJ, USA) during an outbreak in 1947, is a highly virulent, mouse-adapted virus that can cause severe pneumonia, with a high mortality rate in mice. The virus was supplied by the Shanghai Center for Disease Control & Prevention (Shanghai, China) and stored in aliquots at -70°C.Under isoflurane anesthesia, the experimental mice were infected intranasally (i.n.) with 10LD50 (equal to 2.1 × 103 PFU) of influenza virus A/FM/1/47 (H1N1) in a 30-μL-inoculum volume per mouse, and with the normal control mice treated with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM). Three animal experiments are recruited. First, to record the survival rates, the body weight and the survival of mice (n = 10, per group) were recorded daily. Second, the mice (n = 6, per group) on day 4 post-infection were sacrificed. The lung lobes were harvested to calculate the lung/body index, evaluate the lung histopathology score, conduct further experiments (which included quantification of the total protein content, ELISA assay of TNF-α, H&E staining, and immunofluorescence histochemical staining). Third, the mice (n = 6, per group) on day 4 post-infection were anesthetized, and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected to identify the macrophage phenotypes by flow cytometry.Lung HistopathologyOn day 4 post-infection, the mice (n = 6, per group) were euthanized with 10% phenobarbital in the NaCl solution (250 mg/kg), weighed, and sacrificed. The lung lobes were harvested and weighed to calculate the lung/body index. The right lobes were homogenized in PBS buffer for the quantification of the total protein content and TNF-α by using commercial ELISA kits (BD Biosciences). The left lobes were suspended in PBS-buffered formalin and preserved in paraffin blocks as per the standard procedures. Next, tissue sections (10-µm-thick) were prepared, placed on glass slides, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) using conventional techniques. The lung histopathology score was calculated according to the histopathological severity of the analyzed sections of each lung (six separate random fields per tissue section). The scores were assigned as follows: normal = 0; minor = 1; mild= 2; intermediate = 3; and severe = 4 (22, 23).The Phenotype of Macrophages in the BALFOn day 4 post-infection, the BALF was collected thrice by lavage with 0.5-mL ice-cold PBS from the mice (n = 6, per group). The collected BALF was centrifuged at 700 ×g at 4°C for 5 min, and the harvested cells were resuspended in 200-μL PBS. The cells were stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies against the following mouse proteins: CD11b+ and F480+ (macrophages); CD11b+, F480+, and CD86+ (triple positive, M1 phenotype); and CD11b+, F480+, and CD206+ (triple positive, M2 phenotype). The expression of the member proteins was measured on the BD FACSAria II flow cytometer, and the data were analyzed by the CytExpert software.Immunofluorescence Histochemical StainingThe experimental mice (n = 6, per group) on day 4 post-infection were sacrificed, and the lung lobes were harvested to prepare paraffin sections. The paraffin sections of the lung tissues were heated at 65°C for 30 min and washed in dimethyl benzene for 30 min. Then, we used 100%/90%/80%/70% ethanol to hydrate the paraffin sections for 4 min each at room temperature. The paraffin sections were transferred to 10 mM sodium citrate buffer in a 99°C water bath for 20 min, incubated in 3% H2O2 methanol for 15 min, and blocked with a blocking buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology) for 30 min in a 37°C water bath. The paraffin sections were probed with F4/80 and CD11b antibodies (1:1000, fluorescently labeled) at 4°C overnight and stained with DAPI. The paraffin sections were incubated with antibodies against CD63 and LC3 at 4°C overnight, FITC- or Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies at 37°C for 1 h, and stained with DAPI.Experimental H1N1 Infection in Macrophages and Epithelial CellsFor in vitro experiments, the influenza A/PR/8/34 TC adapted (H1N1) was obtained from ATCC (VR,1469 AC) and stored in aliquots at -70°C.Murine and epithelial cells (A549 and BEAS-2B) were obtained from the Cell Bank of Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).Epithelial cells (A549 or BEAS-2B) were cultured in the DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.3 mg/mL l-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco) at 37°C under 5% CO2. The cells were cultured to 80% confluence, supplemented with 0.5 μg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), infected with 10 TCID50 of the H1N1 virus for 2 h, and then transferred to a serum-free culture medium.ANA-1 macrophages and primary peritoneal macrophages (isolated from SPF BALB/c mice) were cultured in the Roswell Park Memorial Institute Medium (RPMI)-1640 media with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.3 mg/mL l-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco) at 37°C under 5% CO2 and infected similarly.Real-Time Quantitative RT-PCR AnalysisAccording to the manufacturer’s instructions, total RNA was isolated from ANA-1 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and then converted into cDNA using the Reverse Transcription Kit (Takara, Japan). qRT-PCR was performed using the StepOne Plus RT-PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using the following thermocycling parameters: 94°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 5 s and 60°C for 30 s (20). We normalized the mRNA levels of iNOS, Arg-1, influenza M gene, IL-1β, IL-13, and Tnf-α to the geometric mean of the Gapdh mRNA levels. The primers used in this study are shown in Table 1. Each group included at least three independent samples.TABLE 1 Table 1 Real-time PCR primers.Western BlottingTotal cellular proteins were extracted from the infected primary macrophages and analyzed by Western blotting. Briefly, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed with RIPA buffer on an ice bath for 1 h. Equal amounts of total protein of each sample (determined by the BCA assay) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with the QuickBlock™ Blocking Buffer (Beyotime) and incubated with an appropriate primary antibody (1:1000 dilution) at 4°C overnight. The PVDF membranes were washed thrice times with TBST and incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution) at 25°C for 1 h. The proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Millipore).Macrophage Recruitment (Transwell) AssayANA-1 macrophage cells (labeled with GFP lentiviral vectors from Genechem, Shanghai, China) were cultivated in the upper chamber of a 24-well Transwell plate (104 cells/well). ANA-1 or BEAS-2B cells (labeled with mRFP-LC3 lentiviral vectors) or A549 cells were cultivated in the lower chamber (105 cells/mL). The cells in the lower chambers were infected with 10 TCID50 of the H1N1 virus for 2 h and then transferred to a fresh culture medium. Macrophage recruitment was evaluated by tracking the movement of GFP+ ANA-1 cells under the Leica EL6000 Microscope (Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH).Cell Immune-Fluorescence Staining AnalysisThe cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde buffer for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min, and blocked with blocking buffer (Beyotime) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were probed with LC3, IL-1β, and CD63 antibodies (1:1000 dilution) at 4°C overnight and subsequently detected with anti-rabbit IgG Fab2 Alexa Fluor® 488 molecular probes (1:2000 dilution). After staining the cell nuclei with DAPI (0.1 µg/mL stock solution) for at least 3 min, the immunofluorescent images were obtained using the Leica EL6000 Microscope (Leica Microsystems).Exosome Extraction and Peritoneal Macrophage Recruitment (Transwell) AssayA549 cells were infected with 10 TCID50 of H1N1 virus (A/PR/8/34, ATCC) for 2 h and then transferred to a fresh culture medium. The supernatant of infected or normal A549 cells was collected and centrifuged at 300 ×g for 10 min, 2,000 ×g for 20 min, and 10,000 ×g for 30 min, which contained the conditioned medium after each centrifugation step. The conditioned medium was collected in a new Seal tube and centrifuged for 70 min at 100,000 ×g, 4°C with the rotor of P70AT in the Hitachi Himac CP100WX Preparative Ultracentrifuge. The precipitate extracted from 80 mL supernatant was redissolved in a 150-μL fresh culture medium and then purified using 70-nm qEV2 size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) columns (H-wayen Biotechnologies, China).The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) established Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV) guidelines for the analysis of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. According to this criterion, we characterized the microscopic appearance, particle size, and specific markers of exosomes (24). The exosome sample was observed under transmission electron microscopy (Hitachi, HT-7700), and the particle diameter and concentration were measured using a particle size analyzer (NanoFCM, N30E). The exosome samples were incubated with FITC-labeled antibodies against CD63 or IgG at 37°C for 30 min and detected using NanoFCM. Other specific markers of exosomes, CD9, and syntenin, were detected by Western blotting.Each male BALB/c mouse (weight: 16-18 g, age: 6-8 weeks) was intra-peritoneal injected with 4% sodium thioglycolate for 2 mL. After 3 days, primary peritoneal macrophages were isolated and cultivated in the upper chamber of 24-well transwell plates (105 cells/well). The lower rooms were filled with a fresh medium containing exosomes, whose concentration was consistent with that of the original culture supernatant. After 24 h, macrophage recruitment was evaluated by counting the numbers of peritoneal macrophages in the lower chambers under a microscope. The cells in the upper and lower chambers were collected to extract total RNA for qRT-PCR analysis.Statistical AnalysesAll statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism for Windows (Version 6.0) and presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The survival of mice was analyzed by the Gehan–Breslow–Wilcoxon test. Meanwhile, the other experimental data were evaluated by the two-tailed Student’s t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni’s test. In all cases, probability levels less than 0.05 (P < 0.05) were considered to indicate statistical significance.ResultsInfluenza Virus Infection Caused Massive Recruitment of M1 Macrophages Into the Lung Tissues of MiceAs shown in Figures 1A, B, the infection with 10 LD50 influenza virus A/FM/1/47 caused 100% mortality and approximately 35% body weight loss within 9 days post-infection. Severe viral pneumonia was observed in the infected mice on Day 4 post-infection, which showed that H1N1 virus infection triggered alveolar tissue destruction (P < 0.01, Figure 1C), pulmonary edema, and hemorrhage (P < 0.01, Figures 1D, E), accompanied by high levels of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α (P < 0.01, Figure 1F).FIGURE 1 Figure 1 High mortality and macrophage-related overactivation of inflammatory responses in infected mice. Mice (n = 6 or 10, per group) were infected with freshly prepared influenza virus A/FM/1/47 (H1N1) strain. Mice (n = 10, per group) and monitored daily for survival and body weight. For lung histopathology, the mice (n = 6, per group) were euthanized with 10% phenobarbital to harvest the whole lungs on day 4 post-infection. (A) Percentage survival. Data below individual survival curves represent the number of survivorsotal number of mice. (B) Bodyweight. Mice were weighed every day. (C) Lung histopathology score. Data were calculated by evaluating the histopathological severity of the analyzed sections of each lung (six separate random fields per tissue section); the scores were assigned as: normal = 0; minor = 1; mild= 2; intermediate = 3; and severe = 4. (D) Lung/body index was calculated as follows: whole lung weight (mg)/body weight. (E, F) The right lobes of the mice were homogenized to quantify the total protein (E) and inflammatory cytokine TNF-α (F). (G-H) Flow cytometric analysis of the macrophage number and phenotype in BALF; macrophages (CD11b and F4/80 positive cells), M1 polarized macrophages (CD11b, F4/80 and CD86 triple-positive cells), and M2 polarized macrophages (CD11b, F4/80 and CD206 triple-positive cells). Mean ± SD from at least three independent experiments are shown. **p < 0.01. (I) H&E staining of the lung tissues. Scale bar: 40 μm. (J) Immunofluorescence histochemical staining of the lung tissues. Scale bar: 50 μm.The results of flow cytometry revealed that these overactivated inflammatory responses correlated positively with the massive macrophage recruitment (nearly 105, CD11b+, F4/80+, P < 0.01) in the BALF of infected mice, of which 95% were of the M1 phenotype (CD11b+, F4/80+, CD86+, triple positive), as shown in Figures 1G, H. Meanwhile, few macrophages were detected in the BALF of normal mice. HE and immunofluorescence histochemical staining of lung tissues further confirmed that the H1N1 virus promoted the recruitment of macrophages (Figures 1I, J). Thus, the recruitment and M1 polarization of macrophages might be involved in influenza virus-induced lung pathological destruction and inflammatory responses.H1N1 Infection Triggered Similar Macrophage Recruitment In-VitroA cell-to-cell transwell assay system was built to explore macrophage recruitment under virus infection conditions (Figure 2A). H1N1 virus-infected ANA-1 macrophages or A549 lung epithelial cells were inoculated in the lower chamber, and GFP-labeled ANA-1 macrophages were cultivated in the upper chamber. GFP+ macrophages were observed to be recruited to the infected cells (macrophages or A549) in a time-dependent manner upon tracking the migration of GFP+ cells (Figures 2B, C). Furthermore, the infected cells and recruited macrophages were markedly aggregated at 48 h post-infection.FIGURE 2 Figure 2 Macrophage recruitment in in-vitro infection experiments. (A) A systematic study of macrophage recruitment using 24-well transwell chambers (8.0-μM membrane). (B) GFP+ ANA-1 recruitment in transwell assays. GFP+ macrophages were inoculated into the upper chambers, while A549 cells or ANA-1 macrophages were inoculated into the lower chambers and infected with influenza PR/8/34. Scale bar: 30 μm. (C) The GFP+ ANA-1 macrophages in the lower chambers were enumerated to evaluate the extent of trans-membrane recruitment of macrophages. No fewer than three fluorescent images were captured and analyzed per group. **p < 0.01.Additionally, owing to more pronounced agglomerations observed in ANA-1 macrophages (Figure 2B), H1N1 infection might trigger more complicated macrophages than those in the A549 cells despite the similarities in the recruitment pattern.Influenza Virus Activated the M1 Polarization of Macrophages and Promoted LC3/CD63/IL1βThe phenotype and other cellular responses in the infected ANA-1 macrophages were explored. A higher proportion of CD86+ phenotype cells were observed in infected ANA-1 cells compared with the uninfected control cells (Figure S1). Subsequently, overall transcriptional analyses of H1N1 replication (M gene), macrophage phenotype marker genes (iNOS: M1 polarized, Arg-1: M2 polarized), and proinflammatory cytokine genes (IL-1β and TNF-α) were performed.As shown in Figures 3A–F, high levels of viral replication (P < 0.01, Figure 3A) were consistent with significant M1 polarization status (>6-fold iNOS and 1.5-fold Arg-1, equivalent to 4-fold iNOS/Arg-1 bias vs. the uninfected samples, P < 0.01, Figures 3B–D) and promoted proinflammatory cytokine transcription (>1.5-fold IL-1β and TNF-α vs. the normal samples, P < 0.01, Figures 3E, F).FIGURE 3 Figure 3 M1 polarization and LC3/CD63/IL-1β analysis of infected ANA-1 macrophages.

(J) Cleaved IL-1β cellular immunofluorescence. Scale bar: 50 μm.Simultaneously, cellular immunofluorescence staining was used to evaluate several possible cell behaviors (LC3: cell autophagy; CD63: exosome; cleaved IL-1β: proinflammatory activation). As shown in Figures 3G–J, remarkable upregulation of LC3 and CD63 indicated autophagy, and exosomes were obviously activated by virus infection. IL-1β cleavage denoted the proinflammatory activation of macrophages. The increased expression and colocalization of LC3 and CD63 were also observed in the lung tissues of H1N1-infected mice with immunofluorescence histochemical staining (Figure 4).FIGURE 4 Figure 4 Autophagy and exosomes in the infected lung tissues. Immunofluorescence histochemical staining of the lung tissue to determine the expression of LC3 (green) and CD63 (red) and their colocalization (yellow). The nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar: 100 μm.Exosomes Possibly Mediated the Recruitment of Macrophages and Their M1 PolarizationThe exosomes were extracted from the supernatant of the normal or H1N1-infected A549 cells, and the purified exosome samples were characterized, as shown in Figure S2. The specific shape of the exosome was observed in both samples by transmission electron microscopy (Hitachi, HT-7700). The mean diameters and concentrations of the exosome samples in the normal and H1N1-infected groups were 76.67 nm and 2.11×109 particles/mL and 83.66 nm and 3.26×1010 particles/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the positive rates of exosome CD63 expression were 20.9%. The specific protein markers, CD9, and syntenin (25), were also detected to identify the exosomes. As shown in Figure 5A, the M1 polarization of peritoneal macrophages was positively correlated with viral replication in a dose-dependent manner. In transwell experiments, exosomes steered the recruitment of more peritoneal macrophages to the lower chamber (Figures 5B, C). Compared with the normal group, the exosomes in the virus-infected group promoted macrophage recruitment to a greater extent (Figure 5C). The phenotypes of the peritoneal macrophages in the upper and lower chambers were analyzed. The exosomes of the infected A549 cells were found to enhance M1 polarization (iNOS/Arg-1, Tnfα/Arg-1, and IL-1β/Arg-1) in a better way (Figure 5D), thereby indicating that exosomes might play an essential role in influenza-mediated macrophage polarization. To exclude the possible interference of residual viruses in the exosomes, the expressions of the M gene in ANA-1 cells directly infected by H1N1 and ANA-1 cells supplemented with exosomes derived from normal or H1N1 infected cells were detected (Figure S3). The M gene level represents the relative amounts of the H1N1 virus. Compared with cells directly infected by H1N1, few viruses were detected in exosome-supplemented macrophages, which implied the presence of few virus particles in the exosomes. However, these exosomes could still promote M1 polarization of the macrophages, thereby suggesting that the stimulation of polarization in the exosome groups might be caused by exosomes themselves rather than the H1N1 virus. The results in Figure S3 also showed that macrophages were more M1 polarized by virus-derived exosomes than by exosomes derived from normal cells, which signified that exosomes produced during viral infection could promote polarization of macrophages to a greater extent. The possible role of remaining virions would be figured out in our future experiments.FIGURE 5 Figure 5 Effects of H1N1 virus infection and exosomes on the polarization and recruitment of peritoneal macrophages. (A) Mouse peritoneal macrophages were infected with a gradient dilution (10-2, 10-3, 10-4) of the H1N1 virus, and total RNA was isolated for the transcriptional analyses of Influenza virus M, iNOS, Arg-1 genes.

(C) Cells in the lower chambers were microscopically observed and counted at 24 h after adding exosomes. Scale bar: 50 μm.

As shown in Figures 6B, C, similar recruitment of GFP+ ANA-1 macrophages was observed in the infected macrophages. This finding suggested that upregulated autophagy by H1N1 enhanced the recruitment of remote macrophages.FIGURE 6 Figure 6 Crosstalk among LC3, CD63, and cleaved IL-1β in macrophage recruitment. (A, B) Transwell assays results showed that LC3 enhanced macrophage recruitment in PR/8/34 infected BEAS-2B cells (A) and ANA-1 cells (B).

GFP+ ANA-1 macrophages in the lower chambers were counted to evaluate the trans-membrane recruitment of macrophages. Scale bar: 50 μm. (H) Cell counting of GFP-positive cells (per 100 cells). No fewer than three fluorescent images were captured and analyzed per group. *p < 0.05. ns, no significance.Based on the role of autophagy and exosome production in macrophage recruitment and M1 polarization, whether autophagy and exosome production coordinately regulated the activation of macrophages was determined. As shown in Figure 6D, remarkable upregulation of LC3 and CD63 was observed in the infected macrophages. Apparent overlaps in fluorescence (yellow arrow) were observed in the margined LC3 (red) and CD63 (green) fluorescence images, which suggested a possible and tight interaction between autophagy and exosome production.The correlation between autophagy and macrophage proinflammatory activation was investigated. As shown in Figure 6E, there was some overlap between the fluorescence images of cleaved IL-1β+ cells and LC3+ cells, and a large proportion of the cleaved IL-1β+ cells were aggregated with the LC3+ cells, which indicated that autophagy steered macrophage recruitment and activation.The overlap between LC3 and CD63 in infected BEAS-2B cells (Figure 6F) and lung tissues (Figure 4) verified the possible interaction between autophagy and exosome production.These aspects were further explored in infected primary peritoneal macrophages using western blotting. As shown in Figure S4, LC3 and CD63 decreased in a similar manner and were accompanied by the accumulation of the autophagy substrate p62 and the augmentation of cleaved IL-1β. This evidence indicated that the canonical autophagic flow was blocked in the infected cells and that LC3 protein likely enhanced exosome production and secretion.When the infected ANA-1 macrophages (lower chambers in transwell experiments) were treated with the autophagy inhibitor LY294002 (1 µM) and the exosome inhibitor GW4869 (1 µM), the recruitment of GFP+ macrophages was significantly reduced (Figures 6G, H).The possible interaction between these functional proteins (LC3 and CD63) was also supported by GeneMANIA Bank (https://genemania.org) network analysis. As shown in Figure 7, possible coexpression of the genes involved in autophagy and exosome production was found.FIGURE 7 Figure 7 Network analysis of autophagy and exosome genes. The possible interactions of the related genes were predicted using the GeneMANIA database (http://genemania.org/).Thus, a possible and sequential activation of macrophages triggered by H1N1 infection in autophagy and exosome-dependent manner was established.DiscussionThis study revealed that autophagy and exosome production are involved in H1N1-induced macrophage recruitment and M1 polarization.Many researchers have reported that inhibiting overactive immune responses can offer protection against H1N1-induced severe viral pneumonia (20, 26–28). However, the detailed interactions among the influenza virus, immune cells, and epithelial cells remain unclear. In this study, M1 polarized macrophage recruitment was observed to be possibly responsible for the exacerbated inflammatory responses and high mortality of the infected mice. In vitro, the transwell experiment system was successfully employed to mimic the recruitment and M1 polarization of the macrophages, which provided a straightforward method to explore the possible crosstalk among the different cells involved in the process of virus infection.Macrophages play an essential role in influenza virus infection. During the infection, alveolar macrophages, as well as neutrophils, perform the function of phagocytizing apoptotic infected cells, thereby arresting viral propagation (29). Alveolar macrophages differ in their susceptibilities to different viral strains. Strains with weak infectivity toward macrophages, such as PR8 (H1N1), exhibit high virulence in mice, perhaps because macrophages are not activated directly by the virus. IAV strains that infect macrophages, such as ST169 (H1N1) and ST602 (H3N2), can stimulate the M1 polarization of macrophages, a phenotype with highly expressed iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines. M1 macrophages also possess enhanced phagocytic ability and are capable of eliminating intracellular pathogens (30). In our study, murine macrophages (ANA-1) and primary peritoneal macrophages were infected by A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and polarized to M1 phenotype with the secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines, thus inducing the polarization and recruitment of more macrophages.In previous studies, cell autophagy has been proven in influenza virus replication and viral pathology (31–34), and inhibiting autophagy has been shown to suppress H3N2 replication in vitro (35). In this study, activation of autophagy (LC3 upregulation) was found to correspond to H1N1 infection and correlated positively with macrophage recruitment. Furthermore, LC3 seemed to induce marked cell infusion (abnormal morphology) and promote macrophage aggregation in response to infection. Thus, autophagy might result in morphological abnormalities in the infected cells and promote macrophage phagocytosis. These results were partly confirmed by other studies, thereby asserting that atypical autophagy induces LC3-associated phagocytosis (36–38). However, the role of autophagy-associated phagocytosis in H1N1 infection needs to be elucidated in the future via an appropriate experimental design. In addition, autophagy can be classified into canonical and noncanonical, both of which are marked by LC3; however, which one plays a dominant role in IAV infection is still obscure. Studies have shown that noncanonical autophagy reduces IAV replication and fusion with endosome and inhibits interferon signaling, which helps control lung inflammation (39). Therefore, further studies are needed to distinguish between canonical and noncanonical autophagy.Exosomes are extracellular vesicles measuring 30-150 nm and are released by almost all cell types, including stem cells (40) and cancer cells. Exosomes are significantly altered in many diseases and physiological states (41–44). In this study, significant upregulation of CD63 (exosome marker) was found in the virus-infected cells. Moreover, exosome production and autophagy pathways exhibited synergies in cellular homeostasis and metastasis (45, 46). Also, an overlap of LC3 and CD63 immunofluorescence imaging was noted in H1N1-infected cells. Some reports have shown that LC3 participates in the production of exosomes known as autophagic exosomes, which function via a mechanism that is independent of canonical macroautophagy (47–49). Autophagosomes can fuse with multivesicular bodies to form amphisomes (50), which in turn fuse with the plasma membrane. The intraluminal vesicles present in the amphisome are released from the cell as exosomes, which carry both viral nucleic acids and proteins and transmit immune signals between cells (51). Employing the transwell method, exosomes from the supernatant of H1N1-infected A549 cells were demonstrated to induce the recruitment and M1 polarization of peritoneal macrophages. This phenomenon was more remarkable than that in the noninfected group and the solvent group. When autophagy and exosome production in the infected macrophages were inhibited with LY294002 and GW4869, the recruitment of GFP+ macrophages was observed to dramatically decrease in a pattern that was quite similar to the one observed in normal cells. These findings indicate that autophagy and exosome production coordinately enhance macrophage recruitment, although the detailed interactions are yet to be clarified.Influenza virus infection induces a severe cytokine storm that releases several proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ. Pro-IL-1β is upregulated by activated NF-κB and then matures into cleaved IL-1β and is secreted under the influence of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3). IL-1β could recruit neutrophils and T cells and induce the epithelial and endothelial cells to produce TNF-α and IL-6, thus aggravating lung inflammation and injury (52). In this study, a cleaved IL-1β antibody was used to label the macrophages, and the possible correlation between autophagy and macrophage proinflammatory activation was explored. Some overlap was seen in the immunofluorescence signals of cleaved IL-1β and LC3, but more IL-1β+ cells were found to be aggregated with the LC3+ cells (Figure 6E), which suggests that upregulated autophagy enhances the activation of M1 macrophages.The exosomes were also purified using 70-nm qEV2 size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) columns and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, the particle diameter, and exosomes markers analysis (NanoFCM and Western blotting). The purified exosome sample from virus-infected cells showed more significant M1 stimulation on macrophages and minor virus replication. However, the possible role of remaining virions would be designed in our future experiments.Based on these results, we propose that autophagy and exosome production coordinately induce M1 polarization and recruitment of the macrophages via a possible autophagic exosome pathway. Exosomes serve as a vehicle for transporting cargo from parental cells to recipient cells. However, the components of the vesicles (LC3, CD63, virus-related proteins, DNA strands, mRNA, microRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs) responsible for these effects have not yet been identified (53–56).This study on autophagy and exosome production in pulmonary cells may shed light on potential therapeutic strategies to manage respiratory diseases caused by the influenza virus and other such viruses. For instance, mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes have been proven to have the potential to cure SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia owing to their anti-inflammatory effects and immune-modulating capabilities (57, 58). Some modulators of autophagy or exosome production may also be used to intervene in disease processes (59) and have implications in the treatment of influenza.Above all, our findings might provide feasible targets for treating influenza virus infection by interfering with macrophage activation and recruitment.Data Availability StatementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics StatementThe animal study was reviewed and approved by The Animal Experiment Committee of Fudan University.Author ContributionsXS designed the study.

You know flu season is ongoing. Every year, usually during the fall and winter, millions of people around the world get sick with the flu, short for influenza. Today, vaccination represents one of the most well-known means to protect humans against the viruses that are each year responsible for hundreds of thousands of seasonal flu infections. Flu viruses, including those in animals, continuously evolve and vaccines may become inefficient against them. To remain effective, new vaccines need to be developed periodically. Every six months, the composition of the human vaccines against flu is reevaluated, based on data collected through the surveillance of virus strains circulating in humans, but also in animals, in particular for the strains that can become zoonotic. Stemming the spread of seasonal flu with vaccination Responsible for around 5 million cases of serious illness, and 290,000 to 650,000 global human deaths annually, seasonal flu continues to be a major public health concern. These annual epidemics are fueled by the flu viruses’ ability to continuously evolve. Their properties can change, the viruses can become more transmissible and current vaccines against them may be less effective. Since the 1940s, 80 years ago, medical research has made available an effective measure to fight the flu: an annual vaccine. Vaccination remains a top recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO), especially for people who are most at risk, and there are many reasons as to why. First off, receiving a flu shot keeps numerous people from getting influenza symptoms, and for those who still get sick, they usually experience less severe illness. As an example, in the United States of America, during the 2019-2020 period, flu vaccination prevented an estimated 7.5 million flu cases. But perhaps the most important reason of all is that getting vaccinated helps mitigate the spread of the disease, by obtaining population immunity. Twice a year, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and its partners contribute to the surveillance of flu viruses in animals including those that have pandemic potential for humans, by collecting and analysing data on these viruses, such as avian influenza. We help ensure that, should these viruses with zoonotic potential make the jump from animals to humans, leading to a pandemic, the appropriate vaccine is rapidly developed with the best protection possible. Considering avian influenza viruses to develop human vaccines Effective vaccination requires that both human and animal sectors conduct significant surveillance and be on the lookout for animal viruses with zoonotic potential, which could possibly not match the strains used in current flu vaccines. When such viruses are found, it is paramount that they are considered to make pre-pandemic vaccines. In this regard, the WHO shares biannual recommendations on the updated composition of flu vaccines, taking into account OIE’s knowledge on the circulation of animal influenza viruses. Animal influenzas, such as avian influenza, share genetic similarities with the human flu viruses. Because of their potential to evolve genetically and be passed to humans, avian influenza viruses are considered a public health concern. Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, and human influenza are linked within a complex system. Their constant evolution calls for significant surveillance to gather the necessary data to develop the vaccines. Setting international standards on surveillance, the OIE works with global partners like WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) as well as its Reference Laboratories to collect scientific information on animal flu viruses. The OIE also encourages countries to report outbreaks of avian influenza and share their data through its World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS). When the animal health sector takes the lead “To ensure that the impact and risks for animals and humans are kept to a minimum, it is vital that the animal health sector takes the lead in monitoring influenza viruses in animals, in analysing the data, and in sharing this information with the international community.”Dr Gounalan Pavade, Scientific coordinator for avian influenza, World Organisation for Animal Health In the process of developing human vaccines, veterinary expertise is key. As a part of its long-standing mandate, the OIE ensures the dissemination of animal health scientific information. This data is collected through WAHIS and supplemented with genetic and antigenic data by OIE Reference laboratories and national animal health laboratories in countries all over the world. This international contribution allows crucial information from the animal health sector to be used by WHO to determine and update their recommendations for human vaccines against flu viruses of concern. A chicken farmer stands proudly with a chicken Moreover, since 2005, the joint OIE-FAO scientific network on animal influenza (OFFLU) works bilaterally with Reference and national laboratories experts worldwide to encourage the publication of data related to animal influenza strains on publicly accessible databases. Undeniably, to analyse and exchange scientific data on animal influenzas with the wider scientific community is crucial to update the vaccines and adapt them to circulating field viruses. And the veterinary work does not stop there. Annually, the OFFLU network provides the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) -those in charge of recommending the strains to use in human flu vaccines- with molecular and epidemiological data to support the selection of the next vaccine’s composition to make human vaccines that could prevent a pandemic. How the pandemic potential of the flu calls for a One Health approach “Avian flu is a very telling example of a disease that can affect both humans and animals. Considering together the epidemiology and the characteristics of the viruses circulating in both animals and humans, and how the transmission patterns can be influenced by the environment, is key to address the disease efficiently: this is the basis of the One Health approach.”Dr Lina Awada, veterinary epidemiologist at the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Over the past few decades, the transmission of flu viruses across different species has been observed. Notably, humans have been infected with bird flu on a number of occasions, including the episode of global concern in 2005/2006 when the subtype H5N1 had a peak of spread to humans. Even if the risk of bird flu transmission to humans remains low, these sporadic zoonotic infections remind us that the threat of an influenza pandemic persists. In this COVID-19 era, we cannot let our guard drop, and must work towards international collaboration on disease control and response, across sectors. To best prepare against a future pandemic, the world must adopt a One Health approach, that considers human health, animal health and environmental health as interdependent. 3 facts about influenzasFlu is short for influenzaThe first known influenza pandemic struck in 1580The first vaccine against the flu was developed 80 years ago, in the 1940s Our latest news Editor's Choice Can we prevent the spread of bird flu?

March 15, 2022 2:04 PM Author | Kara Gavin A sign in a Cincinnati streetcar in 1918 communicates the importance of ventilating homes for preventing airborne disease transmission. (Influenza Archive) The two-year anniversary of the COVID-19 pandemic came and went without much fanfare, thanks to a lull in cases and deaths, and the start of a war in Ukraine that has grabbed the world's attention. But for medical historians who led an exhaustive study of the 1918 influenza pandemic, the recent milestone offers a chance to look back on the parallels, and differences, in how the nation responded to both massive infectious threats. Howard Markel M.D., Ph.D., director of the University of Michigan Medical School's Center for the History of Medicine, along with the center's assistant director Alexander Navarro, Ph.D., led the team that compiled evidence about the impact of different cities' responses to the 1918 flu. Their work, done for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, led to the creation of the online Influenza Encyclopedia of historical articles and images, and to studies that helped shape the "flatten the curve" approach that became famous in the first days of the COVID-19 pandemic. "It amazes me how much we learned from our nation's experience in 1918 and then put into practice in the spring of 2020, as states and local communities implemented a slate of non-pharmaceutical interventions, or NPI, in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID, 'flatten the curve' of cases, and buy the nation time for the development and distribution of vaccines," Navarro said. "I was pleasantly surprised that, despite some pushback, initial compliance seemed to be fairly high." But the success of early efforts when the pandemic was concentrated in major metropolitan areas led to pushback from people in less-affected areas, which persisted even when the pandemic spread to their regions. That's not without historical precedent, Navarro says. "There was certainly pushback to public health orders in 1918 as well, especially when it came to mask mandates, but overall it was much less vociferous, much less organized, and almost completely non-partisan. And this was at a time when death from infectious disease was a much greater part of daily life for Americans, when the etiology and epidemiology of influenza was not well understood, and when there were no effective drug therapies or vaccines for influenza." The nature of the public health and political leadership in different cities in 1918 and 1919 shaped the outcomes for their populations, the U-M researchers found. And the same was true in 2020, 2021 and the most recent wave in early 2022. "With COVID, there is no doubt that we could have done much better as a nation," Navarro said. "Our public health communication and policies have often lacked clarity and focus. Our polity is fractured, impacting our ability to enact solid, science-based public health policies." The way Americans get their information about infectious threats has changed a lot in a century, of course. Printed newspapers, often many in every city, were the main source in the early 1900s – and they relied heavily on statements from elected and public health officials who were looked upon as trusted sources. From the 1918 experience, we learned that good public health policy makes for better public health outcomes. The lesson from our COVID-19 experience is that a divided nation can make good public health policy very difficult to implement and maintain. Alexander Navarro, Ph.D. "Today, Americans get their information from a bevy of sources, some of them trustworthy but many of them not," Navarro said. "Unlike in the Progressive Era, as it was called, where there was a general belief that trust should be put in experts, today many of us are distrustful of government, suspicious of our leaders, and cynical about the motivations of the scientific and medical communities." That has contributed to resistance to, or just disregarding of, measures informed by evolving research on the coronavirus. Markel notes another parallel with the 1918-1919 pandemic: the potential of war to exacerbate the spread of disease. Between the movement of troops and the rapid displacement of civilians from conflict zones, the events in Ukraine and surrounding countries since late February could fan the flames of the pandemic. Markel wrote about this topic in a recent column for PBS Newshour. "No one has any real idea of how the virus may be spreading now," he wrote, noting that data from just before the Russian invasion began showed that case rates and hospitalizations were already high, and vaccination rates low, in both countries. That doesn't mean that the soldiers and refugees in eastern Europe right now are doomed to repeat what their forerunners in World War I did, he wrote. "Unlike our current era, nobody knew much about virology at all back in 1918, and didn't know exactly what caused the flu," he wrote. "Scientists had a better hand on bacteriology, but many experts incorrectly thought influenza was caused by the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae. "They had no medications yet that would work against bacteria – no antibiotics, let alone antivirals, that could have helped in the pandemic," he continued. "There were no intravenous fluids, respirators or intensive care units; nurses and doctors were in short supply; and medical care was more a form of warehousing these young men and women than what we would expect today. Working at these overcrowded base hospitals, let alone finding yourself in one, was a nightmare." Markel cites the work of Victor C. Vaughan, M.D., the U-M Medical School dean of the early 20th Century who investigated the ravages of influenza on American soldiers for the Army. The close and open living quarters of barracks, undersupply of medical personnel, poor nutrition and sanitation for troops, and lack of treatments, helped the virus rip through a young healthy population. Then, as now, "it is safe to say that no one wins if the conflict helps spread the coronavirus," Markel wrote. Even as the war grips the world's attention, Navarro reflects on how lessons from a century ago, and the past two years, will be needed in the future. "From the 1918 experience, we learned that good public health policy makes for better public health outcomes," he said. "The lesson from our COVID-19 experience is that a divided nation can make good public health policy very difficult to implement and maintain. As the world grapples with climate change and as the global population increases, we will likely see a rise in the number of zoonotic spillover events. Any one of these could easily become the next pandemic. Are we prepared for that?" Like Podcasts? Add the Michigan Medicine News Break on iTunes, Google Podcasts or anywhere you listen to podcasts.

Study: Comparison of influenza and COVID-19–associated hospitalizations among children < 18 years old in the United States — FluSurv-NET (October–April 2017–2021) and COVID-NET (October 2020–September 2021).

View Sources Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus cause respiratory disorders, lead to severe disease, and even prove fatal in children. Vaccination against the influenza virus is annually recommended for children older than six months, whereas COVID-19 vaccination is approved only for those aged five years or more. The hospitalization rate for influenza is the highest among the older population (≥ 65 years), followed by adults and children. Similarly, hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among adults than children. Nonetheless, data comparing the COVID-19 hospitalizations to influenza-associated hospitalizations in children are limited. A comprehensive analysis comparing COVID-19- and flu-associated hospitalizations among children could help evaluate mitigation measures and interpret disease burden measures, which could guide the COVID-19 vaccination policy for children aged five years or less. The study In the present study, researchers compared the clinical characteristics, outcomes, and hospitalization rates in children (< 18 years) diagnosed with COVID-19 or seasonal flu in the United States (US). The influenza hospitalization surveillance network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance of flu-associated hospitalizations during each season of influenza (October – April). The COVID-19-associated hospitalization surveillance network (COVID-NET) started similar surveillance in March 2020. FluSurv-NET surveillance covered people from 14 states with a catchment population of 29 million people during the 2017-18 – 2020-21 seasons. COVID-NET conducted surveillance in all counties as FluSurv-NET with a catchment population of 32 million. A COVID-NET or FluSurv-NET case was defined as any hospitalized patient in the catchment area, as mentioned earlier, with positive influenza or SARS-CoV-2 test during or <14 days before hospitalization. Hospitalized patients’ data on demography, clinical characteristics, clinical interventions like mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and outcomes such as pneumonia or intensive care unit (ICU) admission or in situ death were obtained by medical record abstractions. Hospitalizations were enumerated monthly for influenza seasons between October 2017 and April 2021 and COVID-19 from March 2020 to September 2021. The COVID-19 hospitalization rate was calculated for one year between October 1, 2020, and September 30, 2021, and compared with influenza. Seasonal hospitalization rates of influenza represented annual figures. Results Throughout the 2017-18 – 2019-20 seasons, 6774 children were hospitalized with flu, and 3461 were hospitalized with COVID-19 from October 2020 to September 2021. The median age of hospitalized children was three years for influenza compared to 9 years for COVID-19. Nearly 97% of children with flu presented at least one symptom at the time of admission, while 79.7% of COVID-19 cases developed one symptom at least. More than 55% of influenza cases and >53% COVID-19 cases had one underlying medical condition, with asthma, neurologic disorders, and obesity being the most prevalent conditions for flu and COVID-19 patients.

This decrease in influenza-related hospitalizations coincided with the introduction of COVID-19-related measures (school closures, for instance). Only nine flu-associated hospitalizations were recorded in the October 2020 – April 2021 season. COVID-19-related hospitalizations ranged between 22 – 470 every month during the study period. The flu-related hospitalization rate in children aged 0 – 4 years during 2017-18, 2018-19 seasons was similar to the annual rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations; however, it was higher in the 2019-20 season than the annual COVID-19 hospitalization rate. In those aged 5 – 11 years, the COVID-19 and influenza hospitalization rates were comparable, whereas, in adolescents (12 – 17 age group), hospitalization rates were lower in all influenza seasons than the COVID-19 hospitalization rate. The median length of stay in the hospital was shorter for flu patients (2 days) than for COVID-19 cases (3 days). Pneumonia rate was higher in flu patients than COVID-19 cases, while children requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation support were fewer for influenza than COVID-19. The in-hospital mortality rate for flu and COVID-19 was similar. Conclusions Overall, the findings showed that the rate of influenza-associated hospitalizations was relatively lower in three seasons before the onset of the pandemic than the annual rate of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and also noted age-wise differences. Severe clinical outcome, in general, was comparable among children with COVID-19 and those with flu. The low rate of flu-related hospitalizations during the pandemic might be attributed to the COVID-19-related measures such as physical distancing, face masks, and virtual education. Notably, a typical seasonal pattern was observed for influenza, and such seasonality was absent for COVID-19, with infections spreading throughout the year. Moreover, both influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infections can cause hospitalization with severe outcomes, and vaccinations against the two viruses can prevent disease and attenuate disease severity. According to the authors, preventive measures should be strictly adhered to and are essential to protecting children, particularly those ineligible for COVID-19 and flu vaccines.

Despite lockdowns holding it at bay, a small group of scientists is searching the globe for deadly new strains – and to work out what to put in next winter’s vaccinesBy Sarah Boseley. Portraits: David LeveneSat 19 Mar 2022 07.00 GMTShareLast month, a small group of international scientists met to decide an issue critical to the health of millions of people all over the planet. For once, it wasn’t about coronavirus, although these experts know a lot about that, too. The task in hand was to save us from a bug we’ve been fighting since before the days of Hippocrates, the first doctor to describe it in 400BC. It’s an adversary potentially as much of a threat as Covid. These scientists are the flu hunters – heads of a handful of international institutions who track this old foe as it evolves and disperses in its own fight for survival.This crucial annual meeting was held, for the first time since Covid struck, in the plateglass anonymity of the World Health Organization building in Geneva, with a few participants on Zoom. The scientists came armed with mountains of data and decades of experience to decide which four strains of the flu virus circling the globe should be in the next flu vaccine, to protect us from illness and our healthcare systems from buckling. Each has their own opinion and there can be wrangling and even some political positioning. Experts from China, the US, Australia, Japan and Russia are involved. It’s not always easy. But on 25 February, with what surely ought to have been a white puff of pontifical smoke, they made their recommendation public. Many thousands of lives will be saved – if they have got it right.Chairing the meeting was British virologist Dr John McCauley, who has attended these meetings for more than a decade – usually in person. “It’s hard not on Zoom, but it’s awful on Zoom,” he says with a grimace. McCauley, who is in his 60s, grey-haired and jocular, has spent a lifetime watching the devious twists and turns of the shapeshifting virus. Since 2009, he has been director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre in London, based at the Francis Crick Institute next to St Pancras station. And in the months leading up to the meeting, he was busy taking delivery of large numbers of boxes of carefully packaged, potentially lethal human flu virus samples from 90 centres, mostly in Europe. In a normal year – and the last two have been far from normal – the Crick receives 120 or 130 shipments, containing about 5,000 samples. Other boxes stacked ready to be shipped out contain viruses destined for labs in other countries, where scientists will compare them with their own samples. The labels are a story of friendship, colonialism and cooperation: Cyprus, Valladolid, a pre-war St Petersburg.Flu hunters know better than to underestimate their enemy. If you can’t see it just now, it’s probably only hiding“There are periods in which we’re very busy and periods in which we’re extremely busy,” McCauley says. He patiently explains the complexities of the virus, with just an occasional flash of suppressed irritation at this interruption to his lifesaving work. He strides briskly in his white coat between his small glass office overlooking the institute’s atrium and the dark, closed-off labs behind it. Entry to the labs is restricted whenever there is live flu virus around.In January, the trickle of flu virus samples becomes a flood. Cardboard boxes containing the evidence of its latest mutations are brought in and transferred to freezers at -80C, where they will last for a couple of weeks while lab staff get to work. For what they have to do, the word “testing” is inadequate, McCauley’s frown makes clear. It’s about “isolating the virus, propagating the virus, doing the genetic analysis, doing the antigenic analysis, doing the drug resistance analysis, on all of these,” he says. McCauley must work out how the virus is changing so that he can inform the February meeting.This year something unusual has been happening. There has hardly been any flu for the past two winters. There’s even speculation that some strains have vanished completely. But the flu hunters know better than to underestimate their enemy. If you can’t see it just now, it’s probably only hiding. Flu is a killer. It’s not just a bad cold. Man flu is – well, not flu. If you’re at work and think you’ve got flu, you probably haven’t. A proper bout will keep you in bed for days, unable to do much more than moan. Without vaccines, it would regularly scythe through the population, and occasionally cause pandemics, as it did in 1918, when it killed at least 20 million people (Covid has so far killed an estimated 6 million). And it’s a complicated, slippery foe, one that is very good at evolving or mutating to escape vaccines.There are even two types: B, a historically human variety, and A, the animal sort, which can jump species and cause pandemics. Flu B, McCauley says, “has been with us for 10,000 years”. That’s the one Hippocrates knew about. Flu A, on the other hand, originates in animals and birds. Sometimes people in daily contact with domesticated animals, such as pigs and chickens, pick up the virus. Just before Christmas 2021, 79-year-old Alan Gosling caught bird flu from his Muscovy ducks. About 100 wandered his land in Buckfastleigh, Devon; he fed them and 20 lived in the house. He was the first person in Britain to test positive for an A strain called H5N1. The tragedy for Gosling was that all the birds had to be killed and he was banned from adopting more. The good news for everyone else is that the strain was incapable of spreading from him to any other human.View image in fullscreen‘We’re trying to get some virus in from Hong Kong but there are no flights’: Dr John McCauley, director of the Worldwide ­Influenza Centre in LondonThere has been a lot of bird flu about, in the UK and across Europe, known as “highly pathogenic avian influenza” or HPAI. In England, it started in October in wild swans in Worcester. Wild birds carry the virus; domestic birds pick it up. When it gets into poultry, whole flocks have to be slaughtered. There is always the risk that farm workers in contact with chickens, geese or ducks will contract the virus, as Gosling did.Usually, this bird strain of flu cannot be transmitted from the farm worker to any other human. The nightmare scenario is where the virus evolves again and is able to be passed on. Then you’re in potential pandemic territory. In 1918, the “Spanish flu” came from birds. This was a lethal strain of Flu A called H1N1 that killed scores of soldiers and young people at the end of the first world war – previous infections meant older generations had more immunity to it. The strain stuck around until 1957 or so, but by then it was no longer causing devastation because so many people had been exposed to it.Another strain of H1N1 caused the swine flu pandemic in 2009, which took off in Mexico and the southern US. It caused a massive scare, but far fewer deaths than feared: approximately 400 in the UK and up to half a million worldwide. Bad, but not on the scale of 1918.Pandemic flu is so deadly because it is caused by a bird or animal virus that is totally unknown to the human immune system. As with Sars-CoV2, the cause of Covid-19, viruses kill when we are not prepared for them. Seasonal flus surge in the winter months, when people are huddled together indoors and breathing each other’s air. In a normal year, up to 646,000 people worldwide die of flu.A vaccine against one flu strain won’t always defend against another, which means the shot has to contain a cocktail. The two strains of Flu A in the current vaccine are H1N1 and H3N2. The latter arrived in the 1968 pandemic that began in birds in Hong Kong and killed millions. Each of these strains has evolved different versions, which have complicated code numbers and may also be named after the place they were first spotted, such as Victoria, Yamagata, Texas or Bangladesh. Flu isn’t fussy; it will happily mutate anywhere.So how do you outwit and outflank a virus this adaptable and devilish? How can you stop it in its tracks?Global flu surveillance started in the UK. Back in 1947, the year before the WHO was launched, British virologist Christopher Andrewes, arguably the first flu detective, was involved in talks about the nascent UN organisation’s work. The Spanish flu was a horror story in living memory and tracking influenza a priority. Andrewes was asked to set up a Worldwide Influenza Centre, which he did in 1948 under the auspices of the National Institute for Medical Research in London. In 2016, the NIMR became part of the Francis Crick Institute.Obituaries of Andrewes, who died in 1988, paint him as the archetypal eccentric but brilliant British boffin. “Christopher Andrewes was characteristically seen in a tweed jacket, white hair rather dishevelled, his ruddy face expressing interest, puzzlement, concentration, or fun – never boredom,” wrote fellow virologist, David Tyrrell, who in 1965 discovered the first human coronavirus (a cause of the common cold).Coronaviruses have demonstrated their potential for causing havoc over years. With Sars and Mers, globally we dodged a bulletIn 1933, Andrewes helped discover the influenza A virus. Three years later, 16-year-old Dennis Busby, who had joined the NIMR straight from school as a “lab boy”, received the first ever flu vaccination. He was not paraded for the cameras like Margaret Keenan, the first in the world to receive an approved Covid vaccine. In those days, scientific breakthroughs happened more discreetly, and a vital global breakthrough went unmarked.The stories have become folklore among the virologists who have followed Andrewes down the years – a small group you can’t help thinking were cultivated in the same petri dish. “I knew Dennis Busby,” McCauley says. “He was one of the best virological, technical guys.” Busby went on to become head technician in the bacteriology and virus division of the NIMR, which moved to Mill Hill, London, in 1950. Was it ethical to jab him with an experimental vaccine at an age when most boys are at school? “He prepared it himself,” McCauley says, almost proudly.McCauley’s predecessor-but-one as head of the Worldwide Influenza Centre was Sir John Skehel, an eminent virologist who has shown, among other things, how the influenza virus enters human cells and how antibodies can block it. Skehel ran the centre from 1975 to 1993 and was director of the NIMR until 2006.“Would you like to meet him?” McCauley asks. And there he is, the 81-year-old recipient of a string of awards and honorary degrees, across the atrium from McCauley at the Crick, working in a similar small office, cheerful and welcoming. The two chat about the difficulties in tracking flu caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.“We’re trying to get some virus in from Hong Kong, but there are no flights,” McCauley says.“It’s too bad,” Skehel says. “Hong Kong is an important laboratory. They picked up H5N1 bird flu in 1997.”In the past, Hong Kong has been a window on to what flu is doing in mainland China. It has excellent scientists, often trained in the UK and well known to their British counterparts, and some of the samples they collect are from southern China. As China takes an ever firmer grip of Hong Kong, it’s uncertain whether the UK will continue to get those sorts of insights.Seven WHO global reference centres – the Crick, Atlanta and Memphis in the US, Beijing, Tokyo, Melbourne and Novosibirsk – lead flu surveillance around the world. Five are devoted to human flu; two watch for animal viruses that might jump to humans. They are on the alert for flu outbreaks in chickens in Egypt and pigs in Central America, seeing whether farm workers or families with animals get infected and start to infect others.Feeding into those WHO hubs are national influenza centres. In England, this is run by revered virologist Prof Maria Zambon at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Zambon was one of the key members of the government’s Sage advisory committee during the Covid pandemic, alongside her Imperial College colleague Prof Neil Ferguson. She is also an adviser to the WHO. And she never stops working.View image in fullscreen‘You need a crystal ball, and mismatches happen’: Prof Maria Zambon, head of the UK’s national influenza centreDecades ago, Zambon was part of the core influenza group at Mill Hill. There is a “strong historical thread” running from Andrewes to the present day, she says. And she’s not surprised so many of the people she knew a quarter of a century ago, such as Skehel, are still tackling flu. “You fall in love with working on viruses,” she says. “It was a very good start for me because I was surrounded by top-class scientists in a wonderful, collaborative environment. And you take that passion with you.”Even when the world is engulfed in a pandemic caused by a different virus, flu really matters. “Whichever way you look at it, it’s a major public health threat. And we still haven’t quite solved the problem,” Zambon says.She is heavily involved in the response to Covid at UKHSA and Imperial College, where she is co-director of the NIHR health protection research unit. Was she surprised the pandemic that shut down the world was caused not by flu, as scientists had for so long predicted, but coronavirus? “The answer to that is yes,” she says, “and no. Coronaviruses have demonstrated their potential for causing havoc over a number of years.”Zambon helped identify the first Sars virus in 2003, as one of an international team of virologists analysing samples from 436 patients in six countries. In 2012, she led the UK’s efforts to understand another coronavirus, Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome), that turned up in two people who had travelled to the UK and spread to two others. She advised the WHO on it. “With both of those episodes, globally we dodged a bullet,” she says.It’s thanks to all that historical UK influenza effort that the world is in a better place to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Not only is surveillance strong, but so is the UK’s ability to assess how well vaccines are working through the matching of data on immunisation and illness. “We have a vaccine effectiveness system for Covid vaccines that is virtually second to none,” she says.Zambon’s team at the national influenza centre sends the Crick “one or two examples of things that are absolutely representative. And then if we see anything unusual, or a bit weird, we’ll give it to them as well. So they are getting a kind of digest of viruses from us.”View image in fullscreen‘We’ve had two years of basically nothing’: Dr Catherine Moore, head of Welsh flu surveillanceEach of the devolved UK administrations does its own collection and analysis of flu samples, and sends McCauley those they consider interesting. There can be variations in what you find even within regions, says Dr Catherine Moore, who heads flu surveillance at Public Health Wales. Her field is molecular diagnostics, investigating changes in human, viral and microbial genomes to diagnose diseases. She swung into action at the start of the Covid pandemic, developing a molecular assay diagnostics test (PCR) to detect its genetic material (RNA) within a month of the coronavirus being recognised.Moore knows Zambon and McCauley well, and shares their enthusiasm. She is “the current custodian” of a system that has been running for 40 years, she says. It’s “an absolute joy” to be even a small cog in the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).What matters is not the number of flu samples they collect, she says, but gathering high-quality data that can indicate the drift of virus strains, potentially into something different and troublesome. They operate within the hospital system in Wales: “What we want to look at is the severe end of the spectrum.” That’s all the way from a one-night stay to intensive care.Moore has 44 GP practices also feeding in test results. In England, there are 245, organised through a network run by the Royal College of General Practitioners. Since 1967, GPs have collated reports of flu diagnoses from selected practices around the country. In 1994, Zambon was involved in helping with the transition to a system where patients’ flu samples are dispatched to centralised public health laboratories for virological testing. GPs used to be at the sharp end of all of this, swabbing their patients’ throats for flu virus in the way we all now know how to do. Flu is easy to catch, so it was a high-risk occupation. Covid has changed things dramatically, and now people in low-risk groups with flu-like symptoms are able to request home test kits and submit their own samples.View image in fullscreen‘Much less explanation is needed now on how to take a swab’: Prof Simon de Lusignan, who runs England’s GP sample collections network“One of the things the pandemic has done is ensure that much less explanation is needed now on how to take a swab,” says Prof Simon de Lusignan, an academic GP at the University of Oxford who runs the network organising sample collection in England. A charity called TakeATestUK dispatches the flu kit. The patient does the throat swab and posts it off to Zambon’s lab teams for analysis. GPs still feel they need to see some patients in person – such as older people who may have a chest infection, and small babies – but others will be told they are best staying warm, drinking fluids and getting over it at home.The vaccine strain selection meetings at the WHO started in the early 1970s and take place twice a year. In February, they recommend the virus cocktail to go into the northern hemisphere vaccine, with a meeting six months later for the southern hemisphere.The meeting used to recommend three strains. Now, manufacturing technology has improved to accommodate four. It is difficult stuff. Not every virus strain can be grown successfully – traditionally in chicken eggs – in the quantity needed (it is then deactivated). Usually, the committee gets it right, pretty much. “We normally say it’s right something like 70 to 80% of the time, because what you’re trying to do is to match a vaccine strain selection with a moving target,” Zambon says.In early 2018, people with the B Yamagata virus filled half the UK’s intensive care beds. Now it might have shot its boltBut it’s an educated bet. You can see the runners and riders – the strains that are most prevalent in the world – but they can change within six months. “That’s what you need the crystal ball for,” she says. “Some of the time, there’ll be a runner that pops up by August or September that was not present in January or February and if that runner emerges, and is successful against the other riders, then you have a mismatch. It does happen, and it can be painful when it does.”A mismatch is the nightmare. The experts got it wrong in 2014-15. The vaccine protected against Flu B and the H1N1 strain of Flu A, but not against H3N2. In February 2014, the Geneva meeting had opted for the Texas strain of H3N2, kickstarting manufacture of the vaccine across Europe and the US. But as early as March, the flu watchers could see that a different strain of H3N2, from Switzerland, was spreading faster. “It dominated in the winter of 2014-15,” McCauley says. It was too late to switch horses. If vaccine production had been stopped to make a change in the component strains, there would not have been enough of it. That year, there were an estimated 43,900 excess winter deaths in England and Wales – the largest number since 1999-2000.Something odd is happening with Flu B, too. For some time, the two B strains in the vaccine have been Victoria and Yamagata. Now Yamagata seems to have disappeared. “At the start of 2018, half the intensive care unit beds in the UK were filled with people with B Yamagata lineage viruses,” McCauley says. “Now it might have shot its bolt. We haven’t seen a B Yamagata lineage virus for over a year in these laboratories.”View image in fullscreenVirus strains being grown in eggsWhat’s going on? The experts don’t know, exactly. The flu hunters trail influenza but can never get ahead of it. And right now, predicting what it will do next is difficult. Strange things are happening. Not only has Yamagata vanished, but China has reported only Flu B and no Flu A, the animal variety – so the speculation is that it’s not circulating. And in the US, neither Yamagata nor one of the substrains of H3N2 (which doesn’t have a place name) has been spotted since March 2020.The answer must have to do with the Covid pandemic. McCauley produces a slide that dramatically demonstrates what happened in the winter of 2020-21, the first of the pandemic. Flu went into lockdown; there wasn’t any to speak of. Social distancing and mask-wearing thwarted not just coronavirus but flu, too. At the Crick, they were able to clear a backlog of work. They hadn’t been able to do that since 2008. “Last year, we did have periods when we didn’t have stuff to do,” McCauley says with a grin.But if there are fewer reports of flu, is that really because of all the social distancing and mask-wearing? Or is it that people are not going to the GP or hospital and instead are staying at home in bed with a raging fever unnoticed?Moore in Wales says it’s been hard to read. “Because of the pandemic, a lot of our surveillance systems have been disrupted, and particularly in the community.” But, on the whole, it seems there genuinely is less flu. “It’s been quite remarkable. I don’t think I’ve seen anything like this in my entire career,” she says.In 2019, before the pandemic hit, things were looking dodgy. “We were in a really brisk season,” she says. There were four H3N2 substrains circulating in Wales, at least two of which were not great matches for the strain in the vaccine. Moore was expecting a tricky winter. “Then suddenly Sars [Covid-19] arrived,” she says. Because of mitigations such as social distancing, masks and working from home, “flu stopped circulating. We’ve had two years of basically nothing. No signal at all for influenza.” It’s no different in the rest of Europe.We’ve got a massive epidemic in UK birds. We have a human infection from it and birds are dying. Nobody seems to careFlu can vanish – and flu can come roaring back. McCauley and the committee have chosen their strains for next winter. It includes a B Yamagata-type strain (Phuket) in spite of its apparent disappearance, along with H1N1 (Victoria), H3N2 (Darwin) and B (Austria). “It is far too early to conclude it [Yamagata] is extinct,” he says. And not much flu means there is less natural immunity against it. People don’t have the antibodies from getting ill; at least, not the antibodies from recent strains.All of us have some baseline immunity to flu. People born before about 1957 have some resilience to H1N1. It lurked for 40 or so years after the 1918 pandemic, altered in substrains, but older people have some general protection against it all the same. That’s why, in 2009 – the swine flu pandemic, which was also H1N1 – it was working people, aged 25 to 35, who died. Have I heard of “original antigenic sin”, Moore asks. The first flu strain you came into contact with is what your immune system remembers best, she explains. “That’s your immune system’s memory. If you encountered H1N1 as a child, you will be better protected against strains of that than against those of H3N2. And those born in the few years before the 1968-69 Hong Kong flu pandemic are likely to have more immunity to H3N2, which caused it. So H3N2 hits elderly people harder.”View image in fullscreen‘Really ­positive developments are preventing hospitalisations’: UKHSA epidemiologist Conall WatsonFlu travels the world. It may start in Hong Kong or in Bangladesh, but there are no border controls. Global cooperation is essential, and that includes sharing samples of virus – carefully. McCauley won’t send flu virus to countries whose labs are anything less than highly secure. He mentions a country that asked for samples from the UK for comparison purposes. He wasn’t impressed with their safety protocols. “I said, ‘Would you accept Ebola? Would you do this with Ebola?’ And they went, ‘No, no, we wouldn’t do that.’ I said, ‘OK, so Ebola kills 70% of people. And this virus kills 40% of people that it infects. What’s the difference?’”The flu hunters have decades of experience but there are always anxious moments. Moore is concerned about Alan Gosling and his Muscovy ducks. The ducks were infected because, while human flu is at low levels, bird flu in the UK is not. “We’re right in the middle of a massive epidemic in our birds in the UK,” she says.She cannot understand the lack of interest. “We have a human infection from it and birds are dying. Nobody seems to care, but it’s part of the same family of viruses. I find it remarkable that flu has been denigrated almost to just a cold. It’s not. It kills people every year, and it’s distressing.” After the coronavirus pandemic is over, she says, people need to be reminded to take flu seriously.A Christmas pandemic like no other? They thought that in 1918Read moreIn some respects, we are getting on top of flu. Conall Watson, a UKHSA epidemiologist, talks of “really positive developments in flu vaccinations”. He means the introduction of the adjuvant influenza vaccine, which gives older people’s immune systems a boost to help them respond and produce antibodies to the strains in the jab. “We’ve got evidence that it is preventing hospitalisations, but one of the really big steps the UK took was the introduction of a school-age and toddler vaccination programme,” he says, “with the idea of using vaccines to reduce community transmission.”And the mRNA technology that has proved so successful in the Covid pandemic, used in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, is likely to be the future for flu vaccines as well. The companies are now looking to see how they can adapt it. We know mRNA vaccines can be fairly swiftly altered if a serious new coronavirus variant turns up. We could see a scenario where both the Covid and flu vaccines are redesigned every year, depending on the prevailing strains.Will we ever get to a point where we don’t have to worry about flu? “No,” Zambon says, without hesitation, “because the natural reservoir for influenza A is wild birds.” They take the virus around the globe and there is nothing we can do about it. “So it will always be a threat to the human population.”Which means that our best hope will continue to be vaccines. We are in the hands of the flu hunters.Explore more on these topicsFluVaccines and immunisationBird fluHealthFlu pandemicHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this contentComments (…)Sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussionMost viewedMost viewedFashionFoodRecipesLove & sexHealth & fitnessHome & gardenWomenMenFamilyTravelMoneyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Concomitant administration of the high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV-HD) and the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine booster dose is not associated with any safety concerns or interference in older adults’ immune response, according to interim results from an ongoing phase 2 clinical trial published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. The multicenter, open-label, descriptive trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04969276) is being conducted at 6 clinical research sites in the United States. All community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older who previously received a 2-dose primary schedule of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were eligible for inclusion in the study. The second dose of the primary mRNA-1273 vaccination series needed to have been administered at least 5 months prior to study enrollment. All of the study participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (via use of a permuted block method stratified by site and age-group [<75 years vs ≥75 years]) to receive 1 of the following: (1) concomitant administration of QIV-HD and the mRNA-1273 vaccine; (2) QIV-HD alone; or (3) the mRNA-1273 vaccine alone. Between July 16 and August 31, 2021, a total of 306 individuals were enrolled in the study and were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups, with 296 of these persons receiving 1 dose or more (n=100 in the coadministration group, n=92 in the QIV-HD-alone group, and n=104 in the mRNA-1273-alone group). Reactogenicity profiles were similar between the coadministration and the mRNA-1273 vaccine groups, with lower reactogenicity rates reported in the QIV-HD-alone group. Solicited injection site reactions that occurred up to 7 days after mRNA-1273 vaccine injection occurred at similar rates in the coadministration group (86.0% [86 of 100 participants]; 95% CI, 77.6-92.1) and in the mRNA-1273-vaccine-alone group (91.3% [95 of 104 participants]; 95% CI, 84.2-96.0), and at lower rates in the QIV-HD group (61.8% [55 of 89 participants]; 95% CI, 50.9-71.9). Solicited injection site reactions reported following the QIV-HD injection in the coadministration group occurred less often than those following the mRNA-1273 vaccine injection in the coadministration group (61.0%; 95% CI, 50.7-70.6 vs 82.0%; 95% CI, 73.1-89.0 in the QIV-HD-injected limbs and the mRNA-1273-injected limbs, respectively) and at a similar rate to the QIV-HD-alone group (61.8%; 95% CI, 50.9-71.9). The frequency of solicited systemic reactions was 80.0% (95% CI, 70.8-87.3), 83.7% (95% CI, 75.1-90.2), and 49.4% (95% CI, 38.7-60.2) in the coadministration, mRNA-1273-alone, and QIV-HD groups, respectively. Up to day 22, unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were reported among 17.0% (95% CI, 10.2-25.8) of participants in the coadministration arm and 14.4% (95% CI, 8.3 to 22.7) in the mRNA-1273-alone arm. Unsolicited AEs occurred at a slightly lower rate (ie, 10.9%; 95% CI, 5.3-19.1) among participants in the QIV-HD-alone arm. Overall, 7 participants each reported 1 medically attended AE (3 in the coadministration arm, 3 in the mRNA-1273 arm, and 1 in the QIV-HD arm). No serious AEs, AEs of special interest, or deaths were reported. Hemagglutination inhibition antibody geometric mean titers increased from day 1 to day 22 to similar levels in the coadministration and the QIV-HD groups for each influenza strain. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 binding antibody geometric mean concentrations also increased to levels that were similar in the coadministration and mRNA-1273 arms at day 22 (7634; 95% CI, 6445-9042 vs 7904; 95% CI, 6883-9077, respectively). “Concomitant implementation of these vaccination campaigns could help avoid potential delays in influenza vaccination during the northern hemisphere influenza season due to prioritization of COVID-19 booster vaccination, which is particularly important among individuals at increased risk of severe illness and hospitalization from both COVID-19 and influenza infection,” the study authors wrote. “Therefore, concomitant vaccination might be needed to reduce morbidity and mortality due to these infectious diseases as much as possible.” Disclosures: Some of the study authors have declared affiliations with biotech, pharmaceutical, and/or device companies.

This is the state’s first confirmed case of HPAI since 2015. “While Nebraska has not seen HPAI in a backyard or commercial poultry flock within the state this year, the finding of this single goose adds Nebraska to a long list of states with confirmed cases of HPAI,” said State Veterinarian Dr. Roger Dudley. “Infected wild birds can carry the disease to new areas when migrating, so we encourage backyard poultry and commercial poultry flocks to continue to remain vigilant, practice good biosecurity and report sick or dying birds immediately.” Symptoms of HPAI in poultry include: a decrease in water consumption; lack of energy and appetite; decreased egg production or soft-shelled, misshapen eggs; nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing; incoordination; and diarrhea. HPAI can also cause sudden death in birds even if they aren’t showing any other symptoms. HPAI can survive for weeks in contaminated environments. Poultry owners should report unusual bird deaths or sick birds to NDA at (402) 471-2351, or through USDA at (866) 536-7593. BIOSECURITY EFFORTS Enhanced biosecurity helps prevent the introduction and spread of viruses and diseases including HPAI. NDA and USDA have resources available to help poultry owners step up their biosecurity efforts. Know the warning signs of infectious bird diseases like HPAI. Be on the lookout for unusual signs of behavior, severe illness and/or sudden deaths. Restrict access to your property and poultry. Keep it clean. Wear clean clothes, scrub boots/shoes with disinfectant and wash hands thoroughly before and after contact with your flock. If you, your employees or family have been on other farms, or other places where there is livestock and/or poultry, clean and disinfect your vehicle tires and equipment before returning home. Don’t share equipment, tools, or other supplies with other livestock or poultry owners. In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds, making sure wild birds cannot access domestic poultry’s feed and water sources. Report sick birds immediately to: NDA at (402) 471-2351; the USDA at (866) 536-7593; or your veterinarian. Early detection is important to prevent the spread of disease. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the risk to people getting HPAI infections from birds is low. No human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. All poultry entering Nebraska must be accompanied by a VS form 9-3 or Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI, or health certificate). If you are considering moving an animal into Nebraska from an affected state, please call (402) 471-2351 to learn more. Nebraska poultry owners wanting to ship poultry out of state should consult the state veterinarians of the destination states for import requirements. For more information about avian influenza, visit NDA’s website at https:/da.nebraska.gov/animal/avian/index.html or the USDA’s website https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov. Highly pathogenic avian influenza resources available from USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service As of March 8, the USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in 14 states: South Carolina, North Carolina, New York, Kentucky, Virginia, Maine, Delaware, Michigan, Connecticut, Iowa, Indiana, Missouri, Maryland and South Dakota. Commercial poultry and backyard flock owners should review their biosecurity practices and be on high alert for signs of HPAI in their birds. Through the Defend the Flock campaign, USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has an extensive number of resources for our partners at Cooperative Extension to share. Materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists and a toolkit are available.

How to distinguish symptomsPor Newsroom Infobae18 Mar, 2022 10:27 a.m. ESTGuardar12/05/2020 Infección pulmonar Infección pulmonar por virus respiratorios y brote de gripe y coronavirus o coronavirus como casos peligrosos de SARS como un concepto médico pandémico o epidémico con elementos de ilustración 3D. SALUD WILDPIXEL Argentina is undergoing an early epidemic of influenza or influenza, while the Ómicron variant of the coronavirus, as warned this week an alert by the Ministry of Health of the Nation. The flu, cold and COVID-19 have similar symptoms, which is why it is often difficult to differentiate them. To distinguish them, paying attention to body signals, medical diagnosis and avoiding self-medication are key.“As of December 2021, there has been a progressive increase in the number of cases of Influenza A, in particular the H3N2 subtype, with 794 confirmed cases reported as of February 10. This represents, epidemiologically, circulation during a period of the year that is not usual for this respiratory virus, which is commonly expected to circulate during late autumn and during winter (mainly between May and August),” the national health portfolio explained on Wednesday.Influenza viruses are primarily responsible for influenza, which mainly affects the nose, throat, bronchi and, occasionally, lungs. Viral infection usually lasts a week and is characterized by the sudden onset of high fever, muscle aches, headache, general malaise, dry cough, sore throat and rhinitis. The virus is easily transmitted from one person to another through droplets and small particles expelled by coughing or sneezing.In all public vaccinations in the City of Buenos Aires, the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine is already applied (iStock)That is why it recommends that the population continue with the prevention and care measures in force for COVID-19: maintain ventilated environments, wash their hands frequently with soap and water, wear a mask, and avoid going to work, educational or public places in the presence of symptoms. Influenza usually spreads rapidly in the form of seasonal epidemics, and most of those affected recover within a week or two without needing medical treatment. However, in young children, the elderly, and people with other serious medical conditions, the infection can lead to serious complications, lead to pneumonia, and in some cases cause death.But how to differentiate the flu or influenza virus from the coronavirus? Flu, cold, and COVID-19 have many similar symptoms. This makes it so difficult to tell them apart, which is why sometimes you don't know which is which. In addition, in both cases, you can get sick with either virus even if you are vaccinated.Both are respiratory and viral infections whose most severe cases can be prevented through vaccination. The influenza virus can cause between three and five million cases of serious illness per year and more than 200,000 deaths from respiratory infection worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, which caused a global public health emergency since December 2019, has already affected more than 460 million people and killed 6 million. “People can become infected with both the influenza virus and the virus that causes COVID-19 at the same time, and have symptoms of both influenza and COVID-19,” warned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, approximately 7% to 11% of cases of co-infection have been recorded in patients with COVID-19, in which the influenza virus was one of the most frequent. Although some symptoms are similar, with the progression of the pandemic, the 5 main differences that exist between the two infections and their complications and sequelae have been clarified.1- Differences in signs and symptomsBoth COVID-19 and the flu can have varying degrees of signs and symptoms, ranging from the absence of symptoms (they are called asymptomatic cases) to severe symptoms. The most common symptoms of both COVID-19 and the flu include: fever or feeling feverish, having chills, coughing, difficulty breathing (or feeling short of breath), fatigue or tiredness, sore throat, nasal mucus, or stuffy nose.Also in both infections, people may have muscle pain and body aches, headache, vomiting and diarrhea, and changes or loss of taste or smell. However, in the case of the flu, loss of smell or taste is rare. Symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting occur more in cases of children with the flu and not so much in adults.2- How long does it take for symptoms to appearIn the case of the flu, people usually have symptoms within 1 to 4 days of getting the infection. On the other hand, people develop symptoms of COVID-19 about 5 days after they are infected, but symptoms can develop between 2 and 14 days after they are infected.When infecting people, influenza and coronavirus viruses produce similar symptoms that can cause them to be confused (IHN)3- How long can people infectFor both COVID-19 and the flu, it is possible to spread the virus at least 1 day before you experience any of the symptoms. But a person with coronavirus can spread the virus longer than if they have the flu virus. Most people with the flu virus can spread for about 1 day before they develop symptoms. Older children and adults with the flu appear to be most contagious during the first 3-4 days of illness, but many people remain contagious for about 7 days, according to the CDC. Babies and people with weakened immune systems can be contagious even longer. With regard to COVID-19, research is still under way for how long a person can spread coronavirus. According to the CDC, “people may be able to spread coronavirus for about 2 days before they develop signs or symptoms (or possibly sooner) and remain contagious for at least 10 days after signs or symptoms first appear.” They also warned: “A person who is asymptomatic or whose symptoms disappear may continue to be infected for at least 10 days after they test positive for COVID-19. People hospitalized with severe cases of the disease and people with weakened immune systems can be contagious for 20 days or more.”a person with coronavirus can spread the virus longer than if they have the flu virus (Getty)4- How do they differ in terms of transmissionBoth the coronavirus and the flu virus can be transmitted from person to person between people who are in close contact with each other two meters away. Both diseases are spread mainly through large and small particles containing the virus that are expelled when people who are infected (even without symptoms) cough, sneeze, or talk.These particles of different sizes can end up in the mouths or noses of those nearby and possibly be inhaled into their lungs. In some circumstances, such as in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation, small particles - which they call aerosols - could spread beyond 2 meters and cause infections.Although most of the spread occurs through inhalation, it can happen that a person becomes infected by touching another person (for example, by shaking the hand of someone who has the virus in their hand) or by touching a surface or object with the virus, and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.Although the virus that causes COVID-19 and influenza viruses are thought to spread in similar ways, “the virus that causes COVID-19 is often more contagious than influenza viruses,” according to the CDC. In addition, it has been observed that COVID-19 generates many more cases of superpropagators than the flu. This means that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread more quickly and easily to many people and cause continuous spread among people as time progresses.Low temperatures were recorded in several parts of the country in March (GALO CAÑAS/CUARTOSCURO.COM)5- They are distinguished in complications and sequelaeBoth COVID-19 and influenza can cause complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute respiratory failure syndrome (fluid in the lungs), sepsis, heart injury (e.g. heart attacks and strokes), multiple organ failure (respiratory failure, kidney failure) , shock), and aggravation of chronic conditions (involving the lungs, heart, nervous system or diabetes).Patients with both infections may also suffer from inflammation of the heart, brain and muscle tissues, and secondary infections (bacterial or fungal infections that can occur in people who have already been infected with the flu or COVID-19). But differences have been detected. In the case of influenza, secondary bacterial infections are more common in cases of influenza than in cases of COVID-19. Diarrhea is more common in young children with the flu than in adults with the flu. On the other hand, in cases of COVID-19, there are complications such as blood clots in the veins and arteries of the lungs, heart, legs, or brain. Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome can develop in children (MIS-C) and adults (MIS-A), which was described by different scientists since April last year.In addition, COVID-19 can leave sequelae, which are now known as Prolonged Covid Syndrome or Post Covid. It is a range of 55 symptoms that can last weeks or months after being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 for the first time or appear weeks after infection. Long-term COVID-19 can occur in anyone who has had COVID-19, even if the illness was mild or had no symptoms.

State wildlife officials are worried about the disease’s potential effects on wild birds across the Show Me State. (Photo By: Amy Lutz-Shutterstock.com) March 16, 2022 By Lynn Burkhead, OSG Senior Digital Editor With an outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) taking place in Missouri’s poultry industry in recent days, state wildlife officials are worried about the disease’s potential effects on wild birds across the Show Me State.To that end, the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) has confirmed that HPAI has now been detected in at least eight different wild bird species across 10 counties in the state, including the initial confirmation of the disease in an American white pelican in Clay County, Mo.In quick succession after that initial finding a few days ago, a MDC news release indicates that HPAI has now been confirmed in snow geese and/or Ross’s geese in Buchanan, Chariton, Holt, Pettis, and Randolph counties; a mallard in Barton County; a hooded merganser in St. Louis County; a bald eagle in St. Charles County; and peregrine falcon and sharp-shinned hawk in Vernon County. READ MOREThe confirmation of the HPAI cases in the various wild bird species noted above was confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Lab in Ames, Iowa as well as the University of Missouri Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab. And since the state’s HPAI confirmation list was actually updated as this WildfowlMag.com story was actually being finalized on the afternoon of March 16, 2022, don’t be surprised to see it continuing to grow in the days ahead. Advertisement × Advertisement × At the Peak of the MigrationThe outbreak of what is often referred to as bird flu was first detected earlier this month in the Show Me State’s poultry industry, including a commercial poultry flock in Stoddard County on March 3 and in a backyard flock in Bates County a day later. The disease has been confirmed in at least three other poultry flocks across the state so far, all of which have been depopulated. With fears of the highly contagious virus spreading even further, MDC is working closely with the Missouri Department of Agriculture, as well as other state and federal agencies, to monitor and respond to the situation.Of particular note to Wildfowl Magazine readers, this is unfortunately occurring at the height of the Missouri spring snow goose migration, which attracts millions of snow geese and Ross’s geese into the state during the month of March as well as numerous hunters seeking to take advantage of the liberal regulations in place during the annual special light goose conservation season that runs in Missouri from Feb. 7 through April 30 this year.Threats to Waterfowl and Other WildlifeWith the ongoing appearance of so many migrating geese over the next few weeks, the fear is the that the highly contagious disease could spread like wildfire given the close quarters that many geese are keeping right now as they push north towards their Arctic nesting grounds.(Editor’s Note: Wildfowl Magazine has reached out to get the pulse on all of this from Missouri outfitters and hunters chasing spring snow geese right now, and will report on their comments if additional developments warrant.)As worrisome as this development might be in the middle of the grand migration spectacle, the appearance of HPAI this month hasn’t caught wildlife officials completely off-guard since there have been other reports of the pathogen noted elsewhere this year in other flyways.“Avian influenza viruses naturally occur in bird populations, especially waterfowl, shorebirds, and domestic birds such as chickens and turkeys,” said MDC state wildlife veterinarian Sherri Russell, in the MDC news release. “We have been monitoring this strain since early January, when it was detected in the eastern United States and Canada.”State officials in Missouri are monitoring the spread of avian influenza across waterfowl and other wild bird species. (Photo By: Delmas Lehman/Shutterstock.com)Wildlife officials say that the virus spreads from bird to bird through fecal matter, nasal discharge, and bird saliva, particularly troublesome in places where birds congregate to stage, feed, and rest on their annual migrations. And given the proximity that exists in some places to domestic and agricultural poultry, there is the risk for cross-contamination and a back and forth spread like what is being seen in Missouri at the moment.And while the risk isn’t great right now—as the second anniversary of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. is observed this month—there’s also the small possibility that some people could potentially be affected by the virus.“Fortunately, avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern, although on rare occasions it has infected humans and other animals,” said Russell. “We recommend you avoid handling sick or dead birds, and to report sick or dead wild birds, especially waterfowl to MDC.Notice to HuntersMDC officials also advise waterfowl hunters—and potentially spring turkey hunters in a few weeks if the outbreak continues—to do such things as taking “…common sense precautions when handling harvested birds in the field or at home. They should be aware that it is possible to transport avian influenza viruses on boats, waders, or other equipment, especially if it isn’t dry before moving it from one site to another. Allowing hunting equipment to dry between outings will reduce this chance.”Are infected geese—and poultry and other game birds infected by this virus—safe to eat during a HPAI outbreak? State wildlife officials in Missouri say yes, as long as hunters adhere to cooking methods that cause enough heat to kill the virus. (Photo By: Kurt M-Shutterstock.com)“It is safe to eat poultry and wild game birds because normal cooking temperatures are hot enough to kill the virus,” said Russell. “Make sure to cook your meat to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.”With obvious concern for the HPAI outbreak and how it might continue to grow and spread, Missouri has initiated a multi-agency response, including the MDC and other statewide and federal partners, to increase surveillance in wild bird populations across the state. In conducting that surveillance work, Missouri officials have contacted wildlife rehabilitator groups, falconer groups, waterfowlers, and other stakeholders to assist.In particular, MDC and its partners are interested in reports of single waterfowl, raptors, or avian scavengers that show neurological symptoms – i.e., tremors, head tilting, lethargy, loss of coordination, inability to fly or walk properly, or trouble standing upright. Advertisement The MDC news release indicates that state wildlife officials are also interested in reports of waterfowl or other waterbird deaths involving more than five birds where the cause of death is unknown. The agency notes that citizens can report sick or dead birds to wildlife officials by emailing WildlifeHealth@mdc.mo.gov or by calling their local MDC office (Editor’s Note: a list of regional MDC offices can be found HERE.In the meantime, Missouri wildlife officials report that situation updates of their state’s ongoing avian influenza outbreak in wild birds are available HERE.Stay tuned to WildfowlMag.com as this breaking story continues to unfold.

But how, exactly, will we know when the COVID-19 pandemic is really “over”? It turns out the answer to that question may lie more in sociology than epidemiology.As the world passes the second anniversary of the World Health Organization’s declaration of the COVID pandemic, things seem to be at a turning point. COVID cases and deaths are seeing sustained declines in much of the world, and a large percentage of people are estimated to have some immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, through infection or vaccination. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released new risk metrics that suggest people in many parts of the U.S. no longer need to wear a mask, and mayors, governors and other officials have been dropping mask and vaccine mandates in a push to get back to normal. Although the COVID-causing virus, SARS-CoV-2, is likely to always circulate at some level, there is a growing belief among some people—though not all—that the pandemic’s acute phase may be subsiding.“I believe that pandemics end partially because humans declare them at an end,” says Marion Dorsey, an associate professor of history at the University of New Hampshire, who studies past pandemics, including the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic. Of course, she notes, there is an epidemiological component, characterized by the point at which a disease still circulates but is no longer causing major peaks in severe illness or death. This is sometimes referred to as the transition from a pandemic disease to an endemic one. But for practical purposes, the question of when this transition occurs largely comes down to human behavior.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

Whether or not there is an official declaration of some kind, “I don’t think anything really has a meaning until, as a society..., we act as if it is.”Author and historian John M. Barry, who wrote one of the most definitive chronicles of the 1918 pandemic—The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History—has come to a similar conclusion. A pandemic ends “when people stop paying attention to it,” he says. The rest of the matter is a combination of the virus’s virulence, and the availability of vaccines and therapeutics. “We’re almost at that point” with COVID, Barry adds, although vaccines and treatments are still out of reach for many people worldwide. Nevertheless, the public has grown increasingly tired of the restrictions of life under pandemic conditions. “We’ve clearly wearied,” Barry says. But he cautions that there is a danger in moving on too quickly.The 1918 pandemic—which is estimated to have killed at least 50 million people worldwide, though accurate data are hard to come by—is often described as having three waves. The first came in the spring of 1918, followed by a notoriously deadly second wave that fall and then a third, wintertime wave in early 1919—with cases eventually subsiding by the summer of that year. But Barry says a new variant emerged in 1920 and effectively caused a fourth wave. This wave killed more people in some cities than the second one, even though there was widespread immunity to the virus by then. Although many cities and public institutions imposed restrictions during the second and third waves, virtually none did so during the fourth. By 1921, the flu death toll had returned to prepandemic levels. But moving on too soon was a mistake, Barry says.Ultimately the 1918 pandemic pathogen (an H1N1 flu virus) evolved to become less virulent: it lost much of its ability to infect cells in the lungs, where it could cause deadly pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2’s Omicron variant appears to cause milder disease as well, although it is not clear how much of that is because it has lost some of the earlier variants’ ability to infect the lower respiratory tract—or because more people have prior immunity from vaccination or previous infection. But there is no law of nature that says a virus must always evolve to become less virulent. It is entirely possible that a future variant could be as transmissible as Omicron and cause more severe disease. The 1918 virus did cause several bad outbreaks in the years afterward, Barry says, noting that one of them—a particularly severe flu season in 1928—led to Congress to expand and reorganize the Hygienic Laboratory to create what is now the National Institutes of Health.For now, Barry is cautiously optimistic about COVID. “I think it’s more likely than not that future variants will not be any worse,” he says. “In fact, I think it’s more likely that they’ll get milder than that they will get more virulent. But we don’t know that. It’s random event. I think, in the long term, that’s where we will end up, but that doesn’t mean every iteration of the virus is going to move in the same direction.”The 1918 influenza virus never went away (eventually it morphed into seasonal flu), but most survivors developed some immunity to it and simply decided to move on with their lives. “There’s a certain amount [of infection] we can live with,” Dorsey says. Another factor that helped the pandemic subside from the public consciousness was that it coincided with the end of World War I. Then president Woodrow Wilson and his government were more focused on recovering from the war, and this consumed much of the media attention at the time. “Especially as influenza started to decrease in virulence,” Dorsey says, “it was easier to pay attention to the war.” Finally, as the flu gradually became less severe, other diseases such as polio started to draw far more notice.Although it is impossible to draw a direct parallel with how the 1918 pandemic ended, COVID may be headed in that direction. Obviously the virus has surprised us before, Dorsey points out. Even after the immediate threat recedes, society will likely be dealing with its aftermath for years to come. The many people who lost family members and the legions of health care workers who witnessed unimaginable amounts of death and suffering will be experiencing grief and trauma that will make it impossible for many to move on—even if the rest of the world does. And that does not include a potential tidal wave of long COVID, the full effects of which society has yet to grapple with.Devastating as the 1918 pandemic was, history seems to have somewhat forgotten its horrors. With COVID, Barry thinks that is unlikely to happen anytime soon. “In 1918 people died of infectious disease all the time, so there was a certain familiarity with the experience,” he says. That is no longer the case in modern times. COVID has already caused deep and lasting disruptions to society. “It changed everybody’s life for a long time,” Barry says, “and that is not going to be forgotten.”Rights & PermissionsTanya Lewis is a senior editor covering health and medicine at Scientific American.

So you might feel some aspects of déjà vu as winter 2022 approaches in Australia. But this year is different. With relaxed public health measures and the opening of international borders, we will likely see a rise in flu cases. This is on top of a predicted rise in COVID. The potential double-whammy has prompted the federal government to announce A$2.1 billion to target these expected spikes. The funding has been earmarked for measures including vaccination, testing and measures to protect aged care. Here’s what to expect and how to protect yourself ahead of winter. Why can we expect more flu? The main reason behind the expected rise in flu in 2022 is the opening of Australia’s international borders. Tourists and returning residents can arrive without quarantining, provided they have the required COVID vaccinations and have had a COVID test beforehand. However, new arrivals don’t have to be tested for the flu virus, which they may inadvertently bring with them. Flu, a little like COVID, can be spread by infected others before symptoms arise or even if symptoms don’t appear, something we regularly see in children. So once flu arrives, it will inevitably spread, regardless of whether we use masks, hand sanitiser or other measures. In the past two years, for instance, we’ve seen large outbreaks of other common respiratory viruses. These include respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, adenoviruses and rhinovirus. We’ve seen these even with strict COVID measures in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland during 2020-2021. How bad will it get? It’s highly likely we’ll see COVID and influenza circulating at the same time this winter. But less certain is the more catastrophic predictions in the media of a so-called twindemic or syndemic. COVID is more likely to persist and increase during the winter, and sometime during this period influenza will pop up. But we’re uncertain about the details. Will flu be mild or more concerning in 2022? Will we see a rise in cases during the usual June-September period, peaking normally in August? The answers to these questions rely on history, the current situation and a good deal of speculation. History tells us that after two seasons of low or no influenza circulating, we should expect a more severe season. That’s because the majority of people are not vaccinated against influenza each year and peoples’ natural immunity after infection will have waned. However, current evidence argues against this. In the Northern Hemisphere, there have been low levels of flu circulating in most countries, with shorter outbreaks, compared with pre-pandemic years. We’ve also seen a number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere – including South Africa, Brazil and Chile – having out-of-season flu outbreaks, during their 2021-2022 summer. So this may mean the timing of Australia’s normal influenza season might be delayed until spring or even later in 2022. Will I get 'flurona'? We may also see dual infections – when someone has COVID and influenza at the same time – sometimes dubbed “flurona”. While this has occurred, the rates of dual infections globally have been low. Generally, under 1% of people with COVID also have influenza at the same time. Even with dual infections, people do not seem to be sicker than if they had COVID alone. We’ll have a better idea of how many people will be infected with both viruses at once with the use of broader laboratory tests now available at many sites. These so called multiplex tests will detect a range of respiratory diseases, including COVID and flu, in a single test. Fortunately, there is no way a new “hybrid virus” can emerge containing parts of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID) and the influenza virus in people with dual infections. These are distinct viruses that cannot combine. How can I protect myself? Despite the uncertainties around flu in Australia in 2022, the best way to protect yourself is to get your flu vaccine. Everyone is susceptible to flu, no matter your age, health or lifestyle. However, some age groups and some people with underlying disease are likely to suffer more severe consequences if infected with influenza. These include young children (especially those under two years old), people aged 65 and over, pregnant women, people with chronic lung and heart disease, those with asthma, diabetes and people who are obese. Different flu vaccines target different age groups with different formulations. These vaccines have a proven safety record and usually only cause very mild reactions, such as soreness at the injection site, mild fever or headache. These may last for a 12-24 hours and are easily treated with paracetamol or similar medications. Flu vaccines are free for children aged six months to under five years of age, people aged 65 or older, pregnant women and all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people six months and older. People not eligible for free vaccines can still get them via their GP or some pharmacies. This year you won’t have to schedule different visits for your influenza and COVID vaccinations. If needed, you can get them at the same time. Influenza vaccines will be available from late March and will provide protection for at least 6-12 months. While these vaccines are not perfect they help prevent infection and the more serious consequences of the flu, such as hospitalisation and even death. So in April to May this year, as the cool days and nights return, think about booking in and getting your flu shot.

The number of people with flu (influenza) increased significantly in the past two weeks. More and more nose and throat samples taken from people with flu-like symptoms reveal the presence of an influenza virus – three times as many last week compared to the week before. Last week, it seemed as though a flu epidemic might be starting. A clear increase in the number of influenza cases was already becoming apparent. This number continued rising rapidly last week. As a result, RIVM, Nivel and Erasmus MC have said that the seasonal flu epidemic has now started. The flu epidemic usually starts in December or January. Since the start of the ‘normal’ flu season in 2021, however, the flu virus has only been found very occasionally in the Netherlands. This infrequent occurrence is probably due to the coronavirus measures, which also prevent the flu virus from spreading. Now that the measures have been eased, people are having contact with others more often again. This also increases the risk of respiratory infections such as flu. Different sources of information RIVM is monitoring trends in the flu virus in various ways. Through its network of monitoring stations at GP practices, the Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (Nivel) tracks how many people contact their GP with flu-like symptoms. Despite an upward trend in recent weeks, these numbers are still lower than in previous flu seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the number of people found to be infected with an influenza virus has risen sharply. To monitor the flu virus in the Netherlands, RIVM, Nivel and Erasmus MC also look at other data. This includes data from laboratories in the Netherlands. These data sources show that the number of samples in which an influenza virus was found is three times higher than the previous week. Hospitals also report seeing similar numbers of people who have flu, comparable to epidemics before the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, since November 2021, some of the samples for COVID-19 from the GGD test lanes across the country have been examined to check for influenza viruses. That form of influenza surveillance also showed an increase in the number of samples containing the flu. Taking all this information into account, it can be concluded that the flu epidemic in the Netherlands has started. Flu and COVID-19 Flu and COVID-19 are both infections of the respiratory system. They are caused by different viruses. Both viruses spread through droplets that are released during coughing or sneezing. In addition, both viruses cause fever, cold symptoms and coughing, and sometimes lead to pneumonia. The basic measures to prevent the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 from spreading are also effective in preventing the spread of the influenza virus. Washing your hands regularly, coughing and sneezing into your elbow, and distancing all help reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to others. Keep this in mind, especially when interacting with vulnerable groups of people. They could become seriously ill from the influenza virus.

WuPeople awaiting a flu shot outside a grocery store in 2004. (Jessica Leigh / The Times / AP)March 18, 2022 ShareSave About 18 years ago, while delivering a talk at a CDC conference, Gregory Poland punked 2,000 of his fellow scientists. Ten minutes into his lecture, a member of the audience, under Poland’s instruction, raced up to the podium with a slip of paper. Poland skimmed the note and looked up, stony-faced. “Colleagues, I am unsure of what to say,” he said. “We have just been notified of a virus that’s been detected in the U.S. that will take somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 lives this year.” The room erupted in a horrified, cinematic gasp. Poland paused, then leaned into the mic. “The name of the virus,” he declared, “is influenza.”Call it funny, call it mean, but at least call it true. Poland, a physician and vaccinologist at Mayo Clinic, had done little more than recast two facts his colleagues already knew: Flu is highly contagious and highly dangerous, a staggering burden on public health; and for years and years and years, Americans, even those trained in disease control and prevention, have almost entirely ceased to care. Vaccines capable of curbing flu’s annual toll have existed since the 1940s. Close to a century later, some 50 to 60 percent of Americans adults still do not bother with the yearly shot. The crux of the uptake shortfall “is this normalization of death,” Poland told me. He predicts this pattern will play on repeat, and at higher volume, with SARS-CoV-2—another devastating respiratory virus that’s tough to durably thwart with shots.Read: How did this many deaths become normal?COVID-19 is not the flu, and no one knows for sure exactly how often we’ll have to immunize ourselves against it. But it seems inevitable that someday, the entire American public will be asked to sign up for shots again—perhaps quite soon, perhaps every fall, as some vaccine makers would like. We have just one template for this: the flu shot. And expecting even similar levels of so-so uptake may be optimistic. “I’m guessing that flu-vaccine coverage is going to be a ceiling,” says Alison Buttenheim, a behavioral scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. “I just don’t think we’ll have 70 percent of U.S. adults saying, Oh, an annual COVID shot? Sure.”Immunization ennui is already playing out. Months into the COVID-booster-shot rollout, only half of Americans eligible for an additional injection have gotten one—that’s with the pandemic still raging, with more than 1,000 people dying each day in the United States alone. “We’re already losing the immediate motivator of I’m afraid I’ll get sick and die,” says George Dehner, a flu historian at Wichita State University.If the future of COVID shots ends up mirroring the past and present of flu vaccines, we’ll have our work cut out for us. But many of the barriers we face now in trying to get people to sign up for their shots, not just once, not just twice, but likely many times over, don’t have to feel like uncharted territory. Flu vaccines offer “a lot of parallels,” says Tony Yang, a health-policy expert at George Washington University. Again, the two diseases aren’t at all identical. But efforts to vaccinate against either have enough overlap that they can inform each other. Our experience with flu shots reminds us that Americans, cultured to become immune to the notion of unnecessary death from disease, still have a chance to shift that perspective—and chase the kind of immunity that will instead spare them from it.Annual flu vaccines are both an old innovation and a new imperative. Originally developed in the 1940s, when World War II was still raging, the shots first went to the military, under orders from the surgeon general. By the end of the fall of 1945, “everyone in the U.S. Army was vaccinated,” Dehner told me. The shot was cleared for civilian use and soon became a regularly reformulated vaccine to keep pace with the viruses’ rapid mutational clip. The vaccine worked—flu deaths plummeted among those who received the shot. Still, only after the 1957 flu pandemic pummeled people who were over the age of 65, pregnant, or ill with a chronic disease did public-health officials begin actively recommending the vaccine for those groups. Another 45 years would pass before children six to 23 months old joined the list. And only in 2010 were annual flu vaccines recommended for everyone six months and up.More than a decade later, getting just half of American adults to nab the jab is “considered a good year,” Buttenheim told me. That level of uptake is paltry compared with the percentages of children who are, by the age of 2, up-to-date on their shots against chicken pox (90.2), hepatitis B (90.6), measles (90.8), and polio (92.6). But unlike those vaccines, flu shots are high maintenance, requiring refreshment through adolescence and adulthood, every single year. The annual vaccines have other factors working against them too. While they’re decently good at keeping people out of the hospital and the ICU, their protections against less-severe infections are relatively weak, topping out at about 60 percent effectiveness, and fast-fading. (They do far worse than that when there’s a mismatch between the vaccine’s contents and the circulating strain du jour.) “A lot of times, you still end up getting the flu even if you’ve had the vaccine”—which has given the shots a pretty bad rap, says Seema Mohapatra, a health-law expert at Southern Methodist University.Read: How to time your second boosterAnd when people, especially young, healthy adults, do end up with the flu, many of them simply don’t care. The worst flu outbreak in recorded history, in 1918, carried a mortality rate of about 2.5 percent. That was devastating, given how many people were infected. But instead people have, in the decades since, internalized that most did not die. If vaccine appeal tends to toggle by three metrics—the convenience of staying current on shots, the inoculation’s effectiveness, and the pathogen’s perceived threat—flu jabs aren’t much of a contender in any arena. “There are a lot of people who are very, very pro-vaccine, except for flu,” Rupali Limaye, a vaccine-behavior expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told me. They just don’t think the juice is worth the annual squeeze.COVID vaccines have already begun to follow flu shots’ problematic patterns. Set up to believe that the vaccines would instantly obliterate all infections, many people now consider the shots’ performance underwhelming, says Limaye, who has spoken with about 3,000 vaccine-hesitant people in the past two years. And since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it’s been tough to shake the false narrative in some circles that essentially “everyone” who gets the virus “seems to be just fine,” she said. In America, states with low annual flu-shot-uptake rates are near the bottom of the charts on the COVID-vaccine front as well. There’s a mirroring across demographics as well: For both flavors of shots, the elderly, the white, the wealthy, and the highly educated are more likely to be dosed up. These gaps are bound to widen, as the inequities of first doses become the inequities of boosters, and fewer and fewer people return for additional injections. “First to second, second to third, we already saw dropoff,” says Arrianna Marie Planey, a medical geographer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.We don’t have to resign ourselves to this fate. Flu shots have had their failures, but they’ve clearly had their successes too. Roughly half of American adults don’t get an annual flu shot. The other half do. “The best predictor of whether you got a flu shot this year is if you got one last year,” says Gretchen Chapman, a cognitive scientist who studies vaccine behaviors at Carnegie Mellon University. To at least a degree, we have been doing a few things right.First, when mandates are possible, they help. The military requires flu shots, for instance, as do some universities. And requirements are common across a bonanza of health-care settings—a result of intense advocacy efforts, spearheaded just over a decade ago, in part by scientists including the Mayo Clinic’s Poland. Here, the perks of mass inoculation are absolutely incontrovertible. More flu vaccines mean fewer health-care workers missing work, or coming to work sick; they mean fewer vulnerable patients being exposed to the virus and falling seriously ill. It just took an all-out requirement to get the workforce to invest: Following a wave of mandates, starting around the early- to mid-aughts, vaccine-uptake rates zoomed from about 40 percent to about 70 or 80 or more.In other settings, though, mandates are much harder, for some of the same reasons that totally voluntary uptake remains in the pits. Schools might seem an obvious venue, because they already require other shots. But most of those vaccines require just a couple of doses that are done by adolescence at the latest; trying to track annual shots, meanwhile, is a bookkeeping nightmare, my colleague Rachel Gutman reported last fall. No states currently require annual vaccines for all K–12 students (though a few ask that day cares and preschools do). Attempts to change that have ended up dead in the water; even in health-care settings, mandates were an “arduous battle,” Angela Shen, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told me.Read: Vaccinating kids has never been easyOnce people age out of the school system, they become even harder to convince and corral. Across the board, “adult immunization coverage is abysmal,” and not just for the flu, Shen told me. With the American mindset so entrained on liberty and individualism, out-and-out requirements in most industries—for flu shots, for COVID shots—feel doomed to fail. Mandates are “tremendously effective,” Chapman told me. “People just hate them.”Without mandates, shot uptake depends on the miscellany of motivation. So-called nudge tactics have sometimes worked with flu shots, especially when they’re laced with a financial incentive—gift cards, coupons, salary bonuses, and the like, Southern Methodist University’s Mohapatra told me. But they can also flop, or even backfire; the COVID era has provided plenty of evidence for that, even with a few pretty creative pot-sweeteners (boats! sports cars! free gas for 10 years!) in the mix. Some individuals may grow suspicious of the hype, worried they’re being duped. Incentives can also go overboard with cash value, and make people feel like they don’t actually have a choice in the matter at all. “You still want there to be autonomy,” Mohapatra said, so it remains a true nudge, and not a coercive shove. Really, incentives work best on people who just need an extra little push. They’re much less likely to totally overhaul someone’s sociopolitical worldview.Read: A very simple way to get America boostedIncreasing vaccine uptake, then, isn’t just about making shots desirable. It’s also about making them convenient and, in some cases, feasible at all. For many people, getting a vaccine still represents a huge disruption—time spent away from work, or child care, or other responsibilities—especially for those who live in rural regions or don’t have reliable access to health care. Simple venue changes can help. In 2009, a policy shift that finally allowed pharmacists to administer flu vaccines became an “absolute game changer,” says Ross Silverman, a vaccine-policy expert at Temple University’s College of Public Health. Just over a decade later, more than a third of American adults receive their annual shots at pharmacies and stores. Community vaccination sites and mobile clinics, UNC’s Planey told me, can help too. (Unfortunately some of the ones that popped up during the COVID pandemic have since disappeared.) And for those who straight-up forget to get a flu shot, or hit scheduling inertia, Chapman and her colleagues have found that auto-generating appointments can help—it becomes a default option, and people tend to follow through.Decades of slips and stumbles have also made clear what other changes might help efforts to vaccinate against both flu and COVID. Eliminating financial barriers is essential—to do that, policy makers could ensure that shots of all kinds remain free of charge, regardless of insurance status, Shen told me. For those who have to travel to appointments, officials could also instate measures to ensure that their transportation costs are covered, and put paid sick leave on the table so work hours aren’t lost. Changes like these would likely help address some equity gaps in uptake, especially among essential employees and their children, who might be more exposed to infection to begin with, and need the shots that much more. “All of these barriers add up,” Planey told me, but so does chipping away at them.Still, changes that focus on nudges and logistics can go only so far when much of the public has been cultured to view vaccines as not just annoying or unneeded, but outright dangerous, immoral, or partisan. These views are part of why, even after years of scientific toil, flu-vaccine uptake is “stagnant,” Poland said. With COVID, the immunization obstinance may be even worse. Vaccination has become “a hot-button issue in a way that it has never been,” Silverman told me.Read: Restaurant vaccine mandates were set up to failHere, the lessons from flu shots match the ones already clear from current COVID-vaccination campaigns: People must be met where they are. Sometimes, that’s about hearing a vaccine-enthusiastic message from the right person. George Washington’s Yang notes that a strong recommendation for a flu vaccine from a health-care provider can be enough to tip some people toward dosing up. Trusted community messengers—some of whom might even go door-to-door in some cities—are powerful motivators as well. These conversations are about compassion, not dismissal, says Limaye, who works in vaccine hesitancy at Johns Hopkins University. She’s running a study to see if tapping into Republican Party values, such as individualism, freedom, and protecting small businesses, might make headway among conservatives who remain skeptical of shots.Larger-scale cultural shifts, too, are needed—amending people’s perspective on communal risk, and the price of ignoring it, as Poland emphasized at that CDC conference. Some of those lessons can be ingrained early in children, the primary target of most shots to begin with, he told me. Decades ago, when Poland’s youngest son was in second grade, he brought home an assignment he’d filled out in science class. The page was headed with a prompt: “Flu (influenza) kills and hurts people. A flu vaccine exists. What should we do every fall?” Beneath it, Poland told me, his son had scrawled, We should get a shot. So his son did.

Avian flu detected in Kansas' wild birds Disease found in 20 states; no human cases reported A highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has been confirmed this past week in Kansas snow geese such as these birds at Cheyenne Bottoms. Migrating birds have carried the virus westward to 20 states after hitting the U.S. East Coast from Europe since December. - photo by COURTESY PHOTO Dr. Dan Witt It’s been awhile, but the “bird flu” is back in Kansas.Since March 4, the Kansas Department of Agriculture, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, has been warning of a confirmed presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in wild waterfowl in central Kansas. While nationwide in scope, the Kansas warning is especially aimed at hunters and poultry production operations in the state due to current migrations in the Cheyenne Bottoms central flyway.“Confirmed HPAI in wild birds in central Kansas is an indication that Kansas birds are at risk of exposure from the wild migratory bird population, said Justin Smith, Animal Health Commissioner. “We’ve encouraged Kansas poultry owners to be aware of this possibility, but now the reality is all poultry owners need to be vigilant in taking steps to protect their flocks from avian influenza.“If you haven’t implemented biosecurity practices yet, the time to do it is now.” On Wednesday, the KDA updated its message, noting that biosecurity is a high priority. Officials at the Kansas Wetlands Education Center, Cheyenne Bottoms, the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks & Tourism and the Brit Spaugh Zoo in Great Bend have begun the implementation of biosecurity protocols to protect their respective animal populations.“We need all poultry owners to be part of the effort to prevent of disease in Kansas,” Commissioner Smith said Wednesday. “Our best defense is to follow strict biosecurity practices and vigilantly monitor birds for any signs of illness.”Officials are currently investigating cases in snow geese and Ross’s Goose taken by hunter harvest, although other wild birds are highly susceptible. Cases of domestic birds such as chickens, turkeys and other birds have also been identified in neighboring states, in backyard flocks as well as commercial operations. At this time, no domestic cases have been detected in Kansas. This is the first confirmed occurrence of HPAI in Kansas since 2015. Safety firstFor poultry, biosecurity practices include:• Prevent all contact with wild birds, especially wild waterfowl. • Restrict unauthorized people and vehicles.• Cover and enclose outdoor feeding areas and cover stored feed.• Clean and disinfect any vehicle tires or equipment that has been on other farms or other locations where there is poultry or wild birds.• Wear clean clothing, boots and shoes when in contact with your flock.• Isolate new birds.Hunter safetyWildfowl hunters have also been advised to follow biosecurity procedures to prevent accidental exposure and transmission. Officials at Cheyenne Bottoms have issued the following safety protocols for hunters and birding enthusiasts:• Clean harvested birds in the field; do hot take them home to clean.• No salvaging of dead birds.• No transport of ill birds to rehab centers.• Wear disposable gloves when handling dead birds. • Change into clean clothes after being in the field, clean and disinfect shoes.Symptoms of HPAI include: coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge and other signs of respiratory distress; lack of energy and appetite; decreased water consumption; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled, misshapen eggs; incoordination; and diarrhea. Avian influenza can also cause sudden death in birds, even if they are asymptomatic.At the first sign of symptoms, contact a veterinarian. Producers may also contact KDA’s Division of Animal Health at 785-564-6601 or toll-free at 833-765-2006.Evidence of avian flu in birds has been confirmed to date in 20 states, most recently in Kansas, involving three major migratory flyways.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, no human cases of HPAI have been detected in the U.S. Avian influenza does not present a food safety risk; poultry and eggs are safe to eat when handled and cooked properly. Current HPAI wave has European originMANHATTAN — The wave of highly pathogenic avian influenza currently passing through the country’s eastern and central migratory flyways has a European origin, notes a Kansas State University wildlife disease expert.Shane Hesting, wildlife disease coordinator with the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism at KSU, said Friday that Kansas is just the wavefront of the EAH5 strain of the influenza virus attacking bird populations in the U.S.“We have detected EAH5,” Hesting said Friday afternoon. “We haven’t had confirmation of H5N1 yet. It probably is, which is the current one circulating in the U.S. right now.” The disease has been detected in three of the country’s four major flyways beginning on the east coast and moving westward. “It wasn’t in the central flyway (containing Kansas) until late last week,” Hesting said. “As the birds move, they bring it with them.”Hesting said it was important to note that not all infected birds are dying of the disease. The birds collected from Cheyenne Bottoms in Barton County did not exhibit any symptoms in their positive test for H5, he said.“That’s an example of a carrier not sick with it yet. Most of them are carrying it without symptoms, so it will have a serious impact on domestic poultry,” he said. “Any domestic bird is highly at risk of complete eradication from this, if it gets in the pens. Backyard producers should keep their birds penned up as much as they can right now, because in the environment, the virus thrives in the water, ponds and troughs and the like.”Hunters should utilize appropriate PPE and take extra precautions, he said. Hesting said that scientifically, the current strain is the European lineage of H5NI. “It killed birds in Europe, but doesn’t affect people that much,” he said.“The lineage we have here is an offshoot of that,” he said. “The carriers (birds) came here through various corridors. This strain came through Newfoundland in December, bringing it to the Atlantic seaboard and it spread into the Mississippi flyway. Scientists were finding evidence in asymptomatic birds in January and the first poultry farm got infected in Indiana, killing 29,000 turkeys that were meat birds.” There, the entire working flock had to be euthanized to prevent spread, because workers could spread it to other farms from their clothing, he said. Avian flu is a virus that originates primarily with wild bird populations, but can be contracted by humans through contact, Hesting noted. Symptoms usually manifest from two to eight days and seems like the common flu. Cough, fever, sore throat, muscle aches, headache and shortness of breath may occur.Environmentally, the virus can thrive in cold water up to two weeks, but weakens in warmer temperatures, he said.“Once we get into the summer months with a constant warm temperature, we should basically be out of danger,” Hesting said. The Kansas confirmation originated in the Norton area. Hesting said that approximately 215 ill snow geese were collected with a positive result for EAH5 showing in two tested geese. Another sample population of 2,200 was collected in Glen Elder, but results are not in yet. An ill bald eagle was also collected at Glen Elder.Bottoms birds at riskEven with protocols in place, bird populations at risk include sandhill cranes and whoopers, which can be observed on their spring migration through the area as early as February. The KWEC has reported cranes flying overhead at the Bottoms this week.Curtis Wolf, site manager at the Kansas Wetlands Education Center, notes that the risk to human bird watchers is relatively low, but incoming cranes in spring migration would be at risk from sharing the water with infected birds. “We’ve had a lot of sandhill cranes already coming through,” Wolf said Friday. “They’ve been coming through probably for about the last month. It’s the time for whooping cranes to come through as well.”Wolf reported three whooping cranes sighted at Quivira National Wildlife Refuge on Wednesday. “Those were the first ones in this area,” he said. “I did get a report of four sighted up in Nebraska. With waterfowl as the vector for the virus, Wolf said that the cranes would be in the same habitat. Bird-watchers, meanwhile, should be aware of the situation and not attempt to recover a sick bird. They should report dead birds sighted to the proper authorities. Cholera also a possibilitySome of the birds in the Norton sample could have died of avian cholera, Hesting said.Avian cholera is a contagious disease caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida, which commonly affects geese, coots, gulls and crows. Infection in birds results in quick death within 6-12 hours, with symptoms of convulsions and confused behavior. The Norton snow geese could possibly have carried the flu and cholera as a co-infection simultaneously, Hesting said. Bird deaths resulting from avian cholera were documented in 2015 at Cheyenne Bottoms and Quivira. About 30 dead geese were picked up from Cheyenne Bottoms in December of that year.

Latner, JD | March 14, 2022 Although the facts in this month’s Legal Advisor predate the COVID-19 pandemic, the legal impact is likely to be relevant in cases that involve religious exemption for mandatory vaccines. Ms A is a nurse who provided direct care to geriatric patients at a hospital’s outpatient facility. She began working for the hospital in 2001. In 2012, the hospital adopted a system-wide policy requiring influenza vaccination of all employees unless a specific exemption was requested and approved. The hospital’s policy was based on recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Joint Commission on Accredited Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) in order to protect patients. The hospital’s position was that any exemption to its mandatory influenza vaccination policy would weaken the efficacy of the organization’s ability to protect patients from a potentially dangerous communicable disease. Ms A received a flu vaccine in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, and did not request an exemption. In the spring of 2017, however, Ms A began feeling concerned about immunization. In the fall of 2017, Ms A became pregnant and became worried that the influenza immunization might increase her risk for miscarriage. She asked her midwife to certify her for a medical exemption from the mandatory flu shot. The midwife refused. Ms A then asked her obstetrician to provide her with a medical exemption and notified her employer that she was seeking a medical exemption. After the request to the obstetrician was refused, Ms A made a post to a Facebook group “Vaccine Re-education Discussion Forum,” explaining her situation. Members of the group responded to Ms A and encouraged her to avoid vaccination. Several members of the group instructed Ms A to seek a religious-based exemption. “It’s so very easy,” wrote one member of the group, “all I had to do was say I do not vaccinate for religious reasons.” In mid-November, Ms A filed a request for a religious exemption for the influenza vaccine. A retired chief judge of the United States District Court served as a third-party reviewer for religious exemption requests by the hospital’s employees. The judge interviewed Ms A and questioned her about her claims of religious beliefs that prevented her from being vaccinated. The judge was in possession of Ms A’s post to the Facebook group and the responses from the members. After his discussion with Ms A, the judge authored a report concluding that Ms A had a medical objection to the requirement, not a religious objection, and recommended that the hospital deny her request. The judge recommended that Ms A be vaccinated by mid-December, at which point she would be past her first trimester of pregnancy. The hospital followed the judge’s recommendation and denied Ms A’s religious objection and instructed her to get vaccinated. Ms A refused. The hospital terminated her contract in January, solely for her refusal to comply with the hospital’s vaccination policy. Ms A filed a religious discrimination lawsuit against the hospital. Legal Background Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to “fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual … because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” Under Title VII, employees may assert 2 different theories of religious discrimination: failure to accommodate and disparate treatment. Ms A alleged that the hospital failed to accommodate her based on its refusal to exempt her from its vaccine requirement. The hospital made a motion to dismiss the case, alleging that the plaintiff had failed to show religious discrimination. To decide the hospital’s motion, the court examined what is necessary to support a Title VII failure to accommodate claim. First, the court noted that the plaintiff has the initial burden of proving her case; if she does, then the burden shifts to the hospital to show that it either made a good faith attempt to reasonably accommodate Ms A’s religious belief or that such accommodation would cause undue hardship to the employer. To establish her case, the court noted that Ms A must be able to show that: She holds a sincere religious belief that conflicts with a job requirement;She informed her employer of this conflict; andShe was disciplined for failing to comply with the conflicting requirement. It’s the plaintiff’s burden to prove that they hold a sincere religious objection to the influenza vaccine. “Anti-vaccination beliefs themselves are not religious and therefore are not entitled to accommodation under Title VII,” wrote the court in its decision. During questioning, Ms A said that she only requested her religious-based exemption after she had researched vaccines from a medical perspective. She did not request a religious exemption until after she had unsuccessfully petitioned her midwife and obstetrician for a medical-based exemption. The court also pointed out that Ms A’s religious beliefs regarding vaccination only developed days before she filed her religious exemption request. Finally, the court pointed out that Ms A’s consulting with a secular, antivaccination Facebook group does not lead to the conclusion that she requested an accommodation for religious reasons. The court noted that Ms A had received the vaccine and not asked for an exemption from 2012 through 2016, and that her multiple tattoos and piercings did not align with her claim that the bible compelled her to keep her blood “pure under all circumstances and free from contaminates.” Although Ms A introduced a letter from a pastor, the court pointed out that it wasn’t written until after Ms A was fired from her job. “Based on the record before the court,” the decision stated, “no reasonable jury could find that plaintiff had a sincerely held religious belief objection to the influenza vaccine.” The court dismissed the case against the hospital. Protecting Yourself Religious objections to vaccinations must be sincere to be protected. Religious views that are expressed abruptly will be viewed suspiciously. Clinicians should not attempt a religious objection to vaccination if they don’t have a history of those beliefs to back it up. Ann W.

Rapiim SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative Rapid Antigen Test System Canon produced rapid antigen test system “Rapiim” which consists of analyzer and dedicated test kits. We have developed a new dedicated test kit for the COVID-19. It takes just as 15 minutes for detecting antigens of SARS-CoV-2*. The test results help medical staffs and improve their working environments in medical institutions. *SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 after transmitting to people 2022/03/17 #Realizing Professionals' Ideals#Medical Rapid Antigen Test Kit for SARS-CoV-2 Screening The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has made hospitals keep guarding against SARS-CoV-2 carriers slipping into their green areas. Rapid tests are helpful for screening SARS-CoV-2 carriers from outpatients. The test kits alarms medical staffs in early stage and they prepare risks and prevent COVID-19 in-hospital infections by isolating the carriers/patients in COVID-19 care units. Yokohama City University Hospital adopted the rapid test kits co-developed in the collaborative research between Yokohama City University and Canon Medical Systems (called “Canon”) Dr. Hideaki Kato, Head of Infection Prevention and Control Department, Yokohama City University Hospital Yokohama City University Hospital admitted COVID-19 patients of first Japanese cluster case of outbreak in cruise ship that entered the Port of Yokohama in February 2020 and has provided medical services for COVID-19 patients. Through our experience in preventing and managing the risk of cluster of COVID-19, we found out that it is necessary to perform screening test for SARS-CoV-2 carriers in short time for managing SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the facilities. Dr. Hideaki Kato, MD, head of Infection Prevention and Control Department at the university hospital, leads and manages the hospital-wide COVID-19 operations. He started the screening test with immunochromatographic antigen test kits taking half an hour for getting test results at the outpatient fever clinic and emergency room in the hospital. “As our hospital was originally not a designated medical institution for new infectious diseases, it was very hard to us to separate COVID-19 suspected patient traffic from SARS-CoV-2 negative patient traffic in our emergency room and outpatient fever clinic. We have been performing PCR tests for all patients on admission and patients visiting our emergency room and outpatient fever clinic. PCR tests keep us waiting for half a day, e.g. we take specimen from patients in the morning and get the test results in the afternoon. We must provide medical services to patients as SARS-CoV-2 carrier, with wearing PPE until we get negative results.Dr. Kato explored alternative new test kits at the point of higher sensitivity and shorter turn-around time. After evaluating available rapid antigen test kits in the market at that time, he adopted Canon’s “Rapiim SARS-CoV-2-N and Rapiim Eye 10” for their screening tests. A Higher Sensitivity and Specificity Antigen Test Kit “We initially hesitated for using the conventional immunochromatographic antigen test kits in routine screening, because we heard that other healthcare facilities sometimes encountered false-positive case and false-negative cases with the test kits. We decided to adopt Canon’s Rapiim SARS-CoV-2-N because it was developed in collaborative research between Microbiology Lab at our university and Canon, and it has good performance in sensitivity and specificity. *Immunochromatographic test kits: the concept of immunochromatography is combination of chromatography (separation of components of a sample based on differences in their movement through a sorbent) and immunochemical reactions (antigen-antibody reactions). The test kits are simple devices intended to detect the presence or absence of the target analyte. Test results are interpreted visually. The presence of the test line suggests presence of antigen in the kits. The tests are very popular in diagnosis of Flu (Influenza), pregnancy and other respiratory infectious diseases. The antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 are designed to diagnose COVID-19 patients with such symptoms as fever (within nine days following onset of symptoms), using a nasal swab (mucus specimen collected from a depth of approximately 2cm) or a nasopharyngeal swab (mucus specimen collected from the back of the nose). These tests make use of immunochemical reaction “antigen-antibody reaction,” an innate immunological mechanism of the human body, to detect target proteins present in the virus (antigens). The Combination of high-sensitive optical detection technology of Canon and high-specific antibody of the Microbiology Lab at the Yokohama City University achieved higher sensitive and specific test kit for detecting COVID-19. This test system delivers well-balanced performance that satisfies the three key elements in screening of SARS-CoV-2; “higher sensitivity, shorter turnaround time and higher specificity (lower risk of false-positivity due to cross-reaction to other viruses or bacteria).” Additionally, It allows users to test on-site with simple pre-procedures in short time and no-specific facilities such as vacuum chambers. 1. Drop the sample (mixture of reagent and analyte collected from the patient) into the test cartridge 2. Interpretate the data into positiveegative results based on the attenuation of outgoing light from the optical waveguide thin film in the cartridge Detection antibodies are immobilized on the surface of the optical waveguide thin film (sensor). Meanwhile, light-scattering particles conjugated with capture antibodies are also prepared to be used for labelling. When antigens are not present, there is no antigen-antibody reaction, and scattering does not occur when light goes through the thin film since the light-scattering particles do not exist in the evanescent light field on the surface of the thin film. On the other hand, when antigens are present, they trigger an antigen-antibody reaction with antigens. Scattering particles are captured in the evanescent light field on the surface of the optical waveguide thin film by antigen-antibody reaction among the antigen and the detection antibodies immobilized on the thin film. The light is attenuated by the scattering particles at every reflection on the thin film. The analyzer measure the attenuation of the light and translate the value into the results (positiveegative). Easy Operation at Point of Care As a doctor working at the front line of medical treatment for COVID-19, Dr. Kato felt that Canon’s test system helps medical staffs because it was small footprint and simple operation. “In our hospital, the doctors test and diagnose patients with the antigen tests by ourselves. And it is helpful in our operations in outpatient fever clinic and emergency room because of 4 reasons. First, its footprint is so small to install it on a desk in the consultation room. Second, we could test with it everywhere in our hospital because it gets power supply by ordinary outlets (100V, 3Pin) in almost all rooms in our hospital. Third, it boots up so immediately that we start testing in short time. And finally, we could get the results within 4 minutes (minimum) or 15 minutes. Rapiim soften our stress in providing medical treatment to patients by certifying negative in short time with the test; “We performed Rapiim and chest CT scan on a young patient having symptoms of pneumonia in parallel then we diagnosed the symptom caused by COVID-19 based on CT images and Rapiim results in 30 minutes and started treatment on the patient immediately. It is really stressful for us to continue medical treatment to patients not having certification of COVID-19 with the test. With the antigen test, we could diagnose patients within 30 minutes after patient’s arrival. The rapidity and sensitivity of the test for screening of SARS-CoV-2, would relieve healthcare staff providing treatment to COVID-19 suspected patients.” Test Softens Stress of Medical Staffs in the Hospital There are some variabilities in users’ interpretation of visual test line of immunochromatographic antigen test. For example, some users interpretate a faint line as negative, others do the line as positive. Canon’s Rapiim antigen test system shows the interpretated result as “+ (positive)” or “- (negative),” which would make the medical staffs less stressful in interpretation of test results. Rapiim SARS-CoV-2-N detects SARS-CoV-2 proteins at 6.64pg/ml (LOD: limit of detection) and achieves 5 times higher sensitivity compared with conventional immunochromatographic test devices. Its test procedure is simple (3 steps; make a sample by squeezing the swabbed specimen in buffer solution, drop the sample into the test cartridge set on the analyzer and start analyzing by the analyzer). Additionally, its turn-around time is minimum 4 minutes in case of high density of viral antigens, and 15 minutes in case of no or very tiny density of the antigens. Using the combination of less cross-reactional antibodies in the test kit reduce risks of false positive rate. “It was very difficult to secure enough clinical laboratory technicians for performing PCR tests especially on weekends, holidays and at night. On the other hand, medical staff could perform the Rapiim without special test skills and get the results very soon. The scientific certification with the test is helpful for convincing all type of staffs in our hospital, and soften their stress in working in next to COVID-19.” said Dr. Kato. In this sense, the higher sensitivity and specificity of the antigen test system helps medical staffs to reduce their stress and worries. Getting Ready for a Pandemic of a New Infectious Disease “We feel very happy to see that patients being in isolated room until the day before are discharged without any complication from our hospital”, remarked Dr. Kato. We are preparing to provide medical services throughout prevention and treatment in case of pandemics of new infectious diseases based on the experiences of managing expansion of COVID-19. Canon will continue to develop products and services in order to promptly provide test solutions that would benefit both patients and medical staffs. * This article contains the personal views and comments of the doctor.

(WIBW) - State officials say a strain of bird flu has shown up in two more Kansas counties.The Kansas Dept. of Agriculture announced Friday that samples show cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in two non-commercial backyard mixed-species flocks (poultry), one in Dickinson Co. and the other in rural Sedgwick Co.The disease previously was detected in a backyard flock in Franklin Co. and has been reported in other parts of the country as well. Its presence in Kansas had area zoos announcing precautions this week to keep it from impacting their birds.KDA has quarantined the affected locations, and the birds will be removed to prevent disease spread.Agriculture officials are urging anyone involved with poultry production - whether small and private, or large and commercial - to take measures to ensure their birds are healthy. The KDA Division of Animal Health offers guidance on its web site at agriculture.ks.gov/AvianInfluenza. According to KDA, HPAI is a highly contagious viral disease that can infect chickens, turkeys and other birds. It can cause severe illness or sudden death. Symptoms may include coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and respiratory distress; lack of energy and appetite; decreased water consumption; decreased egg production; incoordination; and diarrhea. Some birds may show no symptoms.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says the recent HPAI infections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases have been detected, and birds and eggs from infected flocks will not enter the food system. KDA has additional information on its avian influenza web page at agriculture.ks.gov/AvianInfluenza or call KDA at 833-765-2006.Copyright 2022 WIBW.

Schmitt Posted on Mar 17, 2022 11:34 PM EDT So far in this outbreak, 24 states have detected HPAI in wild bird populations. USDA Share Avian flu is on the rise across the southeastern U.S. The highly contagious disease has already killed hundreds of wild birds along the Atlantic Flyway, and it is now spreading to other regions of the country. The latest reports come out of North Carolina and Florida, where wildlife officials are seeing an uptick in the number of infected birds. The fatal strain of H5N1 Avian Influenza, which is a type of “Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza” (HPAI), was first detected in 53 wild birds in North Carolina in January. The state has since reported four more cases, including a snow goose (Hyde County), a redhead duck (Carteret County), a red-shouldered hawk (Wake County), and a bald eagle (Dare County). The snow goose and redhead duck were “observed with neurological signs consistent with avian flu” before being euthanized by North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission staff. The hawk and eagle were already dead when found. Lab results confirmed that avian influenza was the cause of death for all four, according to the agency. In Florida, wildlife officials reported 38 confirmed cases of HPAI in five counties (Martin, Brevard, Volusia, Charlotte and Palm Beach) with “hundreds more” unconfirmed cases, Treasure Coast Newspapers reports. “Right now, we are still gathering as much information as possible to determine the epidemiology of this virus,” Fish and Wildlife Research Institute spokesperson Carly Jones told the Florida news outlet. “Local outbreaks are likely spurred by multiple factors, including concentrations of susceptible species.” This is the “first known outbreak” of this avian influenza strain in the Sunshine State and, so far, it seems to mainly impact scaup and other ducks, according to Jones. Other affected birds include owls, pelicans, vultures, and bald eagles. Cases aren’t limited to the Southeast either, and a map published earlier today shows that the disease has also spread to the Northeast and Midwest. According to USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, at least 24 different states have detected HPAI in wild birds. About 75 percent of the birds exposed to the avian flu die, according to Dr. Tara Harrison, associate professor of zoo and exotic animal medicine at North Carolina State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine. While songbirds might not be as prone to the disease, hawks, eagles, vultures, crows, gulls, and ravens are incredibly susceptible to HPAI since they feed on infected waterfowl, which are the primary carriers. Backyard chickens and ducks are also extremely at risk, as are domestic turkey and chicken farming operations. Nearly 7 million chickens and turkeys in 13 states have already been killed this year by this particular strain. So, how do you know if a bird has been infected? Lesser scaup are one of the most vulnerable species to HPAI, according to the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute. Jim Hudgins / USFWS “If those birds are not acting quite right, if they are having neurologic symptoms, like a head tilt, or they’re swimming in circles, or they’re walking in a way that seems very uncoordinated. Those are all cases that we would want to be alerted to so that we could follow up on them,” NC wildlife health biologist Sarah Van de Berg told WRAL News. As for the impact on Florida’s spring wild turkey season—which runs March 5 through April 10 for land south of State Road 70, and March 19 through April 24 for land north of State Road 70—hunters should anticipate that the season will proceed as planned. Read Next: Avian Flu a Growing Concern in North Carolina as Officials Confirm More Cases in Wild Ducks “We have never seen an outbreak of [bird flu] in wild turkeys, and have only documented cases that have gotten into captive facilities,” Jones said. “However, we need to consider wild turkeys, like their captive counterparts, as highly susceptible and take precautions to protect our natural populations.” Because the virus can spread via feces—especially when people step in it and get it on their shoes—Jones recommended taking extra precautions when spending time around wild birds. People are also encouraged to report any sightings of sick or dead birds to FWC. “We stress all citizens, regardless if they hunt, to always rinse and disinfect their shoes and boots and wash their clothes after walking through any area of high density waterfowl or seabirds,” Jones said.

Missouri farmer says egg market is 'hot'; grocers watching prices By Spectrum News Staff St. Louis PUBLISHED 3:11 PM CT Mar. 18, 2022 PUBLISHED 3:11 PM CDT Mar. 18, 2022 SHARE ST. LOUIS, Mo. â The market is hot right now when it comes to eggs according to a farmer at Midwest Egg Farms. The company and other egg producers have watched the market go up about 50 cents a dozen on eggs this week. âI donât know what to expect, itâs just crazy right now,â said the Midwest Egg Farms employee. The uncertainty comes as bird flu is spreading and killing millions of chickens. Midwest Egg Farms, which does mostly wholesale business, has nearly 100,000 chickens on its eastern Missouri farm and is keeping a close eye on the news about the virus. At least 10 million chickens in 13 states have been killed so far this year due to avian influenza, also known as the bird flu. Missouri has had 6 cases so far this year, including reports in St. Louis and St. Charles Counties. Midwest Egg Farm says it isnât seeing the demand like during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company expects prices will be impacted but itâs unclear exactly how that will trickle down to consumers. Around St. Louis, a dozen of large eggs was $1.69 Friday at local grocers Schnucks. It says the bird flu is certainly something to keep an eye on. It gets most of its eggs from Rose Acre Farm in Lincoln County, Missouri. The grocer says current egg prices are going up due to inflation and chicken feed has been the reason for some price increases. According to Urner Barryâs food commodity market report, wholesale eggs jumped 10 cents to $1.60 a dozen on Wednesday, the biggest single-day gain since the onset of COVID-19. Midwest Egg Farms says the price went up Thursday and then rose another 20 cents Friday. Urner Barry also reports some retailers have begun to pull heavier volumes as bird flu stands to threaten the supply chain. The report says these buyers hope to be well-stocked by the time Easter-related demand bolsters consumer interests. When it comes to wholesale buying, the report says interest is high as players hope to secure as much inventory as possibly given the uncertainty brought about by the ongoing Avian Flu epidemic. Midwest Egg Farms says it has received calls from wholesalers wanting to stock up to take advantage of the current prices. State and federal officials hope the disease wonât spread as extensively as during an outbreak in 2015 that led to the deaths of about 50 millions chickens and turkeys, causing egg and meat prices to soar. Scientists are confident that wild birds are spreading the disease, but they are unsure how the virus infects commercial flocks in highly secure barns. Research since 2015 suggests the virus can be tracked inside on equipment, workers, mice, small birds, and even dust particles. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the recent bird flu infections in flocks do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. While it can be transmitted to humans, it is unusual and typically due to close contact with infected birds.

After the first case of avian influenza was confirmed just days ago in Kansas, local wildlife experts are doing all they can to limit the possible spread of the deadly disease.A case of the “bird-flu” was confirmed in Franklin County Saturday within a “non-commercial backyard mixed-species flock (poultry).” According to Shane Hesting of the Kansas Wildlife and Parks Disease Biology Department, avian influenza is extremely dangerous to all species of birds and is often most potent with “domestic poultry.”https://media.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/2530/files/2022/03/hesting-birds.mp3Hesting says poultry owners can, and should, take a series of steps to help prevent any potential spread of the virus including:*Prevent contact with wild birds, especially waterfowl *Restrict unauthorized access by people and vehicles *Cover and enclose outdoor feeding areas *Cover stored feed *Clean and disnfect vehicle tires or equipment that has been at other farms or locations with poultry or wild birds *Wear clean clothing, including boots and shoes, when in contact with your flock *Isolate new birds.Hesting also says while bird flu is not as dangerous to humans, residents should still avoid any contact with wild birds that are showing symptoms of the virus including coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, decreased water consumption, decreased egg production, misshapen eggs, lack of coordination and diarrhea. If you come across wild birds showing any of these symptoms do not move the animal, instead, call your veterinarian or the Kansas Department of Animal Health at 785-564-6601.With the presence of bird flu now in Kansas, David Traylor Zoo Director Lisa Keith says the zoo has taken steps to protect its large population of avian animals.https://media.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/2530/files/2022/03/keith-birds.mp3If you have questions or would like more information visit www.agriculture.ks.gov/avianinfluenza.

NORTHFIELD, Minn. (FOX 9) - The 2015 bird flu outbreak decimated poultry flocks across Minnesota, and turkey farmer John Zimmerman has been on high alert ever since. "We are very concerned. We've been concerned since the last outbreak," Zimmerman told FOX 9. His family has been producing turkeys at their Northfield farm since the 1950s and the news that the bird flu has been found in neighboring Wisconsin, South Dakota, and Iowa made his fears a reality. "The sooner we can stop these smaller outbreaks, before they become larger outbreaks, the better off the whole industry will be," said Zimmerman. In 2015, he was one of the lucky ones. Zimmerman didn't lose any birds in that outbreak, but other farmers in Minnesota weren't as lucky. Now, he's hoping the lessons they learned then will help spare their flocks. Poultry farmers are on high alert for the bird flu this year after a spread of it wiped out farms in 2015. "We are just going to batten down the hatches for this next month or so, as the ducks and geese are still flying overhead, and while the temperatures are still cool," said Zimmerman. He has bio-safety measures in place – like wearing protective gear in the barn – and says the birds will stay inside for the time being. What's especially troubling for him about this outbreak is that it's being found in backyard chicken flocks. "It's not just the big guys that this can affect. If you have five to six birds in your backyard, they can be affected and if they are allowed to carry that virus, they can affect everyone around them... A fancy chicken or a heritage breed, or any other type of poultry can get this disease and die just as readily as a commercial bird," said Zimmerman. University of Minnesota Poultry Extension Educator Abby Schuft has been working to spread the word about the spread of bird flu among commercial and hobby farmers. If you have backyard chickens, she suggests limiting visitors and keeping their food inside so wild birds will stay away from it.

(Copyright 2022 by WJXT News4Jax - All rights reserved.)JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – As “bird flu” continues to spread across coastal counties in the state, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) said Monday it has identified a presumptive case in Duval County.FWC said it has been investigating deaths of various bird species believed to be caused by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), commonly referred to as bird flu. There have already been confirmed cases in Volusia, Brevard, Martin and Charlotte counties.Recommended VideosWhile there are concerns when it comes to birds, FWC said there is a low risk of bird flu transmission to humans and there have been no known human infections in North America.To prevent the spread of HPAI, the public should avoid handling sick or dead wildlife, prohibit the contact of domestic birds with wild birds, and report wild bird mortalities so die-offs can be investigated. FWC said that because HPAI is very contagious and not treatable in wild birds, some wildlife rehabbers may not be accepting these animals at this time.The H5 2.3.4.4 strain has been documented in the US since 2021 and was detected in Palm Beach County in January 2022 from a hunter-harvested blue-winged teal.To see a map of cases in Florida and to get answers to questions, visit the FWC website.

Experts weigh in.Maxine YeungMarch 16, 2022 at 5:18 AM·4 min readLink CopiedElderberry has been used to treat colds, the flu and more in folk medicine for centuries. But can the remedy really boost your immune system? (Getty Images)Elderberry has been used to treat colds, the flu and more in folk medicine for hundreds of years. Hippocrates, the father of medicine, even called the elder tree his “medicine chest.” With cold and flu season overlapping with the COVID-19 pandemic, elderberry has become a go-to treatment for some. But can this popular remedy really boost your immune system?What is elderberry?Elderberry is a tart, dark purple berry from the Sambucus nigra tree, also known as the European or black elder tree. The trees are native to Europe and grow in North America, Asia and Northern Africa.The berries are packed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Their flavonols, phenolic acids and anthocyanins help counteract oxidative stress, but sometimes the processing of elderberries can lower this beneficial impact.Elderberries are commonly used in jams, wines and sauces, and supplements that come in the form of syrups, teas, gummies, lozenges and pills.But they’re not meant to be eaten raw. Mary Mosquera Cochran, a registered dietitian at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, warns that “any preparation of elderberries you use should be cooked.” That’s because raw unripe elderberries contain toxic substances, such as sambunigrin, that release cyanide and can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH).“The bark, seeds and leaves also contain this toxic substance and should be avoided in home preparations or products,” Cochran tells Yahoo Life. “Commercial preparations of elderberry don’t contain this substance and are generally recognized as safe.”Cochran also recommends that children and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding avoid elderberry supplements, “as there’s no research on this population pertaining to the safety of elderberry.”What are the health benefits of elderberry?Elderberry has long been used in medicine, mainly for its antioxidant properties. It’s been part of a variety of treatments, including for respiratory illnesses, bruises, burns and even acne. Some studies show elderberries may help reduce the risk of diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease.There may also be some benefits with reducing blood pressure and cholesterol, though Cochran points out that “studies with humans have been small in size,” and the NCCIH says that “more research and larger studies are needed to definitively prove the specific health benefits of elderberries.”How can elderberry help with colds and flu?While elderberry doesn’t appear to reduce the risk of developing a cold, it may reduce the duration and severity of colds and influenza.Five studies involving 936 adults show that when elderberry is taken within 48 hours of the onset of an acute respiratory viral infection, it may reduce the length and severity of symptoms, such as fever, headache, nasal congestion and nasal mucous discharge. Study participants averaged a 50% reduction in symptoms within two to four days of taking elderberry.Taking elderberry before flying may also be a good idea: A 2016 study found that air travelers taking elderberry from 10 days before until up to five days after traveling overseas reported a shorter sickness and fewer cold symptoms.However, the research is mixed when it comes to elderberry’s role in fighting the flu. In 2004, researchers found that flu symptoms were relieved on average four days sooner in participants taking elderberry than those taking a placebo. However, a study from 2020 found no evidence that elderberry improves the severity or duration of influenza.Dr. Harrison Weed, an internal medicine physician at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Yahoo Life that “there is insufficient information to say that there is or there is not a benefit of some preparation of elderberry in treatment of acute mild viral respiratory infections.”Can elderberry help prevent or treat COVID-19?Just like with colds and flu, elderberry has not been shown to help treat symptoms or reduce the risk of getting COVID. In fact, the NCCIH warns against it, stating: “Don’t rely on elderberry or other dietary supplements for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They have not been shown to be effective.”The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is even taking action against companies that are marketing unsupported claims of elderberry as a product that helps prevent or treat COVID because there are no published research studies for this purpose.So how can you strengthen your immune system?“There is no food, magic elixir, or medication to strengthen the immune system,” points out Weed. The best way to support your immune system is to focus on your overall health, meaning “get good sleep, eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly [and] nurture caring relationships,” he says.Cochran also says that even though “taking elderberry products can be a safe way to seek relief from symptoms and possibly shorten your illness, don't skip getting your flu shot and seeking medical attention if you feel you have the flu" or a persistent cold.Maxine Yeung is a registered dietitian and personal trainer.Want lifestyle and wellness news delivered to your inbox?

PALMYRA, Wis. - Nearly three million chickens and eggs will need to be destroyed now that Wisconsin officials confirm cases of bird flu at a Jefferson County farm. It is the first case in the state since 2015. The Wisconsin Department Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection confirmed cases of bird flu at the commercial poultry flock. The positive samples came from Cold Spring Egg Farm in Palmyra. "Movement of any poultry or poultry products were restricted. Also, any farm within a 10-kilometer radius poultry farm, those also are restricted from moving any products on or off their site," said Kevin Hoffman of the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.

Cold Spring Egg Farm, Palmyra "It’s not easy for anybody on site, it’s not easy for the producer, but as animal health staff it’s our priority to make sure this virus doesn’t spread off site," Hoffman said. Health officials say birds from the flock will not enter the food system. But they are asking people with poultry to move them indoors – and watch for symptoms.

Picture: FILE A surge in influenza cases has caused a severe strain on the outpatient care capacity, says Health Ministry permanent secretary Dr James Fong. He said while the ministry was continuing efforts to support COVID-19 vaccination, they were also recording high number of leptospirosis, typhoid and dengue fever cases. Dr Fong said Fiji’s influenza season typically began in January and ended by May or June. “However, in 2020 and 2021 there was a marked decrease in cases of influenza detected, a trend that was also seen in other countries,” he said. “It is likely that public health and social measures deployed for COVID-19 worked to decrease other respiratory viruses, including influenza. “The current increase in cases suggests a return to pre-pandemic levels of seasonal influenza, however, it is also possible that decreased incidence of influenza in recent years will have led to decreased immunity in the community, and subsequently more people becoming ill than in a usual flu season.” He said children under the age of five, especially babies, and the elderly were most at risk of severe influenza. “The ministry has been working on measures to open more facilities with extended service hours and streamline outpatient services to help reduce waiting times.” Amount of FJD: Convert To: Australian DollarCanadian DollarChinese YuanEuroU.K. Pound SterlingHong Kong DollarIndonesian RupiahIndian RupeeJapanese YenSouth Korean WonMalaysian RinggitNew Zealand DollarPhilippine PesoSingapore DollarThai BahtNew Taiwan Dollar U.S. DollarVietnamese DongSwiss FrancDanish KroneEgyptian PoundIsraeli New SheqelJordanian DinarLebanese PoundNorwegian KroneSwedish KronaSouth African RandU.A.E DirhamBulgarian LevBrazilian RealCzech KorunaHungarian ForintIcelandic KronaMoldova LeiMexican PesoPolish ZlotyRomanian New LeuSerbian DinarRussian RoubleTurkish LiraUkrainian HryvniaChilean PesoArmenia DramAzerbaijan ManatBangladeshi takaDominican PesoAlgerian DinarGeorgian lariIraqi dinarKyrgyzstan SomKazakhstani TengeLibyan DinarMoroccan DirhamPakistani RupeeSaudi RiyalTajikistan RubleNew Turkmenistan ManatTunisian DinarUzbekistan SumCentral African CFA FrancWest African CFA FrancBelarussian RubleVenezuelan BolivarPeruvian Nuevo SolArgentine PesoBolivian BolivianoColombian PesoCosta Rican ColónHaitian gourdePanamanian BalboaParaguayan GuaraníUruguayan PesoNigerian NairaAfghan afghaniAlbanian lekNeth.
