Understanding environmental and behavioral factors, such as the association between flu season and colder weather, can aid in predicting flu peaks. Misinformation and conspiracy theories can have a significant impact on public perception and trust in preventive health measures. Antibiotic misuse in flu treatment should be addressed to prevent complications.
