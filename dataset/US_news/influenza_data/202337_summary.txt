Vaccine Effectiveness: The 2023 Southern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine was found to reduce the risk of influenza-associated hospitalizations by 52%. The circulating influenza viruses were genetically similar to those targeted by the 2023-24 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulation, suggesting that the Northern Hemisphere vaccine may offer similar protection.

Importance of Vaccination: Vaccination remains one of the most effective ways to protect against influenza-associated complications. Health authorities are recommended to encourage healthcare providers to administer seasonal influenza vaccines to all eligible individuals aged 6 months and older, particularly emphasizing the importance of vaccination for those at increased risk for severe outcomes.

REVELAC-i Network: Multiple countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, participated in the Network for the Evaluation of Vaccine Effectiveness in Latin America and the Caribbean-influenza (REVELAC-i) to estimate and monitor vaccine effectiveness in preventing severe acute respiratory infections (SARI)-associated hospitalization.

Declining Vaccination Coverage: Despite a history of high influenza vaccination coverage in Latin American and Caribbean countries, declines in coverage have been observed since 2019.

Monitoring Influenza Viruses: Evaluations of vaccine effectiveness during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season can provide valuable information for countries in the Northern Hemisphere's upcoming season and contribute to the monitoring of influenza viruses.
