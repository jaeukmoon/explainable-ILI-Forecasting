COVID-19 vs. the Flu: COVID-19 and the flu are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. They can have similar symptoms such as fever, cough, body aches, and can result in pneumonia. They spread in similar ways through droplets or virus particles from a sick person, and can also spread through touching contaminated surfaces. Vaccines are available for both COVID-19 and the flu, and preventive measures such as mask-wearing, hand washing, and physical distancing can help reduce the spread of both illnesses.
