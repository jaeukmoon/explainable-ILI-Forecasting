This Phase 1 trial will test the experimental vaccine, known as H1ssF-3928 mRNA-LNP, for safety and its ability to induce an immune response. The trial will enroll up to 50 healthy volunteers aged 18 through 49. Three groups of study participants (10 participants each) will be vaccinated with 10, 25 and 50 micrograms of the experimental vaccine, respectively. After evaluation of the data to determine an optimum dosage, an additional 10 participants will be enrolled to receive the optimum dosage. The study also will include a group of participants who will receive a current quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. This will allow the researchers a point of direct comparison between the immunogenicity and safety of the candidate vaccine and available seasonal flu vaccines. Participants will be regularly evaluated to assess the vaccine’s safety (and, secondarily, its efficacy) and will receive follow-up appointments for up to one year after vaccination. Seasonal influenza, or flu, kills thousands of people in the United States each year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that between 2010 and 2020, between 12,000 and 52,000 people died of flu in the United States annually. Although annual seasonal flu vaccines are valuable tools in controlling the spread and severity of influenza, they do not provide immunity against every flu strain. Each year, before the flu season begins, scientific experts must predict which influenza strains are likely to be most common during the upcoming months and then select three or four of these strains to include in the next seasonal flu vaccine. Vaccine manufacturers then need time to produce and distribute the vaccine—during which the dominant strains of the virus can change in unexpected ways, potentially decreasing the efficacy of the vaccine. An effective universal flu vaccine could eliminate these problems by protecting its recipients against a wide variety of strains and ideally providing durable long-term immunity, so people would not need to be vaccinated every year. “A universal influenza vaccine would be a major public health achievement and could eliminate the need for both annual development of seasonal influenza vaccines, as well as the need for patients to get a flu shot each year,” said Acting NIAID Director Hugh Auchincloss, M.D. “Moreover, some strains of influenza virus have significant pandemic potential. A universal flu vaccine could serve as an important line of defense against the spread of a future flu pandemic.” The early-stage trial is being conducted through the Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers (CIVICs) program, which was created by NIAID in 2019 to support the development of broadly protective and longer-lasting flu vaccines. It is the first investigational universal flu vaccine candidate to be tested by the CIVICs program, and was manufactured at the facilities of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute (DHVI), which is a part of the CIVICs program. A similar vaccine developed by researchers at NIAID’s VRC already has shown positive results in early clinical trials. Both vaccines use a specific portion of a flu protein, hemagglutinin (HA), to induce a broad immune response against influenza. While one portion of the HA protein, known as the head, tends to change as the flu virus spreads and evolves, a more stable portion, known as the stem, evolves very slowly and is very similar across many different types of the flu virus. By using the HA stem as the basis for a vaccine, researchers hope to induce long-term immunity against a broad range of flu viruses. Unlike the VRC’s earlier vaccine, the H1ssF-3928 mRNA-LNP vaccine candidate uses a messenger RNA (mRNA) platform. By developing and testing a variety of different platforms for a universal flu vaccine, researchers are more likely to find one that is both safe and provides strong and broad immunity against a variety of strains.

That week CDC staff convened with leaders from animal and human health sectors across Southeast Asia to hone avian influenza (bird flu) preparedness best practices and to improve data-sharing in the region. CDC Update This week, CDC staff will be convening with leaders from animal and human health sectors across Southeast Asia to hone avian influenza (bird flu) preparedness in the region. The main purpose of this workshop is to share best practices in epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance for bird flu and to improve data-sharing to strengthen the region's ability to respond to bird flu pandemic threats. This workshop takes place amid ongoing global outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5 virus among wild birds and poultry, with sporadic spillover events in mammals and rare human infections. The most prolific of these viruses are H5N1 viruses from clade 2.3.4.4b. Since these began circulating globally in 2022, nine human infections have been reported, including two in China, and one in Vietnam. Additionally, two human H5N1 infections were recently reported in Cambodia from clade 2.3.2.1c, a clade circulating in birds in the region, but human infections had not been reported in that country since 2014. CDC has long supported avian influenza surveillance and prevention in Asia. The first global detections of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus were reported in waterfowl in China in 1996. The virus later began to circulate more widely in the region and caused widespread disease in waterfowl and several human infections and deaths. These human infections and deaths raised concern that the virus could potentially continue to mutate and cause a global human pandemic. As a result, in 2006, CDC increased financial support to countries and the number of flu experts across the globe, with particular focus in Southeast Asia. CDC has continued to support flu surveillance in the region, providing financial and technical assistance, as well as maintaining regional hubs, including several in Asia. In many countries in the region, particularly in rural areas, people often rely on poultry and other animals for food and income. These animals typically live intermingled and in very close proximity to their human owners. This proximity raises the possibility of influenza viruses spreading between animals and people, highlighting the importance of prioritizing bird flu surveillance and response in the region. Workshop attendees will look to build on existing efforts to address the ongoing threat of H5 and set region-specific priorities. Further, this workshop will help to elevate the importance of bird influenza preparedness activities among the countries involved by bringing awareness to bird flu and discussing actionable steps for key stakeholders in the region. This workshop is organized by CDC and co-hosted by the Thailand Ministry of Public Health and will include representation from members of the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), as well as key decision makers from Ministries of Health and Ministries from animal and environmental health sectors from countries across Southeast Asia. Human infections have been rare, however specific groups of people who are at higher risk due to their exposure to poultry, including poultry owners, poultry workers, people responding to poultry outbreaks, and those who handle or process chickens should take additional precautions around birds. CDC will continue to provide updates to the current situation as needed.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 viruses continue to be a devastating threat to the poultry industry and an incipient threat to humans. A cross-sectional study was conducted in seven districts of Bangladesh to estimate the prevalence and subtypes (H3, H5, and H9) of AIV in poultry and identify underlying risk factors and phylogenetic analysis of AIVs subtypes H5N1 and H3N8. Cloacal and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from 500 birds in live bird markets (LBMs) and poultry farms. Each bird was sampled by cloacal and oropharyngeal swabbing, and swabs were pooled for further analysis. Pooled samples were analyzed for the influenza A virus (IAV) matrix (M) gene, followed by H5 and H9 molecular subtyping using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Non-H5 and Non-H9 influenza A virus positive samples were sequenced to identify possible subtypes. Selected H5 positive samples were subjected to hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene sequencing. Multivariable logistic regression was used for risk factor analysis. We found that IAV M gene prevalence was 40.20% (95% CI 35.98–44.57), with 52.38%, 46.96%, and 31.11% detected in chicken, waterfowl, and turkey, respectively. Prevalence of H5, H3, and H9 reached 22%, 3.4%, and 6.9%, respectively. Waterfowl had a higher risk of having AIV (AOR: 4.75), and H5 (AOR: 5.71) compared to chicken; more virus was detected in the winter season than in the summer season (AOR: 4.93); dead birds had a higher risk of AIVs and H5 detection than healthy birds, and the odds of H5 detection increased in LBM. All six H5N1 viruses sequenced were clade 2.3.2.1a-R1 viruses circulating since 2015 in poultry and wild birds in Bangladesh. The 12 H3N8 viruses in our study formed two genetic groups that had more similarity to influenza viruses from wild birds in Mongolia and China than to previous H3N8 viruses from Bangladesh. The findings of this study may be used to modify guidelines on AIV control and prevention to account for the identified risk factors that impact their spread.

Based on their potential to cause disease in chickens, avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are grouped into two categories: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) and low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV)2,3,4. AIVs infect chickens, turkeys, and other gallinaceous birds and inflict significant economic losses worldwide5,6,7. In terms of humans and poultry, Bangladesh is one of the world's most densely populated countries. The poultry industry in Bangladesh supports economic growth and poverty reduction in rural and urban areas by creating employment opportunities and food products8. LPAIVs and HPAIVs, including the highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses, have been found in waterfowl, pet birds, wild birds, and chickens in Bangladesh9,10,11,12,13. In Bangladesh, over 580 outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 have been reported in poultry and wild birds since 200714,15,16. Because the poultry industry accounts for 20% of the livestock sector in Bangladesh, the culling of an estimated 250 million diseased animals to date in response to these outbreaks causes food insecurity and negatively impacted the economic growth17. In addition, eight human cases of H5N1 have been reported in Bangladesh, with one fatality18. Human H5N1 infections have been reported in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, China, and Cambodia, all of which have a history of poultry exposure in LBMs and commercial and free-range farms, implying that both LBMs and farms can contribute to the spread of AIVs among poultry and from poultry to humans19,20,21,22. Furthermore, the co-circulation of LPAIV is a source of concern.In Bangladesh, the average number of reported poultry outbreaks caused by AIV subtype H5 per year has declined, dropping from 83 and 10 outbreaks in commercial and backyard poultry, respectively, in 2007–2012 to two and zero outbreaks in 2013–2019. As compensation policies were phased out, underreporting and AIV subtype H5 vaccination in commercial poultry might be among the causes for the reduction in the number of avian influenza outbreaks23. LBMs are the backbone of poultry trade in Bangladesh. Birds of different species and geographical origins are introduced into LBMs on daily basis and these birds may be housed together, allowing for local transmission of several virus subtypes and possible reassortment20,22,24. On the other hand, commercial and backyard poultry farming contribute to the development of the poultry industry of Bangladesh25. Waterfowl, either wild or raised in various settings, such as backyard, nomadic, and free-range, play an additional role in virus transmission among commercial and wild bird populations26,27. Most studies aimed at determining the level of viral circulation in poultry are conducted in LBM, with only a few conducted-on poultry farms24,28,29,30. To address this gap and inform AIV control in poultry in both LBMs and farms, a thorough knowledge of infection patterns and risk management is essential. The study presented here quantifies the extent of H5, H9, and H3 virus circulation, factors influencing the spread of AIVs, and phylogenetic analysis of viruses in duck and turkey farms and LBMs in seven representative districts of Bangladesh.ResultsPrevalence of influenza A virus M-geneThe prevalence of IAV M-gene was 40% (95% CI 35.98–44.57). In our samples, pigeons had the highest prevalence of IAV/ M-gene (75%, 95% CI 23.68–96.67). Further, 52% of the chicken tested positive for M-gene (95% CI 31.78–72.19), and 47% (95% CI 40.80–53.21) of waterfowl were M-gene positive. In addition, IAV M-gene was detected in 31% of the turkey swabs (Fig. 1).Figure 1Sample locations of live bird market and poultry farms showing the avian influenza surveillance sites in seven districts in Bangladesh. The map was generated using ArcGIS version 10.4 (http://arcgis.com/).Full size imageOverall prevalence of IAV subtypes (H3, H5, and H9)Figure 2 presents the prevalence of influenza A virus subtypes. IAV subtype H5 had the highest prevalence (22%, 95% CI 18.58–25.85). The prevalence of IAV subtype H3 and IAV subtype H9 was 3.4% and 6.9%, respectively.Figure 2The prevalence (including 95% binomial confidence intervals) of AIV subtypes H3, H5, H9, and untyped (other subtypes) AIV.Full size imagePrevalence of IAV subtypes (H3, H5, H9) in host taxaIAV subtype H3 was detected only in waterfowl (6.88%, 95% CI 4.31–10.80). On the other hand, IAV subtype H5 was detected in all the species. The prevalence of subtype H5 was highest in chickens (38.09%, 95% CI 20.29–59.81), while 25.51% (95% CI 20.45–31.32) of the waterfowl tested positive for IAV subtype H5. Further, 25% of pigeons and 16% of turkeys were found to have IAV subtype H5. However, IAV subtype H9 was not detected in waterfowl. Only 12.71% of the turkey and 4.76% of the chicken samples were positive for IAV subtype H9, as shown in Fig. 3.Figure 3Prevalence (including 95% binomial confidence intervals) of AIV subtypes H3, H5, H9 and IAV untyped across different poultry species and waterfowl.Full size imagePrevalence of IAV subtypes (H3, H5, and H9) in the LBM-Farm interfaceThe prevalence IAV subtype H5 was much higher in LBMs (39.9%; 95% CI 33.29–46.89) than in farms (10.3%; 95% CI 7.30–14.28). However, the farms had a higher prevalence of both H3 (Farm: 4.97%, LBM: 1.01%) and H9 (Farm: 6.95%, LBM: 5.05%) viruses than LBM, as shown in Fig. 4.Figure 4Prevalence of AIV subtypes H3, H5, and H9 at poultry farm and LBM interface.Full size imageChoropleth map of the prevalence (IAV subtypes H5, H3, and H9) by the districtThe prevalence of IAV M-gene was highest in Thakurgaon. All the samples collected from Thakurgaon were positive for IAV M and subtype H9 (Fig. 5). The prevalence of IAV M-gene was 55% and 49% in Dhaka and Sirajganj, respectively. IAV subtype H5 was detected in 39% and 38% of the samples from Dhaka and Sirajganj, respectively. While the prevalence of IAV subtype H9 was 7% in Dhaka, 0.99% and 1.41% of the samples were IAV subtype H3 positive in Dhaka and Sirajganj, respectively. The prevalence of the IAV M-gene was 38% and was 17.57% for IAV subtype H3 in Kushtia. However, a very low prevalence was recorded for IAV subtypes H5 (4%) and H9 (1%). The prevalence of IAV M-gene was very low in Meherpur (4%) and Rajshahi (5%). In addition, no samples from Rajshahi and Meherpur were detected as being H5 positive. All samples from Naogaon tested negative for the M-gene.Figure 5Choropleth map of the prevalence of avian influenza A virus M-gene, H5, and H9 subtypes identified from the samples in different districts. The map was generated using RStudio version 4.1.2.Full size imageBivariate analysis to determine the factors associated with IAV M-gene and IAV subtype H5Bivariate analyses were conducted to determine the factors associated with M-gene and H5 positivity. The results of the bivariate analysis are given in Table 1. Season, host taxa, health status, and interface were considered. Results from the chi-square test suggest that all the variables were significant risk factors for M-gene and subtype H5 (at 5% significance level). Prevalence was higher in winter than in summer for M-gene (71.11%, 95% CI 60.92–79.54) and subtype H5 (41.11%, 95% CI 31.43–51.54). Based on the interface, the prevalence of M-gene was higher in LBM (53.54%) than in farms (31.46%). The same was true for subtype H5.Table 1 Factors associated with IAV M-gene and H5 subtype (Prevalence and Chi-square test).Full size tableModelingThe multivariable logistic regression modeling of M-gene suggests that season, host taxa, and health status significantly affect M-gene prevalence. However, the season is not a significant factor for subtype H5, but host taxa, health status, and interface are significant factors. The results of the multivariable logistic regression analysis are shown in Table 2. In winter, the chances of being positive for M-gene were 4.93 times higher than in summer, and waterfowl had 4.75 times the odds of being positive for M-gene and 5.71 times the odds of being positive for subtype H5 than chicken.Table 2 Determinants of IAV M-gene and H5 subtype (results from multivariable logistic regression).Full size tableIn terms of health, dead birds were substantially more likely than healthy birds to be both M-gene positive and subtype H5 positive. Furthermore, a bird from LBM had a 3.28 times higher chance of being subtype H5 positive than a bird from a farm (Table 2).Phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA genes of H5N1 and H3N8H5N1Phylogenetic analyses of HA and NA genes of all six H5N1 viruses were performed. H5N1 viruses have evolved into multiple clades including 2.2.2, 2.3.4.2, 2.3.2.1c, and 2.3.2.1a. All the six characterized viruses in the present study, were collected in 2019 (two from Dhaka, three from Kushtia, and one from Sirajganj), shared identical HA and NA sequences and clustered with newly reassorted clade 2.3.2.1a sequences from Bangladesh (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Four substitutions known to play a role in increased alpha-2,6 sialic acid receptor binding have been identified in the HA sequences of the H5N1 strains isolated in the current study: D94N, S155N, T156A and K189R (H5 numbering). No classical neuraminidase inhibitor resistance markers were detected31.Figure 6Phylogenetic analysis of HA gene of H5N1 viruses. Maximum Likelihood tree (HKY + G model) with 500 boostraps (values > 50 shown on branches only); the sequence of the present study was highlighted with a red closed circle. As all H5 sequences from the present study were identical, only Aurkey/Bangladesh/BDADAI-2184/2019 was kept as representative strain. H5 clades are indicated on the right-hand side of the tree.Full size imageH3N8Phylogenetic analyses of HA and NA segments were also performed to gain better understanding of the evolutionary relationships between the characterized 12 H3N8 viruses (eight from Kushtia, two from Dhaka, one from Rajshahi, and one from Sirajganj). The HA segments of the twelve H3 viruses were grouped into the Eurasian lineage (Fig. 7). Ten H3 viruses were identical and clustered in one group; the other two viruses were identical and clustered in another group. The HA sequences of the twelve H3 viruses were genetically more similar to sequences of viruses from Mongolia, China, and Japan than the previously reported H3 viruses from Bangladesh. The twelve N8 neuraminidase genes grouped into the Eurasian lineage. The N8 sequences were closely related to those of viruses from Mongolia and China (Supplementary Fig. 2).Figure 7Phylogenetic analysis of HA gene of H3N8 viruses. Maximum Likelihood tree (HKY + G model) with 500 boostraps (values > 50 shown on branches only); the sequences of the present study were highlighted with a red closed circle. As four H3 sequences from the present study were identical, only A/duck/Bangladesh/BDADAI-2204/2019 was kept as representative of A/duck/Bangladesh/BDADAI-2561/2019, A/duck/Bangladesh/BDADAI-3147/2019, and A/duck/Bangladesh/BDADAI-3237/2019. H3 genotypes (as defined in reference 53) are indicated on the right-hand side of the tree. Reference sequences are in blue text.Full size imageDiscussionAIVs including highly pathogenic strains, can cause zoonotic disease and are often associated with severe economic, animal, and public health consequences32. Influenza A viruses (IAVs) subtype H5 have raised significant concern worldwide due to their high pathogenicity and zoonotic potential. More concerningly, three human infections with avian influenza A (H3N8) virus were reported from China as of April 202333. As a result, determination of the variables that impact influenza virus prevalence is essential. This study investigated the risk factors associated with influenza A, specifically H5 subtype prevalence. The present study detected influenza A viruses in waterfowl, chicken, turkey, and pigeon, similar to previously reported data34,35,36. We screened avian samples and found evidence of H3, H5, and H9 viruses in the tested samples, albeit with specific patterns. No H7 subtype viruses were detected in the tested samples. IAVs subtype H9 were detected only in turkey and chicken samples, and were not detected in waterfowl samples. A higher prevalence of H9 in chickens than waterfowl in LBM was previously reported37,38 similar to the present study. The prevalence of IAV subtype H3 in the present study was lower than that reported in other South Asian countries39. We detected IAV H3 subtype only in waterfowl, which is consistent with the finding that H3 viruses are among the most commonly identified subtypes in ducks (proportion up to 91.76%)38,39. In addition, previous IAVs H3 subtype from Bangladesh were detected primarily in ducks41,42. IAV subtype H3 was detected in Kushtia, Sirajganj, Rajshahi, and Dhaka in the present study and more often in farms than LBMs, suggesting wild bird involvement through interactions with free-range farmed ducks.In the present study, IAV subtype H5 had the highest prevalence. IAV subtype H5 has been spreading in Bangladesh since 2007, with more than 500 outbreaks reported in chickens. Analysis showed that all IAV subtype H5 in the tested samples belonged to the 2.3.2.1a clade. It was also found that the prevalence of influenza A M-gene and influenza A subtypeH5 were greater in chickens than in waterfowls, but the logistic regression model showed an increased risk of the IAV M-gene and IAV subtype H5 in waterfowls, similar to a previous report43.Results of the current study showed that the risk of AIVs was higher in the winter than in the summer, consistent with many outbreaks in Bangladesh and other countries occurring during the same season35,44,45,46. This may be explained due to low temperatures and low humidity, which favor AIVs persistence47. The odds of IAV H5 subtype detection were higher in LBM than in farms in the present study. The LBM biosecurity in Bangladesh is widely seen as falling short of minimum acceptable standards, and their capacity to act as viral evolution drivers facilitating the genesis of new emerging strains is significant48.Molecular markers of influenza HA and NA are associated with increased virulence, adaptation to mammals, or resistance to antiviral agents. Unfortunately, no information on avian H3N8 virus molecular markers is available in literature, except for mutation W222L in HA was shown to allow for equine to dog adaptation for influenza A H3N849. However, many molecular markers HA and NA are well characterized for H5N1. In the present study, four substitutions D94N, S155N, T156A and K189R (H5 numbering) which were previously reported to play a role in the increased α -2,6 SA receptor binding have been identified in the HA of influenza A H5N1 in Bangladesh and no classical neuraminidase inhibitor resistance markers were detected in the NA sequences.Among the limitations of the present study is that only six H5N1 and twelve H3N8 viruses were selected for sequencing and only HA and NA were sequenced. This limited our ability to conduct accurate spatial and temporal analyses of the data. Detailed sequence analysis of the internal gene segments of the tested H5 viruses may add significant data regarding whether these viruses are similar to previously circulating AIVs in the sub-continent or whether these viruses are further evolving by reassortment with other subtypes. However, sequencing of internal gene segments of the tested influenza viruses in the present study was not possible due to lack of resources.The findings of the present study could also be extended to include biosecurity practices such as disposal of dead bird, handling of sick bird, and other factors influencing AIV transmissibility and prevalence.In conclusion, the findings of the present study highlight that multiple subtypes of AIVs (H5, H3, and H9) are circulating in both LBM and farms in Bangladesh. We identified the season, host type, and health status of birds as risk factors influencing AIV prevalence in the selected study areas. Farmers and workers in poultry farms are highly encouraged to get trained regularly to prevent possible AIV zoonotic transmission. The present study shows that avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry populations in LBMs in Bangladesh, emphasizing the need for more extensive genomic surveillance studies to determine the avian influenza gene pool, monitor the possibility of emergence of new viruses of zoonotic potential, and to track their transmission. Routine and programed surveillance will help the early detection and rapid responses to prevent possible AI outbreaks. Many developing countries have similar poultry rearing practices in LBMs and farms as in Bangladesh. As a result, such recommendations based on our data and findings have global significance and implications.Materials and methodsSample collectionWe conducted a cross-sectional study at the LBM and farm interfaces. In the instance of LBM, only LBMs in Dhaka, the capital and largest city in Bangladesh, were sampled due to the large numbers and concentration of LBMs and the presence of an AIV gene pool. On the other hand, for farms, the majority of live birds in Dhaka originate from the country's northeast part. In light of this fact, we collected duck and turkey samples from farms in seven major districts in the northeastern part of the country. Cloacal and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) pigeons (Columba livia domestica) and turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) birds between September 2018 and November 2019 from seven districts, as shown in Fig. 1, using sterile swabs which were placed in a 1.8 mL sterile cryo-vial containing 1 mL of viral transport media (VTM) as previously described49.RNA extraction and AIV rRT-PCRPooled cloacal and oropharyngeal samples (n = 500) were shipped to the Division of Virology, Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (Memphis, TN, USA) for virus isolation and characterization. We extracted the viral RNA using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA), and cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA). We tested all swab samples using real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) using universal M gene and H5, H3, H7 and H9 HA-specific primers, as previously described51,52. We considered a positive result for any gene tested if the Ct (cycle threshold) was less than 35 and with a characteristic amplification curve.Virus isolationInfluenza A virus M-gene positive samples were cultured for virus isolation by inoculation in embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) as previously described32. A volume of 100 μl from each swab sample was injected into the allantoic fluid (AF) of three 10-day-old ECEs per sample and incubated at 35°C. After 72 hr, the AF was collected and tested for hemagglutination using 0.5% turkey erythrocytes. All the first passage in ECE (E1) AF samples were tested using the Flu Detect® (Zoetis Inc.) and RNA was extracted from AF samples and was retested for AIV by M gene rRT-PCR. The AIV-positive RNA were submitted for sequencing.DNA sequencingInfluenza A virus positive samples were submitted to Hartwell Sequencing Center facility, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, for sequencing using Illumina Techniques (Illumina, CA, USA). M-gene positive, H5/H9 negative samples were subtyped using molecular methods using DNA sequencing. A multisegment RT-PCR- was performed using gene-specific primers according to the previously published protocol to amplify the whole influenza viral genome53. PCR products were then gel-extracted and purified using GE Healthcare illustra™ GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA). Library preparation of samples was performed using Illumina's Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Amplicons were sequenced on the Illumina's MiSeq platform using the paired-end approach. Sequencing reads were demultiplexed, quality-trimmed and filtered prior to consensus sequence generation using the Pallas pipeline, developed by the Hartwell Genomics Centre at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Final analysis and the generation of consensus sequences were completed using CLC Genomics Workbench (v.11.0.1).Phylogenetic analysis and molecular characteristicsMultiple sequence alignment with the MUSCLE algorithm and phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses were conducted using IQ-Tree54 and MEGA1155. Briefly, phylogenetic trees of full-length HA and NA gene segments of six H5N1 viruses and 12 H3N8 viruses were generated using the maximum likelihood method with Tamura–Nei model and 1000 bootstraps replicate. All HA and NA sequences of gene segments of AIVs subtype H5N1 from Bangladesh available in the https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ and in the EpiFlu database of the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data https://gisaid.org/ were retrieved and used as references, together with the first 50 blast hits for each gene segment and subtype, and for H3 and N8 trees together with reference sequences from the known genotypes as previously described56. In addition to H5N1 viruses from Bangladesh, the phylogenetic analyses also included H5N1 viruses from other countries with the closest genetic similarity, as indicated by the BLAST search. The phylogenetic analyses comprised the 12 H3N8 viruses from Bangladesh and other countries which were most closely related to H3 viruses for HA and N8 viruses for NA, according to the BLAST search. The HA and NA gene trees included sequences of representative Eurasian and North American H3 subtype viruses from thehttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ and https://gisaid.org/ databases.Statistical analysisData entry and cleaningWe recorded both field and laboratory data in Microsoft Excel 2016. The data set was cleaned, coded, recorded, and checked for integrity in Microsoft Excel before exporting to R (Version 4.1.1, RStudio) for data analysis.Exploratory analysisWe performed descriptive analysis to calculate M gene, H3, H5, and H9 prevalence based on rRT-PCR and sequencing results. The prevalence of M gene, H3, H5, and H9 were also calculated by each host taxa. To visualize the prevalence, graphs with error bars and confidence intervals were used. We used the software R version 4.1.2 and R studio program (Version 4.1106, Integrated Development for R. RStudio, PBC, MA, USA) and GraphPad Prism (Version 8.0.2) (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA, USA). We prepared the choropleth maps depicting the prevalence of IAV H5, H9, and H3 subtypes by districts using R (Version 4.1.1, RStudio).Bivariate analysis and statistical modelingBivariate analysis was conducted for different factors related to IAV M-gene and H5 in the study area. Seasons were classified into temporal patterns (winter and summer). Host taxa were categorized into pigeon, turkey, chicken, and waterfowl. Health status was classified based on healthy and dead birds. The interface was divided into LBM and Farm. “Chi-Square Test” was performed using R to identify the association of factors with the prevalence of the IAV M-gene and H5. Variables that had a p-value < 0.05 were considered for further statistical modeling. For statistical modeling, we utilized significant variables in the bivariate analysis. As our outcome variables on IAV M-gene, and IAV subtype H5 were binary, we considered multivariable logistic regression for each outcome.Ethical approvalAll procedures and methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations and were reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. All procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Chattogram Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Bangladesh, under reference number CVASU/Dir (R&E) EC/2019/126/(1).

Johanna Geron | ReutersPatients are now enrolling in an early stage clinical trial to test a universal flu vaccine based on messenger RNA technology, the National Institutes of Health announced Monday. Scientists hope the vaccine will protect against a wide variety of flu strains and provide long-term immunity so people do not have to receive a shot every year. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is the technology behind Moderna's and Pfizer's widely used Covid vaccines. NIH played a crucial role in developing the mRNA platform used by Moderna. "A universal flu vaccine could serve as an important line of defense against the spread of a future flu pandemic," Dr. Hugh Auchincloss, acting director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a statement Monday.The universal flu vaccine trial will enroll up to 50 healthy people ages 18 through 49 to test whether the experimental shot is safe and produces an immune response, according to NIH. The study will also include participants who receive a quadrivalent flu vaccine, which protects against four strains of the virus, to compare the experimental universal shot to those currently on the market. The universal shot was developed by researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The clinical trial is enrolling volunteers at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.The current generation of flu vaccines provide important protection against hospitalization but the effectiveness of the shots can vary widely from year to year. Scientists right now have to predict months in advance which flu strains will dominate so vaccine manufacturers have time to produce the shots ahead of the respiratory virus season. The dominant flu strains can change between the time when experts select the strains and the manufacturers roll the shots out. In some seasons, the shots are not matched well to the circulating strains and are less effective as a consequence. Flu vaccines reduce the risk of illness by 40% to 60% when they are well matched against the circulating strains, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But in some years the the vaccines' effectiveness has been as low as 19% because the shot was not well matched.Flu killed between 12,000 and 52,000 people annually in the U.S. from 2010 to 2020 depending the circulating strains and how well matched the shots were, according to the CDC.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Study: Novel Avian Influenza Virus (H5N1) Clade 2.3.4.4b Reassortants in Migratory Birds, China. Image Credit: KaterynaKon/Shutterstock.com Background Highly pathogenic AIVs (HPAIVs) such as H5N1 were discovered in 1996, and ever since, H5-type HPAIV species have developed into antigenically divergent genetic clades, resulting in persistent outbreaks among birds. Long-distance and rapid transmission of H5-type HPAIVs indicates that migratory birds are crucial to HPAIV transmission across the globe. Thus far, at least four waves of H5 virus transmission have occurred: 2.2 clade H5N1 viruses between 2005 and 2006, H5N1 2.3.2.1c clade H5N1 viruses between 2009 and 2010, 2.3.4.4a clade H5N8 clade and 2.3.2.1c clade H5N1 viruses between 2014 and 2015, and 2.3.4.4b clade H5Ny viruses between 2016 and 2017. The most recent outbreak of 2.3.4.4b clade H5N1/H5N8 HPAIV epidemics among wild and domesticated birds in Africa and Eurasia commenced in 2020-2021. H5N1, H5N6, and H5N8 infections have been infrequently reported among humans, emphasizing the potential for zoonotic transmission of H5 highly pathogenic AIVs. H5 HPAIVs were responsible for a minimum of nine outbreaks among wild avian species on the Chinese mainland since 2021. Major H5N1 HPAIV outbreaks in domesticated poultry occurred in the United States (US) and Europe between 2021 and 2022. About the study In the present study, researchers reported on H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b reassortment among the migrating avian population of China. Oral swabs and pulmonary samples were obtained from a dead whooper in Inner Mongolia, North China, and a dead black-colored swan in Zhejiang, East China, on 3 November and 15 November 2021, respectively.

Sanger sequencing was performed, and the whole genomes were deposited in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) and NMDC databases. The team reconstructed Bayesian time-resolved phylogenetic origin trees for all three H5N1 viral isolate genes based on the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and GISAID references. Further, geographic analysis was performed to map the spatial coordinates. In addition, the team mapped the host types and neuraminidase (NA) or hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes to ascertain the most probable avian virus ancestor. Furthermore, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays were performed to assess Re-11 [H5N6 (A/duck/Guizhou/S4184/2017)], Re-13 [H5N6 (A/duck/Fujian/S1424/2020)], and the Re-14 [H5N8 (A/whooper swan/Shanxi/4–1/2020)] vaccine immunogenicity against the H5N1 viruses and H5N8 HPAIVs, which were detected in the year 2020. Results In November 2021, three H5N1 HPAIVs were detected, i.e., the Ws/NC/AK1-O/2021 virus and the Ws/NC/AK2-O/2021 virus among samples from the dead whooper of North China, and the Bs/EC/74-Lg/2021 virus from those of the deceased black swan of East China. The H5N1 strains induced severe histopathologic alterations among wild avian species, characteristic of HPAIVs, including numerous basic-type amino acid molecules at the site of HA breakdown. All three H5N1 HA genes shared the 2.3.4.4b.2 clade. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the three new H5N1 viral strains were reassortants from Ws/2021 (Ws/NC/AK1-O/2021 and Ws/NC/AK2-O/2021) and Bs/2021 (Bs/EC/74-Lg/2021). Several regrouping activities among H5N8 HPAIVs produced the viruses. The ancestors of most genes in the two reassortants originated from wild Anseriformes and were most likely transmitted during summer 2021, except for genes such as the Bs/2021-like M gene, which might have evolved from domesticated poultry. Nearly all neuraminidase genes of the H5N1 viruses discovered on China's mainland between 1996 and 2018 were of the EA-1 clade. The first cluster included four H5N8 HPAIVs discovered among wild avian species in 2020, the Re-14 strain, eight H5N6 viruses, and one H5N8 virus that caused human infections. Bs/EC/74-Lg/2021 clustered with H5N1 influenza viruses originating from South Korea and Japan in the second cluster, with 99.0% to 100.0% identical sequences. In the third cluster, the North China whooper swan-derived viruses showed 99.0% antigenic similarity and grouped with European-origin H5N1 viral strains. Most H5N1 viruses discovered between 2020 and 2021 were grouped in the third cluster. Furthermore, two H5N1 (third cluster) virus infections were documented among United Kingdom (UK) and US residents between 2021 and 2022. The HA analysis showed antibody titers 256 between homolog antisera and H5 vaccine antigens and much lower titers (2.0 to 16) for Re-11 and Re-13 by contemporary H5N1/H5N8 viruses. In comparison, H5N8 viruses from the first cluster showed modest antibody titers (64.0) for the Re-14 antiserum. Ws/NC/AK1-O/2021 and Bs/EC/74-Lg/2021 H5N1 viruses from the second and third clusters, respectively, exhibited titers of 32 and 128, respectively. Conclusion Overall, the study findings highlighted the detection of three H5N1 HPAIVs among wild avian species during the fall of 2021 in China that underwent reassortment during long-distance transmission via avian migratory routes. The low antigenic similarity among H5N1 and H5N8 viruses, despite originating from the same genetic clade, underscores elevated risks of H5N1 infections among inadequately protected flocks in the Chinese mainland. The findings also highlighted the need for globally coordinated AIV monitoring among migratory birds to facilitate early detection and prompt treatment of AIV infections.

Prasad Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT Photo used for representation purpose only. Indian researchers have, for the first time, been able to synthesise small molecules that can effectively halt the infection of cells by SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses by targeting the hosts. The approach adopted by the researchers is vastly different from the one that is usually used for making antivirals. In place of antivirals that directly target the virus in question, the team, co-led by researchers at IISER Mohali and IIT Ropar, attempted the host-directed therapy. Till date, no approved host-directed drugs are available for either SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus. In both cultured cells and animal studies, the small molecules that were synthesised by Dr. Prabal Banerjee’s team at the Department of Chemistry, IIT Ropar showed over 95% efficacy in halting the infection of cells by SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. The results were published in PLOS Pathogens.While antivirals that target the virus become ineffective once the virus develops resistance, drugs that target the host cells to prevent the virus from infecting them, are expected to remain effective even when the virus evolves by accumulating mutations. EvidenceThere is already evidence that the current FDA-approved drugs for treating SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection are losing their efficacy due to the emergence of drug-resistant virus strains. In host-directed therapy, the challenge is that molecules can very often turn out to be toxic to the host cells, the reason why this approach has not been widely adopted. The small molecules were not only effective (over 95%) against both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses, they were not toxic to either cultured cells or mice even after prolonged exposure.“We initially tested 28 compounds for their effectiveness in blocking influenza virus from infecting the lung cells. Of the 28 molecules screened, one molecule — 1,3-diphenylurea derivative (DPUD) — was able to block both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection by almost 100% in cells without being toxic to the cells,” recalls Dr. Prabal Banerjee, who is one of the corresponding authors. “This prompted us to synthesise 22 additional DPUDs. Five of the total 23 DPUDs were found to be highly effective against both viruses, while one molecule tested against influenza virus and two tested against SARS-CoV-2 in mice were found to be highly effective without causing toxicity to the animals.” “The discovery of host-directed DPUD molecules was serendipity,” says Nirmal Kumar, a PhD student from IISER Mohali and first author of the paper. “When we began this work in early 2020, we were looking for potent anti-influenza agents through high-throughput screening of small molecules. We identified DPUDs that efficiently blocked influenza infection. After several experiments, we realised that the small molecules (DPUDs) were host-directed and found that they block the cell entry pathway of influenza virus.” During COVID-19 pandemic, scientists indicated that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same pathway as influenza virus to enter the host cells. “We hypothesised that DPUDs should also be able to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection since they block the common viral entry pathway. We immediately tested the DPUDs against SARS-CoV-2 and found them to almost completely block infection. Of the 23 DPUDs that we developed and tested, five showed extremely potent antiviral effect and we found them to be host-directed,” says Mr. Kumar. Better recovery“Compared with Molnupiravir, two DPUD molecules that we tested on animals against SARS-CoV-2 showed better efficacy. Mice challenged with the virus followed by treatment with DPUDs showed better body weight recovery and improvement of lung pathology,” says Indranil Banerjee from the Department of Biological Sciences at IISER Mohali, and one of the corresponding authors of the paper. In the case of influenza virus, one DPUD was tested on mice. “We mimicked influenza virus evolution in the presence of Tamiflu and DPUD. The virus developed resistance to Tamiflu after prolonged exposure (10 generations) but not to the DPUD tested,” says Dr. Indranil. “The virus remained sensitive to the DPUD despite prolonged exposure and this is the reason why the small molecule was able to inhibit infection.” Explaining how the small molecules were able to block virus entry into cells, Dr. Indranil says the chloride concentration inside and outside a cell varies. Maintaining equilibrium of chloride concentration inside the cell is critical for endocytosis — cellular process in which substances are brought into the cell. “These molecules carry chloride ions into the cell, thereby leading to a large accumulation of chloride inside the cell, disturbing the chloride equilibrium. When the chloride equilibrium is disturbed, some endocytic pathways that these viruses depend on to enter cells become non-functional. As a result, the viruses fail to enter the cells and establish infection,” explains Dr. Indranil Banerjee. However, the precise mechanism by which virus entry into the cell is blocked by DPUDs is not clear. The mechanism of nutrient entry into cells even when the virus entry pathways are blocked needs to be further studied.“Probably the small molecules target the pathways the viruses use to enter cells while keeping the other pathways open, so the cell health remains unaffected,” Dr. Indranil says. The small molecules were found to be highly effective when tested against H1N1 and H3N2 influenza virus sub-types and the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan, Delta, and two Omicron variants of concern.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel,File) Read More Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print LOS ANGELES (AP) — California condors will receive a vaccine for a deadly strain of avian influenza that threatens to wipe out the already critically endangered vulture species, federal officials said Tuesday. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service granted emergency approval for use of the vaccine after more than a dozen condors recently died from the bird flu, known as H5N1. There are fewer than 350 California condors in the wild, in flocks that span from the Pacific Northwest to Baja California, Mexico. A pilot safety study will begin this month in North American vultures, a similar species, allowing investigators to check for any adverse effects before they give vaccines to the endangered condors, according to an agriculture department statement.The department approved the emergency vaccination “because these birds are critically endangered, closely monitored, and their population is very small which allows close monitoring of the vaccine,” the statement said. Over the past year and a half, millions of birds across the U.S. have died from avian flu, including more than 430 bald eagles and some 58 million turkeys and commercial chickens that were euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease. California’s population of iconic condors, with their 10-foot (3-meter) wingspans, was nearly wiped out by hunting during the California Gold Rush, as well as by poisoning from toxic pesticide DDT and ingesting lead ammunition.In the 1980s, all 22 California condors left in the wild were put into captive breeding programs to save the species. Zoo-bred birds were first released into the wild in 1992 and in the years since have been reintroduced into wild habitats.

They were long and didn't make sense on his head. We all just really loved him. He was goofy and I think he brought joy to all of our lives," Minneapolis resident Lucy Lloyd said.For nine years, her dog Rooney captured the hearts of everyone he met. Lloyd and her husband are still coming to terms with his unforeseen death."I think that he was a surprise to all of us, as far as how fast it went poorly," Lloyd said. They took their two dogs Rooney and Sawyer to day care on a Thursday. By Saturday, she says they had developed coughs and Rooney progressively got worse. "The breathing was the alert that is was time to do something, it was time to intervene," she said.The vet on Tuesday discovered he had pneumonia. He passed away the next day. Test results confirmed canine influenza a few days later.The highest concentration of cases in Minneapolis are in Uptown and North Loop. Dog parks remain open, though many have signs warning pet owners about the risk of contracting canine influenza."Those high-risk situations again would be dog parks, boarding, dog day care, training facilities, anywhere we are going to have large numbers of dogs coming in contact with each other," Minnesota Board of Animal Health Senior Veterinarian Veronica Bartsch said. Sawyer is recovering at home as he finishes a month-long isolation."It's really hard to watch him navigate his new life without his friend," Lloyd said.She hopes dog owners take the virus seriously and follow precautions."Get your dog vaccinated if you can find the vaccine, we wish we would have. We also know that that's not maybe wanted or possible for everyone, so that's not the easiest answer. I think the easiest answer is figure out how to keep your dogs away from other dogs. I wouldn't have known until now to take those things seriously, because you can't know until you know," she said.Most dogs have mild to moderate symptoms and recover within two to three weeks. Contact your vet if your pet develops symptoms like cough, fever, runny eyes or nose, shortness of breath or fatigue.More information about canine influenza can be found by clicking here.

From: UK Health Security Agency Published 16 May 2023 The 2 people returning positive tests are known to have recently worked on an infected poultry farm in England. Neither has experienced any symptoms of avian influenza and both have since tested negative. Detection of avian influenza in poultry workers can follow contamination of the nose and throat from breathing in material on the affected farm or can be true infection. It can be difficult to distinguish these in people who have no symptoms. Based on the timing of exposures and test results, one individual is likely to have had contamination of the nose and/or throat from material inhaled on the farm, while for the second individual it is more difficult to determine which is the case. Further investigation is under way but meanwhile precautionary contact tracing has been undertaken for this second individual. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has not detected evidence of human-to-human transmission and these detections do not change the level of risk to human health, which remains very low to the general population. Professor Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at UKHSA, said: Current evidence suggests that the avian influenza viruses we’re seeing circulating in birds around the world do not spread easily to people. However, we know already that the virus can spread to people following close contact with infected birds and this is why, through screening programmes like this one, we are monitoring people who have been exposed to learn more about this risk. Globally there is no evidence of spread of this strain from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk to the population. It remains critical that people avoid touching sick or dead birds, and that they follow the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) advice about reporting. UKHSA has contact traced close contacts where needed. For those with the highest risk exposures, UKHSA health protection teams contact them daily to monitor for the development of any symptoms so that we can take appropriate action if necessary. In the asymptomatic surveillance programme, poultry workers are asked to take swabs of their nose and throat which are tested for the presence of influenza virus, during the 10 days after their exposure. In some cases they may also be asked to have finger prick blood tests to see if UKHSA can detect antibodies against avian influenza, suggestive of an immune response in the blood. As part of public health response, UKHSA follows up all individuals who have been in contact with a confirmed human case of avian influenza. For those with the highest risk exposures, we may offer testing and antivirals, to help protect them from infection as well as to reduce the risk of passing infection to others. Guidance from Defra on the signs of bird flu and how to report it in poultry and other birds is available on GOV.UK, while further guidance on avoiding the risk of infection when working with infected poultry is published by the Health Safety Executive.

Back to Healio All immunocompromised adults should receive the high-dose formulation of the influenza vaccine, according to a presenter at the Biologic Therapies Summit. Discussing recent vaccination guideline updates from the American College of Rheumatology, Kevin L. Winthrop, MD, MPH, of the Oregon Health & Science University, stated that the new recommendations should be examined and applied while considering their nuances. “We kind of tricked ourselves, getting into an annual flu vaccine strategy, but it is probably ultimately not the best strategy,” Kevin L. Winthrop, MD, MPH. Image: Adobe Stock Kevin Winthrop “There are several important updates, but I want to give some data behind some of the updates and get you thinking about what is next,” Winthrop, told attendees at the hybrid meeting. “Some of this is very practical and some of it is theoretical.” The first set of guidelines Winthrop discussed included influenza vaccines, specifically that immunocompromised adults should receive high-dose versions of the influenza vaccine. “From now on, if you are immunocompromised and an adult, you should get a high-dose vaccine,” Winthrop said. “It is not just for people older than 65.” However, Winthrop does not recommend that all patients undergo vaccination on an annual basis in all cases. “We kind of tricked ourselves, getting into an annual flu vaccine strategy, but it is probably ultimately not the best strategy,” Winthrop said. “You do gain a little protection every year, about 20%, but if you skip a year and you just stay home, you will do better the following year.” Winthrop also discussed the feasibility of withholding methotrexate following vaccinations. “The bottom line is that 1 week is good enough,” Winthrop said. “And when you look at antibody titers, they are about the same in the 1-week hold group and the 2-week hold groups.” Additionally, the flare rate is lower among patients who withheld methotrexate for a single week, Winthrop said. “I suspect that holding methotrexate probably helps all vaccine responses, but suffice to say, there is no data yet,” he added. According to Winthrop, all immunocompromised patients should receive a pneumococcal vaccination. In addition, a new vaccine, Prevnar 20 (PCV 20, Pfizer), includes protection for 20 serotypes of pneumococcal infection. “The new recommendations are, basically, to just use PCV20,” Winthrop said. “The alternate strategy is to use PCV15.” According to Winthrop, PCV20 and PCV15 cover more strains than PCV13. In addition, if patients receive PCV15, they should typically also receive the Pneumovax (pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent, Merck) vaccination, Winthrop said. There are currently trials evaluating PCV20 in combination with Pneumovax, he added, noting that such a combination may be recommended in the future. Finally, he discussed Shingrix (recombinant zoster vaccine, GlaxoSmithKline) for vaccination against zoster in patients who are immunocompromised. “Shingle prevention remains a high unmet need,” Winthrop said. “Should we be holding the JAK inhibitors? Should we hold methotrexate? There are a lot of questions around DMARDs and how we can maximize vaccine responses.” To address this unmet need, it will be necessary to conduct more trials and gather more data, Winthrop said.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger After having low rates of influenza (flu) transmission in recent years thanks to our COVID control strategies, case numbers are now rising. So far this year, Australia has had more than 32,000 lab-confirmed cases of the flu and 32 deaths. Getting a flu vaccine is the best way to protect against getting the flu. These are reformulated each year to protect against the most widely circulating strains – if our predictions are right. Below you’ll find everything you need to know about the 2023 flu vaccine. But first, some flu basics. Read more: Are flu cases already 100 times higher than last year? Here's what we really know about the 2023 flu season What are the different types of flu? There are two main types of influenza: influenza A and influenza B. On the surface of the influenza virus there are two main proteins, the hemagglutinin (HA or H) and neuraminidase (NA or N). Different strains are named after their versions of the H and N proteins, as in H1N1 or “swine flu”. HA is the yellow spike, while the NA is the green oval. Shutterstock Minor changes in the proteins (HA and NA) on the surface are common because the enzyme the virus uses to make copies of itself is prone to errors. Sometimes the influenza virus can change more abruptly when it mixes up components from different influenza viruses – including influenza viruses that typically infect birds, pigs or bats – to create a virus that’s basically new. The regular change in the virus is the reason the vaccine is updated every year. The Australian Influenza Vaccine Committee meets late in the year to plan what should be included in the vaccine for the following season, after considering what happened in our last flu season and in the Northern hemisphere winter. Read more: Flu or COVID? You can now test for both at home with a single swab. Here's what you need to know What strains does this year’s flu shot protect against? Modern flu vaccines typically protect against four strains. For this year’s vaccine, the committee has recommended it includes: an A/Sydney/5/2021 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus an A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus a B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus. The naming of the viral components can sometimes be confusing. The name is derived from the virus type (A or B)he place it was first isolated/strain number/year isolated (virus subtype). This year’s vaccine therefore includes an influenza A virus similar to the 2009 pandemic-causing H1N1 isolated from Sydney in 2021 and a second influenza A virus (H3N2) isolated in Darwin in 2021. Influenza B viruses are classified into 2 lineages: Victoria and Yamagata. This year’s vaccine includes an influenza B isolated from Austria in 2021 (Victoria lineage) and an influenza B isolated in Phuket in 2013 (Yamagata lineage). This year’s flu vaccine protects against a strain isolated in Darwin. Shutterstock Who should get a flu shot? Health authorities recommend everyone aged six months of age or over should get the flu vaccine every year. Some groups are at greater risk of significant disease from the flu and can access the flu vaccine for free. This includes: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged six months and over children aged six months to five years pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy people aged 65 years or over people aged five years to 65 years who have certain underlying health conditions affecting the heart, lungs, kidneys or immune system, and those with diabetes. Read more: Should I get the flu shot if I'm pregnant? How can I get it? You can get a flu shot from your local general practice or pharmacy. Or you may have an opportunity to get vaccinated at your workplace if your employer supplies it. While the vaccine is free for those in the above groups, there can be a consultation or administration fee, depending on where you get your vaccine. If you aren’t eligible for a free vaccine, it usually costs around A$20-$30. Some people can get the shot for free, while others pay $20 to $30. Shutterstock Are there different options? For over 65s, whose immune systems may not work as well as when they were younger, a specific vaccine is available that includes an adjuvant which boosts the immune response. This is free for over-65s under the national immunisation program. A high-dose vaccine is also available for people aged 60 and over. However this isn’t currently funded and costs around $70 on a private prescription. People with egg allergies can safely get the egg-based flu vaccine. However there is also a cell-based immunisation for people who don’t want a vaccine made in eggs. When vaccines are grown in eggs, sometimes the virus can change and this might affect the level of protection. Cell-based vaccines aim to address this issue. The cell-based vaccine isn’t funded so patients will pay around $40 for a private prescription. How well do they work? The vaccine’s effectiveness depends on how well the strains in the vaccine match those circulating. It generally reduces the chance of being admitted to hospital with influenza by 30-60%. Read more: Why can you still get influenza if you've had a flu shot? What are the side effects? You can’t get the flu from the vaccine as there’s no live virus in it. When people get a flu-like illness after the vaccine, it can be due to mild effects we sometimes see after vaccination, such as headaches, tiredness or some aches and pains. These usually go away within a day or two. Alternatively, symptoms after getting a flu shot may be due to another respiratory virus such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that circulates in winter. When’s the best time to get your flu shot? The vaccine provides peak protection around three to four months after you get it. The peak of the flu season is usually between June and September, however this changes every year and can vary in different parts of the country. Given this, the best time to get the vaccine is usually around late April or early May. So if you haven’t already, now would be a good time to get it.

Video Ad Feedback Dr. Sanjay Gupta breaks down how mRNA vaccines work 04:00 - Source: CNN CNN — The National Institutes of Health is now enrolling participants to test an experimental universal influenza vaccine using mRNA technology. The NIH is looking for 50 volunteers ages 18 to 49 for the Phase 1 trial at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. In 2009, the H1N1 influenza virus swept across the globe causing a global pandemic and infecting more than 18,000 people. NIAID Researchers make important progress toward a possible universal flu vaccine “A universal influenza vaccine would be a major public health achievement and could eliminate the need for both annual development of seasonal influenza vaccines, as well as the need for patients to get a flu shot each year,” said Acting NIAID Director Dr. Hugh Auchincloss in a news release. “Moreover, some strains of influenza virus have significant pandemic potential. A universal flu vaccine could serve as an important line of defense against the spread of a future flu pandemic.” This early-stage trial will evaluate the best dosage for the experimental vaccine while comparing its immunogenicity and safety to current seasonal flu vaccines. Participants in the trial will be followed for up to one year after vaccination to primarily track its safety, but efficacy as well.

There are several universal flu vaccines in various stages of development and testing. The shots use the same mRNA technology that’s in the Covid-19 Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, but scientists first started on these experiments in 2017, years before the first Covid-19 shots were given.

After first being detected in a deceased condor in late March, the illness has swept through the small flock of wild birds, which are closely monitored by agencies in the south-west. So far 21 condors have died, impacting eight breeding pairs, according to a statement issued by the US Fish and Wildlife service.Top-flight recovery: the inspiring comeback of the California condorRead moreThe Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or HPAI, is a virus that has been described as “highly contagious” by the agency. An April statement confirming deaths of the first infected condors in early April said the virus can spread quickly though “bird-to-bird contact, environmental contamination with fecal material, and via exposed clothing, shoes and vehicles”.Several condors remain in the care of experts, including a newly hatched chick whose egg was pulled from its contaminated nest before its mother succumbed to the disease. Officials and rescue workers remain hopeful that the orphaned baby, now being nurtured with the help of a plush condor at the Liberty Wildlife facility in Phoenix, Arizona, can soon be returned to the wild. For now the chick is nestled among blankets and its stuffed surrogate, awaiting placement with foster parents at the Peregrine Fund’s captive breeding facility.Allow Facebook content?This article includes content provided by Facebook.

Recovery has been slow. Condors don’t mate until they reach maturity at around eight years old, and females only produce a single egg every two years.This dangerous strain of avian flu has rapidly spread across the US, killing millions of domestic and wild birds since it arrived in North America at the end of 2021. Though the virus is not considered a high risk to humans, it’s been among the most devastating outbreaks for birds in the country’s history. Roughly 58 million commercial poultry have had to be euthanized in attempts to slow the spread of the disease, which has also claimed the lives of hundreds of bald eagles and been detected in more than 6,700 wild birds, a figure widely considered to be underestimated.While the emergency-use approval by the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is limited to California condors, the agency is continuing work to develop options for other types of birds. Before administering it to condors, a pilot study has been initiated to test the vaccine on North American vultures – “a similar species” – to ensure there are no adverse effects.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Infections among the Arizona flock where the virus was found are holding steady.“Our field teams have not detected any additional compromised California condors in northern Arizona since April 11,” the Peregrin Fund posted in an update this week, adding that four birds under its care are showing signs of recovery. “The Peregrine Fund’s captive breeding program is also in full swing, and new life is hatching,” it added. “Of 18 eggs laid, nine young have hatched and a new season for the recovery effort begins.”The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsCaliforniaBirdsBird fluAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyParrots missing from London zoo found behind Cambridgeshire garden28 Oct 2024Safe sex for seagulls?

Clinical trial begins for universal flu vaccine candidate By Elissa Wolfson, The Science Advisory Board assistant editor May 16, 2023 -- Researchers at NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAIDs) have developed an experimental universal influenza vaccine. They are enrolling volunteers for a phase I clinical trial to test the vaccine, called H1ssF-3928 mRNA-LNP, for its safety and efficacy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that between 12,000 and 52,000 U.S. citizens die of seasonal influenza, or flu, each year. Although annual seasonal flu vaccines help control the spread and severity of influenza, they do not provide immunity against every flu strain. Each year, scientific experts must predict which influenza strains are likely to be most common in the upcoming flu season, and then select three or four to include in the next seasonal flu vaccine. During the time needed to produce this vaccine, dominant virus strains can morph unexpectedly, potentially decreasing the vaccine's efficacy. The researchers sought to develop a universal flu vaccine that could eliminate these problems by protecting against a wide variety of strains and providing durable long-term immunity, thus eliminating the need for annual vaccines. The vaccine uses a specific portion of a flu protein, hemagglutinin, to induce a broad immune response against influenza. While the head portion of the hemagglutinin protein tends to change as the flu virus spreads and evolves, a more stable portion, known as the stem, evolves very slowly and is very similar across many different types of the flu virus. By using the hemagglutinin stem as the basis for this vaccine, researchers hope to induce long-term immunity against a broad range of flu viruses. Unlike earlier vaccines, the H1ssF-3928 mRNA-LNP vaccine candidate uses a messenger RNA (mRNA) platform. The researchers hypothesize that developing a variety of different platforms for a universal flu vaccine may increase their chances of finding one that provides safe, strong, broad immunity against a variety of strains. The trial, occurring at Duke University, is enrolling up to 50 healthy volunteers, aged 18 through 49. Three groups of 10 participants each will be vaccinated with 10, 25, and 50 micrograms of the experimental vaccine, respectively. After evaluation to determine an optimum dosage, an additional 10 participants will receive the optimum dosage. An additional participant group will receive a current seasonal influenza vaccine, allowing the researchers to directly compare the candidate vaccine with an available flu vaccine in terms of their safety and immunogenicity -- i.e., their ability to provoke an immune response in the body. Participants will be evaluated regularly to assess the new vaccine and will receive follow-up appointments for up to one year. "A universal influenza vaccine would be a major public health achievement and could eliminate the need for both annual development of seasonal influenza vaccines, as well as the need for patients to get a flu shot each year," NIAID's acting director Dr. Hugh Auchincloss said in a statement. "A universal flu vaccine could also serve as an important line of defense against the spread of a future flu pandemic."If you like this content, please share it with a colleague!

FarmsDC BureauGovernment & Politics The U.S. is undergoing its worst bird flu outbreak ever. Is a poultry vaccine the answer? While bird flu likely poses little health danger to humans, it’s contributed to spikes in U.S. egg prices and decimated poultry flocks By: Adam Goldstein - May 14, 2023 6:30 am (Photo by Stephen Ausmus/Agricultural Research Service, USDA) WASHINGTON — The deadliest outbreak of bird flu in U.S. history is prompting growing concern in Congress, and Department of Agriculture researchers are awaiting the preliminary results of four trials of vaccines for poultry. Some lawmakers are warming to the idea of a vaccination campaign, long considered a fringe idea due to the cost and potential consequences. Trade groups warn that vaccinated poultry would not be accepted in many overseas markets, disrupting exports. While bird flu likely poses little health danger to humans, it’s contributed to spikes in U.S. egg prices and decimated poultry flocks. Among the domestic poultry affected are chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks and geese — in both big commercial operations and increasingly popular backyard flocks. Since the current strain of highly-pathogenic avian influenza — H5N1 — began circulating in the country in February 2022, farmers across the country have lost or had to cull more than 58 million poultry birds. The USDA estimates it has already spent more than $670 million in insurance indemnities and sanitation services to combat the ongoing bird flu outbreak. And with many wild birds starting their spring migration, roughly 140,000 poultry birds were infected with the virus nationwide in April. While food costs are stabilizing, members of Congress from both parties are asking how the U.S. can do better at controlling bird flu. “We’ve all seen first-hand how high pathogenic avian flu has devastated domestic poultry populations, where depopulations have had to take place,” said Rep. Jim Costa, a California Democrat, at an April 18 House Agriculture Committee hearing. “We’ve got to continue to refine and improve our approach to address animal disease, and USDA needs all the tools to guarantee a robust response.” Deadly bird flu sweeps states, including Pa., straining farmers | Analysis The USDA is testing two proprietary vaccines developed through its Agricultural Research Service, as well as bird flu vaccines from pharmaceutical companies Merck Animal Health and Zoetis, Inc. But animal health experts note that a bird flu vaccine is not the immediate solution that some believe it to be. Jenny Lester Moffitt, undersecretary for marketing and regulatory programs at the USDA, said at an April 24 press event that it will take a minimum of 18 to 24 months to produce a viable vaccine, which is not guaranteed to be effective against infection. Yuko Sato, a poultry veterinarian and associate professor at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, said at an April 26 media event that “the vaccine is not a silver bullet” for an end to the outbreak. “You would have to make sure that if you vaccinate — but still have positive birds — you can stamp out the virus,” Sato said. “Otherwise, we’ll never be looking at eradicating the virus from the United States.” Here are the answers to some common questions about the ongoing bird flu outbreak and potential vaccines: What is highly-pathogenic avian influenza? Highly-pathogenic avian influenza, commonly known as HPAI, bird flu, or “high-path,” is a deadly respiratory virus that affects wild birds and poultry. The contagious disease comes from the Influenza A family, and is characterized by the H5 or H7 categories of hemagglutinin — or spike protein — structures on its surface, which it uses to infect cells. The virus is spread via airborne transmission, or exposure to the byproducts of an infected bird, like saliva, mucus or feces. Poultry and other domesticated birds with the disease will often exhibit a lack of energy, produce soft-shelled or misshapen eggs, and have swollen heads. The highly-pathogenic version of the disease was first identified in China in 1996, and has mutated several times over the last three decades through swapping genetic material with low-pathogenic avian influenza strains within wild birds. David Swayne, former director of the Agricultural Research Service’s Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Georgia, said at an April 26 media briefing that 87% of avian influenza strains are made up of blended genetic material from other strains. He said that this natural mutation process can make a vaccine less effective against the virus year over year. Acting Ag Sec. Redding faces questions about organics, dog law, avian flu at budget talks Wild migratory birds are the primary transmission vector in the current outbreak, accounting for roughly 85% of disease spread, according to the USDA. These animals, including terns, ducks, and geese, can contract and pass along the disease without obvious physical symptoms. Yet an HPAI infection spreads quickly among a flock of poultry, with infections leading to mortality at a rate of 90% to 100% in chickens and turkeys, often within 48 hours, according to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. When a farmer detects the disease in a commercial flock, the only USDA-recommended option is to kill the remaining birds, dispose of the carcasses, and decontaminate the facility to mitigate spread. Who is getting infected? Should I be worried? Despite the threat H5N1 presents to poultry, experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that people do not need to brood over getting sick. The agency reports that 11 cases of bird flu have been reported among humans since 2021, with only one “mild” case occurring in the United States. And as of 2023, there have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission of HPAI, according to the World Health Organization. Swayne said at the media event that only 875 human cases of H5 bird flu have been reported since 1996. About 40% were fatal. He noted these infections have occurred largely among humans handling domesticated poultry, and not from encounters with wild birds. The USDA has documented 176 mammals in the United States infected with the disease since 2022, including skunks, foxes, seals, and mountain lions, among other species. Wildlife experts from the U.S. Geological Survey published a study in April finding much of this disease spillover can be traced back to predation on wild birds. Still both Swayne and Hill pointed to a recent event in which 3,500 sea lions became infected with the virus in Peru as one worth monitoring for mutations that could affect mammals. How does the current outbreak compare to past bird flu outbreaks? The current iteration of the highly-pathogenic avian influenza virus was first detected domestically on January 13, 2022, in a wild bird in Colleton County, South Carolina. The first domesticated animal case of the disease was found on a turkey farm in Dubois County, Indiana on February 8, 2022. Since then, the disease has spread across 47 states, affecting more than 833 commercial and backyard poultry flocks. Still, this is not the first outbreak of HPAI that the federal government has responded to. And despite the scope of these numbers, many animal health experts say current USDA efforts represent a significant improvement over earlier outbreaks of the disease. Sato recalled that a 2015 outbreak of HPAI, previously considered the worst outbreak on record, required the culling of 50.4 million birds on Midwestern poultry operations. She added that 70% of the cause of new infections from that outbreak was farm-to-farm lateral spread from workers in 21 states, including Arkansas, Iowa, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. In contrast to that outbreak, Sato said that now “we’ve done a really good job with biosecurity.” Biosecurity refers to preventive measures producers can take to limit spread of the disease, like disinfecting farm machinery and providing clean clothing and protective equipment to farmworkers. Sato said that with producers embracing these practices, the lateral spread of avian influenza decreased from 70% of reported cases in 2015 to roughly 16% of reported cases in 2023. Moffitt added that efforts to control the virus are projected to cost the country less than 50% of its 2015 expenditures of $1.6 billion. However, animal disease experts caution that the U.S. is dealing with a more widely dispersed and distinct disease than that of the 2015 HPAI outbreak. Nichola Hill, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts, said at the April 26 media event that researchers have detected the virus in 150 of the approximately 1,000 wild bird species found in the U.S., and the disease has affected more than 6,000 wild birds. Greg Tyler, the president and CEO of USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, said that this version of the disease has also gotten into all four major migratory flyways for wild birds in the U.S. Sato said that more backyard flocks of poultry are being affected by the spread of bird flu from migratory populations — a total of 507 small to mid-sized flocks — in contrast to the 21 backyard flocks affected in 2015. There are also new concerns emerging among experts that this deadly disease could become endemic to North America without significant public-private collaboration to reduce spread, according to an April study from researchers at the University of Maryland. “Federal agencies, state agencies, the agriculture sector and wildlife management — we are all going to have to deal with this together, because we can’t afford not to,” said Jennifer Mullinax, an assistant professor in the University of Maryland Department of Environmental Science and Technology, in a release. What about a vaccine? While some animal health experts say developing a vaccine for the current bird flu strain could be a valuable tool, trade experts caution that a national vaccination strategy would not come quickly, or without tradeoffs for the nation’s $6 billion poultry export industry. Sato said that a national vaccination strategy for the roughly 10 billion commercial-purpose birds in the United States could be time-intensive, and cost billions of taxpayer dollars. Tom Super, senior vice president of communications at the National Chicken Council, said that his organization does not support the use of a vaccine for HPAI right now, as most countries do not accept exports from countries that vaccinate for the virus. These non-tariff trade barriers are designed to protect other nations’ unvaccinated poultry flocks from immunized birds that still carry the disease. Super added that if the U.S. vaccinates domestic birds, the broiler industry will be cut off from exports, costing billions of dollars to the U.S. economy every year. Tyler added that his organization found that if a vaccination campaign happens without adjustments to trade policy, there could be a potential loss of 200,000 farm jobs. Moffitt said that negotiations between the USDA and foreign partners are still ongoing to maintain international poultry export markets for certain states amid outbreaks in others in the country. Tyler said that the Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and Foreign Agricultural Service have made significant progress in developing regionalization agreements with foreign governments since 2015. He noted that the U.S. poultry industry has managed roughly $11.7 billion in exports over the last two years, despite the ongoing challenges of HPAI and bans on poultry exports by certain countries like China. Super and Tyler both advocated for continued funding for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to provide rapid-response support to farms. Moffitt urged adhering to biosecurity measures like interstate surveillance and the Defend the Flock program at the April 18 hearing. Moffitt cited that the number of infections in commercial flocks in March 2023 decreased tenfold compared to March 2022, proof the USDA’s current strategy of rapid tests and reporting is working. “We know how to respond quickly, so producers can get back to producing food, how important biosecurity is, how to keep markets open,” she said. “We know what to do, and we are ready.” XThe U.S. is undergoing its worst bird flu outbreak ever. Is a poultry vaccine the answer? by Adam Goldstein, Pennsylvania Capital-Star May 14, 2023 The U.S. is undergoing its worst bird flu outbreak ever. Is a poultry vaccine the answer? by Adam Goldstein, Pennsylvania Capital-Star May 14, 2023 WASHINGTON — The deadliest outbreak of bird flu in U.S. history is prompting growing concern in Congress, and Department of Agriculture researchers are awaiting the preliminary results of four trials of vaccines for poultry. Some lawmakers are warming to the idea of a vaccination campaign, long considered a fringe idea due to the cost and potential consequences. Trade groups warn that vaccinated poultry would not be accepted in many overseas markets, disrupting exports. While bird flu likely poses little health danger to humans, it’s contributed to spikes in U.S. egg prices and decimated poultry flocks. Among the domestic poultry affected are chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks and geese — in both big commercial operations and increasingly popular backyard flocks. Since the current strain of highly-pathogenic avian influenza — H5N1 — began circulating in the country in February 2022, farmers across the country have lost or had to cull more than 58 million poultry birds. The USDA estimates it has already spent more than $670 million in insurance indemnities and sanitation services to combat the ongoing bird flu outbreak. And with many wild birds starting their spring migration, roughly 140,000 poultry birds were infected with the virus nationwide in April. While food costs are stabilizing, members of Congress from both parties are asking how the U.S. can do better at controlling bird flu. “We’ve all seen first-hand how high pathogenic avian flu has devastated domestic poultry populations, where depopulations have had to take place,” said Rep. Jim Costa, a California Democrat, at an April 18 House Agriculture Committee hearing. “We’ve got to continue to refine and improve our approach to address animal disease, and USDA needs all the tools to guarantee a robust response.” Deadly bird flu sweeps states, including Pa., straining farmers | Analysis The USDA is testing two proprietary vaccines developed through its Agricultural Research Service, as well as bird flu vaccines from pharmaceutical companies Merck Animal Health and Zoetis, Inc. But animal health experts note that a bird flu vaccine is not the immediate solution that some believe it to be. Jenny Lester Moffitt, undersecretary for marketing and regulatory programs at the USDA, said at an April 24 press event that it will take a minimum of 18 to 24 months to produce a viable vaccine, which is not guaranteed to be effective against infection. Yuko Sato, a poultry veterinarian and associate professor at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, said at an April 26 media event that “the vaccine is not a silver bullet” for an end to the outbreak. “You would have to make sure that if you vaccinate — but still have positive birds — you can stamp out the virus,” Sato said. “Otherwise, we’ll never be looking at eradicating the virus from the United States.” Here are the answers to some common questions about the ongoing bird flu outbreak and potential vaccines: What is highly-pathogenic avian influenza? Highly-pathogenic avian influenza, commonly known as HPAI, bird flu, or “high-path,” is a deadly respiratory virus that affects wild birds and poultry. The contagious disease comes from the Influenza A family, and is characterized by the H5 or H7 categories of hemagglutinin — or spike protein — structures on its surface, which it uses to infect cells. The virus is spread via airborne transmission, or exposure to the byproducts of an infected bird, like saliva, mucus or feces. Poultry and other domesticated birds with the disease will often exhibit a lack of energy, produce soft-shelled or misshapen eggs, and have swollen heads. The highly-pathogenic version of the disease was first identified in China in 1996, and has mutated several times over the last three decades through swapping genetic material with low-pathogenic avian influenza strains within wild birds. David Swayne, former director of the Agricultural Research Service’s Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Georgia, said at an April 26 media briefing that 87% of avian influenza strains are made up of blended genetic material from other strains. He said that this natural mutation process can make a vaccine less effective against the virus year over year. Acting Ag Sec. Redding faces questions about organics, dog law, avian flu at budget talks Wild migratory birds are the primary transmission vector in the current outbreak, accounting for roughly 85% of disease spread, according to the USDA. These animals, including terns, ducks, and geese, can contract and pass along the disease without obvious physical symptoms. Yet an HPAI infection spreads quickly among a flock of poultry, with infections leading to mortality at a rate of 90% to 100% in chickens and turkeys, often within 48 hours, according to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. When a farmer detects the disease in a commercial flock, the only USDA-recommended option is to kill the remaining birds, dispose of the carcasses, and decontaminate the facility to mitigate spread. Who is getting infected? Should I be worried? Despite the threat H5N1 presents to poultry, experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that people do not need to brood over getting sick. The agency reports that 11 cases of bird flu have been reported among humans since 2021, with only one “mild” case occurring in the United States. And as of 2023, there have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission of HPAI, according to the World Health Organization. Swayne said at the media event that only 875 human cases of H5 bird flu have been reported since 1996. About 40% were fatal. He noted these infections have occurred largely among humans handling domesticated poultry, and not from encounters with wild birds.

Study: Differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes between COVID-19 and influenza in critically ill adult patients: a national database study. Image Credit: Thaiview/Shutterstock.com Background The most common cause of acute respiratory failure was influenza before COVID-19. The influenza pandemic has been used for modeling and planning for epidemics. The common features of COVID-19 and influenza are human-to-human transmission through droplets and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Nonetheless, only a few studies have compared the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 and influenza patients. About the study In the present study, researchers compared the clinical features and outcomes between COVID-19 patients and a historical influenza cohort in France using data from an administrative healthcare database. COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) between March 2020 and June 2021 were included. Besides, patients in the historical influenza cohort were admitted to ICUs between 2014 and 2019. Patients required appropriate International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for the diagnosis of influenza or COVID-19 for inclusion. Age, sex, and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS-II) were recorded at admission, and the Charlson comorbidity index was calculated. Patients with medullar aplasia, solid organ transplants, agranulocytosis, or cancer treatment were deemed immunocompromised. During hospitalization, the team recorded the use of non-invasive (NIV) or invasive ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), prone positioning, and vasopressors. Additionally, they documented if patients developed venous thrombosis events or underwent renal replacement therapy. The study outcomes were ICU/hospital stay, ventilation duration, and vital status at discharge. Vaccination status was obtained beginning in 2021. Chi-squared or Wilcoxon tests were used for comparisons between influenza and COVID-19 patients. The team identified risk factors using the Fine-Gray model. First, they estimated the sub-hazard ratio for invasive ventilation in univariate analysis. Subsequently, a multivariable analysis was adjusted for a predefined set of confounders such as age, infection type, sex, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, immunosuppression, modified SAPS-II, hematologic malignancies, arterial hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. The association between infection type and in-hospital death was also determined. Findings The study included 105,979 COVID-19 and 18,763 influenza patients. Most COVID-19 patients were males and had lower SAPS-II scores at admission than influenza patients. Diabetes mellitus, solid tumors, arterial hypertension, and chronic kidney disease were more common in the COVID-19 cohort.

Around 34%, 18%, and 6% of COVID-19 patients required invasive ventilation, HFNC, and NIV, respectively. By contrast, most influenza patients (47%) required invasive ventilation. COVID-19 was associated with a reduced likelihood of invasive ventilation and an increased in-hospital mortality risk without invasive ventilation. Prone positioning was used for 19% and 12% of COVID-19 and influenza patients, respectively, whereas ECMO was used for 1% of patients in each cohort. The COVID-19 cohort was less likely to require vasopressors and renal replacement therapy than the influenza cohort. COVID-19 patients were more likely to develop pulmonary embolism than influenza patients. In-hospital deaths were more in the COVID-19 cohort than in the influenza cohort. Notably, for patients aged <60, in-hospital deaths were higher among influenza patients than in the COVID-19 cohort. On the contrary, for patients aged 60 or above, mortality was higher in the COVID-19 cohort. The adjusted Fine-Gray model revealed a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients than in influenza patients, particularly for patients aged 65 or older. This finding was consistent among the sub-group of patients requiring invasive ventilation. The hospital stay was longer for COVID-19 patients than for influenza patients. ICU stay was longer for COVID-19 patients, albeit the difference was not relevant clinically. However, in the subgroup of patients with invasive ventilation, COVID-19 patients had a significantly longer ICU stay than influenza patients. The researchers performed sensitivity analyses restricting COVID-19 patients admitted in 2021 and found that COVID-19 patients had an elevated mortality risk relative to influenza patients, irrespective of the COVID-19 vaccination status. Conclusions To summarize, the researchers observed significant differences in ICU management and clinical characteristics and outcomes between critical COVID-19 and influenza patients. COVID-19 patients were less likely to require invasive ventilation. Regardless, COVID-19 patients, especially older adults (≥65 years), showed a consistently higher mortality risk than influenza patients independent of invasive ventilation or vaccination status.

By Attivare Therapeutics0 Attivare Therapeutics Jessica McDonough, Co-founder, Attivare Therapeutics, Natick, MA, USA, Tel: +1-508-589-3625 Produced by Twitter Facebook Email Download PDF Attivare Therapeutics is positioned to transform the management of infectious diseases that affect more than one billion people every year1,2. By localizing immune responses, the biotech’s vaccines trigger amplified, multicellular reactions, unlocking opportunities that are inaccessible to conventional technologies and make single-shot, long-term protection a reality.Using established vaccine technologies, the antigen disperses, is recognized throughout the body, and primarily triggers antibody producing cells. Such traditional vaccines cause transient local inflammation and limited durability of response. Attivare’s technology, which was developed at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States, focuses the immune reaction to change the intensity and type of response.Vaccines developed using the technology feature one or more antigens associated with a silica-based solid material, plus an immune modulator to enhance the initial response. Associating the antigens with the biomaterial scaffold and immune agonists nucleates the immune reaction at one site. At that site, the scaffold recruits and exposes a variety of immune cells, not just antibody producing cells, to an inflammatory microenvironment (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 | The AttImmune technology platform. The biomaterial scaffold recruits, reprograms, and releases target immune cells in an inflammatory microenvironment, and focuses on both poorly immunogenic tumors and infectious diseases.The approach provides durable humoral and cellular immune responses that make single-shot, long-term protection possible. Other advantages include dose sparing (because less antigen is needed to trigger an effective immune response) and the ability to manufacture multivalent products in a simple process.Attivare has validated the technology with various vaccine materials in multiple preclinical experiments in mice and other animals. Internally, the biotech is applying the technology to cancer but the tests also suggest significant opportunities in infectious diseases that it wants to pursue with partners.The biotech sees three main infectious disease partnering opportunities: a urinary tract infection (UTI) vaccine; a universal influenza vaccine; and improving response to novel, but poorly immunogenic, antigens.UTI vaccineMany women have at least one UTI during their lifetime and, while antibiotics can clear the initial infection, 27% of people have a recurrence within six months3. Eighty percent of cases are caused by a specific bacterium, uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), that needs surface adhesion proteins for its virulence.Adhesion proteins enable the pathogen to bind to bladder epithelial cells and avoid clearance by antibiotics. As such, the proteins are a key driver of the recurrent infections that necessitate repeat treatments with antibiotics. Repeat treatment is a burden on patients and raises the risk of drug resistance.The role that adhesion proteins play in recurrent UTIs creates an opportunity to vaccinate against the pathogen, but the immune responses triggered by conventional technologies are unable to clear UPEC from the bladder epithelium or stop the pathogen from penetrating cells in the first place. The limitations of conventional technologies stem from their reliance on transient exposure of immune cells to antigens, which results in a transient humoral response.While systemic antibodies alone are largely ineffective in the bladder epithelium, other types of antibodies and immune cells can clear bacteria from that part of the body. Research shows a multicellular response is needed to clear bacteria from the bladder epithelium, suggesting that Attivare’s vaccine technology is ideally suited to the indication.Universal influenza vaccineThere is also strong, early evidence that the technology is a good fit for the development of a universal influenza (flu) vaccine. Currently, vaccines are changed each year based on a forecast of which influenza strains will be dominant during the flu season. The need to make predictions many months before the start of the flu season means forecasts can be inaccurate. When that happens, flu vaccines provide little protection.The presence of influenza epitopes that are conserved as the virus mutates suggests it could be possible to develop a vaccine that is effective against all strains. However, conventional technologies are yet to deliver a universal flu vaccine. The technologies have so far proven unable to trigger the strong, focused responses to conserved influenza epitopes that are needed to protect people against the virus.By triggering an amplified, multicellular immune response, Attivare’s vaccine technology could provide strong, durable activity against conserved epitopes and fundamentally change how we protect people from the influenza virus.Novel, but poorly immunogenic, antigensThe amplified immune response is key to Attivare’s third partnering opportunity. Vaccine development efforts can be hampered when target antigens are poorly immunogenic. Focusing the immune response on the scaffold allows Attivare to trigger a stronger response and expand the pool of antigens that can support effective vaccines.Attivare’s preclinical tests suggest it has developed a transformational technology for infectious disease vaccines. With the biotech focusing its internal resources on cancer applications, there are opportunities for partners to use the platform to address major unmet medical needs. ReferencesYang, X. et al.

Contribute today Moscow Imposes Quarantine in Multiple Districts Over Bird Flu Outbreak May 18, 2023 A global outbreak of avian influenza has sickened millions of farm poultry and wild birds this year. Kirill Zykov / Moskva News Agency Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Thursday ordered a quarantine for multiple districts in Russia’s capital due to an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu. The order introduces a quarantine for 11 of Moscow's 125 districts that have been assessed to be most at risk for spreading influenza. Epidemiological surveillance services will be intensified to detect potential cases and any operations related to poultry farming — such as the import and export of eggs and slaughtering of birds — are prohibited in the areas affected by the quarantine. Likewise, the order forbids residents from visiting areas where the influenza is spreading. Twenty-two outbreaks of the H5N1 subtype of the influenza virus have been recorded across Russia since the beginning of May, according to the Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary Inspection Service, leading to the deaths of thousands of birds. While humans can contract bird flu, cases remain very rare, and global health officials have said the risk to humans is low. Russia's consumer protection watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said Thursday that there have been no human infections recorded in Moscow. On May 8, several municipalities in Russia’s central Kirov region went under quarantine after outbreaks of bird flu were reported there. Quarantines were also introduced in early May for a number of areas in Yoshkar-Ola, the capital of the republic of Mari El, before local authorities said outbreaks there had been contained. This year, a global outbreak of avian influenza has sickened millions of farm poultry and wild birds, as well as other animals, including seals and foxes.

A total of 77 influenza and 817 COVID-19 cases reported this week 19.05.2023 In week 19, a total of 1773 people fell ill with acute respiratory infections, of whom 39.3% were children. The overall incidence of acute respiratory viral diseases decreased by 12%. Influenza morbidity increased by 18%, with around 40% of the infected being children of up to 15 years of age. According to the Health and Welfare Information Systems Centre (TEHIK), a total of 8 patients were hospitalised due to influenza in recent weeks. In total 1312 people have been hospitalised due to influenza since the beginning of the season. 67.5% of them were over 50 years old. According to conclusively validated data from the Causes of Death Registry of the Health and Welfare Information Systems Centre, a total of 62 people aged 9 to 97 have died due to influenza this season. Based on the data recorded in the Sentinel System, the morbidity rate of influenza can be regarded as low. Isolated cases of infection with influenza B virus are recorded. The overall trend of hospitalisation fluctuates without significant increases or decreases. A total of 817 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed over the week. There was a 22% decline in the total number of registered cases as compared to the previous week. Positive tests account for 7%. Morbidity decreased in nearly all age groups. According to data received from hospitals, 80 patients were hospitalised over the week. 40 patients, ie half of all hospitalisations, were admitted due to symptomatic COVID-19. Due to the many relatively mild and asymptomatic forms of COVID-19, the virus is likely to spread silently without significant fluctuations in cases. The situation is calm and there is currently no risk of the health care system becoming overwhelmed.

(Lewnanny Richardson/Submitted)Social SharingThe number of waterfowl testing positive for avian influenza has gone down in Newfoundland and Labrador, but government authorities are still asking anyone heading out on the land to hunt to take precautions. "We want people to take this risk seriously and to follow the proper hygiene that will protect them and their families," said Alan Hanson, head of aquatic assessment for the Canadian Wildlife Service.There have been 110 confirmed cases of bird flu found in the province so far, but the testing suggests the virus is responsible for thousands of bird deaths. A spike in positive tests began in July of last year with an array of species, including puffins, black-legged kittiwakes, murres, eiders and northern gannets, found dead from the virus. Avian flu responsible for thousands of dead birds in Newfoundland, suggest preliminary testsWhile N.L.'s murre population appeared healthy over winter, experts keeping close eye on avian fluIn Labrador, Hanson said, 45 dead birds were submitted for testing and 12 returned positive. The number of birds testing positive has slowed since the beginning of 2023, with nine positive cases provincially so far. But the Canadian Wildlife Service is asking hunters to act as though any bird or marine animal may have the virus. "Fully cooked wild birds do not pose a risk, so they're safe to consume, but the real risk is in how people are handling the birds," Hanson said. Nesting grounds at the Cape St. Mary's Ecological Reserve were relatively empty in 2022, compared with previous years. Avian flu killed thousands of sea birds that would normally nest at the colony. (Darryl Murphy/CBC)Hanson said people should wear gloves when cleaning animals, avoid touching their faces, dispose of internal organs so other wildlife cannot access them, and keep pets away from wild birds and other wild animals. "One of the things that is surprising and different about this outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza is its transmission to a number of mammalian species, and I think for the most part that's relatively unprecedented," Hanson said. Skunks, red foxes, seals, dolphins, porpoises and black bears have died from the virus as well, Hanson said, so people should also take precautions when hunting and harvesting those animals.Spring migration ramps up risk of spread of new avian flu strain2 years agoDuration 1:55Scientists are warning the spring bird migration could give a new avian flu strain a chance to spread. Migrating birds could pose a risk to animals, so veterinarians recommend pet owners keep their animals away from birds where possible.Key signs to watch for Any sick or dead animals should be reported to your local wildlife officer, Hanson said, listing some symptoms people can keep an eye out for in birds and other animals: Animal acts lethargic. Animal does not show fear of humans. Head drooping. Swelling around the head. Swelling around the eyes. Excessive eye secretions. The virus doesn't seem to be prevalent in birds that hunters thought to be healthy and harvested, Hanson said. The birds are back in town. Spring migration could fuel spread, evolution of avian flu, scientists warnAvian flu is devastating N.L.'s birds. This biologist has some ideas on how to curb itThe service tested 400 murres shot by hunters from Newfoundland this past winter and 148 various birds shot by hunters from Labrador last summer, and all were negative, he said. "We don't want people to totally ignore the risk," he said, "but at the same time we want to let people know that it is safe if they follow the right precautions to hunt birds and to consume them."Read more from CBC Newfoundland and LabradorABOUT THE AUTHORHeidi AtterMobile JournalistHeidi Atter is a journalist working in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Labrador.

Welch, PharmD, MBA, FAPhA: Hello, and welcome to this American Journal of Managed Care® Peer Exchange entitled, “Exploring the Potential Impact of RSV Vaccines.” My name is Dr Adam Welch. I’m a pharmacist and independent vaccine consultant for ETSU Health in Johnson City, Tennessee. Joining me today in this virtual discussion are Dr Laurene Mascola, a physician and immunizations and vaccines policy consultant at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health in California; Dr Wanda Filer, a physician and chief medical officer at VaxCare in Orlando, Florida; Dr Marty Feltner, a pharmacist and director of pharmacy at Senior Rx Care Pharmacy of Nebraska in Lincoln; and Dr Abby Lynne Singleton, senior pharmacist at Highmark Inc, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Today, we’re going to talk about several topics pertaining to RSV [respiratory syncytial virus], including the impact of RSV infections in the adult population, managing infections, and addressing potential barriers to the introduction of RSV vaccines in the market. Let’s get started. Let’s start with Dr Mascola. What is respiratory syncytial virus, and how does it affect older adults?Laurene Mascola, MD, MPH: Well, regarding respiratory syncytial virus, all persons of all ages, both healthy and with underlying conditions, are at risk for this disease, although the morbidity is greatest in those under 2 and also those over the age of 65. Data indicate that RSV impacts the elderly population, both in the community and in nursing homes, similar to nonpandemic influenza, resulting in the same number of hospitalizations, intensive-care visits, and mortality. The prevalence of RSV infection in adults, out of all respiratory infections, is estimated to be about 5% annually, although it can be up to 7.8% seasonally.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that about 60,000 to 160,000 adults are hospitalized annually with this disease, so it is a pretty significant cause of morbidity. We also see that, as the population gets to be older, the older population is expected to increase about 39% between 2020 and 2050, the impact of this disease is going to be greater. We see anywhere between 6000 and 10,000 deaths annually in this older population.Adam C. Welch, PharmD, MBA, FAPhA: We think of RSV a lot of times as a pediatric concern. But you’re saying now with older adults, there’s a significant risk for hospitalizations. You mentioned up to 160,000 adults are hospitalized and 6000 to 10,000 deaths in older adults annually due to RSV, so it’s significant in that population as well.Laurene Mascola, MD, MPH: And it increases by age. When you look at those under the age of 65 years old, the case fatality rate is around 4%. As you get to be over 75 years old, that case fatality rate goes up to about 6%. And in those severely frail adults, it can even be as high as 10%.Adam C. Welch, PharmD, MBA, FAPhA: Wow, so it’s very important. Dr Filer, how is RSV spread? What are the symptoms we should be looking for?Wanda Filer, MD, MBA, FAAFP: I think a lot of people in the adult population are not familiar with RSV, we haven’t been testing for RSV. But it is the person who will come into my family physician office. They’ll come in with a sore throat, they’ll come in with fatigue. They’ll come in with a lot of head and nasal congestion. RSV is known to give a lot of nasal drainage. The other thing is the cough, and that’s where it moves from an upper respiratory illness, where you’ve been infected by those respiratory droplets, those aerosolized droplets from someone who’s sick, or maybe you picked it up on a surface. It can live on a surface for several hours. People can be contagious for 3 to 8 days, and if they’re immunocompromised, even up to 4 weeks. So they can be spreading it out into the community.You may have no idea that you’ve been exposed to this. You come into the office, and you think it’s a head cold. But in about 25% of patients who come in with “just a cold,” it moves into their lower respiratory system, and they can end up with bronchitis, or tracheobronchitis. As Dr Mascola said, some of those patients will move on to pneumonias and require hospitalizations. That’s why I think many of us are very excited about the idea of an RSV vaccine, a way to prevent illness and keep people from missing days at work and all the suffering that comes with this illness.Adam C. Welch, PharmD, MBA, FAPhA: Some of the symptoms you described feel a lot like some of the other respiratory conditions we’re familiar with, with COVID-19 and the flu. So how do you differentiate COVID-19, let’s say, with RSV?Wanda Filer, MD, MBA, FAAFP: It’s not always easy. We often use the term influenza-like illness. It can be very similar to flu, COVID-19, or RSV. More so in the last few years, we’ve got rapid testing. It’s not as widespread in the outpatient world. Many emergency departments are now doing testing. We clearly didn’t test for COVID-19 until the pandemic. We’re doing more flu testing. But RSV, frankly, in adults, I think one of the reasons we’re not aware of it is we weren’t testing for it because there wasn’t anything to do. We would give supportive treatment, but there wasn’t any antiviral to give. There still is not. So, you give supportive care. We’re doing more testing in emergency departments. Frankly, the burden of illness that you heard about a few moments ago from Dr Mascola is probably a lot higher. There’s probably a lot more RSV out there that we didn’t recognize. So, testing is going to help us to get our arms around this a lot better.Laurene Mascola, MD, MPH: Wanda, aren’t there also asymptomatic people who have RSV who can also be spreading the disease?Wanda Filer, MD, MBA, FAAFP: Absolutely. As I mentioned, sometimes, especially people who are immunocompromised, might be infected for weeks, and they can be spreading that disease silently. They have no idea. Many people will have a low-grade infection, they feel absolutely fine. Meanwhile, they’re spreading it to the community. The peak is oftentimes in the winter, when we see this illness in adults. It’s the time, if you think about it, cold and flu season. And this is one of those offenders.Marty J. Feltner, PharmD: I think you made a valid point where it’s underreported. We really don’t know the prevalence of RSV in our community, in our long-term care settings right now. The virus is very similar in clinical presentation to influenza, and COVID-19. So, we really need to start testing for all 3, especially in long-term health care facilities.Laurene Mascola, MD, MPH: Also, if you look at it from a public health point of view, right now, most states don’t have RSV as being a reportable condition, again because there hasn’t been anything that we could do to prevent it, so there hasn’t been any reason to count it. Most state and local health departments don’t even count cases of RSV infection, or look for it, so we really don’t know what’s happening in the community.Marty J. Feltner, PharmD: It’s voluntary reporting. There are maybe 12 or 14 states that are reporting RSV infections.Adam C. Welch, PharmD, MBA, FAPhA: Dr Filer, you mentioned the seasonality of RSV and when it peaks. For the past year with COVID-19 and the pandemic, people weren’t interacting in the way they normally have in years past. So, have we seen changes in RSV over the past few years?Wanda Filer, MD, MBA, FAAFP: We have, and maybe it’s the public health nerd in me a bit, but I find it really interesting. When people were staying at home, they were wearing their masks, and what we saw was RSV was happening in June. It was happening through the summer. There were very high burdens. Everyone’s heard the stories of pediatric ICUs [intensive care units] filling up, but you were also seeing it in the adult space. And adult ICUs, whether it was COVID-19, or RSV, sometimes they were coexisting. And with influenza, there were multiple burdens, and it was occurring year-round. The suspicion is it will go back to a more normal pattern now that life is, in theory, returning a little more to normal. So that October to March time frame is probably, again, when we’re going to see RSV occur.Adam C. Welch, PharmD, MBA, FAPhA: We see RSV peaking around the same time that influenza could be peaking, and it can provide this extra burden of upper respiratory symptoms that people need to deal with, and that providers need to navigate in this process.Marty J. Feltner, PharmD: From a pharmacy perspective, we could be doing all 3 vaccinations during our influenza season, which is going to be a huge challenge in the pharmacy and the health care community as well.Laurene Mascola, MD, MPH: I think for the first time, we’re looking at an adult platform for vaccines coming in the fall. Usually, we didn’t think of adults as having an established routine for getting vaccinations, but now we’re looking at at least 3 vaccines every fall. With the pneumococcal vaccine, flu vaccine, and COVID-19 boosters, and now maybe even RSV, we’re looking at 4 vaccines that adults might need to be getting every fall season.Adam C. Welch, PharmD, MBA, FAPhA: A lot more information and a lot more preventive options coming forward for us as providers.Transcripts edited for clarity.Related VideosRelated Content AdvertisementNovember 11th 2024Possible Genetic Links Between Hidradenitis Suppurativa and CAD, Diabetes RisksMaggie L.

Since then, 20 more condors have died. Another four are recovering at a rehabilitation center. Of these condors, 15 have been confirmed with HPAI, including two of the four in recovery, according to a press release from APHIS. The authorized vaccine is a killed, inactivated product conditionally licensed by APHIS’ Center for Veterinary Biologics in 2016. Since the vaccine has not previously been tested against this strain of the virus in these species, the first step in the vaccination program is a pilot safety study in North American vultures, a similar species, to investigate if there are any adverse effects before giving the vaccine to the endangered condors. This trial is funded by the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service and will be carried out with the surrogate vultures in North Carolina beginning in May 2023. APHIS grants emergency use approvals, which exempt products from one or more regulatory requirements normally applied to licensed vaccines, to prevent, control, or eradicate animal diseases in connection with an official USDA program and/or an emergency animal disease situation. APHIS approved this emergency vaccination of the condors because these birds are critically endangered, closely monitored, and their population is very small (less than 600), which allows close monitoring of the vaccine to ensure it is administered only to the approved population. Vaccination of condors shouldn’t impact poultry tradeVultures and California condors are wild birds, not poultry as defined by the World Organization of Animal Health (WOAH). Because of that, APHIS does not expect their vaccination to result in impacts to poultry trade. USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists continue to research vaccine options that could protect U.S. poultry from HPAI, should vaccination be necessary for additional birds in the United States.

The latest move sees a Phase 1 trial at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, get under way, testing the safety and immune response of H1ssF-3928 mRNA-LNP, developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center (VRC).Some 50 participants aged 18-49 will be split into three groups and given 10, 25 and 50 micrograms of the active drug, respectively. When optimal dosage is then determined, another 10 participants will get this measured jab. There will also be an additional group who will receive a current quadrivalent seasonal flu shot, so researchers have a comparative dataset that takes into account the immune response and safety of readily available influenza vaccines.Those in the trial will then be regularly evaluated over 12 months to see how the drug’s immune response has fared and to assess its short-term and long-term safety. While numbers vary depending on which seasonal influenza strains are prevalent, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that, in its worse years from 2010 to 2020, the virus has resulted in up to 710,000 annual hospitalizations and 52,000 deaths in the US. Worldwide, the flu kills as many a 650,000 people each year.“A universal influenza vaccine would be a major public health achievement and could eliminate the need for both annual development of seasonal influenza vaccines, as well as the need for patients to get a flu shot each year,” said Dr Hugh Auchincloss, acting NIAID Director. “Moreover, some strains of influenza virus have significant pandemic potential. A universal flu vaccine could serve as an important line of defense against the spread of a future flu pandemic.”This trial comes after the initial NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center study on the safety and immune response of the H1ssF (H1 hemagglutinin stabilized stem ferritin) nanoparticle vaccine. The Phase 1 trial, from April 2019 to March 2020, delivered broad antibody responses in the 52 participants aged 18-70. The results of the trial were published last month in the journal Science Translational Medicine.The H1ssF vaccine targets the flu protein hemagglutinin. One section of this protein – the 'head' – changes as the virus evolves into different strains, but the stem of the protein is much slower to be altered and remains fairly constant throughout influenza mutations. The researchers believe herein lies the key to a long-lasting, effective universal preventative vaccine.The new trial combines the H1ssF nanoparticle vaccine with messenger RNA (mRNA) as the platform, with the end goal that it'll deliver a more efficient, targeted immune response."During the course of a flu season, the influenza virus drifts, undergoing small, but significant changes that make current vaccines less effective," said Dr Emmanuel Walter, chief medical officer and director of the Duke Vaccine and Trials Unit. "We are hopeful that this vaccine could offer protection across those sorts of change."The H1ssF-3928 mRNA-LNP vaccine is not the only potential flu shot at this stage of development. CureVac and GSK have begun a combined Phase 1/2 trial for their multivalent, modified mRNA seasonal influenza vaccine. Pfizer and BioNTech launched Phase 3 of their quadrivalent nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) vaccine last September, administering the drug to 25,000 adults in the US aged 18 and over. Theirs is yet another approach, targeting four known flu strains recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). They've also begun Phase 1 trials of a flu shot combined with their COVID-19 Omicron BA.4/BA.5 vaccine.However, last month, Moderna admitted its Phase 3 trial of its vaccine, mRNA-1010, “did not accrue sufficient cases at the interim efficacy analysis to declare early success.” This follows on from 2021's disappointing trial results.Source: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Tags Infectious DiseasesVaccinesRNABiotechnologyInfluenzaDuke UniversityU.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Facebook Twitter Flipboard LinkedIn 3 comments Bronwyn Thompson Bronwyn has always loved words and animals, and she has the journalism and zoology degrees to prove it.

(Getty Images)This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. Contact a qualified medical professional before engaging in any physical activity, or making any changes to your diet, medication or lifestyle.Bird flu — also known as avian influenza virus — has been spreading across Canada killing millions of wild and domestic birds since 2021. Now, experts say the potential for a "spillover" of the virus to humans is of "critical concern."Matthew Miller, Ph.D, scientific director of the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University, said avian influenza virus is "very dangerous" for humans who come in contact with it because of the "extremely high mortality rate.""While many people think that the H5N1 avian influenza virus only poses a risk to birds, that isn’t true," Miller explained.The virus has already been a serious threat to commercial flocks, but has started showing up in a variety of different mammals lately, including the infection of a domestic dog last month in Ottawa.Now, new Canadian research shows that the highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza H5N1 is able to spread quickly and "efficiently" among ferrets — a mammal often used to evaluate the risk of human transmission of a virus. Similarly to birds, the infection in ferrets resulted in lethal outcomes.What exactly is avian influenza virus?According to Health Canada, the predominant avian influenza H5N1 viruses that are now circulating globally are different from earlier H5N1 viruses."Avian influenza viruses continually change, which can affect how easily the virus spreads from birds to other animals, including humans, and also how severe the illness is," a media representative said in an email to Yahoo Canada.The predominant avian influenza H5N1 viruses that are now circulating globally are different from earlier H5N1 viruses. (Getty Images)McMaster's Miller explained the H5N1 influenza virus is a type of virus that naturally infects birds."When birds migrate or congregate in fields or feed in waterways, during their migration, their droppings carry this virus," he said.Those droppings can contaminate the water, the dirt, and food that other animals consume and infect more birds, and even other species."Unlike normal seasonal flus that typically cause mild respiratory infections, H5N1 influenza virus infections can spread throughout our bodies and infect tissues like our brains, our hearts, and other vital organs leading to really severe illness."The Ontario Ministry of Health stated that based on studies of patients with H5N1 virus, symptoms of human infection include: fever, cough, sore throat, congestion, body aches, headaches, tiredness, red eyes, and shortness of breath. Less common symptoms can also manifest as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and even seizures.How common is human infection of bird flu?Health Canada told Yahoo Canada that the risk of human infection with avian influenza (H5N1) is rare.There has been only one case of H5N1 in humans confirmed in Canada to date. (Getty Images)Since 1997, there have been more than 800 human cases of bird flu reported worldwide, mostly occurring in Africa and Asia. To date, there has only been one human case of H5N1 ever reported in Canada – when a Canadian resident died of avian influenza in early 2014 after returning from a trip to China.The new study — which hasn’t passed peer review yet — warned that "while there have been few human cases of infection with clade 2.3.4.4b viruses reported to date, the potential for spillover, particularly of viruses harbouring mammalian adaptation signatures remains a critical concern."The CDC has taken the data on bird flu spreading beyond birds seriously, announcing earlier this spring that there are already trials underway for a vaccine that could be used to protect humans if the virus continues to adapt.How can people protect themselves from contracting H5N1?The good news is that there currently is no evidence that H5N1 transmits effectively between humans who come in contact with each other.Miller said people infected with H5N1 virus typically become infected by direct contact with an infected animal."H5N1 avian flu is not transmitted by eating chicken or turkey that (you) buy at the grocery store," he explained.According to Miller, the best thing people can do to prevent infection is to avoid contact with sick or dead animals.After coming home from parks or places where geese congregate, he also advised to be "extra vigilant about washing your hands." As an extra precaution, wash your shoes or any clothing that comes in contact with bird droppings.Health Canada confirmed "avian influenza is not a food safety concern." It added "there is no evidence that eating fully cooked commercial poultry or eggs could transmit avian influenza to humans."Let us know what you think by commenting below and tweeting @YahooStyleCA!

All but 1 female developed the ulcers after the second dose of the vaccine rather than the first, and none had a known history of SARS-CoV-2a or evidence of prior COVID-19 infection. In addition, none of the patients reported recent symptomatic viral illnesses.Patients first reported systemic symptoms, such as fevers, headache, and myalgias; vulvar symptoms, which included vulvar pain and dysuria, typically developed 2 days after vaccination and peaked within 5 days. Physical exams were consistent with aphthous ulcers, showing violaceous ulcerations with surrounding erythema and necrotic islands.Symptoms resolved in 10 to 24 days. Five patients required only symptomatic support, while 3 received a course of oral steroids, and 2 a course of antibiotics for positive vulvar cultures. In the patients who received oral steroids, the ulcers resolved without evidence of further lesions in 14 to 21 days. In those who received only symptomatic treatment, lesions fully resolved in 10 to 25 days. Symptomatic treatment included nonsteroidal and anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, zinc oxide barrier cream, sitz baths, and topical lidocaine.THOUGHTS FROM DR. FARBER:Remember this possible cause the next time you see a patient with vulvar ulcers; it can save her (and you) a great deal of trouble. The immunization has also been linked to supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, an entity that previously was almost always pathognomonic for lymphoma.To read more from the May, 2023, issue of Contemporary Pediatrics®, click here.Reference:Sartor RA, Lawson A, Moncada-Madrazo M, Altchek C, Vash-Margita A, Cron J.

You Catch Bird Flu?It comes after two poultry workers tested positive for the virus in England.By Kate NicholsonSenior Trends Reporter, HuffPost UK17/05/2023 12:16pm BSTPaul Grace Photography Somersham via Getty ImagesAvian Influenza was found in two humans in England – but neither showed any symptoms, and both have since tested negative.Bird flu concerns are starting to mount in the UK – but should how worried should we be, and what does it actually do?Here are the facts.What is bird flu?Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is a virus which triggers disease among birds.It is not the same as pandemic flu like Covid.The most serious strain is called highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), and can cause a whole host of symptoms, including sudden death in the bird.Advertisement There’s also the less serious version, low pathogenic avian influenza (IPAI).On very rare occasions, it can spread to people after they’ve been exposed to infected birds, by contaminating a human’s nose and throat, or it can also be true infection.You can catch bird flu by touching sick or dead birds, touching droppings or bedding, or by killing or preparing infected poultry for cooking.However, there is currently no evidence that it can spread from person to person.You cannot catch it by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even where there is an outbreak, although bird flu restrictions have affected the UK’s supermarket egg supplies in recent months.RelatedHealthwhat happens ifbird fluWhy Free Range Eggs Are Coming Off Supermarket ShelvesAdvertisement What are the bird flu symptoms in humans?According to the NHS, symptoms include:High temperature or feeling hot or shiveryAching musclesHeadachesCough or shortness of breathDiarrhoeaSicknessStomach painChest painBleeding from the nose and gumsConjunctivitisThe NHS explains it can take around 3 to 5 days for the first symptoms to appear after infection. Complications can later occur, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.It’s important to get treated quickly, and doctors will probably prescribe antiviral medicine to help you feel better as soon as possible.It’s much harder to treat in birds – poultry with the most serious strain can die, or suffer from a list of serious symptoms such as swollen head or closed and runny eyes.LAUREN OWENS LAMBERT via Getty ImagesBird flu means poultry workers have to take more precautionWhy are concerns around bird flu increasing now?Two people have tested positive for avian flu after working on an infected poultry farm in England.However, neither experienced any symptoms and both have since tested negative.UKHSA (the UK Health Security Agency) claims one person likely had nose and/or throat contamination on the farm, although said it’s harder to understand how the second individual caught it.Advertisement The authorities have also confirmed that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission yet, while the overall threat to human health is still very low. What do authorities say?Professor Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor at UKHSA, said that it looks like the current viruses “do not spread easily to people”.However, she added: “We know already that the virus can spread to people following close contact with infected birds.”She said they are monitoring people who have been exposed to learn more about the illness, contacting those with the highest risk exposures on a daily basis to watch their symptoms.Hopkins added: “We know that viruses evolve all the time and we remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk to the population.”Advertisement The UKHSA is asking poultry workers to swab their nose and throat to check for the virus’s presence 10 days after their exposure, with some people being asked to have finger prick blood tests to see if they can detect an immune response.But, importantly, it does not look like the virus is mutating.Professor Ian Brown, director of scientific services for Animal and Plant health agency, said: “No the virus is not changing its characteristics to something more risky to humans but continued monitoring [is] important.”Brown added that “the scale of the epidemic in wild birds appears to have diminished since before Christmas”, predicting that this “will disappear over the summer, but what will happen is hard to predict.”How do you avoid it?According to the NHS, you can protect yourself from bird flu by:Washing your hands often with warm water and soap especially after handling foodUsing different utensils for cooked and raw meatMaking sure meat is cooked until steaming hotAvoiding contact with live birds and poultry Not eating raw eggs, undercooked poultry/ duckRelatedHealthwhat happens ifbird fluAre We Ready For The Next Pandemic?

CNN — It’s time to add to your list of reasons to work out: Getting active could help prevent risk of death from the flu and pneumonia, according to new research. Meeting the physical activity guidelines for aerobic and muscle-strengthening activity reduces risk of dying from influenza and pneumonia by 48%, according to a study published Tuesday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Adults should get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic physical activity and two or more days of moderate muscle strengthening activities a week, according to the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans issued by the US Department of Health and Human Services. The study relied on the survey data of more than 570,000 people from the US National Health Interview Survey between 1998 and 2018. People were asked about their physical activity habits, and they were categorized into groups based on how well they met the recommended amount of exercise, according to the study. On average, the respondents were monitored for nine years after the initial survey. There were 1,516 deaths from the flu or pneumonia in that time. 21 September 2020, Bavaria, Allmannsdorf: Two women walk in the evening sun on the dam of Lake Brombach with Nordic Walking sticks. Photo: Daniel Karmann/dpa (Photo by Daniel Karmann/picture alliance via Getty Images) Daniel Karmann/picture alliance/dpa/Getty Images What you should know about the most underrated form of exercise Meeting both recommendations for aerobic and muscle-strengthening activity cut the risk associated with flu or pneumonia death nearly in half, but meeting just the aerobic activity target was associated with a 36% lower risk, according to the study. Both influenza and pneumonia are among leading causes of death in the United States and around the world, so the results are significant, said lead study author Dr. Bryant Webber, an epidemiologist in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity. “Readers may appreciate the importance of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. This study might encourage them that physical activity may be another powerful tool for protecting themselves against influenza and pneumonia death,” he said. The results make sense given existing knowledge, and the benefits may extend to other conditions, said Dr. Robert Sallis, director of the sports medicine fellowship at Kaiser Permanente Fontana Medical Center, and clinical professor of family medicine at Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine in California. He was not involved in the study. “This study is also consistent with the various studies showing that regular exercise dramatically lowered the risk of COVID-19 related death in similar fashion,” Sallis said in an email. Even a little bit of exercise showed benefit in protecting against flu and pneumonia death, the study found. Hispanolistic/E+/Getty Images Not enough is better than nothing But even if you can’t reach the recommended amount, some activity can still provide more protection than none, according to the study. “We also found that any level of aerobic physical activity, even at amounts below the recommended level, lowered the risk of influenza and pneumonia death, as compared to doing no aerobic activity,” Webber said.

And in the case of muscle strengthening, there is such a thing as too much, the study showed. tired woman working out whyframeshot/Adobe Stock What experts say about exercising when you're tired Meeting the target of two or more sessions lowered the mortality risk significantly, but getting seven or more sessions was associated with a 41% increased risk of death by flu or pneumonia, the study showed. However, this was an observational study, the researchers noted, which means that the study can’t make claims about what causes or prevents the deaths — just what factors were associated with a level of risk. The increased risk could be related to a range of factors, including the cardiovascular impacts of frequent muscle-strengthening activity or inaccurate responses to the survey, the study said. Even though there are limitations in the design, researchers often rely on these studies when it is impossible to randomize people into different lifestyles, Sallis said. Getting in more activity Aerobic activity — or cardio, as it’s often called — doesn’t have to mean getting yourself to the gym regularly, the study said. This type of movement is anything that gets your heart rate and sweat glands going, including speed walking, swimming, biking, running or stair climbing. Exercises such as lifting weights, squats, lunges or even heavy gardening can count as your muscle-strengthening activity, the study added. A megastudy published in December 2021 showed that the best exercise programs include planning when you work out, getting reminders, offering incentives and discouraging missing more than one planned workout in a row. It may seem far-fetched, but you'll be surprised at how tired you can get using a paper plate to exercise. Deborah Brunswick, CNN Strengthen your core with exercises you can do at home using only a paper plate “If people are hoping to boost their physical activity or change their health behaviors, there are very low-cost behavioral insights that can be built into programs to help them achieve greater success,” said that study’s lead author Katy Milkman, the James G. Dinan Professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and author of “How to Change: The Science of Getting From Where You Are to Where You Want to Be.” You can start small, said Dana Santas, a CNN fitness contributor and mind-body coach for professional athletes, in a 2022 CNN article. “Fitting in ten minutes of exercise every day is so much easier than people think. Consider how fast ten minutes goes by when you’re mindlessly scrolling social media or watching your favorite TV show,” Santas said in an email. “It’s not a big time investment, but it can deliver big health benefits.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Health Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

Neither worker experienced symptoms of avian influenza, with both cases found during screening. The risk to the general population remains very low, the UKHSA added.The UKHSA is running a programme of testing workers who have come into contact with infected birds, but is also running asymptomatic testing.The first person who tested positive is thought to have inhaled the virus.The second person is thought to be a more complicated case and it is unclear whether they have suffered a genuine infection or whether they too inhaled the virus while at work. What is bird flu and what's behind the outbreak?Bird flu 'spills over' to otters and foxes in UKListen on BBC Sounds: The Briefing Room: How worried should we be about avian flu?The UKHSA says precautionary contact tracing has been undertaken for this second individual. Chief Medical Advisor at the UKHSA Professor Susan Hopkins said that globally there is "no evidence of spread of this strain from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk to the population.""It remains critical that people avoid touching sick or dead birds, and that they follow the DEFRA advice about reporting," she added.Professor James Wood, head of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge, said the finding should lead to "greater attention" on asymptomatic infection and sampling. He said it was important to sequence the virus in the two workers and infected birds in order to see if there were any mutations of concern, adding that resampling the workers could indicate whether they had developed an immune response. There are various different types of avian flu that have circulated in the past - the latest one infecting birds is H5. Although none of these strains easily infect people, and they are not usually spread from person to person, small numbers of people have been infected around the world, leading to a small number of deaths.There have been very few cases of bird flu transmission to people recorded in the UK. The virus is not that well suited to humans and does not spread as easily as it does between birds. It usually requires very close contact with an infected bird, which is why experts say the risk to humans is currently considered very low.These latest cases do not change that assessment. There is no suggestion that the virus has changed to become more infectious to us or spread from person to person. A "mandatory housing order" for England and Wales was lifted on 18 April, meaning poultry and captive birds could be kept outside again.The measures were introduced during the world's biggest ever bird flu outbreak.Government guidance on the signs of bird flu and how to report it can be found here., externalTop storiesAssisted dying bill has strict safeguards, says MP proposing law changePublished2 hours agoGary Lineker to leave BBC's Match of the DayPublished3 hours agoWatch: 'Any good?'

Here, we bring you everything you need to know about this current strain of bird flu, the bird populations affected and what the plans are to minimise further outbreaks. What is bird flu?The latest wave of avian flu descends from the H5N1 strain of avian influenza that originally arrived in the UK in 2005/06, most likely from dense poultry and geese farms in China and south-east Asia. "Most of the time this has behaved like a normal, natural avian flu, coming and going, bad some years then dropping to a low level," says Martin Fowlie of the RSPB. "But it’s fair to say this is the worst ever outbreak in the UK. We have been in uncharted territory with the disease this year and its effects on wild birds. It has mutated into a really nasty strain."Guillemots are one of a number of species to be hit by bird flu/Credit: Getty Where did this current strain of bird flu come from? The latest version emerged in the summer of 2021, when sick and dead great skuas were found in Shetland, Orkney, St Kilda and the Flannan Isles. Other seabirds and waterbirds were affected over the 2021/2022 winter but this spring it surged again, hitting colonies as they returned from the open sea to breed.More than 100 gannets have died on St Kilda. At Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth, the world’s largest gannetry, more than 150 dead birds discovered along the coastline/Credit: Getty How do birds become infected with bird flu? Birds can be infected with the virus through contact with infected saliva, nasal secretions or faeces. Wild birds including waterfowl are often more resistant to avian influenza than domestic birds, and can carry and transmit the virus without showing evidence of disease. Movements of poultry around and between countries, is another known vector. How many birds have died from bird flu? The true number may not be known as many birds die at sea or are washed away. There is no cure or treatment and almost all infected birds die. "We are looking at hundreds of thousands of birds," says Fowlie. Britain's seabird populations are of global significance, with the UK holding 56% of the worlds northern gannet population and Scotland holding 46% of the world’s northern gannets and 60% of the world’s great skuas. Both these species are amber listed in Birds of Conservation. As of early October, 537 positive cases of the strain had been identified in Scotland, among 28 species over 142 locations, though the true number will be far higher. Bird flu survives after it has killed its host and there is concern that it could spread widely in white-tailed and golden eagles when they scavenge or kill dead or infected birds.

Great skuas: Some colonies have lost up to 80% of their populations . The National Trust for Scotland (NTS), which manages the Unesco World Heritage of St Kilda, which lies 40 miles west of Harris and Uist, said a significant proportion of the islands' great skuas. Also known as bonxies, dead birds have been found on Papa Westray, Shetland and elsewhere. Guillemots have also been hit. ‘We have seen chicks washed up as well. They jump off the cliffs with their dads when they leave the nest. We don’t know if they have got the disease or they have starved when their dads die," says Fowlie. The key roseate tern population on Coquet Island in Northumbria has also been devastated. Black-headed gulls have been found dead from the disease in Suffolk. Ornithologists estimate 3,000-4,000 barnacle geese died over the 2021/22 winter around the Solway firth, a third of the regional barnacle geese population. More than 100 gannets have died on St Kilda. At Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth, the world’s largest gannetry has also been hit with more than 150 dead birds discovered along the coastline. Others have been found dead at Noup Head in Westray. The impact on the European continent and further afield has been similar with at least 400,000 wild birds estimated to have died in 2,600 outbreaks. Among poultry, 3,000 reported outbreaks have led to 77 million birds being culled. Curiously so far puffins, kittiwakes and fulmars have been relatively unscathed, even when they have bred in multi-species colonies where other species have been hammered. The RSPB is keen to establish if this is down to chance or something more significant. Defra and the UKHSA says the risk of avian flu in common garden bird species such as finches, sparrows, tits, warblers, robins, wrens, swallows as well as pigeons is very low.There is concern that bird flu could spread to golden eagle populations/Credit: Getty What happens next? NatureScot, the Scottish government environmental agency, said the virus is likely to remain in circulation "for some time". "The problem," says Fowlie, "is that this deadly strain of avian flu has hit extremely vulnerable populations that are already under great pressure. Bird flu is just more thing our seabirds have to deal with. Our seabirds are already under massive pressure from human impacts including climate change, lack of prey fish, deaths through entanglement in fishing gear and development pressure." In the absence of effective monitoring or measures, the RSPB and others are crossing their fingers that avian flu recedes over the winter. "The concern is if it comes back again to already depleted populations," says Fowlie. "We are hearing talk of potential extinction for some species such as the great skua". Read more John Craven: UK flocks badly hit by costly bird flu outbreak Garden bird guide: how to identify common bird and what to feed each species Is it only wild birds who are affected? No. Several reports of H5N1 have been identified over the summer at poultry farms across the UK. Protection, exclusion and surveillance zones were set up in affected areas. One consequence of this was a requirement to house poultry, leading to eggs no longer being classified as free range. Do imported birds and poultry products play a part in the disease? Not only is avian flu likely to have originated in Asian poultry farms and arrived via processed and air-freighted meat but current practices may compound the problem. Ornithologists have expressed disquiet at the widespread import of game birds for the shooting industry from France where the major breeding sites for pheasants and partridges in the Vendée and Loire Atlantique has been affected by avian flu. Restrictions were in place over the summer and the release of game birds in restricted zones in the UK was prohibited. What can be done to prevent or minimise future outbreaks? Nothing can be done to save individual birds infected. But the RSPB believes that to deal with future HPAI outbreaks in wild birds, improved surveillance, testing and carcass collecting is essential; and that an effective plan should be put in place for biosecurity measures and to minimise disturbance. "Scotland and Wales have put some measures in place but in England it is glaringly absent," says Fowlie. "When bird flu first arrived there was a task force, a collaboration of virologists, vets, ecologists – that was important and so useful. For whatever reason, that has not happened this time. "We need to be more joined up in how we deal with our marine environment. We need to tackle invasive species such as rats and mice in colonies, reinforce and effectively police our marine protected areas, we need to be cleverer about where we put offshore wind farms. Monitoring of trends and populations is needed – funding for data has dried up." What to do if you see a dead bird The risk of contracting the disease from a wild bird is very low but you are advised not to touch any sick or dead birds, their droppings, or any water nearby as the virus survives long after it has killed its host. Should you find any dead swans, ducks, geese, gulls, seabirds, birds of prey or five or more of any other species in one place report them to Defra on 03459 335577 or in Northern Ireland to DAERA on 0300 200 7840.

Here's what it's like. health 'I have the flu, COVID-19 and I'm 33 weeks pregnant. Here's what it's really like.' Jessie Stephens Executive Editor May 20, 2023 Share Leave a comment It starts with the cough. You know the one. At first, you think you might just have something caught in your throat. You drink some water. More coughing. The water must have gone down the wrong way. Then there are two coughs. You're out in public. You smile politely at people walking past as if to say "don't worry I promise it's not COVID", but at this stage you're not so sure. Is this COVID? Surely not again. From there, the cough progresses.Mine developed into the kind of dry cough where you can't quite catch your breath. That night I laid in bed coughing all night long and probably only slept for an hour or two. But I'm also in my third trimester of pregnancy, so that's not entirely unusual. After two days of this cough, a splitting headache, fevers (at least I think it was a fever... again, when you're pregnant you're running pretty hot anyway) and general fatigue, I booked in to see my GP. I did a COVID test before I left for my appointment, as I'd been doing for the last few days, and still it was reading negative. At the appointment, he did a swab and told me to keep up the fluids, rest, and clarified what medication I could and couldn't take. In short, Panadol is just about all you're allowed. In the early hours of the next morning, as I lay in bed in a cold sweat, coughing so hard I thought I might break a rib, I received my results. I indeed had COVID for a second time. And I also had Influenza B. I had somehow managed to contract both at once – as if being 33 weeks pregnant wasn't hard enough.

Post continues after video. Video via Mamamia. During 2020 and 2021, when much of Australia was locked down for the winter months to curb the spread of COVID, cases of influenza dropped dramatically. But then came 2022. Our approach to mask-wearing, hand sanitising and isolating when sick became increasingly lax, and while it wasn't the first season people began contracting the flu and COVID at the same time, it certainly became more widespread. My doctor prescribed an antiviral medication used to treat influenza A and influenza B, which if taken in the first 48 hours, can make the symptoms less severe and can shorten recovery time by a day or two. But my symptoms were about to get a lot worse.The cough became more chesty, sinus pain seemed to fill my whole head, I had a sore throat and my eyes were stinging so I couldn't read or watch anything. Interestingly, however, the worst symptom was the insomnia. And I don't mean I had a bit of trouble sleeping. I mean for seven nights I didn't go to sleep until about five in the morning, where I'd manage to sleep for little windows at a time. I probably got three, maybe four hours of sleep all up a night. I vaguely remembered this from the first time I got COVID. Again, this feature was part of a very fun game called 'is this symptom the result of COVID, pregnancy or the flu?'. ADVERTISEMENT Apart from being miserable and really unwell, I was also anxious. Contracting influenza and COVID at the same time put me at a higher risk of additional infections, like pneumonia. It also meant my immune system was taking a beating at a time when I was already (as any pregnant person would know) rundown. Some research from overseas also suggests a COVID-19 diagnosis during pregnancy can increase the likelihood of premature birth, although my midwife assured me this wasn't something they'd observed in their practice, and to just make sure I'm keeping an eye on my baby's movements and anything unusual. Despite how awful I was feeling, my baby seemed to be living her best life. She was moving as much as usual, and ensuring that whenever I almost did get to sleep, she gave my bladder a good kick to wake me up. My midwife reminded me that while I was sick, my baby wasn't. She was very much protected, and hopefully, she'd be born with a bunch of antibodies. But I keep thinking back to that cough.You see, when I got home that day, I instinctively took a COVID test, and when it was negative I thought "nothing to worry about". I was, I'm ashamed to admit, considering going to work the next day. ADVERTISEMENT When I got those results from my GP, he was clear that it wasn't the COVID he was so much worried about, but rather the influenza. That was the infection that required more urgent treatment. After three years of living in the shadow of COVID, many of us are still living with a pandemic mindset. Testing positive to COVID means isolation for five days. Plans cancelled. You've been red-carded. With influenza, because there aren't at-home tests, and most of us might not end up at the doctor for a swab, we just go about our lives, waiting for the cough to clear up. Still, there is more power in saying "sorry, I can't, COVID", than there is in saying "sorry, I can't, the flu", when the latter can do a whole lot more damage. After eight days, I finally feel like I've turned a corner. The cough has mostly subsided, the sinus pain has passed, and really I just have a runny nose. But one thing I'm sure of is that you do not want the flu and COVID at the same time. It's so bad. If you've got a cough, a fever, a sore throat, stay at home. You don't need a positive COVID test to get you permission. Image: Supplied.Calling all internet users! Take our survey now and go in the running to win a $100 gift voucher!

Photo: ShutterstockHealthLearning from COVID-19: Here’s what is needed to prepare for the next global health emergencyA new pandemic may already be on the horizon as highly pathogenic avian influenza is raising growing alarmJulianne Piper, Kelley LeePublished on: 15 May 2023, 3:55 amCopiedWhen the World Health Organization formally declared an end to the COVID-19 pandemic’s designation as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), it may seem to have had little, if any, perceivable impact on the daily lives of most people.However, it would be a mistake to assume that this is a mere formality.A PHEIC, like the one adopted for COVID-19 on Jan. 30, 2020, is declared if a public health event is determined to constitute: an extraordinary event; a public health risk to other states through the international spread and potentially requiring a co-ordinated international response. Under the International Health Regulations (IHR) — a legally-binding agreement which commits governments to certain actions when responding to the international spread of disease — the declaration of a PHEIC permits the WHO to issue temporary recommendations to national governments to support a co-ordinated and effective global response to such events. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, talks to the media at WHO headquarters in Geneva on Jan. 30, 2020, the day COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency or international concern. Photo: Jean-Christophe Bott/Keystone via APA PHEIC means the WHO is sounding the loudest possible alarm to national governments to act together with urgency. A total of seven PHEICS have been declared since the IHR took effect in 2007: H1N1, Ebola, Polio, a second Ebola outbreak, Zika, COVID-19 and Mpox.However, the heightened state of emergency under a PHEIC is not meant to be sustained indefinitely. The recommendations are temporary and require review every three months.Significance of the end of the COVID-19 PHEICThe lifting of PHEIC status for COVID-19 is significant for two reasons.First, ending the emergency stands down the WHO’s formal authority to guide national COVID-19 policies. While the acute phase of the pandemic appears to have passed, this must still be balanced with continued response efforts aligned with the ongoing risk posed by the ever-evolving SARS-CoV-2.Moreover, the phrase “no one is safe until everyone is safe” may have become a familiar tagline during the pandemic. Yet, many people, mostly in low- and middle-income countries, still struggle to access COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics and treatments.Others, such as the immuno-compromised, remain subject to severe health outcomes.With the impact of COVID-19 continuing to disproportionately affect vulnerable populations worldwide, the pandemic remains far from over.Second, the standing down of the PHEIC declaration is accompanied by an understandable desire — and necessity — to “move on” from COVID-19 after three difficult years. Many high-income countries have been steadily returning to pre-COVID-19 life. While the acute phase of the pandemic appears to have passed, this must still be balanced with continued response efforts aligned with the ongoing risk posed by the ever-evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus. Photo: ShutterstockHowever, the critical and challenging process of learning lessons from the pandemic — let alone addressing the shortcomings in the global response to COVID-19 — has just begun.Governments must ensure that “moving on” does not mean losing the opportunity to capture critical insights that will determine the effectiveness of future pandemic preparedness and response.Perhaps the biggest lessons has been the failure of countries to co-ordinate on many aspects of the global COVID-19 response, such as access to vaccines and use of travel measures. The lack of real-world authority by the WHO to enforce the legally binding IHR has become abundantly clear.Global co-ordination fell shortThe Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, convened by the WHO to review the global response to the pandemic, characterized February 2020 as a “lost month” due to the overwhelming inaction of many countries after the PHEIC was declared.Governments eventually began to take emergency action but only after the WHO made the strategic decision in March 2020 to declare COVID-19 a pandemic. Still, what ensued fell far short of a co-ordinated global effort.The need for collective action during global public health emergencies like COVID-19 has only been reinforced by the past three years. Our research on the use of travel measures in response to COVID-19 has identified key policy areas where improving effectiveness depends on how willing countries are to act in a co-ordinated way.For example, the chaos caused by varied and changing use of travel measures was due in part to the lack of an agreed risk-based approach. Among those that applied risk analysis, how risk was defined and approached varied substantially.Additionally, travel measures implemented in response to COVID-19 and in previous PHEICs, fell inequitably upon different population groups. Further research is needed to understand and mitigate unfair impacts.Once again, better risk-based public health responses with more equitable outcomes will require countries to renew their commitment to work together.If future co-ordination efforts are to be successful, governments must begin by understanding and addressing the shortcomings of existing legal frameworks, including the PHEIC and IHR.Towards this end, WHO member states have begun simultaneous negotiation of IHR amendments, alongside a new pandemic legal instrument.Previous outbreaks of concern, notably SARS-CoV-1 and H1N1, initially prompted new attention and investments in pandemic preparedness. However, these efforts were not sufficiently sustained.Whether and to what extent current efforts will compel countries to act in the collective interest is the crux of the issue.Meanwhile, a new pandemic may already be on the horizon as the global and interspecies spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza is raising growing alarm.The adoption and now lifting of the PHEIC declaration during the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governments in between, offer clear lessons if the world is willing to learn them.Julianne Piper, Research Fellow, Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University and Kelley Lee, Professor and Canada Research Chair in Global Health Governance; Scientific Director, Pacific Institute on Pathogens, Pandemics and Society, Simon Fraser UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Brazil's chicken exports rose by 27% last year to $9.76 billion as other countries reeled from a global outbreak of the virus, yet the South American country had never registered a case until now.The Brazilian government confirmed the detection of H5N1 subtype of the influenza virus on two birds migrating off the coast of Brazil's southeastern state of Espirito Santo. Brazil's main poultry producing states are in the far south and center-west.The agriculture ministry said that because the cases were detected in wild animals, Brazil's status "as a country free of HPAI" was not affected.Web DevelopmentDjango & PostgreSQL Mastery: Build Professional Web ApplicationsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Basics of Generative AI: Unveiling Tomorrow's InnovationsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program MarketingDigital Marketing Masterclass by Pam MooreBy - Pam Moore, Digital Transformation and Social Media ExpertView Program Web DevelopmentIntermediate Java Mastery: Method, Collections, and BeyondBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program AstrologyVastu Shastra CourseBy - Sachenkumar Rai, Vastu ShashtriView Program Web DevelopmentJavaScript Essentials: Unlock AI-Driven Insights with ChatGPTBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Data ScienceSQL for Data Science along with Data Analytics and Data VisualizationBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program LeadershipBusiness Storytelling MasterclassBy - Ameen Haque, Founder of StorywallahsView Program FinanceA2Z Of MoneyBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView Program Office ProductivityMastering Microsoft Office: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and 365By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)AI-Powered Python Mastery with Tabnine: Boost Your Coding SkillsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentJava 21 Essentials for Beginners: Build Strong Programming FoundationsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentA Comprehensive ASP.NET Core MVC 6 Project Guide for 2024By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentAdvanced C++ Mastery: OOPs and Template TechniquesBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentMastering Full Stack Development: From Frontend to Backend ExcellenceBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program StrategyESG and Business Sustainability StrategyBy - Vipul Arora, Partner, ESG & Climate Solutions at Sattva Consulting Author I Speaker I Thought LeaderView Program MarketingPerformance Marketing for eCommerce BrandsBy - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara MarketersView Program FinanceFinancial Literacy i.e Lets Crack the Billionaire CodeBy - CA Rahul Gupta, CA with 10+ years of experience and Accounting EducatorView Program Web DevelopmentAdvanced Java Mastery: Object-Oriented Programming TechniquesBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentIntermediate C++ Skills: Master Pointers, Structures and File StreamBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program FinanceA2Z Of Finance: Finance Beginner CourseBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)AI and Analytics based Business StrategyBy - Tanusree De, Managing Director- Accenture Technology Lead, Trustworthy AI Center of Excellence: ATCIView Program Web DevelopmentMaster RESTful APIs with Python and Django REST Framework: Web API DevelopmentBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Miguel Gularte, CEO of Brazil-based BRF, the world's largest chicken exporting company, told a press conference he was not surprised by the case of highly pathogenic avian influenza, adding the company is prepared for any scenario. The executive reiterated WOAH's recommendations that no members of that organisation impose import bans because of cases detected in wild animals.BRF's Gularte also noted the company relies on Brazil’s "robust" animal health services to prevent and contain any potential threats to industrial poultry farms.Brazil's main importers of chicken products in April included China, Japan, South Africa and Saudi Arabia.China has banned imports of poultry from nearly 40 U.S. states due to outbreaks of bird flu on commercial poultry farms.Brazil's neighbor Argentina suspended its poultry exports in late February after recording the first case of bird flu in its poultry industry in southern Rio Negro province but resumed exports from bird flu free areas in late March.A record number of chicken, turkeys and other birds have died in outbreaks in the United States, Europe and Britain, and the virus is spreading in South America, Africa, and Asia. Losses of poultry flocks have contributed to record high prices for eggs and turkey meat in some places.While humans can contract H5N1, cases remain very rare, and global health officials have said the risk of transmission between humans is low.Nominations for ET MSME Awards are now open.

They may have mild breathing problems. These signs can indicate bird flu, but the avian influenza virus can only be confirmed through laboratory tests.– Is bird flu a risk to humans?The advice from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is that the risk to public health from the virus is very low. People are advised not to touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds that they find.Strict rules brought in under the avian influenza prevention zone will still apply (Joe Giddens/PA)– What measures have been in place?A “mandatory housing order” for England and Wales was lifted on April 18, meaning poultry and captive birds could be kept outside again.Bird keepers had been subject to a national housing order since November 7 to help curb an unprecedented number of bird flu cases – more than 330 had been confirmed in the UK since October 2021.The Government said poultry and other captive birds could be kept outside again unless they were in a specified protection zone.– Is the virus still circulating in the environment? In April, Dr Christine Middlemiss, the UK’s chief veterinary officer, said the risk of bird flu infection had reduced following restrictive measures throughout the winter, although bird keepers were encouraged to observe “stringent standards of biosecurity”.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the strict rules brought in under the avian influenza prevention zone will still apply, as the virus may still be circulating in the environment for several more weeks.Places with poor biosecurity had been assessed as medium risk of infection and those with good biosecurity are seen as low risk.Sorry, we are not accepting comments on this article.Similar storiesWhat the papers say – November 12UK News|Just nowJohn Smyth QC abuse survivor calls for ‘clean sweep’ of Church of EnglandUK News|1 hour agoLandowners warn of huge tax on profits due to farm inheritance changesUK News|2 hours agoSmell of rat urine ‘overpowering’ at squalid and failing prison, says watchdogUK News|2 hours agoParents face higher nursery fees due to national insurance hike, charity warnsUK News|2 hours agoMost popular1‘My Guernsey-born great-uncle deserves the Victoria Cross’News|19 hours ago2Big projects at risk as P&R starts mini-BudgetNews|19 hours ago3John Smyth QC abuse survivor calls for ‘clean sweep’ of Church of EnglandUK News|1 hour ago4Rotten eggs put in appeal collection binNews|Nov 10Follow us onGet involvedSend Us Your NewsSubscribe to the Guernsey PressUseful linksAdvertise with usMaking a complaintGuernsey AirportGuernsey HarboursAbout the websiteAbout usContact usTerms of website usePrivacy PolicyAcceptable Use PolicyHomepageFollow us onTwitterFacebook Back to top© 2024 Guernsey Press.

Neither experienced any symptoms of avian influenza and both have since tested negative. Detection of avian influenza in poultry workers can follow contamination of the nose and throat from breathing in material on the affected farm or can be true infection. It can be difficult to distinguish these in people who have no symptoms. Based on the timing of exposures and test results, one person is likely to have had contamination of the nose and or throat from material inhaled on the farm, while for the second it is more difficult to determine which is the case. Further investigation is underway but meanwhile precautionary contact tracing has been undertaken for the second individual. The UKHSA has not detected evidence of human-to-human transmission. “Current evidence suggests that the avian influenza viruses we’re seeing circulating in birds around the world do not spread easily to people,” said Professor Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor at the UKHSA. “However, we know already that the virus can spread to people following close contact with infected birds and this is why, through screening programmes like this one, we are monitoring people who have been exposed to learn more about this risk. In the asymptomatic surveillance programme, poultry workers are asked to take swabs of their nose and throat which are tested for the presence of influenza virus, during the 10 days after their exposure. In some cases, they may also be asked to have finger prick blood tests to see if UKHSA can detect antibodies against avian influenza, suggestive of an immune response in the blood. As part of public health response, UKHSA follows up all individuals who have been in contact with a confirmed human case of avian influenza. Share.
