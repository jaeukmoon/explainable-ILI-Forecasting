ACIP Recommendations Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices‎ Prevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — United States, 2024–25 Influenza Season Recommendations Tips to reduce the risk of seasonal flu The single best way to reduce the risk of seasonal flu and its potentially serious complications is to get vaccinated each year, but preventive actions like avoiding people who are sick, covering your cough and washing your hands also can help stop the spread of germs and prevent respiratory illnesses like flu. This also can include taking steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces. Preventing Respiratory Viruses Core strategies can help prevent the spread of viruses that cause common respiratory illnesses. Feb. 29, 2024 Flu: What To Do If You Get Sick Guide on what to do if you are sick Aug. 2, 2024 These tips will help you learn about actions you can take to protect yourself and others from flu and help stop the spread of germs. Avoid close contact. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. When you are sick, keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick, too. Putting physical distance between yourself and others can help lower the risk of spreading a respiratory virus. Stay home when you are sick. If possible, stay home from work, school, and errands when you're sick. You can go back to your normal activities when, for at least 24 hours, both are true: Your symptoms are getting better overall, and You have not had a fever (and are not using fever-reducing medication1). After these two criteria are met, there are some additional precautions that can be taken to protect others from respiratory illness. Cover your mouth and nose. Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick. Influenza viruses are thought to spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. Wearing a mask is an additional prevention strategy that you can choose to do to further protect yourself and others. When worn by a person with an infection, masks reduce the spread of the virus to others. Masks can also protect wearers from breathing in infectious particles from people around them. Clean your hands.Washing your hands often will help protect you from germs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub. Handwashing: Clean Hands Save Lives Tips on hand washing and using alcohol-based hand sanitizers Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.Germs can be spread when a person touches something that is contaminated with germs and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth. Take steps for cleaner air.You can improve air quality by bringing in fresh outside air, purifying indoor air or gathering outdoors. Cleaner air can reduce the risk of exposure to viruses. Practice good hygiene and other healthy habits.Cleaning frequently touched surfaces, such as countertops, handrails, and doorknobs regularly can help prevent the spread of some illnesses. Also, get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food. Preventing Spread of Respiratory Viruses When You're Sick Take steps to protect others while you are sick and when you start to feel better. Feb. 29, 2024 Flu: What To Do If You Get Sick Guide on what to do if you are sick Aug. 2, 2024 Get Vaccinated‎ Seasonal flu vaccines protect against the three influenza viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season. There are several flu vaccine options this flu season. The tips and resources below will help you learn about additional actions you can take to protect yourself and others from flu and help stop the spread of germs. Different Types of Flu Vaccines Preventing Flu at School Find out about plans your child's school, childcare program, and/or college has if an outbreak of flu or another illness occurs and whether flu vaccinations are offered on-site. Ask your child's school, childcare program, and/or college about whether they routinely clean frequently touched objects and surfaces, and whether they have a good supply of tissues, soap, paper towels, alcohol-based hand rubs, and disposable wipes on-site. Also ask your child's school, childcare program, and/or college about whether they take steps for cleaner air. Ask how sick students and staff are separated from others and who will care for them until they can go home, and about the absentee policy for sick students and staff. Preventing Flu at Work Find out about your employer's plans if an outbreak of flu or another illness occurs and whether flu vaccinations are offered on-site. Routinely clean frequently touched objects and surfaces, including doorknobs, keyboards, and phones, to help remove germs. Make sure your workplace has an adequate supply of tissues, soap, paper towels, alcohol-based hand rubs, and disposable wipes. Train others on how to do your job so they can cover for you in case you or a family member gets sick and you have to stay home. If you begin to feel sick while at work, go home as soon as possible. Did you know?‎ Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), are actions – apart from getting vaccinated or taking medicine – that people and communities can take to help slow the spread of illnesses like flu.

Here we profiled blood and draining lymph node (LN) samples from human volunteers for over 2 years after two influenza vaccines were administered 1 year apart to define the evolution of the CD4+ TFH cell response. The first vaccination induced an increase in the frequency of circulating TFH (cTFH) and LN TFH cells at week 1 postvaccination. This increase was transient for cTFH cells, whereas the LN TFH cells further expanded during week 2 and remained elevated in frequency for at least 3 months. We observed several distinct subsets of TFH cells in the LN, including pre-TFH cells, memory TFH cells, germinal center (GC) TFH cells and interleukin-10+ TFH cell subsets beginning at baseline and at all time points postvaccination. The shift toward a GC TFH cell phenotype occurred with faster kinetics after the second vaccine compared to the first vaccine. We identified several influenza-specific TFH cell clonal lineages, including multiple responses targeting internal influenza virus proteins, and found that each TFH cell state was attainable within a clonal lineage. Thus, human TFH cells form a durable and dynamic multitissue network. Similar content being viewed by others PD-1 directed immunotherapy alters Tfh and humoral immune responses to seasonal influenza vaccine Article 28 July 2022 Stepwise differentiation of follicular helper T cells reveals distinct developmental and functional states Article Open access 24 November 2023 Continually recruited naïve T cells contribute to the follicular helper and regulatory T cell pools in germinal centers Article Open access 31 October 2023 MainNeutralizing antibodies against influenza viruses represent a key correlate of protection and the goal of vaccination. High-affinity antibodies are generated by activated B cells in germinal centers (GCs) located in secondary lymphoid organs. Mature CD4+ T follicular helper cells (hereafter TFH cells) home to GCs and support GC B cells through the production of cytokines and direct costimulatory molecule signaling through T–B cell contact1. While baseline frequencies of circulating TFH cells (cTFH cells) in peripheral blood are typically low2,3, the expansion of cTFH cells in response to vaccination is correlated with increased B cell activation and, consequently, increased antibody titers4,5,6. A diverse polyfunctional T cell response, including cTFH cells, is correlated with protection against symptomatic infection independent of serology5. Considering their influence on humoral immune response quality, a better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate TFH cell responses to vaccination is necessary for designing improved vaccine platforms.TFH cells display substantial phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity across location and time. CD4+ TH1 cell-like CXCR3+CXCR5loPD-1lo cTFH cells have impaired capacity to help B cells compared to CXCR3− cTFH cells, which more closely resemble GC TFH cells6,7,8. As cTFH cells are replenished by GC TFH cells that egress the secondary lymphoid organs, cells from both compartments display substantial overlap in core gene expression programs and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires3,9,10,11. The trajectory of simultaneous TFH cell differentiation and maturation in secondary lymphoid organs and peripheral blood in humans following influenza vaccination has not been tracked over time. Previous characterization of GC B cell responses following influenza vaccination, performed by serial sampling of lymph nodes (LNs) and blood from human volunteers, indicated vaccine-specific B cells enter and persist in GCs for months while undergoing somatic hypermutation (SHM)12.Here we characterized the phenotype and kinetics of TFH cells in the LN (hereafter LN TFH cells) and cTFH cells in five donors over the course of 2 years following two seasonal influenza vaccinations. In year 1, we observed a transient increase in cTFH cell frequencies in the blood during the first 2 weeks postvaccination, while LN TFH cells clonally expanded and slowly matured into IL21+CXCL13+ GC TFH cells. However, redifferentiation and cytokine production by GC TFH cells in year 2 postvaccination were more rapid. Furthermore, we observed the emergence of interleukin (IL)-10+ TFH cells13,14, characterized by a unique transcriptional profile, by 2 months postvaccination in year 1. Together, our data present a spatiotemporal view of TFH cell phenotype and repertoire dynamics following influenza vaccination.ResultsInfluenza vaccination mobilizes human TFH cell responsesCohort 1 contained five healthy adults (five males, 26–40 years old, referred to as 321-04, 321-05, 321-07, 321-08 and 321-11) enrolled in WU321 (ref. 12), a multiyear seasonal influenza vaccination study at Washington University, who had not received a seasonal influenza vaccine for at least 3 years before enrollment. Donors were first administered the 2018–2019 Northern Hemisphere seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) in year 1 (hereafter year 1), then the 2019–2020 seasonal QIV in year 2 (hereafter year 2). LN samples were collected before year 1 vaccination (D0_Y1), on day 5 after year 1 vaccination (D5_Y1), D12_Y1, D120_Y1, D0_Y2, D14_Y2, D60_Y2, D90_Y2 (321-04), D26_Y1 (321-07), D12_Y1 (321-08), D7_Y2, D28_Y2, D60_Y2, D120_Y2 (321-05) and D6_Y1, D18_Y1, D21_Y1, D35_Y1 (321-11). Blood samples were taken at D5_Y1 (321-07 and 321-08) and D120_Y1 (321-05). Paired blood and LN samples were collected at D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D180_Y1 and D0_Y2 (321-05; Fig. 1a). Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and LN samples from year 1 for 321-05 showed that the frequency of CXCR5+CD38+ cTFH cells among CD4+ T cells in the blood was low (0.16%) before vaccination, expanded fourfold at D5_Y1, then contracted to baseline at D28_Y1 (Fig. 1b,d and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). A similar transient increase in cTFH cell frequency was observed at D5_Y1 in 321-04 (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Expression of the activation markers ICOS and CD71 on cTFH cells peaked at D5_Y1 for 321-05 (Fig. 1c). The frequency of LN CXCR5+PD-1hi TFH cells in 321-05 began to increase at D5_Y1 and D60_Y1 before contracting at D90_Y1 and D180_Y1 (Fig. 1d). CXCR5+PD-1hi LN TFH cells expressed high levels of the TFH master transcription factor BCL6 across year 1 (Fig. 1e). The frequency of CD19+IgDloCD20hiCD38int GC B cells in the LN peaked and remained elevated from D28_Y1 to D90_Y1, coinciding with the peak in LN TFH cell frequency (Fig. 1f). Similarly, 321-04 showed an accumulation of LN TFH cells coinciding with increased GC B cells in the LN beginning at D5_Y1, which increased at D60_Y1, and peaked at D120_Y1 (Extended Data Fig. 1d).Fig. 1: Influenza vaccination stimulates a CD4+ TFH cell response in blood and LN of humans.a, Schematic representation indicating the time points of PBMC (D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1 and D120_Y1) and LN (D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D26_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D120_Y1, D180_Y1, D0_Y2, D7_Y2, D14_Y2, D28_Y2, D60_Y2, D90_Y2 and D120_Y2) samples in five donors (321-04, 321-05, 321-07, 321-08 and 321-11) postvaccination with Flucelvax QIV on D0_Y1 (2018–2019 season) and D0_Y2 (2019–2020 season) 1 year apart. b, Representative flow cytometry plots of circulating CXCR5+CD38+ TFH cells (cTFH cells) in PBMCs from donor 321-05 at D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D120_Y1 and D180_Y1, gated on CD45+CD14−CD19−CD3+CD4+ cells. c, Frequency of ICOS+CD71+ cTFH cells in PBMCs from donor 321-05 at D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D120_Y1 and D180_Y1, gated on CXCR5+CD38+ TFH cells as in b. d, Representative flow cytometry plots of CXCR5+PD-1+ LN TFH cells in donor 321-05 at D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D120_Y1 and D180_Y1, gated on CD14−CD19−CD4+ T cells. e, Frequency of CD27+BCL6+ LN TFH cells in 321-05 at D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D120_Y1 and D180_Y1, gated on CXCR5+PD-1+ TFH cells as in d. f, Frequency of cTFH, LN TFH and CD19+IgDloCD20hiCD38int LN GC B cells in 321-05 at D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D120_Y1 and D180_Y1. Shown as a percent of total CD4+ T cells or CD19+ B cells on log10 scale.Full size imageTo characterize changes in T cell phenotypes elicited by repeated influenza vaccination, we performed single-cell gene expression (scGEX) and TCR sequencing on immune cells in all PBMC and LN samples from 321-04, 321-05 (except for the LN sample D120_Y1), 321-07 and 321-08 (Supplementary Table 1). The total T cell dataset comprised 154,109 cells and covered 127,329 unique TCR clonotypes grouped into 21 clusters (C0–C20) based on transcriptional similarities (Fig. 2a). Each cluster was categorized broadly into CCR7hiSELLhi CD4+ (C0, C3, C18 and C12) and CD8+ (C5) naive T cells (TN cells), CCR7loSELLloKLRG1+ effector (TE) or memory (TM) CD4+ (C1, C2, C6, C7, C9, C10, C14, C16 and C18) and CD8+ (C4, C11, C13, C15, C17 and C20) T cells (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Another CCR7loSELLloKLRG1+ cluster of CD4+ T cells (C14) containing cells from all donors expressed markers consistent with TFH (PDCD1, CXCR5, ICOS, TOX2 and IL21) and CD4+ regulatory T cells (FOXP3; herein called Treg; Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Comparing clone size distributions across GEX clusters showed TN cells had few clones with more than one cell, whereas the clusters containing CD8+ or CD4+ TE, TM, TFH and Treg cells showed a high degree of clonal expansion (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). Overall, the total T cell dataset deeply profiled the LN and blood T cell phenotypes of four donors following influenza vaccination.Fig. 2: scGEX and TCR profiling capture diverse T cell phenotypes in blood and LN after influenza vaccination.a, UMAP projection of the total T cell dataset generated from the PBMC (at D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1 and D120_Y1) and LN (at D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D26_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D120_Y1, D180_Y1, D0_Y2, D7_Y2, D14_Y2, D28_Y2, D60_Y2, D90_Y2 and D120_Y2) samples from donors 321-04, 321-05, 321-07 and 321-08 annotated by GEX cluster (n = 154,109 cells with 127,329 unique TCR clonotypes). b, UMAP projection of the total T cell dataset annotated by T cell phenotype as CCR7hiSELLhi TN, CCR7loSELLloKLRG1+ TE cells or TM cells or PDCD1+CXCR5+ TFH or FOXP3+ Treg cells. c, Feature plots displaying distinguishing T cell markers in the total T cell dataset.Full size imageInfluenza vaccination induces diverse phenotypes in TFH cellsWe next separated TFH cells from the total T cell dataset to more closely examine their phenotypes. Because CD4+ TH cells can differentiate into multiple subsets within clonal lineages that stem from a single founder15, we made a subset of all cells in the dataset with TCR sequences matching CD4+ T cells in the TFH/Treg cell cluster (C14; Fig. 2a,b). We also included 250 naive CD4+ T cells from clusters C0 and C3 (Fig. 2a) with 250 cells from LN and PBMCs (500 total; hereafter TN cells) as controls. This strategy yielded 6,109 CD4+ T cells with 4,418 unique TCR clonotypes (Supplementary Table 2), henceforth referred to as the TFH/Treg subset. Reclustering this subset, we discovered 13 scGEX clusters (K0–K12), with ‘donor’ accounting for much of the scGEX variation (Fig. 3a,b). Most cells in the TFH/Treg subset (excluding CD4+ TN cells) were from the LNs (4,737), while 539 cells were from the blood (Fig. 3c), indicating that our approach captured both the cTFH and LN TFH cell populations and their clonal relations. In addition to ‘donor’, scGEX varied substantially across time points and was roughly partitioned into early (D0_Y1–D28_Y1), middle (D60_Y1–D0_Y2) and late (D5_Y2–D120_Y2) time points in the projection (Fig. 3d). Because the single-cell dataset also contained LN B cells12, we looked for correlations between the frequency of LN TFH cells and LN B cell subsets. While we found no relationship between the frequency of TFH and plasmablasts, naive, resting memory or activated B cell subsets (markers defined in Methods) in the LN at matched time points, there was a significant positive correlation between the frequencies of TFH and the GC B cell subset (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b).Fig. 3: Influenza vaccination stimulates the differentiation of distinct TFH cell subsets.a–d, UMAP projections of the TFH/Treg subset annotated by scGEX cluster (a), donor (b), tissue (c) and time postimmunization (d) in a subset of the total T cell dataset in Fig. 2 that contained all cells clonally related to those in the TFH/Treg cell cluster C14 from the PBMC and LN of all donors (n = 6,109 cells with 4,418 unique TCR clonotypes). e, UMAP projection of the TFH/Treg subset annotated as CCR7loCXCR5loPDCD1loICOS+ pre-TFH/mem-TFH cells, CCR7−CXCR5hiPDCD1hiICOS+ GC TFH cells, CCR7−CXCR5hiPDCD1hiICOS+LAG3+ IL-10+ TFH cells, FOXP3+ Treg cells, MKI67+ cycling cells or CCR7+CD4+ TN cells. f, Dot plot of select TFH cell and Treg cell subset-specific markers in TFH/Treg subset grouped by each subset (excluding cycling) defined in e. g,h, Reclustering and feature plots of CCR7loCXCR5loPDCD1loICOS+ pre-TFH/mem-TFH cells (g) and CCR7−CXCR5hiPDCD1hiICOS+ GC TFH cells (h) displaying marker genes associated with scGEX clusters within the pre-TFH/mem-TFH and GC TFH cells.Full size imageDifferentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis across TFH cell clusters indicated that clusters K1, K5, K7 and K8 had scGEX profiles characteristic of mature GC TFH cells (CXCR5, PDCD1 and IL21), while clusters K3, K10 and K12 expressed genes consistent with the early and memory stages of TFH cell differentiation (KLF2 and CCR7; Extended Data Fig. 3c). Cluster K6 expressed IL10 and was consistent with IL-10+ TFH cells (Extended Data Fig. 3c)13,14. Clusters K2 and K9 corresponded to FOXP3+ Treg cells, while clusters K0 and K11 corresponded to CD4+ TN cells and cycling cells, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Therefore, we classified each of the TFH cell clusters as either CCR7loCXCR5loPDCD1loICOS+ pre-TFH/mem-TFH cells, CCR7−CXCR5hiPDCD1hiICOS+ GC TFH cells, CCR7−CXCR5hiPDCD1hiICOS+LAG3+ IL-10+ TFH cells, FOXP3+ Treg cells, MKI67+ cycling cells or CD4+ TN cells (Fig. 3e). Compared to TN, GC TFH cells had increased expression of TOX2 (ref. 16) and CXCL13 (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 3d). Top DEGs in pre-TFH/mem-TFH cells were associated with adhesion and cytoskeletal rearrangement, including VIM, EMP3 and TMSB10, as well as KLF2, a negative regulator of TFH differentiation17 (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 3d). Pre-TFH/mem-TFH and GC TFH cells had high expression of TCF7, which promotes TFH cell differentiation via suppression of TH1 cell-promoting transcription factor PRDM1 (ref. 18), and low expression of PRDM1 (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 3d). In contrast, IL-10+ TFH cells expressed low levels of TCF7 and high levels of PRDM1 (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 3d). We then compared the human TFH cell subsets with mouse transitional and mature GC TFH cell subsets by scoring DEGs characteristic of these subsets across human TFH subsets19,20. We found that the mouse mature GC TFH module scores were highest in the human GC TFH and IL-10+ TFH cells and lowest in the CD4+ TN cells, while pre-TFH/mem-TFH cells were in the middle (Extended Data Fig. 3e), indicating they aligned with the mouse transitional GC TFH cells.Reclustering of the pre-TFH/mem-TFH cell subset identified ten subclusters (m0–m9) that improved the resolution between the pre-TFH and mem-TFH cells (Fig. 3g). Clusters m6 and m7 had high expression of CCR7 and CD27 and moderate expression of PDCD1 and BCL6 (Fig. 3g), corresponding to the mem-TFH cells. CXCR3+CCR6−TBX21+ TH1-like in pre-TFH cell clusters m0 and m4 and CXCR3−CCR6+RORC+ TH17-like in pre-TFH cluster m2 aligned well with previously defined CXCR3+ cTFH and CCR6+ pre-TFH cell subsets (Fig. 3g). Similarly, ten subclusters of GC TFH cells (g0–g9) that expressed BCL6 and TOX2 were identified after reclustering (Fig. 3h). Clusters g3 and g6 coexpressed CXCL13 and IL21, while cluster g5 coexpressed IL4 and IL21 (Fig. 3h). The inhibitory coreceptors LAG3 and TNFRSF18 were expressed in clusters g1–g6, g8 and g9 (Fig. 3h). Cluster g0 expressed PVALB but lacked expression of CXCL13, IL21 and signaling molecules associated with mature GC TFH cells (MAP3K8, DUSP4 and GNG4; Fig. 3h).Next, we conducted pathway enrichment analysis to identify Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes enriched in Treg and TFH cell subsets (Fig. 4a). GC TFH cells showed upregulation of genes related to the electron transport chain (ETC; Fig. 4a). IL-10+ TFH and Treg cells shared enrichment in cytokine signaling and regulation of apoptosis pathways (Fig. 4a). Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was performed to look at the variation of these pathways over time in LN TFH cells for 321-05 and 321-04. In 321-05, pathways associated with T cell activation and cytokine signaling increased between D0_Y1 and D60_Y1 before decreasing to baseline by D0_Y2 (Fig. 4b). ETC pathways were sharply upregulated at D60_Y1 and D90_Y1 before decreasing at D180_Y1 (Fig. 4b). Compared to year 1, the ETC module was upregulated at D28_Y2 and remained elevated at D60_Y2 and D120_Y2 (Fig. 4b). Similar kinetics in these pathways were detected in 321-04, although the ETC was elevated on D0_Y1 and displayed kinetics during year 2 like those of 321-05 during year 1 (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Overall, influenza vaccination stimulated subset-specific changes in the transcriptional profiles related to cell migration, activation and metabolism of LN TFH cells.Fig. 4: Influenza vaccination alters TFH cell metabolism and signaling with time.a, Enrichr analysis showing enriched GO biological processes in using LN pre-TFH/mem-TFH, IL-10+ TFH, GC TFH and Treg cells from the TFH/Treg subset from donors 321-04 and 321-05 at time points D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D120_Y1, D180_Y1, D0_Y2, D7_Y2, D14_Y2, D28_Y2, D60_Y2, D90_Y2 and D120_Y2. Marker DEGs for the four subsets were redefined by comparing them against the global background of subsetted LN pre-TFH/mem-TFH, GC TFH, IL-10+ TFH and Treg cells included in the analysis. b, GSVA across D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D180_Y1, D0_Y2, D7_Y2, D28_Y2, D60_Y2 and D120_Y2 in LN TFH cells from donor 321-05 (excluding Treg cells) for top TFH cell-specific GO terms for a.Full size imageInfluenza vaccination stimulates a dynamic TFH cell responseNext, we assessed changes in the subset composition for LN TFH cells over the entire time course in 321-04 and 321-05. In 321-05, pre-TFH/mem-TFH cells represented the largest fraction (1.2% of CD4+ T cells in LN), followed by Treg cells (0.86%), GC TFH cells (0.65%) and a few IL-10+ TFH cells (0.19%) at D0_Y1 (Fig. 5a). The GC TFH cell frequency increased sixfold (3.86%) at D12_Y1, peaked at D60_Y1 (4.18%) and declined to a similar frequency as D0_Y1 by D180_Y1 (1.05%; Fig. 5a). The IL-10+ TFH cell frequency increased at D12_Y1 (1.79%), declined at D28_Y1 (0.30%) and D60_Y1 (0.67%) and again increased to 1.3% at D90_Y1 (Fig. 5a). Treg frequency increased at D5_Y1 (1.07%) and D60_Y1 (1.15%), before returning to baseline by D180_Y1 (1.09%), and varied little during year 2 (1.1–2.5%; Fig. 5a). Pre-TFH/mem-TFH cells were also the predominant subset (0.94%) at the time of revaccination on D0_Y2 (Fig. 5a). GC TFH cells expanded threefold between D0_Y2 and D7_Y2 (0.63–2.12%) and remained elevated out to D120_Y2 (4.24%; Fig. 5a), while IL-10+ TFH cell frequency increased threefold between D7_Y2 and D28_Y2 (0.23–0.85%) and remained elevated out to D120_Y2 (0.88%; Fig. 5a). In 321-04, the frequency of GC TFH cells (1.75%) was over twofold higher than pre-TFH/mem-TFH cells (0.75%) on D0_Y1 (Extended Data Fig. 5a). IL-10+ TFH cell frequency increased fourfold at D5_Y1 (0.95%) and 15-fold at the peak time D120_Y1 (3.13%; Extended Data Fig. 5a). Treg cell frequency increased from D0_Y1 to D5_Y1 (0.53% and 1.23%) and remained elevated through D120_Y1 (1.73%; Extended Data Fig. 5a). The frequency of GC TFH cells (14.47%), IL-10+ TFH cells (3.13%) and GC B cells (21.96%) each peaked at D120_Y1 (Extended Data Fig. 5a). During year 2, the frequencies of pre-TFH/mem-TFH, GC TFH and GC B cells increased between D0_Y2 (1.12%, 0.81% and 0.47%) and D14_Y2 (2.15%, 2.67% and 5.90%; Extended Data Fig. 5a). Frequencies of GC TFH cells, IL-10+ TFH cells and GC B cells further increased between D14_Y2 and D60_Y2 (7.35%, 1.94% and 20.9%) and decreased at D90_Y2 (4.50%, 0.81% and 5.53%; Extended Data Fig. 5a).Fig. 5: Influenza vaccination elicits dynamic alterations in TFH cell composition.a, Relative frequency of LN GC TFH cell, GC B cells, IL-10+ TFH cells, pre-TFH/mem-TFH cell and Treg cell subsets in donor 321-05 at time points D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D180_Y1, D0_Y2, D7_Y2, D28_Y2, D60_Y2 and D120_Y2. b–d, UMAP projections of LN pre-TFH/mem-TFH, GC TFH, IL-10+ TFH and CD4+ TN cells from all donors at D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D26_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D120_Y1, D180_Y1, D0_Y2, D7_Y2, D14_Y2, D28_Y2, D60_Y2, D90_Y2 and D120_Y2 subsetted from the TFH/Treg subset, reclustered and subjected to pseudotime analysis showing calculated pseudotime values with selected root nodes where pseudotime scale was set to zero are indicated by black points on the left side of the projection (b), time points (c) or TFH cell subset (d). n = 4,418 cells. e, Density plots of pseudotime value distributions by TFH cell subset in the division of the TFH/Treg subset defined in b. f, Scatter plot of log10 normalized expression of indicated TFH cell subset marker genes versus pseudotime values per cell in the division of the TFH/Treg subset defined in b. Each dot represents a cell, and the color indicates its assigned TFH cell subset.Full size imageRecall of TM cell responses on re-exposure to antigen enables rapid responses through clonal expansion and/or accelerated redifferentiation into TE cell types. While the sum frequency of all TFH cell subsets in the LN was comparable at D5_Y1 (3.59% of CD4+ T cells) and D7_Y2 (8.70%) for 321-05 (Fig. 5a), we looked for transcriptional differences in LN GC TFH cells between D5_Y1 and D7_Y2, D28_Y1 and D28_Y2 and combined year 1 and combined year 2 time points for 321-05 (Extended Data Fig. 5b). MT-ATP6 and MT-ND3, critical ETC components, were increased in year 2 time points for the combined year 1 and year 2, D28_Y2 versus D28_Y1 and D28_Y1 versus D28_Y2 comparisons (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). In 321-04, IL21 and CXCL13 were upregulated at D5_Y1 and D12_Y1 and at D14_Y2 compared to D0_Y1 or D0_Y2, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 5d). In 321-05, induction of IL21 and CXCL13 occurred at D12_Y1 and continued to rise until the peak at D90_Y1 before decreasing to similar levels as D0_Y1 at D180_Y1 (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Modest levels of IL21 and little CXCL13 were observed at D0_Y2; however, their expression at D7_Y2 had risen to levels comparable to those between D28_Y1 and D90_Y1 (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Overall, GC TFH cells, despite similar overall frequencies, produced higher levels of IL21 and CXCL13 for supporting GC B cell recruitment and proliferation when re-exposed to influenza vaccine in year 2 compared to initial postvaccination responses in year 1.GC TFH cells support the activation and maturation of B cells through SHM. The rate of SHM in IGH chains of QIV-specific B cell clonal lineages in 321-04 and 321-05 at time points postinfluenza vaccination year 1 has been reported12, so we compared the frequency of LN GC TFH cells during the same time points. Here we found that the SHM peak in the QIV-specific B cell lineages aligned with the peak frequency of GC TFH (D60_Y1 and D120_Y1 for 321-05 and 321-04, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 5e).To infer the developmental trajectories of LN TFH cells over the course of the GC response, we performed pseudotime analysis using the LN TFH cells (excluding the Treg cells; Fig. 5b,d). Comparing pseudotime values across TFH cell states showed that the inferred trajectories of the pre-TFH/mem-TFH cells were distributed across early and middle pseudotime (~0 to 20), IL-10+ TFH cells were in middle pseudotime (~12 to 22) and GC TFH cells had the latest pseudotime values (~11 to 30; Fig. 5e). Comparing the expression of marker genes representative of TFH cell subsets relative to pseudotime values indicated that CCR7 expression was highest in the early and middle pseudotime pre-TFH/mem-TFH cells, the GC TFH cell markers PDCD1, PVALB, TOX2 and CXCR5 increased in expression during mid to late pseudotime and IL-10+ TFH cell markers FOXB1 and IL10 were specifically expressed in middle pseudotime (Fig. 5f). These results showed dynamic alterations in the magnitude and phenotypic composition of LN TFH cells in response to influenza vaccination.Influenza vaccine stimulates clonal TFH cell responsesNext, we characterized the TCR repertoires and clonal dynamics of TFH cell responses. In 321-05, the frequency of TFH cells among all T cells in the LN increased between D0_Y1 and D5_Y1 and peaked at D28_Y1 before decreasing to baseline at D90_Y1 (Fig. 6a). In 321-04, TFH cell frequency increased starting at D5_Y1 and peaked at D120_Y1 during year 1 (Fig. 6a). LN TFH cell frequency increased between D0_Y2 and D7_Y2 (321-05) or D14_Y2 (321-04) and remained elevated through D28_Y2 and D120_Y2 (321-05) or D60_Y2 and D90_Y2 (321-04) for year 2 (Fig. 6). TFH cell clonality followed a similar trend as frequency. For 321-05, the peak in TFH cell frequency coincided with their maximum clonality (Methods) at D12_Y1 (Fig. 6b). For 321-04, the clonality of TFH cells increased at D12_Y1 and remained elevated for the remainder of year 1 (Fig. 6b). TFH cell frequency and clonality in both donors contracted at baseline (D0_Y2) but quickly expanded in a clonal manner at D7_Y2 (321-05) and D14_Y2 (321-04), contracted at D28_Y2 and D60_Y2 (321-05) or D60_Y2 (321-04), expanded again to a second peak at D90_Y2 and D120_Y2 for 321-04 and 321-05, respectively (Fig. 5b). TFH cell frequency and clonality were positively correlated across all time points (Fig. 5c).Fig. 6: Influenza vaccination leads to TFH cell clonal expansion.a, Relative frequency of all subsets of TFH cells in LN (TFH/Treg subset excluding Treg and TN cells) from donors 321-04 and 321-05 over D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D120_Y1, D180_Y1, D0_Y2, D7_Y2, D14_Y2, D28_Y2, D60_Y2, D90_Y2 and D120_Y2 time points. b, TCR clonality of all subsets of TFH cells in LN (TFH/Treg subset excluding Treg and TN cells) from donors 321-04 and 321-05 over D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D120_Y1, D180_Y1, D0_Y2, D7_Y2, D14_Y2, D28_Y2, D60_Y2, D90_Y2 and D120_Y2 time points by inverse D50 index. c, Scatter plot comparing the relative frequency and clonality from a and b (n = 20). Correlation analyses were performed using the Pearson correlation metric, and P values were computed using two-sided t test. d, Network graph depicting the connection between TFH cell clonal lineages in PBMCs and LN in donor 321-05 at D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D180_Y1, D0_Y2, D7_Y2, D28_Y2, D60_Y2 and D120_Y2 time points. Node sizes correspond to the number of unique clones, and edge widths correspond to the number of clones connecting each node.Full size imageWe tracked TFH clonotypes across all time points for 321-04 and 321-05, and across LN and blood for 321-05. In 321-05, the number of unique LN TFH cell clonotypes remained low at D0_Y1 (101) and D5_Y1 (170) and expanded on D12_Y1, when the largest number of unique TFH clonotypes was observed (388; Fig. 6d). In 321-05, several of the TFH clones detected in the LN at D12_Y1 were detected in the blood at D0_Y1 (Fig. 6d), indicating that some of the clonotypes engaging in GC reactions were derived from cTFH cells. Many of the TFH clonotypes from D12_Y1 were detected at subsequent time points, particularly at D28_Y1, D60_Y1 and D90_Y1 (Fig. 6d), with fewer detectable by D180_Y1 (Fig. 6d). Very few TFH clonotypes detected in year 1 were detectable on D0_Y2 but were 1-week postsecondary vaccination (D7_Y2) and persisted until D120_Y2 (Fig. 6d). In 321-04, several of the TFH clones detected at D12_Y1 persisted up to D120_Y1, contracted by D0_Y2, were detected again at D14_Y2 and persisted through D90_Y2 (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Shared clonotypes in the PBMCs of 321-07 and 321-08 were detected across D0_Y1 and D5_Y1; however, no clones were shared between the blood and LN TFH compartments in these donors (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c).We performed additional single-cell and bulk TCR-seq on sorted cTFH cells and LN TFH cells from 321-04, 321-05 and 321-11 postvaccination year 1 (Fig. 1a). TCR sequences from 321-04 and 321-05 PBMC and LN TFH cells mostly matched to cells within the TFH/Treg cell cluster (C14) in the total T cell dataset (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). Measuring the overlap between cTFH cells and LN TFH cells for year 1 time points showed that the overlap of TCRα and TCRβ chains was highest among samples taken from the same donor, regardless of tissue (Extended Data Fig. 6f). These results indicated that the TCR repertoire of TFH cells was shared among tissues and remained durable over the course of multiple years.Vaccination stimulates the maturation of influenza-specific TFH cellsNext, to determine whether the expanded and persistent TFH cell lineages were specific for influenza vaccine-derived antigens, we chose 12 paired (α and β chains) TCRs (herein called lineages T1–T12) from 321-05, prioritizing clonally expanded lineages detected in both PBMC and LN samples and/or at multiple time points in postvaccination year 1 (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Data 1). T3, T9, T11 and T12 were detected in both blood and LN (Fig. 7a). T3 was detected in cTFH cells at D0_Y1 (Fig. 7a), while T1, T2, T4, T5, T6, T7 and T10 were detected in bulk cTFH cells sequenced on D5_Y1 (Fig. 7b). To determine whether each TFH TCR picked was influenza-specific, we transduced TCRs T1–T12 into TCR-deficient Jurkat cells to create stable T1–T12 cell lines. Artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) expressing individual major histocompatibility (MHC) class II alleles from 321-05 in K562 cells (Supplementary Data 2), or purified B cells from PBMCs from HLA-matched individuals not in the study, were used as APCs. We cocultured T1–T12 cell lines with aAPCs infected with influenza virus or transfected with plasmids expressing individual virus segments and measured upregulation of CD69 or interferon-γ (IFNγ) as the readout of activation. T1, T3 and T12 showed a positive response to infected aAPCs expressing HLA-DR3*03:01, HLA-DPA1*01:03/DPB1*13:01 and HLA-DR5*01:01, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Overexpression of influenza proteins showed that T1 and T3 responded to the matrix (M) protein and T12 responded to nucleoprotein (NP; Extended Data Fig. 7c). T6 showed a positive response to neuraminidase (NA) peptides presented by B cells expressing HLA-DPA1*01:03/DPB1*04:02, which could be blocked with an anti-HLA-DP antibody (Extended Data Fig. 7d,e). Using partially overlapping peptides tiled across the M, M2, NP and NA proteins, we found that the peak response for T1 was to M246–62, T3 to M151–67, T6 to NA417–431 and T12 to NP30–43 (Fig. 7c). Coculturing T11 with aAPCs pulsed with full-length recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) showed a positive response to HA (H1N1) presented by HLA-DR5*01:01 aAPCs (Extended Data Fig. 7f). More precise HA epitope mapping determined that T11 responded to an epitope within the HA160–260 region (Fig. 7d).Fig. 7: Vaccination evokes maturation of influenza-specific TFH cell clonal lineages.a, Number of cells detected in PBMCs (top) and LN (bottom) for TFH cell clonal lineages T1–T12 in donor 321-05 at D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D180_Y1, D0_Y2, D7_Y2, D28_Y2, D60_Y2 and D120_Y2. b, Relative abundance of TFH cell clonal lineages T1–T12 in bulk TCRβ sequencing of sorted cTFH cells and LN TFH cells from donor 321-05 at D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1 and D60_Y1. c, Frequency of CD69+ cells in T1, T3 and T12 cell lines after 24 h of coculture with aAPCs expressing HLA-DR3*03:01, HLA-DPA1*01:03/DPB1*13:01 or HLA-DR5*01:01 pulsed with peptides derived from influenza M2, M1, NA or NP, and in the T6 cell line after 24 h of coculture with B cells expressing HLA-DPA1*01:03/DPB1*04:02 pulsed with NA peptides. DMSO alone was used as a control (n = 2–4 technical replicates per condition).

Representative of n = 2 experiments. e, Heatmap of pre-TFH/mem-TFH, GC TFH and IL-10+ TFH cells gene set module scores for TFH cell clonal lineages T1–T12 from donor 321-05 across time points in a. f, UMAP projection showing the localization of all cells encompassed by TFH cell clonal lineages T1–T12 assessed in donor 321-05 across time points from within the embedding from Fig. 2e.Source dataFull size imagePrincipal-component analysis (PCA) analysis of the highly variable features in cells belonging to the T1–T12 lineages indicated that the first principal component (PC1) scores varied with respect to time (Extended Data Fig. 7g). The highest positive PC1 scores were observed on D0_Y1, D5_Y1 and D12_Y1, decreased to values around 0 at D28_Y1, continued to decrease until D60_Y1 and remained stable at D180_Y1, D7_Y2, D28_Y2, D60_Y2 and D120_Y2 (Extended Data Fig. 7g). Examining the top contributing genes in PC1 (positive and negative) showed that genes in the positive loadings contained several pre-TFH/mem-TFH cell markers (TMSB10 and KLF2), while those in the negative loadings were enriched with GC TFH cell markers (TOX2; Extended Data Fig. 7h). Scoring marker gene sets for pre-TFH/mem-TFH, GC TFH and IL-10+ TFH cell subsets as modules showed that pre-TFH/mem-TFH cell module scores were highest between D0_Y1 and D12_Y1 and decreased at D28_Y1, while GC TFH cell and IL-10+ TFH cell scores increased and continued to rise at D60_Y1 and D90_Y1 (Fig. 7e and Supplementary Data 3; Methods). Pre-TFH/mem-TFH cell module scores increased little in response to vaccination in year 2, while GC TFH cell module values were consistent between D0_Y2 and D120_Y2, comparable to those observed at D90_Y1 (Fig. 7e). Finally, we plotted the daughter cells, or cells derived from a shared clonal ancestor as defined by TCR sequence, for T1–T12 lineages across all time points in which they were detected (Fig. 7a) in the context of the TFH/Treg cell embedding. This analysis showed that while the daughter cells localized to clusters corresponding to the pre-TFH/mem-TFH, GC TFH and IL-10+ TFH cell subsets, their distribution among the TFH subsets varied with time postvaccination both years (Fig. 7f). These observations indicated that TFH subset composition among clonally expanded influenza-specific TFH clonotypes could change rapidly within the first week postvaccination and durably over the course of years.DiscussionHere we found that seasonal influenza vaccination mobilized and matured the TFH response in the blood and LN. Pre-TFH/mem-TFH, GC TFH and IL-10+ TFH cell subsets followed distinct kinetics and could be populated by cells from a single clonal lineage. IL-10+ TFH cells may represent a further matured GC TFH cell subset, but our pseudotime analysis suggested this was not the case. Instead, we observed a bifurcation in the developmental trajectories toward either GC TFH cells or IL-10+ TFH cell subsets within a clonal lineage. This suggested that differentiation into either state was stochastic rather than due to the qualities of TCR-antigen recognition. Plasticity between these subsets on a per-cell basis could not be ruled out. Further work in this area will be necessary to elucidate the mechanisms regulating this fate decision.The quality of the TFH cell response to the seasonal influenza vaccination varied between the first and second vaccinations. We observed substantial alterations in LN TFH cell transcriptional profiles at matched time points postvaccination year 2 versus year 1, corresponding to changes in signaling, costimulation and metabolic pathways. The magnitude and kinetics of IL21 and CXCL13 expression following vaccination also differed between year 1 and year 2. Previous work in mice has shown that CD4+ TM cells previously engaged in GC reactions can dedifferentiate, persist long-term (at least 200 days) in the LN and redifferentiate more quickly into GC TFH cells upon antigen re-exposure21. Our findings support the idea that a similar accumulation of memory TFH cells occurs in human lymphoid organs. Long-lived TFH cells in mice undergo epigenetic alterations that enforce their reprogramming and support their survival and plasticity22. Whether a similar mechanism exists for human TFH cells should be further investigated.TCR sequencing permitted us to track individual TFH cell clonotypes over time and across tissues. In other studies, a comparison of the TFH cells from the tonsils to cTFH in the blood of a single donor showed that these two compartments partially overlap in their TCR repertoires10,11,23. We identified influenza-specific TFH cell clonotypes that persisted in the LN 3–6 months after the first vaccination and reappeared in year 2 upon revaccination in the same LN, where they persisted for 4 months.Among the five TFH cell TCRs with specificities identified in this study, three recognized epitopes from internal M1, M2 or NP proteins. These clones were detectable on day 5 of the first vaccination, indicating that they were likely derived from TM rather than TN cells. This implies that a substantial portion of the TFH cell response to seasonal influenza vaccination is memory-based and targets conserved epitopes present in split-inactivated vaccines24,25, rather than the desired new responses to HA or NA epitopes26. Along those lines, the investigation into the quality of adaptive immune responses after Flublok administration, which contains only recombinant HA, showed improved CD4+ T cell functionality and antibody responses compared to FluZone, a split-inactivated QIV vaccine27. We speculate that the presence of internal proteins in split-inactivated influenza vaccines stimulates memory TFH cell responses that blunt the ability of CD4+ TN cells and B cells to engage in a GC response and generate antibodies targeting new HA subtypes. Future studies on the quality and kinetics of the TFH cell response comparing split-inactivated virus versus subunit vaccines are needed to address this possibility.A limitation of our study is that we examined only five individuals due to the cost and procedural intensity of the experimental plan. Future studies will build on these observed trajectories to characterize human TFH cell responses in more individuals and with matched time points postvaccination between years and diverse vaccination strategies.MethodsHuman donorsThe WU321 study12 enrolled eight participants (one female and seven males, ages 26–40 years) who had not been vaccinated with the vaccine for at least 3 years before the initiation of the study. Cohort 1 studied here contains PBMC (D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1 and D120_Y1) and LN (D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D26_Y1, D28_Y1, D60_Y1, D90_Y1, D120_Y1, D180_Y1, D0_Y2, D7_Y2, D14_Y2, D28_Y2, D60_Y2, D90_Y2 and D120_Y2) samples from five donors (321-04, 321-05, 321-07, 321-08 and 321-11) of the WU321 study. Paired PBMC–LN samples from donor 321-05 were available for D0_Y1, D5_Y1, D12_Y1, D28_Y1 and D60_Y1. All studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Washington University in St. Louis. Written consent was obtained from all participants.Sample collection, preparation and storagePBMCs were isolated using Vacutainer CPT tubes (BD Biosciences), the remaining red blood cells were lysed with ammonium chloride lysis buffer (Lonza) and cells were immediately used or cryopreserved in 10% dimethylsulfoxide in FBS. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of axillary LNs was performed by a qualified physician’s assistant under the supervision of a radiologist. LN dimensions and cortical thickness were measured before each FNA. For each FNA sample, six passes were made using 25-gauge needles, each of which was flushed with 3 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U ml−1 penicillin/streptomycin, followed by three 1-ml rinses. Red blood cells were lysed with ammonium chloride buffer (Lonza), washed twice with PBS supplemented with 2% FBS and 2 mM EDTA and immediately used or cryopreserved in 10% DMSO in FBS. Participants reported no adverse effects of phlebotomy, serial FNA or vaccination. No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size. Investigators were not blinded to experiments and outcome assessment.VaccineThe Flucelvax QIV influenza vaccine for the North American 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 seasons was purchased from Seqirus.Single-cell RNA-seq library preparation and sequencingActivated and memory B cells were enriched from PBMCs by first staining with IgD-PE (IA6-2; 1:200 dilution) and MojoSort anti-PE Nanobeads (BioLegend) and then processing with the EasySep Human B Cell Isolation Kit using the EasyEights Magnet (STEMCELL Technologies) to negatively enrich IgDlo B cells. Enriched IgDlo B cells, whole PBMCs and whole FNA were processed using the following: 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 5′ Library and Gel Bead Kit v2, Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment Kit and Chromium i7 Multiplex Kit (PN-120262). The cDNAs were prepared after GEM generation and barcoding, followed by GEM reverse transcription reaction and bead cleanup steps. Purified cDNA was amplified for 10–14 cycles before cleaning with SPRIselect beads. Then, samples were evaluated on a bioanalyzer to determine the cDNA concentration. TCR/B cell receptor (BCR) target enrichments were performed on full-length cDNA. scGEX and enriched TCR/BCR libraries were prepared as recommended by the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kit (v1 Chemistry) user guide, with appropriate modifications to the PCR cycles based on the calculated cDNA concentration. The cDNA libraries were sequenced on NovaSeq 6000 S4 (Illumina), targeting a median sequencing depth of 50,000 and 5,000 read pairs per cell for gene expression and TCR/BCR libraries, respectively.Cell sorting and flow cytometryStaining for analysis and sorting was performed using fresh or cryopreserved PBMCs or FNA single-cell suspensions in 2% FBS and 2 mM EDTA in PBS (P2). For sorting, cells were stained for 30 min on ice with IgD-PerCP-Cy5.5 (IA6-2; 1:200), CD4-Alexa 700 (SK3; 1:400), CD20-APC-Fire750 (2H7; 1:100) and Zombie Aqua, along with CD38-BV605 (HIT2; 1:100), CD71-FITC (CY1G4; 1:200) and CD19-PE (HIB19; 1:200) for PBs or CD19-BV421 (HIB19; 1:100), CD71-PE (CY1G4; 1:400), CXCR5-PE-Dazzle 594 (J252D4; 1:40) and CD38-PE-Cy7 (HIT2; 1:200) for GC B cells (all from BioLegend). For donors 321-07 and 321-08, the PBMC samples for days 0 and 5 were stained with TotalSeq-C antihuman hashtag oligos 9 and 10, respectively, for downstream demultiplexing. Cells were washed twice, and single PBs (live singlet CD19+ CD4− IgDlo CD38+ CD20− CD71+) and GC B cells (live singlet CD19+ CD4− IgDlo CD71+CD38int CD20+ CXCR5+) were sorted using a FACSAria II into 96-well plates containing 2 μl lysis buffer (Clontech) supplemented with 1 U μl−1 RNase inhibitor (New England Biolabs) or bulk sorted into buffer RLT Plus (QIAGEN) and immediately frozen on dry ice. For analysis, cells were stained for 30 min on ice with biotinylated recombinant HAs and PD-1-BB515 (EH12.1; BD Horizon; 1:100) diluted in P2, washed twice and then stained for 30 min on ice with IgA-FITC (M24A; Millipore; 1:500), CD45-PerCP (2D1; BD Bioscience; 1:25), IgG-BV480 (goat polyclonal; Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:100), IgD-SB702 (IA6-2; Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:50), CD38-BV421 (HIT2; 1:100), CD20-Pacific Blue (2H7; 1:400), CD27-BV510 (O323; 1:50), CD4-BV570 (OKT4; 1:50), CD24-BV605 (ML5; 1:100), streptavidin-BV650, CD19-BV750 (HIB19; 1:100), CXCR5-PE-Dazzle 594 (J252D4; 1:50), CD71-APC (CY1G4; 1:100), CD14-A700 (HCD14; 1:200) and IgM-APC-Cy7 (MHM-88; 1:400; all from BioLegend) diluted in Brilliant Staining Buffer (BD Horizon). Cells were washed twice, then fixed and permeabilized for intranuclear staining for 1 h at 25 °C with True Nuclear fixation buffer (BioLegend), washed twice with permeabilization/wash buffer and stained for 30 min at 25 °C with BCL6-PE (7D1; 1:50) and Ki-67-PE-Cy7 (Ki-67; 1:400; both from BioLegend). Cells were washed twice with permeabilization/wash buffer and resuspended in P2 for acquisition on an Aurora using SpectroFlo v.2.2 (Cytek Biosciences). Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo v.10 (Treestar).Processing of 10x Genomics single-cell 5′ gene expression dataThe demultiplexed FASTQ pair-end reads were preprocessed on a by-sample basis using the cellranger count command from 10x Genomics’ Cell Ranger (v.6.0.0) for alignment against the GRCh38 human reference (v.3.0.0; refdata-cellranger-GRCh38-3.0.0). Individual samples are assigned to one of three initial datasets—one containing samples from donors 321-05 and 321-04, one containing samples from donors 321-07 and 321-08 and the last containing additional CD4+ PBMCs from donor 321-05 at D0_Y1 time point.Processing 10x Genomics single-cell TCR readsReads for each sample were parsed using cellranger vdj from 10x Genomics’ Cell Ranger (v.6.0.0) for alignment against the cellranger-vdj-GRCh38-alts-ensembl-5.0.0 reference. Additional quality control was performed using the make_10x_clones_file function from CoNGA software package using settings stringent = True to correct for spurious chain pairings based on other paired clonotypes in the dataset. Only cells with paired TCRαβ sequences were retained. The inverse D50 index in Fig. 6b was calculated as the reciprocal of the quotient from dividing the number of unique clones occupying the top 50% of the repertoire (after ranking by abundance) by the total number of unique clonotypes for the time point multiplied by 100.Processing single-cell TCR sequencing from sorted TFH cellsTCRα and TCRβ chains were amplified from blood and LN TFH cells sorted into individual wells of a 384-well plate (described above) by RT–PCR using variable gene and constant region primers and sequenced by the Sanger method as previously described28. Sequencing reads were parsed using the TCRdist pipeline as previously described29.Bulk TCR sequencing of sorted TFH cellsTCRα and TCRβ chains from bulk-sorted cTFH and LN TFH were amplified using 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends procedure with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) for error correction essentially as described in ref. 30. RNA was extracted from bulk-sorted blood and LN TFH cells from donors 321-04, 321-05 and 321-11 using the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN). Reverse transcription was carried out using SmartScribe RT (Takara) and Q5 polymerase (NEB) was used during the first and second rounds of amplification. Barcoded TCRα and TCRβ amplicons generated by the second round of PCR were pooled by equal volume, prepped and indexed for sequencing on Illumina platforms using a KAPA HyperPrep Kit (Roche). We performed 150-bp paired-end sequencing on the NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina).Processing bulk TCR sequencingPaired-end FASTQ reads were processed using migec (v.1.2.9) software31. Reads corresponding to individual samples were demultiplexed before assembling nucleotide sequence reads within each UMI group. Variable–diversity–joining (VDJ) junction mapping of assembled contigs was performed using the NCBI-BLAST+ package within migec. Additional quality control was performed on the filtered clonotype tables from migec using the vdjtools (v.1.2.1)32 FilterNonFunctional, Correct and Decontaminate functions to remove potentially erroneous clonotypes within and between samples. The immunarch (v.0.6.5) package33 for R was used for the Morisita–Horn index calculations.scGEX analysisAnalysis was performed using Seurat (v.4.1.1). The three datasets noted above were each processed in the following manner before aggregation. First, an object containing all cell types was generated before filtering down to only T cells. Quality control was performed by removing cells with greater than 10% mitochondrial content, expressing fewer than 300 or greater than 4,000 genes, and containing fewer than 900 or greater than 40,000 UMIs to filter out presumably lysed/dead cells and doublets. MULTIseqDemux was used for demultiplexing hashtag oligos for the dataset containing donors 321-07 and 321-08 (ref. 34). After preprocessing, the three datasets were merged, and SCTranform was used for data normalization before feature extraction, scaling and PCA35. The Harmony algorithm was applied for batch integration across donors and datasets36. The FindClusters and RunUMAP tools were applied to the harmonized embedding to generate a 2D projection of scGEX space. TCR clonotype information (described above) was then mapped back to cells in the object by matching their corresponding UMI barcodes.The total T cell dataset was subset from all cell datasets by selecting clusters where the majority of cells expressed CD3E and then further subsetting those to only cells with paired TCR sequence information. Cluster identities for the total T cell dataset were assigned based on the expression of T cell markers distinguishing each of the major subtypes, including CD4, CD8B, KLRB1, ZBTB16, KLRG1, CCR7, SELL, FOXP3, PRF1 and TBX21. PDCD1, CXCR5 and ICOS were used to identify TFH clusters. TFH cells were further subset and reprocessed to identify heterogeneity in their scGEX phenotypes. Here we chose to include all cells clonally linked to those in the two TFH clusters that might otherwise be excluded due to non-TFH scGEX cluster assignments.B cell subsets were defined using the following markers: BCL6, RGS13, MEF2B, STMN1, ELL3 and SERPINA9 for GC B cells; XBP1, IRF4, SEC11C, FKBP11, JCHAIN and PRDM1 for plasmablasts; TCL1A, IL4R, CCR7, IGHM and IGHD for naive B cells; TBX21, FCRL5, ITGAX, NKG7, ZEB2 and the lack of CR2 for activated B cells; TNFRSF13B, CD27 and CD24 for resting memory B cells.Monocle3 (refs. 37,38,39) R package (v.1.1.0) was used for pseudotime analysis on our data. The getEnrichedPathways function in the Cerebro40 (v.1.3.1) R package was used to find enriched GO terms for the TFH populations. GO terms enriched in IL-10+ TFH cells with respect to all other TFH and Treg cells were used for GSVA41 analysis in Fig. 4b (GSVA R package, v.1.42.0). Genes defining the pre/memory, GC and IL-10+ TFH modules (Supplementary Data 3) 6F were taken from intersecting positive markers defining the subset relative to the two other subsets based on the results of the differential expression analysis results using Seurat’s FindMarkers function using default parameters (Extended Data Fig. 3). Module scores were calculated using the AddModuleScore function in Seurat. The scCustomize package was used to generate some visualizations.HLA typingHLA typing was conducted with the research-grade AllType NGS 11-loci Amplification Kit (One Lambda) as described in https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-022-01184-4. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform at 150 × 150 bp, and data were parsed using TypeStream Visual software (One Lambda). HLA typing results are in Supplementary Data 2.Construction of TFH TCR cell lines and aAPC lineagesTwelve TCR clonotypes were picked from donor 321-05 for cloning based on the following two criteria: the clone was detected at multiple time points after vaccination, and it had matching single-cell TCR and bulk sequencing results from the sorted TFH cells. Full-length TCR nucleotide sequences of the picked clones were reconstructed using stiTChR42 with the TCRα and TCRβ chains linked with a P2A auto-cleavage site. To generate APCs expressing specific HLA, the nucleotide sequences of α and β chains for donor-specific HLA class II haplotypes were linked via the T2A site to form the full HLA constructs (HLA-DR, HLA-DP and HLA-DQ). Constructs were synthesized and cloned (Genscript) into a custom pLVX-EF1a-P2A-GFP-IRES-Puro lentiviral vector. Lentivirus particles were subsequently generated by cotransfecting 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection; ATCC) with one of the generated constructs, psPAX2 (Addgene, 12260) and pMD2.G (Addgene, 12259), using GeneJuice transfection reagent (EMD Millipore) or Lipofectamine3000 transfection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To generate the aAPC lineages, K562 cells (ATCC, CCL-243) expressing HLA-DM, CD80 and CD64 molecules were transduced with the donor’s HLA-II vectors to generate a set of aAPC lines. Similarly, Jurkat cells were transduced with the panel TCR lentiviruses. Both K562 and Jurkat cells were placed under 1 μg ml−1 puromycin selection for 2 weeks before sorting for GFP+ cells.Generation of APCsB cells were used as APCs and were generated from PBMCs. The cells were isolated using CD19+ microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and maintained in culture with irradiated NIH3T3 CD40L feeder cells, as previously described43,44. Cells were expanded for 5 days in B cell medium—Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (ATCC) containing 10% human serum, 100 U ml−1 penicillin, 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin, 2 mM l-glutamine and 200 U ml−1 IL4 (Peprotech). Following the expansion, B cells were used in coculture assays with the Jurkat T cell lines.Cell line antigen-stimulation assaysTCR-negative Jurkat cells were cloned with a curated set of donor-derived TCR sequences. The TCR-expressing clonotypes were subsequently screened for activation upon coculture with aAPC-encoding cognate HLA class II alleles. The HLA-II-expressing aAPCs were preincubated with β-propiolactone-inactivated influenza A virus (strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1) at multiplicity of infection 1 for 2 hours before adding the TCR-expressing lines in a ratio of 1:1. The cocultured cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for an additional 24 h. Cells were washed with cold PBS and then stained with a cocktail of fluorescently labeled antibodies, including antihuman CD3-PE-Cy7 (OKT3; 1:200), Ghost viability dye (Tonbo Biosciences; 1:1000), TCRαβ-BV421 (IP26; 1:100), CD69-PerCP-eFluor-710 (FN50; 1:100) and IFNγ-BV785 (4S.B3; 1:100). Similarly, HLA-II-expressing aAPCs were transfected with pHW2000 vectors encoding the genomic viral segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M and NS) 48 h before coculturing with the TCR-expressing lineages. The transfection was conducted via a Neon Electroporation System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MPK5000S) using 1 pulse at 1,000 V and 50 ms width, following the manufacturer’s protocol. To identify the driving peptide motifs that triggered activation in the responding clones, a pool of overlapping oligopeptide sequences spanning M1, M2 and NP proteins of the H1N1 PR8 strain (Mimotopes) was used for the peptide mapping experiments. Libraries covering M1 and M2 consisted of 17-mer peptides that were overlapping by 11 residues. The NP library consisted of 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 residues. All samples were acquired on an Aurora (CyteK), and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

All Rights Reserved.ExpandAugust 23, 2024UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — After three weeks of testing as required under a voluntary state monitoring program for bird flu in dairy cattle, animal health experts in Penn State’s College of Agricultural Sciences announced that the University’s dairy herd has been certified as free of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI. “The Penn State dairy herd has achieved ‘monitored herd’ status under the Pennsylvania Lactating Dairy Cow Health Monitoring Program,” said extension veterinarian Ernest Hovingh, clinical professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences and director of Penn State’s Animal Diagnostic Laboratory. “This means the herd has met all program requirements, including having multiple negative weekly test results for the HPAI virus.” Penn State announced in July that it would test its herd in response to an outbreak of avian flu that has affected dairy cattle in more than a dozen states since March. As of Aug. 22, the virus had not been found in Pennsylvania dairy herds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and state animal health authorities. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture has encouraged all dairy farms in the state to enroll in its voluntary monitoring program, which is aimed at providing critical data on the status of dairy herds in Pennsylvania and detecting HPAI as quickly as possible should it arrive in the commonwealth. All the tested bulk-tank milk samples, representing Penn State’s entire milking herd, were analyzed by the Animal Diagnostic Lab at Penn State — one of three labs in the state-funded Pennsylvania Animal Diagnostic Laboratory System — using a highly accurate test, according to Mathias Martins, head of the lab’s virology and molecular diagnostics sections. “The real-time PCR test conducted to monitor HPAI in dairy is highly sensitive and specific, ensuring a high level of confidence in the laboratory results,” Martins said. “All samples tested were negative for HPAI over three consecutive weeks, confirming that the virus is not present in the Penn State dairy herd.” Research Professor and Attending Veterinarian Jacob Werner, who oversees the health and well-being of all Penn State livestock, said the University’s cows have remained healthy, and no animals have been brought into the herd from other farms, which is thought to be a prime means of HPAI spread among herds. He pointed out that under the state monitoring program, weekly testing will continue, even though the risk of an introduced infection is extremely minimal. “It’s a very simple process to take a sample and submit it to the lab,” Werner said. “And there’s no charge for the testing, since that’s covered by the USDA’s National Animal Health Laboratory Network.” Hovingh and Werner noted that Penn State is on the leading edge of supporting state and national surveillance efforts by having its dairy cattle tested for avian flu. “By testing our herd, we hope to have set an example for others to participate in the Lactating Dairy Cow Health Monitoring Program,” Hovingh said. “Besides confirming our expectation that our herd is free of avian flu, one of our goals was to inspire dairy producers across the state to test their herds too, so Pennsylvania animal health authorities can document that the state is in fact HPAI-free, as well as detect any outbreak that might occur and nip it in the bud before it has a chance to spread.” Last Updated August 23, 2024ContactChuck Gillcdg5@psu.eduCell Phone: 814-863-2713@agscienceshttp://agsci.psu.eduTagsResearchHealth and MedicineImpactNationalPennsylvaniaVisitors and NeighborsFaculty and StaffBusiness and IndustryAlumniUniversity ParkAgricultural SciencesDepartment of Animal ScienceDepartment of Veterinary and Biomedical SciencesPenn State ExtensionLatest NewsGet the news by emailSubscribeFacebookTwitterLinkedinInstagramGet News By EmailDiscover NewsExploreNewsCareersFacts and RankingsCollegesCampusesHealth CareResearchImpactResourcesProspective StudentsCurrent StudentsInternational StudentsBusiness and IndustryVeterans and MilitaryVisitorsFaculty and StaffAlumniMediaCOVID-19 InformationPopular LinksMapsDirectoryLibrariesAcademic CalendarLionPATHStay ConnectedEmails / HeadlinesEmergency NotificationsPenn State GoStrategic CommunicationsReport MisconductPolice201 Old Main, University Park, PA 16802814-865-4700Contact UsNon DiscriminationEqual OpportunityAccessibilityLegal StatementsThe Pennsylvania State UniversityThe Pennsylvania State University © 2024Preventing the spread of avian influenza at the State Fair Open in Our App Get the best experience and stay connected to your community with our Spectrum News app. Learn More Open in Spectrum News App Continue in Browser Toggle navigation Central NY EDIT Watch Live | Recent Activity Log Out Recent Activity Log In LATEST NEWS Headlines Business & Growth Around the State Education Good News Health The Big Deal with Errol Louis Pursuit Unlimited Everyday Heroes Lottery Seen On WEATHER & TRAFFIC Today's Forecast 7 Day Forecast Interactive Radar Current Conditions Satellite & Radar Weather Blog Travel Weather Watches & Warnings Closings & Delays Sign Up For Weather Alerts Traffic Map Traffic News Gas Prices Storm Season POLITICS Election Results Political News New York State of Politics Capital Tonight 2024 Elections Washington, D.C.

(Emily Kenny/Spectrum News 1) Wash your hands: Preventing the spread of avian influenza at the State Fair By Emily Kenny, Report for America corps member Central NY PUBLISHED 4:06 PM ET Aug. 21, 2024 PUBLISHED 4:06 PM EDT Aug. 21, 2024 SHARE While New York has had no positive cases of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, dairy cattle and poultry were required to test before coming to the New York State Fair. âLetâs make sure we are part of the answer not the problem,â said Commissioner of Agriculture Richard Ball. Being proactive about biosecurity is important when it comes to preventing the spread of this virus for both dairy cattle and poultry, he said. Exhibitors clip their dairy cows to prep for the upcoming shows. (Emily Kenny/Spectrum News 1) âFor our dairy cattle, they can carry the disease and may show some symptoms, but the rate of morbidity is very, very low, but for our poultry industry itâs life or death â so biosecurity measures on both fronts are critical,â Ball said. Thirteen states in the U.S. have had dairy cattle test positive for HPAI and about 200 farms have been impacted, Ball said. Cornell Universityâs Animal Health Diagnostic Center has taken the lead in testing these animals. âTo ensure the safety for New York animals and fairgoers, all milking cows must be tested within seven days of arrival at a state fairground,â said assistant professor Elisha Frye, who assisted with this testing process. A fairgoer pets a dairy cow. (Emily Kenny/Spectrum News 1) The milk samples were submitted by veterinarians and the testing is paid for by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal Plant Health Inspection Service. âWeâve got great animal health officials that are staying on top of this,â Ball said. Fair officials have placed hand washing stations and hand sanitizer around the barns to make sure fairgoers can keep their hands clean after interacting with the animals. Lou Smith oversees parts of the poultry barn and brings nearly 100 birds to exhibit each year. Smith stands for a portrait in the poultry barn at the New York State Fair. (Emily Kenny/Spectrum News 1) âWe have a veterinarian that goes through our building, checks our birds and makes sure everything is healthy and to keep everyone safe for the public,â Smith said. Smith has been coming to the fair with his birds for 20 years and emphasized the importance of clean hands. âIf you want to pet them, pet them. Sometimes you can find one of us who will let you hold them, but wash your hands after,â Smith said. Bossard with her dairy cattle. (Emily Kenny/Spectrum News 1) Brynley Bossard, whose parents Brett and Johanna Bossard operate Barbland Dairy in Fabius, brought her cattle to the fair this year. âIf they are scared of [getting sick], just make sure to wash your hands after and bring hand sanitizer,â Bossard said. Ball said the risk of HPAI spreading to humans is very low, but itâs important to continue these good practices. âWe are in a good place, and I think vigilance is the price we pay for that,â he said.

Influenza B virus (IBV) causes annual seasonal epidemics. The exploration of molecular biology and reverse genetics of IBV is pivotal for understanding its replication, pathogenesis, and evolution. Reverse genetics empowers us to purposefully alter the viral genome, engineer precise genetic modifications, and unveil the secrets of virulence and resistance mechanisms. It helps us in quickly analyzing new virus strains by viral genome manipulation and the development of innovative influenza vaccines. Reverse genetics has been employed to create mutant or reassortant influenza viruses for evaluating their virulence, pathogenicity, host range, and transmissibility. Without this technique, these tasks would be difficult or impossible, making it crucial for preparing for epidemics and protecting public health. Here, we bring together the latest information on how we can manipulate the genes of the influenza B virus using reverse genetics methods, most importantly helper virus-independent techniques. BackgroundInfluenza Viruses are segmented, single-stranded RNA genome viruses that belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Depending on the host types, genetic properties, severity of infection, and vaccine coverages, these viruses could be divided into four types: A, B, C, and D (Table 1) [1]. Influenza, a highly contagious acute viral illness affecting the respiratory system, poses a significant global public health concern. It spreads from person to person, indiscriminately impacting individuals of all ages but more prevalent in children [2]. The trend of disease severity is high in children as compared to adults and individuals with underlying other chronic diseases (liver, immunosuppression, lungs, cardiac, kidney, and neurological disorders) [3]. Children under five years of age are at greater risk of getting sick with the influenza, and the annual incidence is up to 30% [1, 4]. According to estimates from the WHO and CDC, up to 650,000 people worldwide die from these illnesses annually [5].Table 1 Comparison of different type of influenza virusFull size tableThe development of reverse genetics and the molecular engineering of recombinant viruses, which have revolutionized the field of virology, have made the study of genetic modifications in virus genomes possible [6, 7]. Exploring the structure and function of a virus, known as reverse genetics or viral rescue, is accomplished by creating an infectious clone of the virus and modifying it in-vitro at the DNA level. Infectious molecular clones include infectious cDNA and infectious in-vitro transcripts. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to amplify the cDNA fragment of the RNA virus genome. The restriction enzyme sites are then utilized to clone it into an appropriate vector to produce a full-length cDNA clone of the genome [7, 8].Reverse genetics techniques for generating recombinant viruses were first developed in 1999 for influenza A virus because of the pandemic potential of this virus [8, 9]. In 2002, almost three years later, two different groups separately announced that the influenza B virus could be successfully recovered entirely from plasmid DNA [10]. The capacity to alter a virus genome completely revolutionized the study of influenza, enabling the development of infectious, recombinant viruses that are genetically altered [11]. Studies have clarified information on virus virulence and pathogenicity, host range and transmissibility, packing signals, the function of viral proteins, and virus-host interaction [12, 13]. Reverse genetic technologies have also been used to make flu vaccines and recombinant flu viruses that carry foreign peptides and/or proteins [14, 15].Currently, reverse genetics stands as a fundamental approach in molecular virology, extensively employed in influenza virus laboratories for generating mutant as well flu viruses that are both wild-type and reassortant generated from viral cDNA [15] (Fig. 1). This review explores reverse genetics methods for influenza B virus, driving advancements in basic and applied virology. These methods enable the study of extinct viruses, rapid characterization of new strains, and development of novel vaccines to overcome substantial challenges.Fig. 1Overview of genetic manipulation of influenza B virus using plasmid-based approachFull size imageStructure and genome organizationThrough molecular virology studies, researchers have gained valuable insights into the genomic organization and replication RNA segmented within the genome of influenza B viruses (IBVs) [7, 8]. When viewed through electron microscopy, both influenza A and B viruses look like circular or filamentous structures. The width of spherical forms is about 100 nanometers, and the length of filamentous forms can be more than 300 nanometers [9, 12]. The influenza B virus consists of eight genomic segments including nucleoprotein (NP), nuclear export protein (NEP), matrix protein (BM1), BM2 ion channel, and three surface glycoproteins (HA, NA, and NB), giving the virus its characteristic molecular properties (Table 2). Each of the encoded proteins are crucial in the life cycle of the virus and its interactions with the respective hosts [16, 17].Table 2 The genomic segments organization of influenza B virusFull size tableAlthough the Influenza A and B virus have similar genomes encoding homologous proteins, yet they are different in their virion structures, genomic organization, host range, and glycan binding specificities [15]. Variable lengths of the encoded proteins, and non-coding regions (NCRs) serving as promoters for replication and transcription, different accessory proteins encoded from open reading frames (ORFs), and different internal proteins inducing antigenic differences are the significant distinguishing features [18, 19]. Translation strategies of several encoded proteins such as M2 and BM2 in both IAV and IBV have also been reported to be different [15]. Furthermore, presence of NB ion channel in IBV which is absent in IAV is another characterizing feature to differentiate both the viruses [15, 20].The surface glycoproteins Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) are encoded in both the virus types. However, the 18 HA (H1–H18) and 11 NA (N1–N11) subtypes classify IAVs based on different antigenic properties. Yet, currently only two subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 are circulating in humans [20]. Contrastingly, reassortant influenza B viruses, featuring a hemagglutinin (HA) similar to B/Shandong/7/97 from the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage and a neuraminidase (NA) closely related to B/Sichuan/379/99 from the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage, have been found globally, becoming the most common strain causing influenza B epidemics [17, 21, 22]. The main viral proteins, including HA, NA, NP, and polymerase proteins, have been fully characterized [1, 7]. This indicates the important roles of genomic organization, replication, transcription, and translation in the characterization of IBV (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Structural and genomic organization of influenza B virusFull size imageLife cycle of influenza B virusDuring the viral infection, the initial stage involves the binding of the viral HA protein to a cellular receptor which is a sialylated glycoprotein with either α-2,3 or α-2,6 bonds. Upon this binding event, the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis is triggered, resulting in the containment of virus particles within an endosome [23]. Acidification of the endosome induces a structural alteration in the HA protein of the influenza virus, facilitating the fusion of the viral and endosome membranes [20]. The M-2 (IAV) and BM2 (IBV) ion protein channels play crucial roles in releasing viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes into the cytoplasm of the host cell. The transportation of viral ribonucleoproteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is aided by the export of nuclear protein as well as matrix 1 protein. This translocation is essential for initiating viral genome replication and gene transcription [20, 24]. The packaging of viral RNA into new virion is regulated by RNA-RNA interactions that take place between vRNA packing signals located at the terminal ends of each vRNA segment [25]. The final phase involves the enzymatic function of NA, which eradicates the receptors and liberates newly generated viral particles from the exterior of infected cells (Fig. 3) [23].Fig. 3Life Cycle of Influenza B virus: (A) Entry of Influenza B virus into the host cell by invading the cell membrane; (B) Release of the viral components into the cytoplasm followed by the transport of vRNP into the nucleus; (C) vRNP undergoes transcription for the production of viral mRNA and replication to produce cRNP.

This is because, as soon as the viral infection begins, the immune cells particularly the type I interferons try to overcome the viral attack by activating the immune response [26]. Therefore, the viral cells adopt different splicing strategies to produce multiple primary and functional transcripts. For example, the nonstructural gene produces nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) as a primary transcript which plays important roles in the replication cycles of influenza virus but also produces NEP by the alternate splicing of NS mRNA [27]. The NS1 inhibits the IFN-1 response induction and innate immune response activation [28]. Therefore, the ongoing fight between the host and the virus, particularly involving type I interferon, is crucial in controlling viral infection [20].MethodsReverse genetics (RG) represents an indispensable tool for elucidating the intricate characteristics of viruses both in vivo and in vitro. Initially implemented with DNA viruses and later expanded to encompass RNA viruses, the pioneering success of RG manipulation was achieved in a positive-sense RNA virus, namely poliovirus [8, 25].However, tackling negative-stranded RNA viruses posed daunting challenges, including the absence of genomic RNA, the stringent demands for exact genome length to enable replication and packaging, as well as the requirement for transient availability of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [29]. Notwithstanding these formidable obstacles, the creation of a reporter IAV replicon was triumphantly accomplished using a helper virus [10]. A pivotal breakthrough emerged with the advent of plasmid-based systems, facilitating enhanced manipulation of negative-sense RNA viruses, marking a significant milestone in virology research [30, 31].Recombinant virus generation techniques initially focused on DNA viruses, employing transfection with plasmids encoding the viral genome or heterologous recombination between plasmids and the viral genome with a helper virus [32]. Positive-sense RNA viral genomes, like poliovirus, were later manipulated through cell transfection with plasmid DNA or in vitro-transcribed RNA for recombinant virus production [29]. However, negative-sense RNA viruses, such as influenza, posed challenges due to their non-infectious nature without viral RdRps and vRNA [33]. The advent of reverse genetics and molecular engineering revolutionized influenza research, enabling exploration of viral replication, transcription, pathogenicity, host interactions, and vaccine development [32]. These technologies have also facilitated the creation of recombinant influenza viruses for vaccine vectors, expressing foreign proteins, or carrying reporter genes for easy infection tracking [29, 32, 34].It’s a new era for the study of influenza virus with powerful reverse genetics technology, and the comparison of different methods used for the reverse genetic of IBV is shown in Table 3. These discoveries have enabled the study and resuscitation of extinct influenza viruses, quick characterization of new viral strains, production of conventional influenza vaccines, and development of state-of-the-art influenza vaccines. Its application has yielded significant benefits, contributing to the development of inactivated or live-attenuated influenza vaccines and the exploration of anti-influenza treatments with elucidated antiviral mechanisms [35]. The ability to manipulate viral genomes through reverse genetics has brought a transformative impact on influenza research. Researchers now have the capacity to work with infectious, recombinant, and genetically modified viruses, allowing them to target and address specific research concerns with precision and depth [35,36,37].Table 3 Comparison of different methods used for the reverse genetic of influenza B virusFull size tableA major breakthrough occurred in 2002 when reverse genetics techniques successfully achieved the complete recovery of recombinant influenza B viruses from plasmid DNA [13]. This aided in the investigation of both the host and viral factors involved in influenza pathogenesis, transmissibility, host-range interactions and restrictions, and virulence [15]. The reverse genetics approaches allowed the researchers to determine the importance of the non-coding regions present in the genome of influenza B virus, generate novel vaccine strains, study the drug resistance mechanisms, and evaluate the function of viral proteins, which are analogous to influenza A virus proteins and uniquely present in influenza B viruses [10].Helper virus-dependent methodsThese were the first successful influenza virus reverse genetics methods. They relied on a helper virus and a selection system to obtain the desired recombinantransfectant influenza virus [36]. During the era when helper virus-dependent systems were the sole accessible RG systems for influenza virus, selection systems for only six out of the eight genomic RNA segments of influenza A virus were documented [37]. Consequently, the genetic manipulation of two RNA segments, the first PA and the second PB1, was rendered impossible [36]. Many selection procedures differed in their level of strictness and, consequently, in their effectiveness. The quantity of mutated or reassortant influenza B viruses produced using this system was significantly less than the quantity produced [10, 38]. These technologies represent the initial advancements in reverse genetics for influenza viruses. Although they have demonstrated effectiveness and great significance in influenza virus research, their drawbacks on the helper influenza virus and their reliance consequently require the implementation of a selection method to enable the separation of necessary transfectant or recombinant influenza B viruses [35, 37].Helper virus-independent methodsHelper virus-independent reverse genetics methods for influenza B virus revolutionized the study and manipulation of viral genomes. In this approach, individual plasmids containing cloned cDNA of the eight influenza B viral RNA segments, driven by RNA polymerase I or II promoters, are co-transfected into permissive cells [38]. The transfected cells serve as a host for the transcription, replication, and translation of the viral RNA segments, ultimately leading to the reconstitution of infectious influenza B virus [13, 39]. Most approaches use plasmids or vectors to produce all viral genomic RNA segments and required ‘helper’ proteins in cells, removing the requirement for selection procedures or helper virus elimination. Recent research proposed an alternate technique based on isolated RNPs from influenza virus preparations, but it has yet to gain attraction in the literature [40].Plasmid-only reverse genetics systemsViral RNA segments and necessary viral proteins are typically expressed by transfecting cells with specific plasmids (plasmid-based RG systems) [41]. These systems can be categorized based on factors like promoter types, plasmid numbersypes, transcription control elements, and cell species. Plasmid-based RG systems have been established for influenza A, B, C, and D viruses, along with the tick-transmitted Orthomyxoviruses, and Thogoto virus [41,42,43]. Jackson et al. described the use of cassette vector, pPRGCAT, cloned with the segments of influenza B/Panama/45/90 and flanked by human polymerase I promoter at the 5′ terminus and the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) antigenomic ribozyme at the 3′ terminus, so that the transcription resulted in the synthesis of negative-sense RNAs with exact viral-like termini [10].Nogales et al. [15] described the generation of recombinant influenza B virus using an ambisense bidirectional plasmid pDP-2002 containing two transcription units in opposite direction. The influenza B vRNAs are expressed using the human polymerase I (hPol-I) promoter and a murine Pol-I transcription terminator (TI) while the mRNAs are expressed using polymerase II-driven cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV) and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (aBGH). The synthesis of negative-sense vRNA from the hPol-I cassette, and positive-sense mRNA from the Pol-II unit, from one viral cDNA template is allowed by the orientation of both the polymerase units. The cloning of influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 was carried out by inserting the influenza B viral cDNAs between the polymerase I transcriptionerminator cassette flanked by an RNA polymerase II-dependent (Pol-II) cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV) and a polyadenylation site (aBGH) [15].Expression of viral RNA with the help of promotorsThe initial reverse genetics systems employed plasmids that were free of helper viruses and had only the necessary genetic material. These plasmids utilized the human Pol I promoter to enable the production of viral RNAs [44]. The 3′ terminus of the viral RNAs was produced through the action of the ribozyme or the (murine) Pol I terminator sequence. Pol I promoters are typically regarded as species-specific, meaning that they function exclusively in the species where the promoter sequence originated or in closely related species [45]. Canine and chicken Pol I promoters were also utilized in specific cell types. Murine Pol I promoters were not widely used due to limited transfectable cell lines [46].To overcome species-specific limitations, a universal plasmid-based reverse genetics system employed the T7 promoter, relying on T7 RNA polymerase expression within transfected cells. This system worked in human, canine, and quail cells. An alternative patent suggests using Pol II promoters with self-cleaving ribozymes at both ends of viral RNAs for reverse genetics [46, 47]. Nogales et al. shared their methods, which described the use of bidirectional plasmid pDP-2002 containing two promoters, human polymerase I (hPol-I) promoter, and polymerase II-driven cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV) for influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008. This plasmid allowed the synthesis of vRNA and mRNA from the same vector, thereby, reducing the number of vectors used to eight for the efficient recovery of influenza B virus [15].Human 293T and PER.C6 cells, as well as monkey Vero and COS-1 cells, have been employed in reverse genetics studies related to influenza virus. The cells have been cultivated either individually or in conjunction with more vulnerable cells, such as MDCK or chicken embryo cells [27, 39]. The rescue of recombinant influenza B viruses from the plasmid DNA have been reported using HEK293T and MDCK cell lines [15]. Another research has reported the efficient recovery of influenza B virus strains using human derived PER.C6 cell lines [45].Reporter RNA and DNA polymerase-based cloningDifferent techniques, such as using long-overhang primers and restriction enzymes, have been employed to create plasmids that produce RNA templates for influenza B virus reporters. Using these methods, the luciferase gene is added to target vectors, viral vectors are joined with UTRs, or a double-stranded DNA linker is used between terminator sequences and the Pol-I promoter [48]. It has been tried to create restriction enzyme-free methods for IBV reporter-based RNP activity assays using overlapping sequences and long overhang primers, but these methods cannot be standardized or established because no clear experimental protocols are currently present [49]. The difficulty is increased for influenza B viruses because their untranslated regions (UTRs) are greater in comparison to influenza A virus [48, 50].Recent research shows a different way to make a firefly luciferase-based reporter plasmid for the influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 virus that does not use restriction enzymes, specialized reagents or kits thus making the method fairly simple to be adopted. The cloning strategy developed by Kedia et al. utilized a single DNA polymerase, which was easily available due to its wide use in regular molecular biology work. The reporter RNA cassette with the reporter ORF which was flanked by the viral 5′- and 3′-UTR regions was generated by two consecutive PCR amplification reactions. It was then cloned into the selected vectors for the expression analysis to successfully establish a simple, adaptable, and user-friendly cloning of any other reporter RNA constructs [51].Vaccine innovation and epidemic controlEpidemiologic studies have indicated the presence of selective pressure on influenza B viruses. This is certainly due to a phenomenon known as immunologic imprinting in which the individuals in the population exhibit the pre-existing immunity against the virus developed during the childhood by infection with the influenza strain circulating which then protect against unfamiliar HA or NA subtypes emerging from the same groups [52, 53]. The evolution of the influenza B virus is driven by the antigenic drift and reassortment mechanisms along with the mutations in the HA and NA genes allowing the evasion of pre-existing antibodies. Thus, to overcome the epidemic threats posed by rapidly evolving influenza B virus strains, it is crucial for the researchers to come up with vaccines developed from the updated strains [52, 54].To mitigate the burden attributed to epidemics caused by influenza virus, a number of approaches including vaccines and antiviral drugs, are being developed. The high evolutionary rates of influenza B virus have constrained the production of a fully effective vaccine, making it difficult to prevent influenza completely. However, vaccination is deemed as an appropriate option to combat the viral attack [53]. The researchers have developed three types of vaccines (inactivated, live attenuated, and recombinant HA vaccines) with their advantages and disadvantages, respectively. The vaccine seed viruses for all these vaccines should be replaced periodically with respect to the antigenicity of the circulating viral strains which otherwise cause low vaccine efficacy. The epidemiologic information from individual countries, the genetic and antigenic characteristics of the circulating viruses are responsible for the selection of the correct influenza vaccine composition (Fig. 4) [55].Fig. 4IBV vaccine production: (1) Selection of IBV strain; (2) RNA extraction; (3) cDNA synthesis for gene manipulation; (4) Cloning of the targeted gene into a suitable plasmid vector; (5) Transfection of the selected mammalian cell lines by the cloned vector; (6) Recovery of the transfected viral strain from the cell lines; (7) Vaccine productionFull size imagePreviously, high uncertainty existed in the yield of influenza B virus for vaccine purposes based on the propensity of the selected antigenic variant to propagate in eggs. For example, with the change of recommended strain of influenza B virus to B/HK/330/2001, poor growth of the strain in the egg became apparent after a long time. Therefore, achieving the necessary antigen doses needed for the influenza B virus was difficult. Emergence of reverse genetics approaches eliminated the uncertainty of the reassortment process [52]. This was demonstrated by Hoffmann et al. (2002) who generated ‘6 + 2 reassortants’ by reverse genetics with internal genes from B/Yamanishi/166/98 and HA and NA genes from B/Victoria/504/2000, B/Hawaii/ 10/2001 and B/Hong Kong/330/2001 influenza strains. The recombinant viruses grew along with the wild-type virus in eggs, with the enhanced growth exhibited by B/Victoria recombinant virus [16].Researchers further developed tissue culture cell-based approaches for vaccine production which might be fast, adaptable, and pose minimal risk of biological contamination. Cell lines including 293T, MDCK, and PER.C6 have been used for the recovery of influenza B viruses using reverse genetics procedures. MDCK and PER.C6 cell lines have been licensed for influenza vaccine production which are being widely used to generate vaccines [45, 56, 57]. Initially, trivalent vaccines were formulated which contained two influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and one lineage of influenza B viruses. This was to develop protection against three different influenza viruses irrespective of two different lineages of circulating B viruses. To provide wider protection, the second lineage of the influenza B virus was included to produce a quadrivalent influenza vaccine. The current approved vaccines for influenza virus are quantitatively standardized with respect to the antigenicity or HA quantity but not by the presence of neutralizing antibodies (NA) [58].ConclusionInfluenza B virus infections persist as a formidable threat to humanity. A relentless increase in incidence, notably during the 2019–2021 influenza season has been recorded. The challenge of antigenic mismatch and uncertainty in predicting prevalent IBV lineages poses a daunting obstacle in vaccine seed selection. Although quadrivalent vaccine formulations offer some relief, IBV vaccine efficacy remains insufficient due to increased antigenic drift and mutations in HA and NA genes. Present study highlights the transformative impact of reverse genetics on influenza B virus research, detailing its role in manipulating viral genomes. It categorizes methods, favoring plasmid-only systems for efficiency. In-depth analysis of reverse genetics and viral vector-based approaches has been conducted. Interestingly, a reporter plasmid free of restriction enzymes or complex reagents has been developed for influenza B virus. This standardized assay system proves valuable for studying viral and host factors, offering a high-throughput screening platform for antiviral drugs. Overall, it underscores the crucial role of reverse genetics in advancing influenza B virus research and potential interventions.

Credit: NIAID Share Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Email In April 2024, laboratory results from a hospitalized patient in Mexico City showed the first direct evidence of human infection caused by influenza A virus subtype H5N2 (A/H5N2). The patient died, and the case fatality was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 23 May 2024. In a new paper (pre-print), researchers provide additional context on the clinical case and phylogenetic analysis. The patient initially developed developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea and general malaise. About a week after symptom onset, on 24 April, the patient sought medical attention, was hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases “Ismael Cosio Villegas” (INER per its acronym in Spanish). At admission the patient was severely ill, with uremia, renal failure and metabolic acidosis, and a bacteremic infection originating likely from peritonitis. The patient deteriorated rapidly and died the same day. It is uncertain what was the contribution of the influenza virus H5N2 to the final clinical status of the patient. The primary avian influenza subtypes implicated in causing respiratory diseases inhumans are H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6. Additionally, avian influenza viruses like H5N1 or H7N3 have also been implicated in human infections causing conjunctivitis but not respiratory disease. H5N2 has been associated primarily with migratory birds and commercial and backyard poultry infections. This was the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally and the first avian H5 virus infection in a person reported in Mexico. Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico. The patient had multiple underlying medical conditions, and relatives reported that the patient had already been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms. Results from RT-PCR of a respiratory sample collected and tested at INER on 24 April indicated a non-subtypeable influenza A virus. On 8 May, the sample was sent for sequencing to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Emerging Diseases Center for Research in Infectious Diseases (CIENI per its acronym in Spanish) of INER, which indicated that the sample was positive for influenza A(H5N2). On 20 May, the sample was received at the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE per its acronym in Spanish) of the Mexico National Influenza Centre, for analysis by RT-PCR, obtaining a positive result for influenza A. On 22 May, sequencing of the sample confirmed the influenza subtype was A(H5N2). No further cases were reported during the epidemiological investigation. Of the 17 contacts identified and monitored at the hospital where the case died, one reported a runny nose between 28 and 29 April. Samples taken from these hospital contacts between 27 and 29 May tested negative for influenza and SARS-CoV 2. Twelve additional contacts (seven symptomatic and five asymptomatic) were identified near the case’s residence. Samples of pharyngeal exudate, nasopharyngeal swabs and serum were obtained from these individuals. On 28 May, the InDRE reported that all twelve samples from contacts near the patient’s residence tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B, as determined by RT-PCR. Molecular evidence suggests that the strain possibly derived from a common avian H5N2 ancestor from 2019 of Central Mexico. Although a direct contact of the patient in this study with poultry or other domestic animals could not be confirmed, it is plausible that this avian virus, causing high disease burden in chickens in this geographical area in 2024 could be the source of the human case described here, as human to human transmission seems implausible. Several comorbidities in the case described here led to a fatal outcome, but the pathogenicity of the isolate needs to be further studied. Further studies are required to determine the predicted pathogenicity of the virus and to predict its capability for human-to-human transmission and potential threat to human health.

IAV in cats is sporadic and self-limiting but the recent findings of high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) with genetic signatures of mammalian adaptation, in domestic cats, has raised new concerns about the potential role of cats in the virus ecology. The present study aimed to investigate the circulation of IAV in companion animals' shelters in North-eastern Italy. All samples were collected from feral cats living in feline colonies that were hosted in the companion animals' shelters for the requisite period to administer the veterinary treatments. Between 2021 and 2022, 389 oropharyngeal swabs and 279 sera were collected. All swabs tested negative for IAV and the only one ELISA positive serum sample resulted H5 positive by HI test with a titer of 1:80. Despite the sporadic occurrence of influenza in cats, continuous monitoring is crucial due to the evolving zoonotic nature of the virus. 1 Introduction Influenza viruses are negative-sense, single stranded segmented RNA viruses, belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. This virus family comprises four genera: A, B, C, and D (1–3). In humans, influenza type A and B viruses are responsible for acute respiratory diseases, but while type B primarily circulates among humans, type A viruses (IAV) have been detected in a variety of animal species including bird and mammals (1, 4, 5). Influenza A viruses are categorized into different subtypes based on the antigenic profile of the two major surface glycoproteins: the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) (3, 6). Influenza are rapidly evolving viruses, whose evolution is driven by the so called “antigenic drift,” a constant accumulation of point mutations primarily affecting the HA gene, and “antigenic shift,” resulting from genetic reassortment events among different influenza viral strains originating even from different animal species (1, 7). Each IAV subtype commonly exhibits restricted host range. However, there are instances where strains belonging to a subtype specific to one host species may be transmitted to another species. Wild aquatic migratory birds are considered to be the natural reservoirs for these viruses, and spill over events into other animal hosts such as horses, cats, dogs, and swine can occur (8–11). IAV disease in cats is infrequent and typically self-limiting, however, pathogenic strains may cause a severe disease, resulting in high mortality. There are four described IAV subtypes mainly associated with acute respiratory syndrome in cats: canine influenza H3N2, low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H7N2, the pandemic H1N1 swine-origin and the high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 (12). The HPAI H5N1 virus has caused significant losses to poultry flocks and wild bird populations and there is a growing concern as an increasing number of mammalian species are becoming susceptible to H5N1 virus. From 2003 to 2023, more than ten cases of IAV infections, involving felines were reported worldwide (13, 14). It is noteworthy that in six of these cases, the feed containing raw chicken meat was suspected to be the source of the infection with H5N1 virus (13–21). Recently, in Europe two cases of HPAI H5N1 infections were reported, in domestic cats exhibiting respiratory and neurological signs. In both cases, in France in December 2022 and in Poland in 2023, the involved IAV strain showed genetic signatures of mammalian adaptation (22, 23). Furthermore, in April 2023, a cat in Italy, living in a rural farm with H5N1 HPAIV-positive hens, seroconverted without exhibiting clinical signs (24). In late March and early April 2024, Texas reported detection of HPAI H5N1 in several cats from several dairy farms that had experienced HPAI H5N1 virus infections in dairy cows (25). This suggests that the virus may have spread to the cats either from the affected dairy cows, raw cow milk, or from wild birds associated with those farms. These recent cases have raised concerns about the potential role of cats in the virus ecology. In 2006, a H3N2 strain, known as canine influenza, emerged in Southeast Asia, and rapidly spread in the region, becoming endemic before reaching the USA and Canada (12, 26–28). Subsequently, H3N2 outbreaks were observed among cats, characterized by fever, sneezing, coughing, respiratory distress, and lethargy. Although cats can contract the virus through direct transmission from dogs or from other infected cats, it replicates less effectively in cats compared to dogs (29). Moreover, natural outbreaks among felines are infrequent and mainly occurred within shelter environments (29). Several studies suggest that in 2009, cats globally became infected with the pandemic H1N1 swine origin influenza virus, probably due to a direct transmission from their owners. In Italy, it was reported an outbreak of respiratory and gastrointestinal disease in a colony of 90 cats, leading to 25 fatalities (12, 30). The first detection of H7N2 in cats was reported in the USA in December 2016 (29, 31). The virus was closely related to strains that circulated in poultry markets in the USA between 1994 and 2006. Subsequently, the virus spread into several cat-shelters, and during the outbreaks, a veterinarian became infected with the H7N2 virus of feline origin, exhibiting respiratory symptoms, and serological evidence of H7N2 infection was identified in a shelter worker (29, 31). The present study was part of a broader investigation on zoonotic pathogens in cats at companion animals' shelters in North-eastern Italy, that investigated the circulation of Capnocytophaga spp., Bartonella spp., Norovirus, Rotavirus A, Cowpoxvirus, Mammalian Orthoreovirus (MRV), Hepatitis E virus (32), and SARS-CoV-2 (33), including IAV in feral cats. The companion animals' shelters that participated in the present study, hosted feral cats, primarily originating from different feline colonies, for the required period to deliver veterinary care and treatments. During this period, workers (veterinarians and volunteers) were potentially exposed to zoonotic pathogens due to the unknown infection status of the hosted cats. Consequently, companion animals' shelters were identified as a potential hotspot for the transmission of zoonotic pathogens due to the high turnover of feral cats and frequent contacts with volunteers, who often lacked knowledge about biosecurity and zoonotic risks. Furthermore, the cat colonies from which cats were sampled are in an HPAIV epidemic area in 2021–2022. It is plausible to assume that feral cats may have been exposed to H5N1 positive birds during this period. Although literature documented low prevalence of HPAI H5N1 antibodies in cat sera even in areas where birds tested positive for HPAI H5N1 virus, the monitoring is crucial. This becomes even more important following recent cases of HPAI H5N1 in cats. 2 Material and method 2.1 Samples and sampling area Oropharyngeal (OP) swabs and sera were collected from eight different companion animals' shelters located in seven provinces, within Veneto and Trentino Alto Adige regions in North-eastern Italy, from May 2021 to June 2022 (Figure 1). A sample size of 385 animals was considered necessary to estimate prevalence with a 95% confidence interval, assuming an expected prevalence of 50% (with no prior information about the population). For each cat were collected one OP swab and one serum and each animal was sampled only once. Given the nature of the animals—feral cats from colonies housed in shelters only for medical treatment and then released—it was not possible to sample animals more than once. Additionally, an oropharyngeal swab was selected as considered less invasive than a nasal swab. OP swabs collected in 2021 were examined individually, whereas OP swabs collected in 2022 were analyzed in pools of 10 samples each, to optimize resources. Pooled samples originated from the same province. Each swab was rehydrated with 1 mL of Minimal Essential Medium (Sigma Aldrich, Burlington, Massachusetts, USA) supplemented with antibiotics, albumin 0.5% v/v, HEPES buffer. Each sample was stored at −80°C until use. All samples were collected by veterinarians for diagnostic, therapeutic, or prophylactic purposes adhered to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments (National law: D.L. 26/2014), with ethical committee approval received for the study (CE_IZSVE 8/2020). Figure 1 Figure 1. Map illustrating the sampling zones of the study. Each province is color-coded, with the percentage of sampled animals from each province relative to the total sampled in the study indicated. Veneto provinces: Venice (VE), Padua (PD), Rovigo (RO), Vicenza (VI), Verona (VR), Trentino-Alto Adige provinces: Trento (TR), and Bozen (BZ). 2.2 RNA extraction and RT real-time PCR screening Viral RNA was extracted from 100 μL of each sample using a semi-automated method on the KingFisher™ Flex Purification System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), with the ID Gene™ Mag Universal Extraction Kit (Innovative Diagnostics, Grabels, France). Additionally, to assess RNA extraction efficiency and validate each negative result, a universal heterologous RNA control, Intype IC-RNA (Indical Bioscience GmbH, Leipzig, Germany) was added to each sample during the extraction phase at a 1:10 ratio of the total elution volume and subsequently co-amplified using the primers and probe indicated by Hoffman et al. (34). Extracted viral RNA was stored at −80°C until use. Extracted RNA samples were tested for IAV using a one-step Real Time RT-PCR targeting the conserved M gene of IAV of swine origin (35), performed on a CFX 96 Deep Well Real time PCR system (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) with the AgPath-ID™ One-Step RT-PCR (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). In detail, the reaction was carried out in 25 μL volume consisting of 2.5 μL of water, 12.5 μL of 2X RT-PCR AgPath-ID buffer, 2 μL of premix of the target primers IAV and 2 μL premix of internal control (IC) primers EGFP as described in Hoffman et al. (35), 1 μL enzyme mix, 5 μL of the extracted RNA. Real time RT-PCR reactions were run using the following thermal profile: retro-transcription at 45°C for 10 min; a Taq activation step at 95°C for 10 min followed by 42 cycles with denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at 55°C for 20 s, extension at 72°C for 30 s. In light of the method's capability to identify influenza strains circulating in swine, it is therefore able to identify the pandemic strain currently circulating among humans as well. The in silico analysis conducted using all feline and canine influenza sequence available in GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), last accessed July 2020) showed a correct alignment of primers and probes used with all the eight sequence (Supplementary material 1). Method proved to be capable to detect the canine influenza strain available in the laboratory: A/canine/Korea/LBM412/08. Moreover, during the validation of the assay, one H5N1 avian strain were included: H5N1/chicken/3401/05, and the method in silico can detect HPAI H5N1 strains, circulating in Italy between January 2021 and December 2022 (Supplementary material 2). Furthermore, during the validation tests, the method showed to accurately detect samples positive for influenza when processed in pools of up to 10 samples per pool. The limit of detection (LoD) of the method, established during the validation process, was equal to 100.4TCID50/100 μl with a 96.3% of agreement between different replicates in different runs (data not shown). 2.3 Serological analysis The commercial ELISA kit Influenza A Virus Antibody Test Kit (ELISA1 - IDEXX, Westbrook, Maine, USA), with IAV antigen coated on the wells, was used as screening to analyse the serum samples. Samples positive to ELISA1 were tested in series by another commercial ELISA kit (ELISA2) ID Screen® Influenza A Antibody Competition Multi-species (IDVet, Grabels, France) with NP of IAV coated on the wells, was used to assess positive samples. Both the ELISA kits were used following the manufacturer instructions. The positivity cut-off for ELISA1 was S/N <0.60, for ELISA2 S/N ≤ 0.45. Furthermore, positive samples were assessed by haemagglutination inhibition test (HI) using the antigens selected according to available literature on IAV infections in cats (24, 36, 37) and namely: an H5 (H5N1 HPAI Aurkey/Italy/21VIR9520-3/2021), H7 (H7N1 A/Africa starling/England/983/79), H3 (H3N8 A/psitt/Italy/2873/00; H3N2 A/sw/It/312583/2009), and H1 (H1N1 A/swine/Italy/711/06; H1N2 A/swine/Italy/4159/06; H1N1 A/Verona/Italy/2810/09 human pandemic). Specifically, three volumes of receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE Seiken) were added to one volume of serum. The mixture was incubated overnight at +37°C, and subsequently inactivated at +56°C for 30 min and brought to a final dilution of 1:10 (v/v) adding six volumes of PBS. To remove non-specific haemagglutinating factors, one volume of chicken erythrocytes was added to 10 volumes of serum and incubated at +4°C under gentle shaking for 1 h, before removing erythrocytes by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min. HI tests were performed using four haemagglutinating units of virus with 0.5% chicken erythrocytes according to standard procedures. Two-fold dilutions were tested with the first dilution tested being 1:20. The HI tire was expressed as the last dilution at which complete HI was observed. 3 Results During the study period, OP swabs were collected from each of the 389 enrolled cats. One hundred and ninety-three samples were collected in 2021 and 196 in 2022. All sampled cats were European shorthair and their anamnestic information are resumed in Figure 2. More than half of the samples were collected during the warmer seasons, spring and summer, respectively 29.1% and 24.4 %. Samples were distributed in Veneto region in five provinces: Venice (n = 131, 33.7%), Padua (n = 67, 17.2%), Rovigo (n = 58, 14.9%), Vicenza (n = 53, 13.6%), Verona (n = 22, 5.7%), and in two provinces of Trentino Alto Adige: Trento (n = 42, 10.8%) and Bozen (n = 16, 4.1%) (Figure 1). Most sampled cats were young subjects: (n = 187 between one and five y/o and n = 114 were <1 y/o). Nineteen subjects were adult/senior cats (5–10 y/o, and >10 y/o), while for 69 cats this information was not available. Three hundred and twenty-nine animals were asymptomatic, ten showed respiratory signs, one exhibited gastrointestinal signs, 32 animals were found to have ectoparasites, nine animals showed skin lesions. Additionally, eight animals presented with more than one clinical signs. All the OP swabs tested negative for IAV screening by Real Time RT-PCR. Figure 2 Figure 2.

The sera were available only for 279 out of 389 cats. The serology performed with the screening ELISA1 on the 279 cat sera yielded a positive result for one sample (0.19 S/N) with an overall prevalence of 0.36% (n = 1/279). This sample was confirmed positive with ELISA2 (0.06 S/N) and by HI test with a titer of 1:80 for the H5 antigen. All other antigens (H7, H3, and H1) gave negative result. The positive sample originated from the Veneto region and pertained to a five-and-a-half-year-old spayed female cat that exhibited dermatological symptoms (diffuse alopecia) at the time of collection. 4 Discussion The present investigation was part of a wider research project conducted between 2021 and 2022 with the aim of determining the circulation of zoonotic and/or potentially zoonotic microorganism in health-shelters, considered as hot spot of animal-human transmission of microorganisms. The project included influenza viruses among the zoonotic agents and the present papers present results of a 13-month surveillance in eight health shelters located in North-eastern Italy. The tested health shelters were located in a densely populated poultry area (DPPA) with recurrent incursion of avian influenza infections by the H5N1 HPAI in wild and domestic avian species. In particular, during the study period, HPAI H5N1 epidemic occurred with 263 outbreaks in domestic poultry and at least 24 cases in wild avian species (38). The circulation of avian influenza during these epidemic outbreaks in colony cats, which potentially have been exposed to positive HPAI H5N1 influenza wild birds, is of significant interest. Our results suggested that the risk of exposure to IAV among the stray cats' population is low. The studied population did not report significant prevalences for IAV both in molecular and serological analyses, confirming the previous reports (29). Notwithstanding the assertion that close contact between companion animals and humans plays a significant role in the epidemiology of IAV (39, 40) in this study possibly the interaction between free-roaming, stray cats and humans is minimal. In addition, regarding the potential transmission of IAV from humans to cats at companion animals' shelters, our results showed no detection of the H1N1 pandemic strain (H1pdmN1pdm). This finding may be attributed, at least in part, to the widespread adoption of personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves in the post-pandemic period, which greatly limited influenza virus circulation in humans. In addition, over 50% of the samples were collected during summer and spring, when the spread of influenza in humans is typically limited. The available literature indicates that the majority of influenza outbreaks in cats and instances of transmission to humans have occurred in animal shelters, which are characterized by high population density (12, 29). However, all cats housed in the shelters under study, tested negative for the pandemic strain as well, confirming the effective management of the facilities. In conclusion, our data indicate that influenza in cats remains a sporadic infection, with the transmission of IAV from avian species to cats occurring only rarely. Nevertheless, in light of the progressive mutation of IAV and the potential for its spread to wild and domestic mammals, it is imperative to maintain surveillance programs on these species, as already implemented by several European Union member states (41). Feral cats, due to their ethological intermediate position between domestic and wild, and their frequent contact with humans, represent an optimal epidemiological sentinel for the risk of IAV mutations and spread. Passive surveillance on this species is also more feasible than the one on wildlife.

Meanwhile, Pennsylvania's patient had a variant H1N2 (H1N2v) infection and had occupational exposure to swine.So far 7 variant flu cases have been reported during the 2024-25 flu season in the United States, 4 from H1N2v, 2 from H3N2v, and 1 from H1N1v.No symptoms were reported in the patients' contacts, and no related human-to-human cases have been identified.Sporadic human infections with swine flu occur in the United States and other countries, most often in people who have contact with pigs or their environments. Many of the cases in the United States occur during the summer months, when agricultural fairs take place. CDC ends its probe of cucumber Salmonella outbreak after 551 cases News brief Jim Wappes Topics Salmonella Foodborne Disease Bill Couch / Flickr cc The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) yesterday declared its investigation into a multistate Salmonella outbreak tied to cucumbers over after 551 cases and 155 hospitalizations, an increase of 102 cases and 30 hospitalizations since its last update on July 2."Epidemiologic, traceback, and laboratory data showed that cucumbers were contaminated with Salmonella and made people sick," the CDC said. "Testing identified the Salmonella Braenderup outbreak strain in untreated canal water used by a grower in Florida. "An additional grower was identified as a likely source of illnesses in this outbreak. Cucumbers from both of these growers are no longer in season and products are no longer on shelves."On May 31, Fresh Start Produce Sales Inc. issued a cucumber recall because of the outbreak. But the CDC said, "Recalled cucumbers did not account for all the illnesses in this outbreak."Two outbreak strainsOf the 551 illnesses, 269 people were infected with the Salmonella Braenderup strain and 282 people with Salmonella Africana. Illness-onset dates range from March 11 to July 26, with patient ages ranging from less than 1 year to 94, with a median age of 48. Sixty-eight percent of patients are female, and 84% are White.Recalled cucumbers did not account for all the illnesses in this outbreak.New York state reported the most cases, 69, followed by Pennsylvania (68), Florida (60), Georgia (48), and Virginia (48). Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia confirmed cases."The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses," the CDC said. High-dose, adjuvanted flu vaccines better protect seniors from symptoms, hospital stays, study finds News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Influenza Vaccines James Gathany / CDC High-dose (HD) and adjuvanted influenza vaccines offered the best protection for people aged 65 years and older against symptoms and hospitalization during the 2022-23 flu season, concludes a real-world study published this week in Clinical Infectious Diseases.High-dose flu vaccines contain four times the standard dose (SD), while adjuvanted vaccines contain an extra immune-boosting ingredient. In 2022, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended high-dose, adjuvanted, or recombinant (cell-based) vaccines over SD vaccines for older adults, who are at elevated risk for severe disease and flu-related hospitalization and death.Kaiser Permanente Southern California researchers retrospectively assessed the comparative vaccine effectiveness (cVE) of HD, adjuvanted, and SD cell-based flu vaccines versus SD egg-based vaccines. Participants were 495,119 adults with a median age of 73 years who received a flu vaccine dose from August through December 2022 and were followed up to May 2023. Of all participants, 54.9% were women and 46.3% were White."Overall, influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) has remained low (<50% between 2014 and 2022), particularly in seasons of mismatch between the vaccine and circulating strains," the study authors wrote. "To improve vaccine platforms and production, high-dose (HD), adjuvanted, recombinant, and standard-dose (SD) cell-based vaccines became available in addition to egg-based SD vaccines."Adjuvanted vaccines most effectiveIn total, 74.8% of participants received high-dose flu vaccines, and the remainder received SD egg-based (13.9%), SD cell-based (6.5%), or adjuvanted (4.7%) vaccines. Our research showed that there were advantages for older people to receive high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines over the standard vaccine. Jennifer Ku, PhD, MPH Adjusted cVEs against flu-related medical visits in the HD, adjuvanted, and SD cell-based vaccine groups were 9.1%, 16.9%, and −6.3%, respectively. Adjusted cVEs against hospitalization in the three groups were 25.1%, 61.6%, and 26.4%, respectively."Our research showed that there were advantages for older people to receive high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines over the standard vaccine," lead author Jennifer Ku, PhD, MPH, an infectious disease epidemiologist, said in a Kaiser Permanente news release. "While seasonal variation exists, it is expected that seniors will continue to benefit from flu vaccines that are stronger than the traditional standard-dose vaccines." DoD-funded study to collect data on antibiotic-resistant war wounds in Ukraine News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship President of Ukraine / Flickr cc The University of Colorado (UC) School of Medicine announced yesterday that it's been awarded $5 million from the US Department of Defense (DoD) to collect and study data on antibiotic-resistant wounds linked to the war in Ukraine.Wound infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms have substantially increased in Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country in 2022, complicating treatment for frontline providers. Yet no systematic data for wound infections exist in Ukraine. Through the project, called the Antimicrobial Resistance Research to Improve Outcomes of Traumatic Wounds study (ARROW) study, UC researchers will work with researchers in Ukraine to create infrastructure for collecting such data.Wound infection a 'top concern' for US militaryThe project aims to enroll up to 1,000 patients and collect data on injury and wound characteristics, molecular testing, and clinical outcomes, with researchers in Ukraine collecting specimens at three frontline hospitals and two referral centers over the next 2 years. UC researchers say these data will help providers in Ukraine during the current conflict and enable clinical trials to test solutions that help prevent and treat wound infections in future conflicts."Wound infection is consistently identified as a top concern in Ukraine and the U.S. military, which is why we are moving forward on this project first," Adit Ginde, MD, MPH, a professor of emergency medicine at UC and principal investigator on the project, said in a UC press release. "The first step is actually describing the problem in a more systematic way and then quickly pivot[ing] to clinical trials."Roman Fishchuk, MD, a researcher at Central City Clinical Hospital of Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine, will lead the in-country data collection effort.“I'm grateful to our colleagues at the University of Colorado for being brave, working with us, and being so proactive," Fishchuk said. "This partnership is inspiring and helps us do our job and think about research in new ways." Study reveals how microbiota-based treatment may help prevent recurrent C diff News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Clostridium difficile Artur Plawgo / iStock Analysis of data from a phase 3 clinical trial provides some clues as to how a microbiota-based treatment helps prevent recurrent Clostridioides difficile (rCDI) infection, researchers reported yesterday in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.For the study, researchers analyzed stool samples from participants in PUNCH CD3, a randomized clinical trial that found the fecal microbiota-based live biotherapeutic Rebyota (RBL) was clinically superior to placebo in preventing rCDI. The researchers wanted to investigate the extent to which RBL restores the balance of bacteria and bile acid (BA) in the gut microbiome following antibiotic therapy, which is typically the first line of treatment for rCDI patients but often causes further gut microbiome disruption and increases the risk of future recurrence.RBL linked to microbiota, BA changes Stool samples were collected from participants who received a dose of RBL or placebo at baseline and 1, 4, and 8 weeks after treatment. Sequencing of those samples revealed that, before administration, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacilli dominated the microbiota community, and primary BAs were more prevalent than secondary BAs in trial participants. These characteristics are associated with reduced resistance to C difficile colonization, the study authors note. "Thus, trial participants were dysbiotic before study treatment in ways that could enable CDI recurrence," they wrote.In participants who responded to treatment with RBL or placebo, clinical success after administration correlated with shifts to predominantly Bacteroidia and Clostridia, a significant increase in the Microbiome Health Index, and a shift from primary to secondary BAs. But several microbiota and BA changes were more extensive in RBL-treated responders than in placebo-treated responders, and microbiota changes correlated with BA changes."Overall, the microbiome and BA analyses herein support a model in which Bacteroidia restoration, decreased Gammaproteobacteria levels, and the increased metabolism of primary to secondary BAs were potential drivers of RBL clinical efficacy," the authors concluded.RBL was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of rCDI in 2022 based on data from PUNCH CD3 and other clinical trials.

According to study authors, the combination includes Pfizer’s mRNA-based influenza vaccine with the licensed COVID-19 vaccine.1Image credit: Thaut Images | stock.adobe.com“We are encouraged by the robust immunogenicity we saw with our combination vaccine against influenza A, which was similar to what we had seen for our initial quadrivalent influenza vaccine where we saw superior relative vaccine efficacy against a comparator flu vaccine,” Annaliesa Anderson, PhD, senior vice president and head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, said in a news release.1Influenza is reported to cause around 140,000 to 710,00 hospitalizations and 12,000 to 52,000 deaths in the US each year.1 The virus contains 4 types of infection, including A, B, C, and D; however A and B cause the seasonal epidemics of the disease, recognized as flu season. Study authors noted that influenza A viruses are separated into subtypes based on 2 proteins on the exterior of the virus—hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), with 18 different H subtypes and 11 different N subtypes.2Individuals 65 years and older face an increased risk of hospitalization and death caused from influenza, despite receiving a vaccine that matches the circulating strain. Study authors noted that available influenza vaccines provide 40% to 60% protection annually and is decreasing protection in years with poor corresponding of strains.1However, because influenza strains change within the seasons, researchers noted that it becomes difficult to match the vaccine for the upcoming epidemics, which are typically chosen more than 6 months before the next season. mRNA technology could solve this issue due to its prompt manufacturing, allowing for a more accurate strain match.1Researchers assessed the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single combination dose to evaluate its immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A and B, in a phase 3 randomized, observer-blinded study (NCT06178991). The study included more than 8000 individuals aged 18 to 64, aiming to demonstrate if the antibody responses to influenza and SARS-CoV-2 were non-inferior to standard of care, according to study authors.1About The TrialTrial Name: A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a Combined Modified RNA Vaccine Candidate Against COVID-19 and InfluenzaClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06178991Sponsor: BioNTech SECompletion Date (Estimated): November 2024The results found that the trivalent combination displayed higher influenza A responses compared to a licensed influenza vaccine while showing lower geometric mean titers and seroconversion against influenza B, according to the results. Additionally, the combination displayed similar results to protect against SARS-CoV-2, compared to the COVID-19 vaccine. However, the study authors noted that the trial did not meet one of primary immunogenicity objectives of non-inferiority against the influenza B strain.1“We are committed to developing vaccines that will reduce the burden of respiratory diseases and believe that combination vaccines are the most efficient way to do this. Today’s results provide insight and direction towards achieving this goal, and we remain optimistic about our combination COVID-19 and influenza program, for which we are evaluating the next steps,” said Anderson in a news release.1The study authors noted that no new safety signals were found among individuals that received the combination vaccine.1“The insights gained from this combination vaccine trial are highly valuable and will play a crucial role in guiding the further development of Pfizer’s and our combination vaccine program against influenza and COVID-19,” Ugur Sahin, MD, CEO and co-founder of BioNTech, said in a news release. “We are committed to drawing on our experience in developing mRNA-based vaccine candidates against multiple antigens and believe we can successfully accomplish this task in collaboration with our partner Pfizer.”1REFERENCES1.

Read time: 3 minutes In recent years, public health measures, surveillance, and vaccination have helped bring about significant progress in reducing the impact of seasonal flu epidemics, caused by human influenza viruses A and B. However, a possible outbreak of avian influenza A (commonly known as ‘bird flu’) in mammals, including humans, poses a significant threat to public health. The Cusack group at EMBL Grenoble studies the replication process of influenza viruses. A new study from this group sheds light on the different mutations that the avian influenza virus can undergo to be able to replicate in mammalian cells. Some avian influenza strains can cause severe disease and mortality. Fortunately, significant biological differences between birds and mammals normally prevent avian influenza from spreading from birds to other species. To infect mammals, the avian influenza virus must mutate to overcome two main barriers: the ability to enter the cell and to replicate within that cell. To cause an epidemic or pandemic, it must also acquire the ability to be transmitted between humans.

Of particular concern is the recent unexpected infection of dairy cows in the USA by an avian H5N1 strain, which risks becoming endemic in cattle. This might facilitate adaptation to humans, and indeed, a few cases of transmission to humans have been reported, so far resulting in only mild symptoms.At the heart of this process is the polymerase, an enzyme that orchestrates the virus’s replication inside host cells. This flexible protein can rearrange itself according to the different functions it performs during infection. These include transcription – copying the viral RNA into messenger RNA to make viral proteins – and replication – making copies of the viral RNA to package into new viruses.Viral replication is a complex process to study because it involves two viral polymerases and a host cell protein – ANP32. Together, these three proteins form the replication complex, a molecular machine that carries out replication. ANP32 is known as a ‘chaperone’, meaning that it acts as a stabiliser for certain cellular proteins. It can do this thanks to a key structure – its long acidic tail. In 2015, it was discovered that ANP32 is critical for influenza virus replication, but its function was not fully understood. The results of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications, show that ANP32 acts as a bridge between the two viral polymerases – called replicase and encapsidase. The names reflect the two distinct conformations taken up by the polymerases to perform two different functions – creating copies of the viral RNA (replicase) and packaging the copy inside a protective coating with ANP32’s help (encapsidase). Through its tail, ANP32 acts as a stabiliser for the replication complex, allowing it to form within the host cell. Interestingly, the ANP32 tail differs between birds and mammals, although the core of the protein remains very similar. This biological difference explains why the avian influenza virus does not replicate easily in mammals and humans. “The key difference between avian and human ANP32 is a 33-amino-acid insertion in the avian tail, and the polymerase has to adapt to this difference,” explained Benoît Arragain, a postdoctoral fellow in the Cusack group and first author of the publication. “For the avian-adapted polymerase to replicate in human cells, it must acquire certain mutations to be able to use human ANP32.”To better understand this process, Arragain and his collaborators obtained the structure of the replicase and encapsidase conformations of a human-adapted avian influenza polymerase (from strain H7N9) while they were interacting with human ANP32. This structure gives detailed information about which amino acids are important in forming the replication complex and which mutations could allow the avian influenza polymerase to adapt to mammalian cells.To obtain these results, Arragain carried out in vitro experiments at EMBL Grenoble, using the Eukaryotic Expression Facility, the ISBG biophysical platform, and the cryo-electron microscopy platform available through the Partnership for Structural Biology. “We also collaborated with the Naffakh group at the Institut Pasteur, who carried out cellular experiments,” added Arragain. “In addition, we obtained the structure of the human type B influenza replication complex, which is similar to that of influenza A. The cellular experiments confirmed our structural data.”These new insights into the influenza replication complex can be used to study polymerase mutations in other similar strains of the avian influenza virus. It is therefore possible to use the structure obtained from the H7N9 strain and adapt it to other strains such as H5N1.“The threat of a new pandemic caused by highly pathogenic, human-adapted avian influenza strains with a high mortality rate needs to be taken seriously,” said Stephen Cusack, EMBL Grenoble Senior Scientist who led the study and has been studying influenza viruses for 30 years. “One of the key responses to this threat includes monitoring mutations in the virus in the field. Knowing this structure allows us to interpret these mutations and assess if a strain is on the path of adaptation to infect and transmit between mammals.” These results are also useful in the long-term perspective of anti-influenza drug development, as there are no existing drugs that target the replication complex specifically. “But it’s just the beginning,” said Cusack. “What we want to do next is to understand how the replication complex works dynamically, in other words, to know in more detail how it actively performs replication.” The group has already successfully carried out similar studies on the role of influenza polymerase in the viral transcription process.Reference: Arragain B, Krischuns T, Pelosse M, et al.

ANP32 comprises an LRR domain and a long C-terminal low complexity acidic region (LCAR). Here we present evidence suggesting that ANP32 is recruited to the replication complex as an electrostatic chaperone that stabilises the encapsidase moiety within apo-polymerase symmetric dimers that are distinct for influenza A and B polymerases. The ANP32 bound encapsidase, then forms the asymmetric replication complex with the replicase, which is embedded in a parental ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP). Cryo-EM structures reveal the architecture of the influenza A and B replication complexes and the likely trajectory of the nascent RNA product into the encapsidase. The cryo-EM map of the FluB replication complex shows extra density attributable to the ANP32 LCAR wrapping around and stabilising the apo-encapsidase conformation. These structures give new insight into the various mutations that adapt avian strain polymerases to use the distinct ANP32 in mammalian cells.

The functional context for both processes is the viral ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), a flexible supercoiled rod-shaped particle, in which the influenza virus genome is packaged by multiple copies of the viral nucleoprotein (NP) with one FluPol bound to the conserved 3’ and 5’ ends of either the vRNA (vRNP) or the cRNA (cRNP). Both processes require FluPol to recruit essential host factors. For transcription, FluPol binds to cellular RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to gain access to nascent, capped transcripts from which capped transcription primers are excised, a process known as cap-snatching3,4. In particular, FluPol binding to the serine 5 phosphorylated C-terminal domain of Pol II (Pol II pS5 CTD) is conserved amongst FluPolA, B and C although the binding sites are divergent3,5,6. It has been recently proposed that the Pol II pS5 CTD may serve as a platform for both transcription and replication7, but additionally for replication, the highly conserved acidic nuclear protein 32 (ANP32) is an obligatory host factor8,9. ANP32 comprises a folded, N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain followed by a Glu-, Asp-rich intrinsically disordered region known as the low complexity acidic region (LCAR). ANP32 proteins have multiple cellular functions, notably as histone chaperones10. Of the three functional human ANP32 (hANP32) isoforms, hANP32A and hANP32B support human adapted influenza A (FluA) and B (FluB) virus replication11,12,13,14, but not hANP32E15. ANP32 is required for both vRNA to cRNA and cRNA to vRNA replication16,17. It is thought that ANP32 plays at least two mechanistic roles. First, it stabilises the formation of the replication complex, an asymmetric FluPol dimer comprising a replicase, which is part of a parental RNP and synthesises the genome copy and an encapsidase, a newly synthesised apo-FluPol, which binds the 5’ end of the nascent RNA replicate to nucleate formation of a progeny RNP. Second, ANP32 is proposed to recruit successive NPs to the replication complex via a direct interaction between the LCAR and NP thus facilitating co-replicational packaging of product RNA into a progeny RNP18,19. Extensive biochemical and mutagenesis studies have previously shown that hANP32A binds to FluPol20,21 and NP18,19. Moreover, the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the influenza C (FluC) replication complex, that is, the replicase-encapsidase dimer bound to ANP32, has been determined22.These data underlie the proposed model, but there are a number of aspects of the replication mechanism that remain unclear. Firstly, the structure of the replication complex has not been determined for FluA or FluB viruses, for which most of the biochemical and molecular virological data have been obtained. In the case of FluA, an avian specific 33 residue insertion in avian ANP32A (avANP32A) compared to hANP32A is critical to explain why avian adapted FluPolA polymerases cannot replicate in human cells8. Indeed, avian to human inter-species transmission necessitates adaptive mutations in the avian polymerase (typically PB2/E627K, D701N or Q591R) to be able to productively use the mammalian ANP32 for replication23. A complete molecular understanding behind these intriguing observations is still lacking. Moreover, given that the binding sites of the Pol II pS5 CTD on FluPolA, B and C are significantly different, it is likely that there has been co-evolution in the mode of ANP32 binding since the divergence of FluA, B and C. Therefore, it is of particular importance to characterise structurally the FluA and FluB replication complexes.As a step towards further understanding of the role of ANP32 in replication, we first analysed binding of hANP32A to FluPolA and FluPolB. We show that, at least in vitro, it acts like an electrostatic chaperone24 to stabilise apo-FluPol dimers at physiological salt concentrations (~150 mM NaCl), with distinct roles for the LRR and LCAR domains. In the case of apo-FluPolB, cryo-EM analysis reveals a previously undescribed apo-dimer structure with a 2-fold symmetrical interface, distinct from that of the previously described FluPolA dimer25,26,27, with one monomer being preferentially in the encapsidase configuration. Additional cryo-EM structures (summarised in Table 1) show that hANP32A is an integral part of the FluA (strain A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9)) and FluB (strain B/Memphis/13/2003) replication complexes. These structures reveal that there are significant differences in the contacts between the replicase, the encapsidase and hANP32A and in domain orientations, compared to the previously published FluC replication complex. Moreover, in the FluB replication complex, additional density clearly suggests the trajectory of the LCAR wrapping around the encapsidase. We also provide minigenome data that combined with extensive existing information in the literature validate these structures as functionally relevant. Importantly, they also provide a rationale for many of the observed mutations that favour adaption of avian FluPol to mammalian cells and that have eluded a full explanation for many years. Furthermore, these results are particularly relevant in the light of the pandemic threat posed by currently circulating, highly pathogenic avian strains, particularly A/H5N1 clades 2.3.2.1c and 2.3.4.4b. These viruses have infected diverse wild and domestic animals, including recently cows28,29, as well as humans, with often a high mortality rate30. Finally, we propose a generalised trimer model of replication, whereby an ANP32-stabilised incoming apo-FluPol dimer, distinct for FluPolA and FluPolB, interacts with a replication competent vRNP or cRNP to form the functional and dynamic replication complex.Table 1 Summary of FluPolA, FluPolB, and replication complex structuresFull size tableResultsIn vitro, human ANP32A acts as an electrostatic chaperone for apo-influenza A and B polymerasesRecently it has been shown that proteins DAXX and ANP32 act as ‘electrostatic’ chaperones that exhibit disaggregase activity dependent on extensive polyAsp/Glu stretches within their sequences24. Such chaperones bind to basic peptides on the target protein and have a maximal effect between 25 and 150 mM NaCl, declining in activity between 150 and 300 mM, indicative of electrostatic interactions. To investigate whether hANP32A acts as a chaperone for apo-FluPol, we analysed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and mass photometry31 the interaction between recombinant apo-FluPolA/H7N9 or apo-FluPolB/Memphis with full-length and truncated variants of hANP32A as a function of NaCl concentration (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 1: Biochemical and biophysical analysis of the interaction of FluPolA/H7N9-4M and FluPolB with hANP32A.SDS-PAGE and mass photometry analysis of FluPolA/H7N9-4M at 500 mM NaCl without (A) or with (B) hANP32A.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file (n = 1–3 independent experiments).Full size imageFor this study, we chose to use a functional, monomeric mutant of FluPolA for the following reasons. Apo-FluPolA forms dimers with a 2-fold symmetrical interface mediated by loops from the cores of each of the three subunits25,26,27. The peripheral PA endonuclease (PA-ENDO) and PB2 C-terminal (PB2-C) domains remain flexible in cryo-EM structures26,27, but take up the replicase conformation when constrained in a crystal26. It has been proposed that, for FluPolA, template realignment following internal initiation of cRNA to vRNA replication would be specifically facilitated by transient trimer formation involving a third apo-polymerase interacting via the symmetrical dimer interface with the replicase moiety of the replication complex22,26,32. However, loop mutations that abolish FluPolA symmetrical dimerisation are not detrimental to FluPol activity in the minigenome assay7. Furthermore, they are selected for in infected cells when virus evolves to use the usually non-permissive hANP32E, in the absence of hANP32A and hANP32B15. It was concluded from the latter work that optimal virus replication requires the correct balance between competing symmetric and asymmetric FluPolA dimer formation, consistent with a previous study32. To characterise structurally the FluA asymmetric replication complex, without interference from the competing symmetric dimer, we therefore used in the following analysis the monomeric FluPolA/H7N9-4M mutant, bearing the PA/E349K, PA/R490I, PB1/K577G and PB2/G74R mutations. This mutant was demonstrated to be active in vitro and in cells in previous studies aimed at elucidating the role of the Pol II pS5 CTD in replication7.In Fig. 1, we present SEC experiments performed at µM FluPol concentration and complementary mass photometry measurements performed at nM FluPol concentration. Different NaCl concentrations ranging from 500 to 100 mM have been tested in the presence or absence of hANP32A, for apo-FluPolA/H7N9-4M and apo-FluPolB. In Supplementary Fig. 1, additional experiments at 150 mM NaCl compare the effect of full-length hANP32A (1-249), the LRR domain alone (1-149), the LCAR alone (144-249), or the LRR domain with half the LCAR (1-199).In SEC, full-length hANP32A is unable to bind apo-FluPolA/H7N9-4M at 500 or 300 mM NaCl but does so at physiological salt concentrations (150–100 mM NaCl), resulting in a broadening and a shift in the elution profile (Fig. 1B, D, F, G, left, H). Complementary mass photometry, shows that, in presence of hANP32A, apo-FluPolA/H7N9-4M remains mainly monomeric at all NaCl concentrations, with a small fraction of dimers at 150 and 100 mM (Fig. 1B, D, F, G, right). In the absence of hANP32A, apo-FluPolA/H7N9-4M is soluble and monomeric at 500 and 300 mM NaCl, whereas at 150 mM, it precipitates prior to SEC although mass photometry indicates the presence of soluble apo-FluPolA/H7N9-4M monomers (Fig. 1A, C, E).When only the hANP32A LRR domain (1-149) is used at 150 mM NaCl, apo-FluPolA/H7N9-4M again precipitates prior to SEC (Supplementary Fig. 1B left, E), but mass photometry shows mainly monomers with 8% dimers (Supplementary Fig. 1B right). With the LRR with half the LCAR (1–199) at 150 mM NaCl, binding, solubilisation and a small fraction of dimers (7%) is observed as for the full-length hANP32A but the SEC profile does not shift (Supplementary Fig. 1A, C, E). With the LCAR alone (149-249) at 150 mM NaCl, binding and a shifted SEC profile similar to full-length hANP32A are observed, but no dimers are detected in mass photometry (Supplementary Fig. 1A, D, E).Overall, these results show that only below 300 mM NaCl can hANP32A bind and solubilise apo-FluPolA/H7N9-4M at μM concentration and this depends on the presence of at least half the LCAR. Binding of the LCAR, either alone or with the LRR, to apo-FluPolA/H7N9-4M is mainly responsible for the broadened and shifted SEC profile. In addition, apo-FluPolA/H7N9-4M dimer formation requires the LRR, the LCAR alone being insufficient. These dimers are rare, and we show below that they correspond to the FluA asymmetric replication complex, consistent with the fact that the monomeric FluPolA/H7N9-4M mutant does not form symmetric dimers.For apo-FluPolB, complementary results are obtained. In the absence of hANP32A, the protein is soluble and mainly monomeric at 500 and 300 mM NaCl (Fig. 1I, K). At 150 mM NaCl, apo-FluPolB alone precipitates prior to SEC, but mass photometry shows that 14% dimers are formed (Fig. 1M). In the presence of hANP32A, at 500 mM NaCl, apo-FluPolB is monomeric and does not co-elute with hANP32A (Fig. 1J). It only binds to hANP32A at 300 and 150 mM NaCl, forming a monomer-dimer mixture with respectively 22 and 47% dimers, as also indicated by the SEC profile shift (Fig. 1L, N, P). At 150 mM NaCl, apo-FluPolB forms significantly more dimers in the presence of hANP32A (47%) than in its absence (14%) (Fig. 1M, N), while at 100 mM NaCl, apo-FluPolB is again mainly monomeric (Fig. 1O).Using hANP32A truncated constructs at 150 mM NaCl, the LCAR alone (144-249) stabilises apo-FluPolB dimer (46%) at a similar level to the full-length hANP32A (Supplementary Fig. 1F, I, J). With only the LRR domain (1-149), apo-FluPolB precipitates although mass photometry detects a small fraction (7%) of dimers (Supplementary Fig. 1G, J). Finally, with the LRR plus half the LCAR (1-199), partial apo-FluPolB solubilisation is achieved with 15% dimers formed (Supplementary Fig. 1H, J).These results shows that hANP32A LCAR is sufficient to stabilise the apo-FluPolB dimer at 150 mM NaCl concentration. A significantly smaller fraction of dimers can exist without hANP32A under these conditions at low protein concentration. Below we show by cryo-EM that this dimer is a novel symmetric FluPolB dimer, quite distinct from that of FluPolA.For completeness, we also present results for the wild-type FluPolA/H7N9 (FluPolA/H7N9-WT). As previously established26,27, and different from apo-FluPolB, apo-FluPolA/H7N9-WT without hANP32A forms equally symmetric dimers and monomers at 500 and 300 mM NaCl (Supplementary Fig. 2A, B, F). At 150 mM NaCl, the protein alone is not soluble in SEC (Supplementary Fig. 2C left, F) but mass photometry indicates a mixture of monomers, dimers and tetramers25 (Supplementary Fig. 2C right). In the presence of hANP32A at 150 mM NaCl, apo-FluPolA/H7N9-WT is fully soluble and mainly dimeric (85%) (Supplementary Fig. 2D, F). On the other hand, vRNA promoter bound FluPolA is mainly monomeric at low NaCl even in the absence of hANP32A (Supplementary Fig. 2E, F). These results show that binding of hANP32A to apo-FluPolA/H7N9-WT at physiological salt concentrations promotes soluble symmetrical dimer formation.Taken together, these results show that hANP32A binds to and stabilises dimers of apo-FluPolA/H7N9-WT and apo-FluPolB at physiological salt concentrations and that this depends mainly on the LCAR. Furthermore, hANP32A acts as a disaggregase for apo-FluPol at µM concentration only at physiological salt concentrations, consistent with it acting as an electrostatic chaperone, at least in vitro. We think that these ANP32 bound dimers are likely a major form of apo-FluPol in the nucleus, prior to any encounter with the RNPs that are already present, whether or not ANP32 plays an essential chaperone role in vivo.Human ANP32A binding to apo-influenza A and B polymerases promotes formation of the replication complexIn the preceding analysis, a minor fraction of hANP32A-bound FluPolA/H7N9-4M dimers are formed at 150 mM NaCl, this requiring at least the LRR domain (1-149). To characterise structurally the FluA asymmetric replication complex we analysed complexes of apo-FluPolA/H7N9-4M with hANP32A by cryo-EM (Supplementary Notes 1, 2; Table 1; Supplementary Table 1). As expected, the majority of particles are FluPolA/H7N9-4M monomers, exhibiting the PA-ENDO in the replicase conformation (ENDO(R)). Two distinct such structures were determined at 2.77 (CORE-ENDO(R)-1) and 2.54 (CORE-ENDO(R)-2) Å resolution respectively, differing in the degree of polymerase core opening (Supplementary Notes 1; Supplementary Table 1). Consistent with the biochemical and biophysical analysis, a small fraction of particles corresponds to the FluA replication complex, comprising a replicase and an encapsidase bridged by hANP32A. The overall map resolution is limited by the flexibility between the replicase and hANP32A-encapsidase moieties as well as the presence of a preferred orientation. To alleviate this, a smaller number of particles were selected to equilibrate the distribution of orientations, giving a final map of the FluA replication complex at 3.25 Å resolution. Focussed refinement on the separate replicase and hANP32A-encapsidase moieties further improved map quality to 3.21 and 3.13 Å resolution, respectively, allowing a relatively complete model to be built (Supplementary Notes 2, 3; Supplementary Table 1), with the replicase core being similar to that in the CORE-ENDO(R)-1 structure.Cryo-EM grids made after mixing apo-FluPolB and hANP32A show a majority of dimers with a 2-fold symmetric interface, which are quite distinct from those of FluPolA (Supplementary Notes 4, 5; Table 1; Supplementary Table 3). Several different pseudo-symmetric dimer structures were determined at 2.8 to 3.1 Å overall resolution, almost invariably comprising an encapsidase paired with a variable partner (Supplementary Notes 4). A minority of particles are apo-FluPolB trimers, whose overall structure was determined at 3.57 Å resolution. These particles comprise the FluB replication complex, which is similar to that of FluA, with an additional third polymerase forming a FluPolB symmetrical dimer interface with the replicase. Further refinement focussed on the replicase or hANP32A-encapsidase moieties improved the map quality and estimated resolution to 3.3 Å, enabling relatively complete models to be built (Supplementary Notes 6, 7; Table 1; Supplementary Table 2).Structure of the influenza A replication complexThe FluA replication complex comprises the asymmetric replicase-encapsidase dimer with bound hANP32A (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 3). Both replicase (related domains will be annotated with (R)) and encapsidase (related domains will be annotated with (E)) have the conserved polymerase core, comprising PA C-terminal domain (PA-C), PB1 subunit and PB2 N-terminal domain (PB2-N), but with differently disposed peripheral domains (PA-ENDO and PB2-C) (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. 3B, C). Compared to the transcriptase conformation (Supplementary Fig. 3A), the replicase conformation is characterised by a rotated PA-ENDO(R), against which packs the PB2 nuclear localisation signal domain (PB2-NLS(R)), with the C-terminal, helical NLS containing peptide extending across the ENDO surface26,33,34(Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. 3A, B, D). The PB2 cap-binding domain (PB2-CBD(R)) is packed against the palm domain of PB1(R) (Supplementary Fig. 3E). The PB2/627-NLS(R) double domain is in the open conformation35 with the linker extended and the otherwise flexibly connected PB2-627(R) domain being held in place in the FluA replication complex by interactions with the PB2-NLS(E) domain (Fig. 2A). In the distinct encapsidase conformation (Supplementary Fig. 3C), the PA-ENDO(E) packs on the PB1(E) fingers domain, but has only low-resolution density. The flexible PA-ENDO(E) 51-72 insertion contacts the top of the PB2-CBD(E) (e.g. residues PA/55-57 with PB2/I461, 469-471, K482), which is not rigidly integrated into the FluA replication complex either (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. 3C, F). Interestingly, this PA loop, found in FluPolA and FluPolB but not FluPolC, has been shown to be essential for replication in the case of FluA36. The PB2(E) midlink domain is stabilised in position by residues 520-524 forming an antiparallel alignment of strands with PB2-N(E) residues 126-132 (Supplementary Fig. 3C, G). PB2-N(E) residues 138-226, which include the helical lid domain, are not visible in the map, having apparently been displaced to avoid clashing with the PA-ENDO(E). There is putative density for the PB1-C(E)/PB2-N(E) helical interface bundle, but no model can be built, contrary to the situation in the FluB replication complex (see below). The PB2/627-NLS(E) double domain is in the closed conformation with the 627-domain packing against PA-C(E). The PB2-NLS(E) domain makes a substantial contact with the PB2-627(R) domain (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2: Overall structure of the FluPolA/H7N9-4M replication complex and the interactions with hANP32A.A Surface representation of the FluPolA/H7N9-4M replication complex with hANP32A displayed as cartoon (purple).

I Chemical shift perturbations (CSPs), calculated from differences between free and hANP32A bound forms of 627(K)-NLS from A/duck/Shantou/4610/2003(H5N1) (from Fig. 2 of ref. 21). CSPs were mapped onto the structure of the 627-NLS(E) and 627(R) domains from the FluPolA/H7N9-4M replication complex. CSPs from the 627 domain were designated as being associated with the replicase, while shifts from the NLS domain were associated with the encapsidase. Red corresponds to the highest CSPs (CSP > 0.35), orange to intermediate CSPs (>0.2) and yellow to lower but still measurable CSPs (CSP > 0.13).Full size imageThe interface between the replicase and the encapsidase buries a solvent accessible surface of around 3300 Å2, with three main zones of contact (Supplementary Fig. 4). The first involves PB2-N(R) β-strands (128-134, 243-250), neighbouring PA(R) 432-438 loop interacting with the PA(E) arch (N-terminal side, 368-377) and the tip of the PB1(E) β-hairpin (361-364) (Supplementary Fig. 4A, B). The latter region is close to the encapsidase 5’ hook binding site, which however is empty in this apo-structure. Key hydrophobic contacts are made by PA-C(E)/I330, W368 (which changes rotamer) and M374 to PB2-N(R)/T129, M243 and T245; PB1(E)/M362 to PA(R)/P434 and I438, and PB1(E)/K363 to PB2-N(R)/F130 (Supplementary Fig. 4B). The impact of various mutations designed to disrupt this interface was tested using cell-based assays for the FluPolA/WSN/33 in a vRNP reconstitution assay with a vRNA reporter to assess overall transcriptioneplication activity and a split luciferase-based complementation assay to assess binding to hANP32A (Supplementary Fig. 4C-E). FluPol activity was significantly impaired in the presence of the PA/I330A and PB2/T129A, T245A mutations, more markedly so when they were combined (Supplementary Fig. 4C), consistent with the described interactions. Similar trends were observed when FluPol activity support by either hANP32A, hANP32B or chANP32A was determined by transient complementation in HEK-293T cells knocked out for hANP32A and hANP32B (Supplementary Fig. 4D). This is consistent with decreased FluPol-binding levels to either hANP32A, hANP32B, or chANP32A, as determined in a split luciferase-based complementation assay (Supplementary Fig. 4E).The second zone of interaction between replicase and encapsidase involves the C-terminal β-sheet region of PB2-627(R) (residues 645, 651-657, 668-669) with PA(E) (315-316, 550-loop 547-558) (Supplementary Fig. 4A, F). Notable hydrophobic interactions include PB2-627(R)/M645 and L668-G669 with PA(E)/F315, and PB2-627(R)/P654 with PA(E)/L549, together with a hydrogen bond between PA(E)/Q556 and PB2-627(R)/N652 carbonyl oxygen (Supplementary Fig. 4F). The third zone of interaction is localised at the interface of PB2-627(R) (residues 585-587, 631-637 on the 627-loop, 644-646) with PB2-NLS(E) (residues 703-708, 712, 715-720) (Supplementary Fig. 4A, G). Notable hydrophobic contacts are made by PB2-627(R)/A587, M631, F633, T637 and R646 (Supplementary Fig. 4G). Using the cell-based assays described above, we found that the mutations PB2/A587K or A717E significantly reduced overall FluPol activity (Supplementary Fig. 4H), its dependence on either hANP32A, hANP32B or chANP32A (Supplementary Fig. 4I) as well as binding to hANP32A, hANP32B or chANP32A (Supplementary Fig. 4J), consistent with the structural findings. The PB2/A717E mutation had the strongest effect on FluPol activity, but not on binding to hANP32A, suggesting that it impairs another FluPol function beyond the replicase-encapsidase interaction.The PB2-627(R) domain behaves as a rigid-body part of the encapsidase in focussed cryo-EM refinement (Supplementary Notes 2), which is explained by its interfaces with PB2-NLS(E) and PA-C(E) domains. The particular juxtaposition of the PB2-627(R) domain with the PB2/627-NLS(E) double domain is a key feature that distinguishes both the FluA and FluB replication complexes from the previously described FluC replication complex (Fig. 3). In FluPolA, the PB2-NLS(E) domain is sandwiched between the PB2-627(E) and PB2-627(R) domains, with no contact between the latter two domains, whereas in FluPolC the PB2/627-NLS(E) double domain is rotated relative to the PB2-627(R) domain by ~78° and the PB2-NLS(E) domain squeezed to one side (Fig. 3A, B). Consequently, for FluC, the replicase and encapsidase PB2/627-domain loops containing K649 (equivalent to E627 in FluPolA/H7N9 and K627 in FluPolB) are closer and face each other, with the two K649 Cα atoms being ~19 Å apart. The LCAR is proposed to pass over this interface22. In the FluA and FluB replication complexes, these two loops are rotated far apart from each other with a main chain distance of respectively ~40 Å and ~42 Å between equivalent PB2/627 residues (Fig. 3A, C). This makes a significant difference to the surface with which the LCAR of hANP32A is likely to interact in the FluA and FluB replication complexes compared with FluC.Interactions of human ANP32A with the influenza A polymerase encapsidase and replicaseBinding of the hANP32A LRR domain to the FluA replication complex buries ~3300 Å2 of solvent accessible surface of which 80 % is with the encapsidase (Fig. 2B). The C-terminal end of the LRR domain, notably the 128-129 loop, packs against the PA-C(E) domain, burying the N-terminus of PB1(E) and the peptide 152-157 curves back against the LRR domain to contact the PB2/627-NLS(E) double domain (Fig. 2B). In particular, hANP32A/N129 makes a key interaction with PA(E)/K635, a residue previously shown to be critical for the binding of Pol II pS5 CTD in site 1 of both FluPolA and FluPolB3,7. In addition, PA(E)/K413 makes multiple hydrogen bonds to the main chain of residues 126-128 of hANP32A (Fig. 2C). Consistently, when cell-based mutational analysis was performed in the FluPolA/WSN/33 minigenome assay, the PA/K413A, PA/K413E and PA/K635A mutations reduced FluPol activity (Supplementary Fig. 5A), FluPol dependence on hANP32A, hANP32B or chANP32A (Supplementary Fig. 5B) and binding to hANP32A, hANP32B or chANP32A (Supplementary Fig. 5C). The effect is most dramatic for PA/K413E which shows FluPol activity and binding levels close to background. These data are in agreement with a previous report that the PA/K413A mutation affects replication of FluPolA, based on the observed role of the equivalent residue K391 in the FluC replication complex22 (note that this residue is not conserved in FluPolB). Similarly, it has been previously reported that the PA/K635A mutant is not only defective for Pol II pS5 CTD binding and hence transcription activity, but also replication activity3,7. The observation that PA/K635 is important for binding to both the Pol II pS5 CTD and to hANP32A suggests that their simultaneous interaction with PA-C is sterically impossible, notably in the context of the encapsidase. Finally, hANP32A/K153 also makes interactions with PB2(E)/N711 and PA(E)/E493, which are stabilised by PA(E)/R495 and E293 in a network of polar interactions (Fig. 2D).To assess the impact of hANP32A mutations on FluPolA activity, vRNP reconstitution were performed in HEK-293T cells knocked out for ANP32A and ANP32B, and transiently complemented with a WT or mutant hANP32A. Compared to WT, hANP32A mutants K153A and K153E, as well as the PA/E493K mutant, were less efficient in supporting FluPol activity (Supplementary Fig. 5D). Interestingly, FluPol activity was partially rescued when charge-reversal mutants PA/E493K and hANP32A/K153E (but not K153A) were combined (Supplementary Fig. 5D), indicating that the interaction is restored to some extent. Consistently, hANP32A/K153E and PA/E493K individually decreased FluPol-binding to hANP32A, but showed increased binding-levels when tested in combination (Supplementary Fig. 5E). This is in line with the observed interactions shown in Fig. 2C, D and with previous results showing that this region of hANP32A is critical for its interactions with FluPol37.Another major point of contact is of the PA-C(E) 550-loop, which bends to be able to interact with the concave β-sheet surface of hANP32A. Loop residues R551, T552 (an avian specific residue38, normally serine in mammalian-adapted FluPol) and R559 make direct interactions with hANP32A/A155, D119, N94 and F121 respectively (Fig. 2E). A deletion in the PA-C 550-loop was previously shown to affect replication in a cell-based assay6,7. Consistent with these observations, we show that the triple mutation R551A-S552A-R559A in A/WSN/33 PA affects both FluPol activity and binding to hANP32A, as does the double mutation F121A-N122A in hANP32A, although with a relatively modest effect on FluPol activity (Supplementary Fig. 5F, G). Beyond residue 157 there is only disjointed, low resolution density for hANP32A, so that the conformation and interactions of the LCAR cannot be visualised precisely in the FluA replication complex.The interactions of the replicase with hANP32A are more tenuous (Fig. 2F). K660 from the PB2-627(R) 660-loop makes a salt bridge with hANP32A/D25. Residues 680-DE from the extended PB2/NLS-627(R) linker could make electrostatic interactions with R6 and R12 of hANP32A and G608 from PB2-627(R) with R14, although the density is relatively poor in this region, due to mobility. Again, cell-based mutational analysis (PB2/K660A, hANP32A/D25A) confirmed the structural findings (Supplementary Fig. 5H–I). Importantly, steady-state levels of the WT and mutant PA, PB2 and hANP32A proteins used for functional studies in cell-based assays were similar as determined by western blot (Supplementary Fig. 5J–L).Correspondence with published studies on influenza polymerase-ANP32 interactionsThere is already abundant literature on putative interactions between hANP32A and FluPolA. Residues 129-130 have been shown to be critical for defining functional (or non-functional) species and isoform specific interactions of ANP32. In mammals, these residues are generally 129-ND in ANP32A and ANP32B, or NA and SD in mouse respectively, all of which support FluA replication, although mouse proteins are suboptimal12,39. Avian ANP32A has 129-ND and supports FluA replication, whereas avANP32B (129-IN) and avANP32A with the single N129I mutation do not11. Human or avian ANP32E, with 129-ED, poorly support replication11,15,40. These observations are fully consistent with the FluA replication complex structure that shows hANP32A/N129 interacting with PA(E)/K635 (Fig. 2C) and which can be plausibly substituted by the smaller serine, as in mouse, but not by the larger isoleucine or glutamate. A virus that has evolved to use hANP32E in human cells knocked out for hANP32A and hANP32B acquires the PB1/K577E and PA-C/Q556R (550-loop) mutations15. The PB1 mutation likely acts by weakening the competing FluPolA symmetric dimer interface as proposed15, similar to the monomeric FluPolA/H7N9-4M mutant, which bears the PB1/K577G substitution. In addition, our FluA replication complex structure shows that the PA/Q556R mutation in the encapsidase could make a salt-bridge with hANP32A/E154 (which is conserved in ANP32E), thus promoting replication complex formation (Supplementary Fig. 6A, B). In a related experiment, when virus is selected to replicate in transgenic chickens or chicken embryos carrying mutant chicken (ch) ANP32A (N129I, D130N) instead of WT chANP32A, escape mutants PA/E349K, Q556R, T639I, G634E, K635E, K635Q and PB2/M631L, I570L are found, with a predominance of PA/E349K and PB2/M631L. PA/E349K again acts by weakening the FluPolA symmetric dimer interface15,32, also shown by the FluPolA/H7N9-4M mutant, which bears this substitution, whilst PA/Q556R would strengthen the interaction with hANP32A (see above). The other PA mutations cluster around the key contact with the hANP32A 129-130 loop, plausibly making local perturbations that better accommodate 129-IN (Supplementary Fig. 6A). PB2/M631L, in the encapsidase, is at the other main contact where the polymerase interacts with hANP32A/K153 and again may facilitate accommodation to the mutated chANP32A/D130N (Supplementary Fig. 6A). Interestingly, PB2/M631L is the most consistently observed FluPol adaptive mutation in the recent outbreak in the US of high pathogenic avian influenza in cows, with a very low detection of PB2/E627K and D701N28,29. In addition, the recently described PA/E613K mutation present in clade A in cattle-derived sequences can also be explained as strengthening the replicase-encapsidase interface based on the FluA replication complex structure (Supplementary Fig. 6E).The influenza A replication complex structure explains avian to human host adaptationsAdaptation of avian strain FluPols (which invariably have PB2/E627) to be able to function in human cells generally requires PB2 mutations. Real-life evolution of circulating FluA viruses and numerous laboratory studies show that the most effective routes to adapt avian FluPol to mammalian ANP32A or ANP32B are PB2/E627K41, PB2/D701N42,43 or PB2/Q591R (A/H1N1pdm09 strain)23,44, with other observed mutations (PA/T572S, PB2/T271A, PB2/K702R, PB2/D740N) potentially assisting to a lesser extent.To understand why these residues make such a difference, we calculated electrostatic surfaces using the FluA replication complex structure with appropriate modelled substitutions in replicase and encapsidase for the four cases (Fig. 3D–G): (1) typical human signature with PB2/Q591, K627, D701 (Fig. 3D), (2) typical avian signature with PB2/Q591, E627, D701 (Fig. 3E), (3) human adapted FluPolA/H7N9 with PB2/Q591, E627, N701 (corresponding to our structure) (Fig. 3F), and (4) human adapted FluPolA/H1N1pdm09 with PB2/R591, E627, D701 (Fig. 3G).The typical human signature results in an uninterrupted positively-charged path following the PB2-NLS(E)/PB2-627(R) interface (and continuing round the back), encompassing K627(R) and skirting the acidic patch due to D701(E) (Fig. 3D). The structure of the fully human adapted FluB replication complex (see below) shows a similar strong basic path (Fig. 3H). Residues in the FluA replication complex contributing to this basic surface are PB2-NLS(E)/K702, R703, K718, K721, K738, R739 and PB2-627(R)/K586, R589, K627, R630. We propose that this is likely the trajectory followed by the proximal part of the acidic LCAR of hANP32A or hANP32B (e.g. residues 160-AEGYVEGLDDEEEDEDEEEYDEDAQVV-186, italic here is mammalian specific), interacting in a predominantly electrostatic, multivalent fashion, since it is not clearly observed in the structure. Indeed, projecting the residues undergoing chemical shifts when hANP32A interacts with isolated 627-NLS domain, onto PB2-NLS(E)/PB2-627(R) rather than the closed PB2/627-NLS(E) conformation, highlights perturbations (due to direct or indirect binding effects) at the PB2-NLS(E)/PB2-627(R) interface21 (Fig. 3I). The typical avian signature results in an interrupted basic track, due to the combined effect of positively charged D701(E) and E627(R) (Fig. 3E). This surface is more appropriate to bind the avANP32A due to the 33 amino acid insertion (i.e. residues 160-AEGYVEGLDDEEEDEDVLSLVKDRDDK-186, bold here is avian specific). This could place the avian specific hexapeptide 176-VLSLVK that strongly interacts, according to NMR21, and two other basic residues in the equivalent region.Both human adapted signatures, as in FluPolA/H7N9 and FluPolA/H1N1pdm09, partially restore the basic track (Fig. 3F, G). Interestingly PB2/Q591R might have a dual mode of action in both replicase and encapsidase, since the simultaneous Q591R(E) mutation could enhance binding of hANP32 to the encapsidase through formation of a salt bridge with hANP32A/D151 (Supplementary Fig. 6C). Furthermore, the ‘third-wave’ mutation PA/N321K in FluPolA/H1N1pdm09 is thought to be an additional adaptation of a swine FluPol to hANP3239,45. Indeed, the mutation PA(E)/N321K could lead to a salt bridge with PB2(R)/E249 (Supplementary Fig. 6D), thus strengthening the encapsidase-replicase interface, a mechanism suggested to compensate for a sub-optimal ANP32 interaction15.It has also been shown that mammalian ANP32A and ANP32B proteins preferentially drive different adaptive mutations in avian FluPol, respectively PB2/D701N or PB2/E627K, and this ability maps to the significantly different LCAR23 (Supplementary Notes 8). One possible explanation is that hANP32B is considerably more acidic than hANP32A in the region 176-190, with an insertion of five extra acidic residues and substitution of three non-charged residues by acidic residues (Supplementary Notes 8). This hyper-acidic stretch of hANP32B may require the more basic LCAR track, resulting from the PB2/E627K mutation, to bind in a functional way.Importantly, the FluA replication complex structure reveals a significant asymmetry in the positioning of the encapsidase PB2/627 and 701 residues and their counterparts in the replicase. Only the 627(R) and 701(E) residues are in the putative pathway of the LCAR (Fig. 3). This would suggest that the nature of these residues, whether E/K or D/N, should only exert their influence in human cells via the replicase or encapsidase, respectively. Whereas the relevant position of PB2/701 has not been analysed, several studies have addressed the effect of making the PB2/E627K substitution only in the encapsidase or only in the replicase16,17,46. These studies are based, firstly, on a cRNA stabilisation assay involving infection of HEK-293T cells in the presence of pre-expressed NP and PB2/627E or PB2/627K FluPol with an inactive PB1, with added actinomycin D or cycloheximide to prevent transcriptionranslation by the incoming vRNPs. The incoming virus thus provides the vRNA to cRNA replicase, whilst the pre-expressed FluPol acts as encapsidase. Results indicate that both incoming avian 627E and 627K viruses produce stable cRNPs in infected cells, whether the pre-expressed PB2 is 627E or 627K16,17,46. In a second assay, performed in the presence of pre-expressed NP and FluPol with an active PB1 (i.e. a replication assay), Manz et al.46 found that only 627K viruses could produce functional cRNPs in human cells. In contrast, Nilsson-Payant et al.16 and Swann et al.17 found that: (i) cRNPs produced by 627E and 627K viruses can both serve as a template for cRNA to vRNA synthesis, provided that the pre-expressed PB2 (which now is part of the replicase) is 627K; and (ii) the impaired vRNA synthesis when the pre-expressed PB2 is 627E can be restored by pre-expressing chANP32A.Taken together, these observations indicate that in human cells, the PB2/E627 FluPol is functional as a replicase to perform vRNA to cRNA synthesis and as an encapsidase, but is impaired as a replicase to co-opt hANP32 to perform cRNA to vRNA synthesis. This agrees with the structure showing that only the replicase 627 residue is part of the likely LCAR trajectory, however, why this restriction only affects cRNA to vRNA replication remains unexplained.Structure of the apo-influenza B polymerase symmetrical dimerThe biochemical and biophysical analysis revealed that a stable apo-FluPolB dimer is formed in the presence of hANP32A at physiological salt concentrations (Fig. 1). Consistently, the majority of particles in the apo-FluPolB-hANP32A cryo-EM analysis are dimers and monomers, with a minority of trimers (Supplementary Notes 4–6). The dimers have a 2-fold symmetrical interface, although the peripheral domains of each monomer can be in quite different conformations (Fig. 4; Table 1; Supplementary Table 3; Supplementary Notes 4, 5). The apo-FluPolB dimer interface involves the PA-arch residues 375-385 of one monomer contacting PA/332-338 and 361-364 of the second monomer, and vice versa. In addition, the tips of the PB1 β-hairpin of each monomer (residues 360-363, closely associated with the PA-arch), interact with each other across the 2-fold axis (Fig. 4A–C). The core dimer interface buries only ~2200 Å2 of solvent accessible surface compared to ~3600 Å2 for the FluPolA symmetrical dimer. The apo-FluPolB dimer interface involves hydrophobic (e.g. PA/F335, Y361, W364, I375, M376, V379), polar and salt-bridge interactions (e.g. PA/D382 with Y361 and K338, E378 with K338 and K358) (Fig. 4C). The PA peptides 357-372 and 504-513, containing aromatics residues PA/Y361, W364 and PA/H506 are refolded in the apo-form compared to their configuration in the 5’ hook-bound form of FluPolB, where PA/H506 stacks on nucleotide 11 of the 5’ hook (Fig. 4D). This suggests that for FluPolB, symmetrical dimer formation and 5’ hook binding might be mutually exclusive. Biochemically and biophysically, this is found to be the case, since FluPolB bound to the vRNA 5’ hook is soluble and monomeric at 150 mM NaCl and, furthermore, does not bind hANP32A (Supplementary Fig. 7). This highlights the fact that hANP32A is mainly required to chaperone apo-FluPol, even though we see no density corresponding to it in the apo-FluPolB symmetrical dimer structures. We confirmed these observations by structure determination of a monomeric form of the FluPolB encapsidase bound to nucleotides 1-12 of the cRNA 5’ hook (Fig. 4E; Table 1; Supplementary Table 4; Supplementary Notes 9), which can serve as a model for the vRNA replication product-bound encapsidase. We conclude that 5’ hook binding disassociates the apo-FluPolB symmetric dimer or, conversely, under certain circumstances, formation of a symmetrical dimer could perhaps eject the bound 5’ end (see discussion).Fig. 4: Apo-FluPolB pseudo-symmetrical dimer and 5’ cRNA bound FluPolB encapsidase.A Cartoon representation of the most abundant apo-FluPolB pseudo-symmetrical dimer.

H Comparison of the distinct apo-FluPolB (left) and apo-FluPolA/H7N9-WT (PDB 7ZPM) (right) symmetrical dimers, with monomer 1 core (grey) in the same orientation. Other domains are coloured as in (A).Full size imageThe cryo-EM analysis shows that most apo-FluPolB symmetric dimers exhibit a complete encapsidase conformation in one monomer (monomer 1 in Fig. 4A). In the apo-FluPolB encapsidase, the PB2 lid domain is disordered (as in FluPolA(E)), but interestingly, is observed in its normal position in the 5’ cRNA hook bound form of the encapsidase, due to subtle displacements of domains (Fig. 4A, E). For the symmetric partner monomer denoted FluPolB(S) (monomer 2 in Fig. 4A), a variety of conformations are observed including with the PA-ENDO in either the replicase (ENDO(R)), encapsidase (ENDO(E)) or transcriptase (ENDO(T)) orientations, with the PB2-C domains usually exhibiting weaker density (Supplementary Notes 4, 5). Even the core conformations vary due to different openings of the polymerase. Given that this encapsidase-containing dimer requires the hANP32A LCAR for stabilisation, we suggest that the LCAR in fact stabilises the encapsidase conformation. This is consistent with the fact that the encapsidase has only ever been visualised in the presence of ANP32, as here, or for FluPolC22. As described below, the FluB replication complex cryo-EM maps reveal the likely pathway of the extended LCAR, providing a rationale for how it stabilises the encapsidase conformation by electrostatic complementarity (Fig. 4F).We used the split luciferase assay to show that mutations in the symmetrical FluPolB dimer interface significantly reduce self-oligomerisation in cells (Fig. 4G), suggesting that this dimer likely exists under physiological conditions. Furthermore, we reiterate that the FluPolA and FluPolB symmetrical dimers are quite distinct, involving different regions at their respective 2-fold interfaces (Fig. 4H).Structure of the influenza B replication complexThe overall architecture of the FluB replication complex is similar to that of FluA, with most domains in the equivalent location, albeit with a few significant differences (Fig. 5; Supplementary Figs. 8, 9). In the FluPolB replicase there is a rotation of ~15° of the PA-ENDO(R) towards the PB2-627(R) domain when compared to the FluA replication complex, allowing the FluPolB PA-ENDO(R) 63–73 insertion to contact the PB2-627(R) domain in the region of W575, a contact not observed in FluPolA replicase (Supplementary Fig. 8D). The encapsidase moiety of the FluB replication complex adopts a very similar conformation to that seen in the apo-FluPolB symmetrical dimer. The PA-ENDO(E) is rotated by ~48° away from the PB2-CBD(E) compared to FluPolA, so there is no longer contact with the PA-ENDO(E) 63-73 loop as observed in FluPolA encapsidase (Supplementary Fig. 8E). In addition, the lid domain of PB2(E) is also disordered in FluPolB encapsidase, although there is some suggestive, but low resolution, density close to the PA-ENDO(E). Interestingly, there is unambiguous density for the FluPolB encapsidase PB1-C/PB2-N helical bundle swung away from its normal position (Supplementary Fig. 8E). This structural element, together with residues 194-198 at the tip of the PB1(E) β-ribbon, makes a significant new interface with the top of the PB2-CBD(R) (residues 466-474), which considerably reinforces the replicase-encapsidase interface (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. 9A, F). No equivalent interaction is observed in the FluA replication complex. This extra contact largely accounts for the fact that the total buried surface between the replicase and encapsidase in the FluB replication complex is ~ 5100 Å2, considerably more than the ~3300 Å2 for FluA. This mainly results from the fact that the three encapsidase subunits each contact PB2(R) (Supplementary Fig. 9A–D).Fig. 5: Overall FluB trimeric replication complex and hANP32A interactions.A Surface representation of the FluB trimer replication complex. hANP32A is displayed as cartoon, coloured in purple.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageFurthermore, the PA-C 609-loop, a specific FluPolB insertion that is also important for Pol II pS5 CTD binding6, makes special contacts within the FluB replication complex. In the encapsidase, the PA-C(E) 609-loop interacts with the PB2-CBD(E) 420-loop, thereby providing additional stabilisation to the encapsidase conformation (not shown). Conversely, in the replicase, the PA-C(R) 609-loop interacts with the PA-C(E) arch domain, reinforcing the replicase-encapsidase interface (Supplementary Fig. 9E).Influenza B polymerase trimerThe FluB replication complex is only seen as part of a trimer (determined at 3.57 Å resolution overall), with an additional monomer, FluPolB(S), making a symmetrical FluB-type dimer interface with the replicase (Fig. 4F; Fig. 5A; Table 1; Supplementary Notes 6, 7). FluPolB(S) is less well ordered with only the core visible and not the peripheral domains, likely due to flexibility. The encapsidase component of the FluB replication complex cannot simultaneously make a symmetrical dimer as it uses the same interface (i.e. the PA-arch and PB1 β-hairpin) to interact with the replicase. This shows that the encapsidase component of the apo-FluPolB symmetrical dimer would have to disassociate to be able to form the FluB replication complex. Consistent with this and the biophysical data, a significant number of monomeric apo-encapsidases are observed (Supplementary Notes 5). A speculative biological role for the replication complex-containing FluPolB trimer is mentioned in the discussion.Interactions of human ANP32A within the influenza B replication complexHuman ANP32A binds in the same position and orientation to the FluPolB encapsidase as in its FluPolA counterpart, but due to sequence divergence the interactions are not necessarily conserved (Fig. 5A, B). The total buried solvent accessible surface upon hANP32A binding to the FluB replication complex is ~2200 Å2, only 66% of that for the FluA replication complex. In both complexes, the main anchor point remains the C-terminal end of the LRR domain wedged against the PA-C(E) domain in the vicinity of the N-terminus of PB1(E) (Fig. 5A, B). On the other hand, in the FluB replication complex, the N-terminal end of the LRR domain does not make any contacts and consequently has less well-ordered density due to mobility. A critical contact is again made by hANP32A 129-ND, but in the FluB replication complex it is D130 that directly interacts with the Pol II pS5 CTD binding residue PA(E)/K631 (in FluA replication complex, N129 contacts the equivalent PA(E)/K635), with also a slightly more distant salt-bridge to R634, whereas N129 hydrogen bonds to PA(E)/S411 (Fig. 5C). The equivalent of FluPolA PA/K413 is L409 in FluPolB and is close but does not interact (Fig. 5C). It has previously been shown that the substitution N129E that occurs in hANP32E is responsible for its limited ability to support FluB replication14, emphasising the importance of this contact point. Furthermore, we show that the double mutation PA/K631A and R634A reduces FluPolB activity (Fig. 5E), as previously described6, as well as hANP32A binding to FluPolB in a cell-based split luciferase assay (Fig. 5F). In FluPolA, PA(E)/R638 is further away and its mutation less impacts replication3. Furthermore, the PA-C(E) 550-loop of FluPolB, being four residues shorter than that of FluPolA, does not reach so far onto the β-sheet surface of hANP32A (Fig. 5B, D). This observation is consistent with the fact that no decreased binding of the FluPolB PA-C 550-loop deletion mutant to hANP32A was observed (Fig. 5F), despite some interactions between PA(E)/S547 to hANP32A/D152 and the carbonyl oxygen of K153, and PA(E)/R549 that contacts hANP32A/N84 and D119. Other polar interactions are made to hANP32A/R150 and D151 by PB2(E)/S630 and R629, respectively, and to hANP32A/E154 by PB2(R)/R653 and possibly K639 (Fig. 5D).Path of the human ANP32A LCAR in the influenza B replication complexAdditional pseudo-continuous density is present in the FluB replication complex maps that we interpret as tracing the path of the hANP32A LCAR extending beyond residue 155, the last of the folded part of the LRR domain, and wrapping around the encapsidase (Fig. 6A, B). Although no accurate model can be built into this density, it could correspond to a chain of at least 50 residues extending to beyond hANP32A residue 200. The path follows a clearly defined positively-charged electrostatic track, created by a number of basic residues that would point towards the acidic LCAR. In order along the pathway, we find: PB2-NLS(E)/K721, K742, R741, K703, K734 and PB2-627(R)/R629, K588; PB1(E)/K566, K570 and PA(E)/K298, K301, K475, H506, K374; PB1(E)/R196 and R203 that are close to the PB1 NLS on the long β-ribbon47, and finally PB1(E)/R135, K353 and PB2(E)/R40 (Fig. 6C). The LCAR passes over the PB2-NLS(E)/PB2-627(R) interface, then over the 3’ end secondary binding loop (PA/K298, K301), round the tip of the PB1(E) β-ribbon (PB1/R203) and then parallel to the β-ribbon with the PA(E) arch on the other side (PA/K374) (Fig. 6B, C). These observations plausibly explain how the LCAR stabilises the encapsidase conformation by electrostatic complementation.Fig. 6: hANP32A LCAR density and putative RNA path within FluA/H7N9-4M and FluB replication complexes.A Low-pass filtered FluB replication complex map at 5 Å resolution (threshold 0.12). hANP32A and FluPolB domains are coloured as in Fig. 5.

D Model of template and product RNA binding to the FluB replication complex in the early-elongation state shown in two orientations as a transparent surface. hANP32A LRR and LCAR are respectively coloured purple and red. The template 5’ hook is in plum and the 3’ end gold. The replication product is coloured cyan. The template extremities and product-template duplex bound in the replicase core are modelled from PDB 8PNQ. The replication product is modelled to extend through a channel between the replicase PB2-N and midlink/cap-binding domains into the 5’ end hook binding site of the encapsidase (modelled using the cRNA hook-bound FluPolB(E) structure). The template 3’ end binds in the replicase secondary site. Un-modelled RNA is displayed as dotted lines. The C-terminal end of the modelled LCAR (A–C) would clash with the product RNA entering the encapsidase hook binding site and would have to be displaced during elongation. E Close-up view of the elongating RNA product, coloured as in (D), exiting the replicase and entering the encapsidase, mapped onto the FluA/H7N9-4M replication complex. Nucleotides 1–22 are numbered from the 5’ end of the product, with nucleotides 1−10 corresponding to the 5’ hook bound to the encapsidase and 11−22 to the minimal product in the channel formed by PB2-N/midlink/CBD(R) and PA-C(E). Basic residues in the channel are displayed with atoms as spheres. Domains are coloured as in (A), with PB1(R) in blue, PB2 midlink(R) in magenta, PB2-N(R) in dark red, PB2 CBD(R) in orange and PA-C(E) in green. F Surface representation of the FluA/H7N9-4M replication complex coloured according to the electrostatic potential, with the modelled RNA product and hANP32A LCAR superimposed, numbered and coloured as in (E). The distal end of the hANP32A LCAR clashes with the RNA product. White arrows indicate the 5’ hook bound to the encapsidase and where the growing replication product could bulge out to be bound by NP.Full size imageModel of the active RNA bound replication complexWe have determined the structure of the putative FluA and FluB replication complexes in the absence of viral RNA. We therefore sought to model how template and product RNA could bind to an active replication complex (Fig. 6D–F). To remain simple, we have chosen not to take into account the expected conformational changes that are known to accompany promoter binding and the initiation to elongation transition, which involves FluPol core opening and extrusion of the priming loop48,49. The template extremities and product-template duplex bound to the replicase were modelled by superposing on PB1(R) the FluPolA/H7N9 elongation state (PDB 8PNQ) with the 3’ end of the template binding back to the secondary site. The replication product was manually extended from the top of the duplex through a channel into the 5’ end hook binding site of the encapsidase, modelled using the cRNA 5’ hook-bound FluPolB encapsidase structure. From the 3’ end at the +1 position in the replicase active site to the 5’ end in the encapsidase hook-binding site, a minimal 32 nucleotides of the product are modelled (10 in the duplex, 12 in the channel, 10 in the 5’ hook) (Fig. 6D, E). In the FluA replication complex, the putative product exit channel linking replicase to encapsidase passes between the PB2-N(R) and PB2-CBD(R) domains and then has PA-C(E) on one side, while the other side is solvent exposed and could be where the extending product bulges out to be bound by incoming NP (Fig. 6E, F). The channel is lined by basic residues notably PB2(R)/R143, R144, K157, R213, R368, R369, K389 and PA-C(E)/K361, K362, K367, R508 yielding a positively charged pathway rich in flexible arginines that are able to interact with both RNA bases and phosphate backbone (Fig. 6E, F). Not unexpectedly, the product exit channel partially overlaps with the capped transcription primer entrance channel, where it has already been shown how some of the same arginines can adapt to interact with different RNA configurations27. The RNA model is transferable between the FluA and FluB replication complexes without modification. In the FluB complex, the distal, C-terminal end of the modelled LCAR, would clash with the product RNA entering the encapsidase hook-binding site (Fig. 6D, F). Consequently, the LCAR would have to be displaced as the product RNA emerges. This could have the dual effect of preventing non-specific RNA binding to the encapsidase prior to product emergence, with subsequent release of the LCAR to be able to recruit NP to the elongating replication product.DiscussionDe novo synthesis of the influenza anti-genomic and genomic RNA (cRNA and vRNA), respectively from parental vRNPs and cRNPs, with concomitant packaging of the product RNA into a progeny RNP, is a highly complex process that we are only just beginning to get a grasp off. Two key elements have been established, firstly that the host factor ANP32 plays critical and probably multiple roles in the process and secondly, that an asymmetric FluPol dimer comprising replicase (integrated into the parental RNP) and encapsidase (a newly synthesised and initially apo-FluPol) is fundamental to nucleate co-replicational assembly of the progeny RNP. The proposed roles of ANP32 so far include formation and stabilisation of the ternary replicase-ANP32-encapsidase replication complex22 and secondly, through interactions of the LCAR with apo-NP, successive recruitment of NPs to package the growing replicate18,19. A further intriguing aspect that lacks a full mechanistic explanation is why certain specific mutations, mainly in PB2, are required to overcome the restriction of avian strain FluPols to replicate in human cells, as this mainly depends on a 33 residue insertion in the LCAR of avANP32A, compared to hANP32A and hANP32B8.Here we present evidence based on in vitro biochemical and structural analysis of complexes of FluPolA and FluPolB with hANP32A, that ANP32 may have a third important role that is to act as an electrostatic chaperone/disaggregase24 for apo-FluPol. This function is primarily dependent on the LCAR and involves solubilisation and stabilisation of apo-FluPolA and apo-FluPolB predominantly in a dimeric form at physiological salt concentrations. We speculate that this may have been the primordial role of ANP32 in the nuclear lifecycle of influenza-like viral polymerases, since it is highly conserved in most eukaryotes, notably those known to be hosts of orthomyxo- and orthomyxo-like viruses. Only later, ANP32 would have acquired an active role in replication.Interestingly, both FluPolA and FluPolB apo-dimers have 2-fold symmetric core interfaces (although the peripheral domains need not be disposed symmetrically), but they are structurally quite different (Fig. 4H). The FluPolA apo-dimer is stable at high salt without ANP3226,27 but ANP32 binding at physiological salt enhances the dimer population (Supplementary Fig. 2). On the other hand, FluPolB is monomeric at high salt (Fig. 1), but again ANP32 significantly increases the amount of dimers at lower salt. One monomer of the FluPolB apo-dimer is observed to be preferentially in the encapsidase conformation, which appears specifically to be stabilised by the LCAR of hANP32A. These initial observations led us to perform cryo-EM structural analysis on mixtures of apo-FluPolA or apo-FluPolB, with hANP32A, which yielded multiple structures including the replication complex of each FluPol. Electrostatic calculations for the FluA replication complex structure suggest that human adaptive mutations restore a coherent positively charged pathway at the PB2-NLS(E)/PB2-627(R) interface, able to bind the negatively charged proximal region of the LCAR of hANP32A or hANP32B. In contrast, the more mixed surface of avian FluPol more appropriately binds the avian LCAR, which because of the 33 residue insertion, has more basic and hydrophobic residues in the equivalent region (Fig. 3). The FluA replication complex structure also explains why PB2/E627 is only restrictive in human cells in the replicase. The FluB replication complex exhibits density that we assign to the extended LCAR following a basic pathway around the encapsidase, thus providing a plausible explanation of how it stabilises this particular FluPol conformation (Fig. 6A–C). Both the FluA and FluB replication complexes also have a positively-charge channel for the product RNA to exit the replicase and enter the 5’ hook binding site of the encapsidase (Fig. 6D–F).Whether or not the chaperone effect of ANP32 is important in vivo, it is clear that hANP32A binds to dimeric apo-FluPol in vitro (Fig. 1) and in cells (e.g. Supplementary Fig. 4E, J, for split luciferase binding assays in the absence of viral RNA). This likely occurs in the nucleus prior to the apo-FluPol encountering an RNP. Thus, for both FluA and FluB, an ANP32-bound apo-FluPol symmetric dimer is brought together with a replication-competent RNP during the replication initiation process. We therefore propose a generalised trimer model of replication. For both FluPolA (Supplementary Fig. 10) and FluPolB (Supplementary Fig. 11), one half of the dimer would become the ANP32-bound encapsidase within the asymmetric replication complex. For FluPolA, the third polymerase has been proposed to play a role in template realignment specifically during initiation of cRNA to vRNA synthesis by forming a transient symmetrical interface with the asymmetric replication complex dimer26. However, such a trimer has not been observed structurally. For FluPolB, based on the observed trimer structure, where the third FluPolB forms a different symmetrical interface with the replicase, we speculate that it could have a distinct role. It might assist in replication termination by binding the replicase and releasing the 5’ hook of the template so it can be copied. It is possible that both types of symmetric dimer exist for both FluPolA and FluPolB under certain conditions, but this has not been shown yet. However, given that FluPolA mutated to be monomeric appears to be functional7,15, it could also be that these third polymerases are not essential but merely increase efficiency of replication.To reveal more details of the mechanism, it will be important to determine structural snapshots of replication in action, as has been done for transcription48,49. This would visualise the trajectory of the nascent RNA replicate from the replicase into the encapsidase and subsequent conformational changes that might occur as elongation proceeds. Ultimately, one would like to validate the NP recruitment model leading to RNP assembly.Finally, our structures will be useful in interpreting polymerase mutations detected in mammals infected with highly pathogenic and potentially pandemic avian influenza strains (as exemplified by the ongoing outbreaks of H5N1 in diverse mammals, notably cows), for instance, whether they might be mammalian adaptive mutations that effect the stability of the replication complex28,29.MethodsConstruction of expression plasmids for influenza A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) and B/Memphis/13/2003 polymerasesThe two previously described pFastBac Dual vector encoding for the influenza A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) wild-type polymerase subunits, PA (Uniprot: M9TI86), PB1 (Uniprot: M9TLW3) and PB2 (Uniprot: X5F427)48 and the A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) 4 M monomeric mutant bearing the mutations PA/E349K, R490I, PB1/K577G and PB2/G74R7 were used as a starting point. The PA N-terminal His-tag was removed by a combination of PCRs and Gibson assembly. The PB2 C-terminal Twin-strep-tag was kept.The previously described pKL vector encoding the self-cleavable poly-protein of influenza B/Memphis/13/2003 polymerase subunits, PA (Uniprot: Q5V8Z9_9INFB), PB1 (Uniprot: Q5V8Y6_9INFB) and PB2 (Uniprot: Q5V8X3_9INFB)50 was used as a starting point. Each FluPolB subunit was amplified and inserted in a pLIB plasmid by a combination of PCRs and Gibson assembly resulting in FluPolB subunits being under control of distinct polyhedrin promoters. The PA N-terminal His-tag was removed, whilst the PB2 C-terminal Twin-strep-tag was retained to enable purification.All plasmid sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing for each polymerase subunit.Removal of all N- or C-terminal tags (except the PB2 C-terminal purification tag) was essential to allow replication complex formation. An N-terminal PA tag prevents formation of the full replicase conformation, which requires close contact of the cap-binding domain to the N-terminus of PA. An N-terminal PB1 extension impedes close packing against PA-C of ANP32 in the vicinity of residues 129-130, which buries the PB1 N-terminus. In the FluB replication complex, an N-terminal PB2 extension would prevent the observed contact between the encapsidase PB1-C/PB2-N helical bundle with the replicase cap-binding domain.Influenza A and B polymerases expression and purificationFluPolA/H7N9-WT, FluPolA/H7N9-4M and FluPolB were produced using the baculovirus expression system in Trichoplusia ni High 5 cells. For large-scale expression, cells at 0.8-106 cells/mL concentration were infected by adding 1% of virus. Expression was stopped 72 to 96 h after the day of proliferation arrest and cells were harvested by centrifugation (1000 g, 20 min at 4 °C). Cells were disrupted by sonication for 5 min (5 s ON, 20 s OFF, 40% amplitude) on ice in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP, 5% glycerol) with cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). After lysate centrifugation at 48,000 g for 45 min at 4 °C, ammonium sulphate was added to the supernatant at 0.5 g/mL final concentration. The recombinant protein was then collected by centrifugation (45 min, 4 °C at 70.000 g), re-suspended in the lysis buffer, and the procedure was repeated. FluPol was purified using strep-tactin affinity purification beads (IBA, Superflow). Bound proteins were eluted using the lysis buffer supplemented by 2.5 mM d-desthiobiotin and protein-containing fractions were pooled and diluted with an equal volume of buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 2 mM TCEP, 5% glycerol) before loading on an affinity column HiTrap Heparin HP 5 mL (Cytiva). A continuous gradient of lysis buffer supplemented with 1 M NaCl was applied over 15 CV, and FluPol was eluted as single species at ~800 mM NaCl. Pure and acid nucleic free FluPol were dialysed overnight in a final buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP, 5% glycerol), concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15 (50 kDa cutoff), flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C for later use.Human Acidic Nuclear Phosphoprotein 32 AHuman ANP32A (hANP32A) was cloned and expressed as previously described7. The N-terminal His-tagged hANP32A construct was expressed in BL21(DE3) E.coli cells. Expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG, for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (1000 g, 20 min at 4 °C), disrupted by sonication for 5 min (5 s ON, 15 s OFF, 50% amplitude) on ice in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol (BME) with cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). After lysate centrifugation at 48,000 g for 45 min at 4 °C, the soluble fraction was loaded on a HisTrap HP 5 mL column (Cytiva). Bound proteins were subjected to a wash step using the lysis buffer supplemented by 50 mM imidazole. Remaining bound protein was eluted using the lysis buffer supplemented by 500 mM imidazole. Fractions containing hANP32A were dialysed overnight in the lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM BME) together with N-terminal his-tagged TEV protease (ratio 1:5 w/w). Tag-cleaved hANP32A protein was subjected to a Ni-sepharose affinity column to remove the TEV protease, further concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15 (3 kDa cutoff) and subjected to a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva) in a final buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP. Fractions containing exclusively hANP32A were concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15 (3 kDa cutoff), flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C for later use.Truncated hANP32A constructs (1–199 and 144–249) were generated, expressed and purified as previously described21. The hANP32A 1–149 construct was a gift from Cynthia Wolberger (Addgene plasmid # 6724151), and was expressed and purified as previously described21.Analytical size exclusion chromatographySEC experiments for FluPolA/H7N9-4M and FluPolB were performed on a Superdex 200 Increase 3.2/300 (Cytiva) at 4 °C, in a final buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 8, 500-300-150-100 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP. Depending on the experiment, 5 µM FluPol, 15 µM hANP32A (full-length, ‘1–149’, ‘1–199’, ‘144-Cter’) and 10 µM 5’ vRNA 1-12 (5’-pAGU AGU AAC AAG-3’) were used. Resulting mixtures were incubated 1 h on ice and centrifuged 5 min at 11,000 g prior to injection onto the column. SEC fractions of interest were loaded on 4–20% Tris-glycine gel (ThermoFisher) and stained with Coomassie Blue.SEC experiments for FluPolA/H7N9-WT were performed on a Superdex 200 Increase 3.2/300 (Cytiva) at 4 °C, in a final buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 8, 500-300-150 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP.

Coverslips (No. 1.5H, 24 × 50 mm, VWR) were washed with water and isopropanol before being used as a support for silicone gaskets (CultureWellTM 423 Reusable Gaskets, Grace Bio-labs). Contrast/mass calibration was realised using native marker (Native Marker unstained protein 426 standard, LC0725, Life Technologies) with a medium field of view and monitored during 60 s using the AcquireMP software (Refeyn). For each condition, 18 µl of buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 100/150/300/500 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP) were used to find the focus. Using diluted SEC inputs, 2 µl of sample were added to reach a final FluPol concentration of 50 nM. Movies of 60 s were recorded, processed and mass estimation was determined automatically using the DiscoverMP software (Refeyn).Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Electron microscopyFluPol A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) and B/Memphis/13/2003 replication complexes sample preparationFluPolA/H7N9-4M and FluPolB replication complexes were trapped by mixing 1.15 µM FluPol with 5.75 µM hANP32A (molar ratio 1:5) in a final buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP. Mix were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, centrifuged for 5 min at 11,000 g and kept at 4 °C before proceeding to grids freezing. For grid preparation, 1.5 µl of sample was applied on each sides of plasma cleaned (Fischione 1070 Plasma Cleaner: 1 min 10 s, 90% oxygen, 10% argon) grids (UltrAufoil 1.2/1.3, Au 300). Excess solution was blotted for 3 s, blot force 0, 100% humidity, at 10 °C, with a Vitrobot Mark IV (ThermoFisher) before plunge freezing in liquid ethane.FluPol B/Memphis/13/2003 bound to 5’ cRNA sample preparationThe FluPolB encapsidase bound to 5’ cRNA structure was trapped by mixing 1.15 µM FluPolB with 5.75 µM hANP32A and 1.72 µM 5′ cRNA 1-12 (5′-AGC AGA AGC AGA -3′) (molar ratio 1:5:1.5) in a final buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP.

Coma and astigmatism correction were performed on a carbon grid. Micrographs were recorded in counting mode at a ×105,000 magnification giving a pixel size of 0.84 Å with defocus ranging from −0.8 to −2.0 µm. Gain-normalised movies of 40 frames were collected with a total exposure of ~40 e−/Å2.FluPol B/Memphis/13/2003 bound to 5’ cRNA sample preparationAutomated data collection was performed on a TEM Glacios (ThermoFisher) operated at 200 kV equipped with a F4i direct electron detector camera (ThermoFisher) and a SelectrisX energy filter (ThermoFisher), using EPU (ThermoFisher). Coma and astigmatism correction were performed on a carbon grid. Micrographs were recorded in counting mode at a ×130,000 magnification giving a pixel size of 0.878 Å with defocus ranging from −0.8 to −2.0 µm. EER movies were collected with a total exposure of ~40 e−/Å2.Image processingFluPol A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) structure determinationFor the FluPolA TEM Titan Krios dataset, 14,001 movies were collected. Movie drift correction was performed using Relion’s Motioncor implementation, with 7 × 5 patch, using all movie frames52. All additional initial image processing steps were performed in cryoSPARC v4.353. CTF parameters were determined using ‘Patch CTF estimation’. Realigned micrographs were then manually inspected and low-quality images were manually discarded resulting in 13,328 micrographs kept. Particles were automatically picked using a circular blob with a diameter ranging from 110 to 130 Å, and extracted using a box size of 420 × 420 pixels2, Fourier cropped to 210 × 210 pixels2. Successive 2D classifications were used to eliminate particles displaying poor structural features, and coarsely separate monomers from dimers. Monomers were subjected to a ‘heterogeneous refinement’ job. Particles displaying PA-ENDO in the replicase conformation (PA-ENDO(R)), the rest of them displaying a dislocated FluPol core, were Fourier uncropped and subjected to a ‘non-uniform refinement’ job. Based on the estimated particle angles and shifts, a ‘3D classification’ job was performed. For each relevant FluPol conformation, particles were grouped and subjected to a final ‘non-uniform refinement’. FluPolA/H7N9-4M asymmetric dimers were first subjected to a ‘heterogeneous refinement’ job. Particles assigned to the 3D class displaying well-defined secondary structures were used for model training and picking using Topaz54. The resulting picked particles were extracted and subjected to 2D classification. All asymmetric dimers particles were merged, the duplicates removed, Fourier uncropped and then subjected to a ‘non-uniform refinement’ job. To alleviate the preferential orientation problem of the FluPolA/H7N9-4M replication complex, a ‘3D classification’ job was used. Particles displaying a proper view distribution equilibrium were used and subjected to a ‘non-uniform refinement’. Based on this consensus map, particle subtraction around ‘FluPol(R) minus 627(R)’ and ‘FluPol(E)-hANP32A-627(R)’ was performed. The subtracted particles were finally subjected to local refinement to improve subtracted particle angles and shifts estimation. Post-processing was performed in cryoSPARC using an automatically or manually determined B-factor. For each final map, reported global resolution is based on the FSC 0.143 cut-off criteria. Local resolution variations were estimated in cryoSPARC. The 3D-FSCs and particle orientation distribution were calculated in cryoSPARC v4.4.1, using the ‘Orientation diagnostics’ job. The detailed image processing pipeline is shown in Supplementary Notes 1–3.FluPol B/Memphis/13/2003 structure determinationFor the FluPolB TEM Titan Krios dataset, 15,650 movies were collected. Movie drift correction was performed using Relion’s Motioncor implementation, with 7 × 5 patch, using all movie frames52. All additional initial image processing steps were performed in cryoSPARC v4.353. CTF parameters were determined using ‘Patch CTF estimation’, realigned micrographs were then manually inspected and low-quality images were manually discarded resulting in 15,234 micrographs kept. Particles were automatically picked using a circular blob with a diameter ranging from 110 to 140 Å and extracted using a box size of 480 × 480 pixels2, Fourier cropped to 200 × 200 pixels2. Successive 2D classifications using a circular mask of 210 Å were used to eliminate particles displaying poor structural features. Following initial 2D classifications, all particles were re-extracted at a larger box size (512 × 512 pixels2, Fourier cropped to 200 × 200 pixels2) and subjected to multiple 2D classifications using a circular mask of 280 Å to coarsely separate dimers, monomers and trimers. For the FluPolB symmetrical dimers, following an ‘ab-initio’ reconstruction job, particles displaying one FluPolB(E) were Fourier uncropped and subjected to a ‘non-uniform refinement’ job, followed by respective FluPolB symmetrical (FluPolB(S)) and FluPolB(E) signal subtraction. After subsequent local refinements, ‘3D classification’ jobs were performed to separate the different FluPolB states. 3D classes displaying a complete FluPol(E) conformation were grouped, locally refined and subjected to a final ‘non-uniform refinement’ using the un-subtracted particles. A similar approach was used for the different FluPol(S) conformations (core, ENDO(R), ENDO(E) or ENDO(T)) (Supplementary Notes 4). Dimers displaying two FluPolB core were Fourier uncropped and subjected to a ‘non-uniform refinement’ job followed by a ‘3D classification’. Particles displaying one FluPolB with PA-ENDO in a transcriptase conformation (ENDO(T)) were grouped and subjected to a final ‘non-uniform refinement’ job (Supplementary Notes 5). For the FluPolB monomers, particles were subjected to an ‘ab-initio’ reconstruction followed by a ‘non-uniform refinement’. Subsequent ‘3D classification’ allowed isolation of monomeric apo-FluPolB(E). Particles were Fourier uncropped and subjected to a final ‘non-uniform refinement’ job (Supplementary Notes 5). For the FluPolB trimers (FluPolB replication complex plus one FluPol(S)), particles were subjected to an ‘ab-initio’ reconstruction job. The few particles displaying a well-defined FluB replication complex were Fourier uncropped and subjected to a ‘non-uniform refinement’ job. Particle subtraction was performed on ‘FluPolB(S) + FluPolB(E)’, ‘FluPolB(S) + FluPolB(R)’ and ‘FluPolB(S)’ moieties, followed by local refinements to improve subtracted particle angles and shifts estimation (Supplementary Notes 6). Post-processing was performed in cryoSPARC using an automatically or manually determined B-factor. For each final map, reported global resolution is based on the FSC 0.143 cut-off criteria. Local resolution variations were estimated in cryoSPARC. The 3D-FSCs and particle orientation distribution were calculated in cryoSPARC v4.4.1, using the ‘Orientation diagnostics’ job.

Movie drift correction was performed using Relion’s Motioncor implementation, with 5 × 5 patch, using all movie frames52. All additional initial image processing steps were performed in cryoSPARC v4.353. CTF parameters were determined using ‘Patch CTF estimation’, realigned micrographs were then manually inspected and low-quality images were manually discarded resulting in 2353 micrographs kept. Particles were automatically picked using a circular blob with a diameter ranging from 110 to 140 Å and extracted using a box size of 380 × 380 pixels2, Fourier cropped to 240 × 240 pixels2. Successive 2D classifications using a circular mask of 210 Å were used to eliminate particles displaying poor structural features. Remaining particles were subjected to a ‘heterogeneous refinement’ job. Particles belonging to the class corresponding to 5’ cRNA bound FluPolB(E) were subjected to a ‘non-uniform refinement’ job, followed by ‘3D classification’. A final ‘non-uniform refinement’ has been done with particles displaying a complete FluPol(E) conformation. Post-processing was performed in cryoSPARC using an automatically determined B-factor. For each final map, reported global resolution is based on the FSC 0.143 cut-off criteria. Local resolution variations were estimated in cryoSPARC. The detailed image processing pipeline is shown in Supplementary Notes 9.Model building and refinementAtomic models were constructed by iterative rounds of manual model building with COOT55 and real-space refinement using Phenix, with Ramachandran restraints56. For model building of the replicase-moiety of the FluPolB replication complex, the previously determined replicase-like structure (PDB: 5EPI)34 was used as starting point. The FluPolB encapsidase conformation was initially constructed from the higher resolution symmetrical dimer map and transferred to the replicase complex. For the FluA replication complex structure building, a variety of previous A/H7N9 structures were used as starting models.Validation was performed using Phenix. Model resolution according to the cryo-EM map was estimated at the 0.5 FSC cutoff. Structural analysis was performed in Coot and Chimera57. Electrostatic potential surfaces were calculated using the APBS-PDB2PQR software suite58. Buried solvent accessible surfaces were calculated using PISA59 at the PDBe. Figures were generated using ChimeraX60.CellsHEK-293T cells (ATCC CRL-3216) and HEK-293T (ATCC CRL-11268) ANP32AB KO cells7 were grown in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco). Cell cultures were PCR-tested regularly to ensure absence of mycoplasma contamination. Cells (3E04/well) were seeded in 96-well white plates (Greiner Bio-One) the day before transfection with polyethyleneimine (PEI-max, #24765-1 Polysciences Inc).Plasmids used in cell-based assaysThe pcDNA3.1-hANP32A-FLAG, A/WSN/33 (WSN) pcDNA3.1-PB2, -PB1, -PA, pCI-NP and B/Memphis/13/2003 (Memphis) pcDNA3.1-PB2, -PB1, -PA, -NP plasmids were described previously3,19,50. Plasmids used for vRNP reconstitution assays and the WSN pCI-PB1-luc1, Memphis pCI-PB1-luc1, pCI-hANP32A-luc2, pCI-chANP32A-luc2 plasmids used for split-luciferase-based complementation assays were described previously6,7. The pCI-hANP32B-luc2 plasmid was constructed by replacing the hANP32A sequence in the pCI-hANP32A-luc2 plasmid. pcDNA3.1-hANP32B-FLAG, -chANP32A-FLAG were constructed by replacing the hANP32A sequence in the pcDNA3.1-hANP32A-FLAG plasmid. All mutations were introduced by an adapted QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies) protocol61. ORFs were verified by Sanger sequencing.vRNP reconstitution assaysHEK-293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding the vRNP protein components (PB2, PB1, PA, NP), a pPolI-Firefly plasmid encoding a negative-sense viral-like RNA expressing the Firefly luciferase and the pTK-Renilla plasmid (Promega) as an internal control. For FluPol activity rescue experiments in ANP32AB KO cells, a plasmid encoding either the wild-type or mutant hANP32A, hANP32B or chANP32A protein was co-transfected. Mean relative light units (RLUs) produced by the Firefly and Renilla luciferase, reflecting the viral polymerase activity and transfection efficiency, respectively, were measured using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) on a Centro XS LB960 microplate luminometer (Berthold Technologies, MikroWin Version 4.41) at 48 hours post-transfection (hpt). Firefly luciferase signals were normalised with respect to Renilla luciferase signals. At least three independent experiments (each in technical duplicates) were performed, and each biological replicate is represented as a dot in the graphs. Plasmid combinations, orientations of tags as well as plasmid amounts used for transfections in a given experiment are available as a Source data file.Protein complementation assaysHEK-293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding the FluPol subunits (PB2, PB1-luc1, PA) and an ANP32A protein (hANP23A-luc2, hANP32B-luc2 or chANP32A-luc2). Cells were lysed 20–24 hpt in Renilla lysis buffer (Promega) for 45 min at room temperature under steady shaking. RLUs produced by the reconstituted Gaussia princeps luciferase, reflecting the FluPol-ANP32 interaction, were measured on a Centro XS LB960 microplate luminometer (Berthold Technologies, MikroWin Version 4.41) using a reading time of 10 s upon injection of 50 µl Renilla luciferase reagent (Promega). Three independent experiments (each in technical triplicates) were performed, and each biological replicate is represented as a dot in the graphs. Plasmid combinations, orientations of tags as well as plasmid amounts used for transfections in a given experiment are available as a Source data file.Antibodies and immunoblotsTotal cell lysates were prepared in RIPA cell lysis buffer as described previously62. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE™ 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes which were incubated with primary antibodies directed against PA (1:250063), PB2 (GTX125925, GeneTex, 1:5000), Gaussia princeps luciferase (New England Biolabs, #E8023, 1:5000), Histone H3 (Cell Signalling Technology, #9715, 1:1000), Tubulin (B-5-1-2, Sigma Aldrich, 1:10,000) and subsequently with HRP-tagged secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, 1:10,000). Membranes were revealed with the ECL2 substrate according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce). Chemiluminescence signals were acquired using the ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad, Image Lab Touch Software 2.4.0.03) and analysed with ImageLab (Bio-Rad, Image Lab 6.0.1 build 34). Uncropped gels are provided as a Source data file.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

This resulted in voluntary data reporting, which led to reduced visibility. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued a new rule requiring hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) to report information about COVID-19, influenza, and RSV starting November 1, 2024. Through the National Healthcare Safety Network, CDC will work with hospitals to provide training and technical assistance to ensure they are ready and able to meet these updated reporting requirements this fall. Summary What CDC knows Beginning November 1, 2024, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will require hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) to electronically report information, like confirmed infections and bed capacity, related to flu, COVID-19 and RSV, on a schedule specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. What CDC is doing These data will complement data that CDC collects and disseminates from other sources, such as wastewater, laboratory, and emergency department data. These data sources support robust systems that detect and monitor threats, keep the public informed about threats in their communities, and inform respiratory disease forecasting efforts. Through the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), CDC will work with hospitals to provide training and technical assistance to ensure they are ready and able to meet these updated reporting requirements this fall. Respiratory virus data are important for patient safety and public health The COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) underscored the critical role of hospital data in providing situational awareness around the impact of respiratory disease on the nation's hospitals, their patients, and workers. Considering this, CMS' new rule will require respiratory illness reporting in a modified form similar to previous reporting requirements. CDC, CMS, and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) worked together on these requirements, which were also informed by public comment. The requirements create a minimum set of data elements necessary to maintain situational awareness and address current patient health and safety needs while also informing CDC's public health response. Hospital data were collected through previous reporting requirements during the COVID-19 PHE and through the first respiratory virus season after the PHE declaration expired. This hospital data helped CDC provide weekly reports on severe health consequences of flu, COVID-19, and RSV and also monitor hospital capacity. Before the previous reporting requirements ended, NHSN data also informed local jurisdictions, hospitals, and nursing homes about local respiratory virus spread. Additionally, this data helped guide infection prevention strategies, such as source control, to protect patients, residents, and healthcare workers. While CDC continued sharing voluntary data after the mandatory reporting requirements ended in April, the change in reporting requirements impacted completeness, and information would fluctuate from week to week. The number of hospitals regularly reporting data decreased by nearly two thirds. These data are critical to help with public health coordination and keeping patients safe by: Informing strategic planning and coordination of public health responses. Enhancing disease surveillance and early warning systems by helping identify trends and patterns of disease spread. Improving healthcare delivery and patient outcomes through patient-centered care. Reporting requirements for hospitals CMS is requiring that, beginning on November 1, 2024, hospitals and CAHs electronically report information about flu, COVID-19, and RSV on a schedule specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). These include: Confirmed infections for a limited set of respiratory illnesses, including but not limited to flu, COVID-19, and RSV, among newly admitted and hospitalized patients. Total bed census and capacity, both overall and by critical hospital units and age groups. Limited patient demographic information, including age. In the event of a declared national, state, or local Public Health Emergency (PHE) for an acute infectious illness, the Secretary of HHS may also require reporting on the following additional data elements: Facility structure and infrastructure operational status. Emergency department diversion status. Staffing shortages. Supply inventory shortages (e.g., equipment, blood products, gases). Relevant medical countermeasures and therapeutics inventories, usage, or both. HHS will provide additional details on the specific data elements hospitals will be required to report in the coming weeks. CDC's NHSN will work closely with hospitals to provide training and technical assistance to ensure they are ready and able to meet these updated reporting requirements.

Alesia Davydava/iStock The patient was a 15-year-old girl from Prey Veng province who died from her infection on August 20. An investigation found that chickens had died in the village 5 days before the girl became ill and that she had touched and held dead chickens.Two earlier cases this summerCambodia reported two other H5N1 cases earlier this summer, both from Svay Rieng province. The patients—a 4-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl—were both hospitalized for their infections and both had contact with dead poultry before they got sick.The cases are part of an uptick in H5N1 cases in Cambodia, which has now reported 18 since early 2023. So far, the clade of the H5N1 virus that infected the most recent patient isn't known, but many earlier infections involved an older clade called 2.3.2.1c, which is known to circulate in poultry in some Asian countries, including Cambodia. The H5N1 clade is distinct from the 2.3.4.4b clade circulating globally, including in the United States, where the virus has also infected dairy cows, poultry, and a few farm workers. Georgia reports another measles case as Oregon outbreak hits 30 News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Measles The Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) yesterday reported a measles infection in an Atlanta resident who wasn't fully vaccinated, marking the state's fifth case of the year, according to a statement. LeventKonuk/ iStock The DPH said the patient was exposed to the virus during international travel, adding that it is working to identify people who had contact with the patient during the infectious period.Oregon outbreak worst since 1991In other developments, the Oregon Health Authority reported 4 more measles cases in its outbreak, raising the total to 30 in three counties. The outbreak is the state's largest since 1991. According to the latest data, all patients were unvaccinated and 2 were hospitalized. Twelve of the patients are younger than 10 years old, and 11 are ages 11 to 19.Measles activity in the United States is at its highest level since 2019, part of a global rise in cases. In its latest update, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it has received reports of 219 cases from 27 jurisdictions. Thirteen outbreaks have been reported, and 68% of cases this year were linked to outbreaks. High rate of carbapenem resistance in bacteria that cause newborn sepsis in Africa News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Sepsis Nearly a third of gram-negative bacterial infections in newborns with suspected sepsis in Africa are resistant to carbapenem antibiotics, researchers reported late last week in BMC Infectious Diseases.The findings are from a review and meta-analysis conducted by researchers from Woldia University in Ethiopia who hoped to fill in knowledge gaps in the population-based epidemiology of neonatal sepsis in Africa and estimate carbapenem resistance in the gram-negative bacteria that can cause sepsis in newborns. They defined carbapenem resistance as resistance to meropenem, imipenem, or ertapenem.Pooled prevalence of carbapenem resistance was 30%Among the 36 studies that assessed carbapenem resistance in gram-negative bacteria isolated from newborns with suspected sepsis in Africa, there were 7,116 isolates. The most frequently isolated pathogen was Klebsiella pneumoniae, which accounted for 38.2% of all isolates. The pooled prevalence of carbapenem resistance in all isolates was 30.34% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.03% to 38.64%). The pooled estimate of gram-negative bacteria resistant to imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem was 35.57% (95% CI, 0.67% to 70.54%), 34.35% (95% CI, 20.04% to 48.67%), and 26.11% (95% CI, 15.82% to 36.40%), respectively. The highest prevalence of carbapenem resistance was found in Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas spp., which had pooled prevalence of 45.9% (95% CI, 33.1% to 58.7%) and 43.0% (95% CI, 23.0% to 62.4%), respectively. The percentage of carbapenem-resistant isolates varied widely between countries, ranging from 0.5% in Sudan to 57.9% in Egypt.Neonatal sepsis is a primary cause of neonatal mortality in low- and middle-income countries in Africa and elsewhere. The study authors say stronger microbiology laboratory capacity to diagnose drug resistance is needed in countries with a high burden of neonatal sepsis.To address this global health threat, it is essential to implement robust infection prevention measures, antimicrobial stewardship, and strict surveillance."To address this global health threat, it is essential to implement robust infection prevention measures, antimicrobial stewardship, and strict surveillance of infections and antimicrobial resistance (AMR)," the authors wrote. "This is particularly crucial as third-line medications and carbapenems are increasingly losing their effectiveness."

Here, we sought to identify the nasal microbiome, Staphylococcus epidermidis-regulated antiviral immune responses and the alteration of polyamine metabolites in nasal epithelium. We found that polyamines were required for the life cycle of influenza A virus (IAV) and depletion of polyamines disturbed IAV replication in normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) cells. Inoculation of S. epidermidis also suppressed IAV infection and the concentration of polyamines including putrescine, spermidine, and spermine was completely attenuated in S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells. S. epidermidis activated the enzyme involved in the production of ornithine from arginine and downregulated the activity of the enzyme involved in the production of putrescine from ornithine in nasal epithelium. S. epidermidis also induced the activation of enzymes that promote the extracellular export of spermine and spermidine in NHNE cells. Our findings demonstrate that S. epidermidis is shown to be able of creating an intracellular environment lacking polyamines in the nasal epithelium and promote the balance of cellular polyamines in favor of the host to restrict influenza virus replication.

The respiratory epithelium produces antiviral molecules that initiate immune responses by rapid recruitment of innate effector cells and have their own unique mechanisms to prime antiviral immune responses in the respiratory tract against influenza viruses3,4,5. Importantly, the colonizing microbiome in the human respiratory mucus is subject to mediate the mucosal immune defense mechanisms of the respiratory epithelium, and studies on the reaction of the mucosal microbiome to the inhaled pathogens within the host increasingly consider the contribution of immune responses6,7. Inhaled respiratory viruses encounter the host’s immune system for the first time in the nasal passage, and the microbial characteristics of the nasal mucus are closely related to the mechanisms of initial immune responses8,9. Thus, insights into the microbiota of the human nasal mucus can provide fundamental information about the susceptibility of an individual to respiratory viral infections and factors contributing to related immune mechanisms10,11. Our previous study revealed that Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most abundant commensal present in the nasal mucus of healthy humans and that it accelerated the clearance of influenza A virus (IAV) from the nasal epithelium8. In addition, the inoculation of the human nasal commensal S. epidermidis into an in vivo nose limited IAV-caused lung infection via interferon-related innate immune responses12.A virus has to infect host cells to complete the genome replication and transcription, and the reproduction of a new infectious virus through its own metabolic machinery and enzyme system13. In this process, polyamines including putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are small aliphatic metabolites synthesized by mammalian cells to support cellular processes such as cell cycling and viruses rely on polyamines for the varied stages of replication, including cell binding, viral transcription and protein translation14,15. In the metabolic pathway of biogenic polyamines, ornithine is converted to putrescine by ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1), and it follows that putrescine is converted to spermidine by spermidine synthetase (SRM) and spermine by spermine synthetase (SMS)15. Several specific and potent inhibitors of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway have been developed to suppress viral replication and the ODC1 inhibitor, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) which is approved by the Food and Drug Association, has been found to reduce the replication of diverse viruses in vitro and in vivo with minimal cytotoxicity16. Prior work has demonstrated that RNA viruses are sensitive to polyamine inhibitors in vitro, suggesting that polyamines might be necessary for the replication of respiratory viruses17,18.Complex host–microbe interactions have made it difficult to gain a detailed understanding of the mechanisms involved in the cellular metabolism and antiviral immune responses. However, we hypothesized that nasal commensals that are always present in the nasal mucus or microbe-secreted proteins could affect the metabolites of the nasal mucosa. In particular, if the concentration of polyamines can be altered by the symbiotic nasal microbiome, respiratory virus replication could be controlled at the level of nasal epithelium and viral spread to the lower airway might be restricted more efficiently.In this study, we aimed to determine whether S. epidermidis, a dominant nasal commensal in healthy nasal mucus, might have the ability to influence the environment of cellular metabolites in the nasal mucosa and whether the alteration of metabolites might be involved in the suppression of IAV replication. We show that S. epidermidis creates an intracellular environment lacking polyamines in the nasal epithelium to restrict IAV replication and promote the balance of cellular polyamines in favor of the host.ResultsNasal commensal S. epidermidis alters the metabolites in nasal epitheliumWe first sought to explore whether the metabolite profile might be altered in nasal epithelium via human nasal commensal S. epidermidis. NHNE cells from five healthy volunteers (Supplementary Table S1) were inoculated with S. epidermidis (multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.25) for 1 day and the metabolome analysis was performed in the NHNE cell lysates using a p180 kit for screening of differential metabolomic profiles.We compared NHNE cell lysates of 111 metabolites depending on S. epidermidis inoculation by partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and separated profiles were observed (Fig. 1A). A variable importance in projection score plot followed by PLS-DA analysis is shown in Fig. 1B. The most important metabolites upregulated in S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells were citrulline, ornithine, acetylornithine, glutamate, and aspartate. To determine the specific metabolism altered in NHNE cells after inoculation with S. epidermidis, we used a metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) approach using the small molecule pathway database (SMPDB) (Fig. 1C) and visualized the biochemical and chemical interactions of metabolites (Fig. 1D, E). Together, the urea cycle and polyamine-related metabolites were altered significantly. The urea cycle-related metabolites such as citrulline (fold change 154.1), ornithine (fold change 32.47), and acetylornithine (fold change 29.25) were upregulated, whereas arginine was decreased (fold change −4.69). Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) were downregulated with a fold change of −3.33 to −1.66. Additionally, other metabolisms were also altered, for instance, arginine and proline metabolism, glycine and serine metabolism, and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis (Fig. 1C). In lipid metabolism, the levels of most lipids were decreased including phosphatidylcholines (PC), PEs, and sphingomyelins (SM) (Fig. 1E).Fig. 1: Nasal symbiont S. epidermidis alters the concentration of metabolites and metabolic pathways.A PLS-DA score plot, B VIP score plot showing top 15 metabolites by component 1, C metabolites set enrichment analysis using SMPDB, and chemical and biochemical networks of (D) amino acids and biogenic amines and (E) lipids. F Mapping of the urea cycle and polyamine metabolism-related metabolites from S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells.Full size imageAs the urea cycle and polyamine-related metabolites were changed significantly in NHNE cells after the inoculation of S. epidermidis, we mapped those metabolisms with detected metabolites from cell lysate and the supernatant (Fig. 1F). Interestingly, urea cycle-related metabolites were changed in the same direction in both lysate and supernatants. However, the concentrations of polyamines were downregulated in cell lysate but upregulated in the supernatant in response to S. epidermidis inoculation. These results indicate that the inoculation of the human nasal microbiome with S. epidermidis alters metabolic profiles and, in particular, depletes the polyamines from the intracellular level while the urea cycle metabolites are upregulated. Staphylococcus epidermidis restricts IAV replication and mediates polyamine depletion in nasal epitheliumTo determine the effects of S. epidermidis pretreatment on the susceptibility of the nasal epithelium to IAV infection, NHNE cells were inoculated with S. epidermidis (MOI = 0.25) at 8 h before IAV infection (WS/33, H1N1 MOI = 1) and the concentration of polyamines and the transcription or translation levels of IAV were measured. The real-time PCR results revealed that the increase in IAV PA RNA level (1.5 × 103) was significantly attenuated in IAV-infected NHNE cells after inoculation of S. epidermidis (3.9 × 102) at 1 dpi (Fig. 2A). Similarly, S. epidermidis exposure also decreased IAV NP levels in the cell lysate of IAV-infected NHNE cells at 1 dpi (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2: Staphylococcus epidermidis restricts IAV replication through the induction of polyamine depletion in nasal epithelial cells.Staphylococcus epidermidis restricts IAV replication through the induction of polyamine depletion in nasal epithelial cells. A Schematic diagram of the urea cycle and polyamine metabolism, B IAV PA mRNA expression, C NP protein expression, and changes in the urea cycle and polyamine metabolism-related metabolites in (D) cell lysate and (E) supernatant.Full size imageNext, we compared the metabolite levels related to the urea cycle (citrulline, aspartate, arginine, citrulline, and ornithine) and polyamine metabolism (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) from NHNE cell lysate and supernatant after the inoculation of S. epidermidis or IAV (Fig. 2C). The concentrations of urea cycle-related metabolites such as citrulline, aspartate, and ornithine were increased in the cell lysate in response to S. epidermidis, whereas arginine was decreased (Fig. 2D). A similar pattern of metabolite concentration changes was also observed in the supernatant of NHNE cells inoculated with S. epidermidis (Fig. 2E). While the level of ornithine was highly elevated, the concentration of polyamines such as putrescine, spermidine, and spermine was significantly lower in the cell lysate of S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the concentration of polyamines increased in the supernatant of NHNE cells after inoculation with S. epidermidis (Fig. 2E). In addition, metabolite profiles from NHNE cells after the inoculation of IAV did not separate by PLS-DA (Supplementary Fig. S1a) and the concentration of polyamine and urea cycle-related metabolites was not significantly altered in IAV-infected NHNE cells (Supplementary Fig. S1b). These findings suggest that human nasal commensal S. epidermidis restricted IAV replication in nasal epithelium and inoculation with S. epidermidis mediated the increase of urea cycle metabolites and depletion of polyamines in the nasal epithelium.Polyamine depletion limits IAV replication in NHNE cellsAs a next step, we examined whether polyamines might be essential for IAV replication in nasal epithelium and whether IAV replication was limited after the depletion of polyamines in NHNE cells. First, NHNE cells were treated with diethylnorspermidine (DENSpm, 100 µM) and DFMO (100 µM) which are known to mediate the depletion of polyamines at an intracellular level19,20. We found that DENSpm treatment depleted the level of polyamines more significantly than DFMO in NHNE cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, to determine the influence of polyamine depletion on IAV replication, the NHNE cells were treated with DENSpm 8 h before IAV infection (MOI = 1) (Fig. 3A). The western blot results showed the increase in spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1) expression in NHNE cells after the addition of DENSpm and as expected, the polyamines were depleted in NHNE cells (Fig. 3B, C). We observed a significant reduction in viral RNA levels (Fig. 3D) and IAV NP expression (Fig. 3F) at 1 dpi in the cell lysate of IAV-infected NHNE cells following the addition of DENSpm. To determine if exogenously supplied synthetic polyamines serve to induce viral replication, NHNE cells were treated with synthetic polyamines (putrescine, spermine, and spermidine combined at 1 uM) at 8 h before IAV infection. The results showed that both IAV PA RNA and NP protein levels were significantly elevated in IAV-infected NHNE cells when the synthetic polyamines were added to the cells after DENSpm treatment (Fig. 3E, F). Together, these results suggest that polyamines are required for IAV replication in NHNE cells and the polyamine-depleted cellular environment limits the transcription and translation of IAV in nasal epithelium.Fig. 3: Polyamine depletion limits IAV replication in NHNE cells.A Schematic mechanism of the depletion of polyamines by DENSpm, B SAT1 protein expression, C Alterations of polyamine metabolism-related metabolites, D, E viral PA mRNA expression by treating DENSpm or synthetic polyamines, and F viral NP protein expression.

The core polyamine synthesis pathway present in mammals is summarized in Fig. 4A. Within the cell, arginine is converted to ornithine, and arginase (ARG) is a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of ornithine from arginine and ornithine. Ornithine is converted into the polyamine putrescine via the action of ODC1. Putrescine is converted into spermidine via the action of SRM; spermidine is converted into spermine via SMS. Spermine can be catabolized further back to spermidine and putrescine via the action of SAT1. We have already found that the concentration of ornithine was significantly higher and the concentration of putrescine, spermine, and spermidine was completely lower in the cell lysate of NHNE cells in response to S. epidermidis. Therefore, we presumed that S. epidermidis might affect enzymes that are involved in the production of polyamines in nasal epithelium. We measured the mRNA levels of ARG, ODC1, and SAT1 in NHNE cells after inoculation with S. epidermidis. The results showed that the transcription of ODC1 was completely reduced in the cell lysate of NHNE cells 8 h after the inoculation of S. epidermidis. On the contrary, the mRNA levels of ARG and SAT1 were significantly elevated in response to S. epidermidis from 1 dpi (Fig. 4B). The western blot results also showed that the expression of ODC1 gradually decreased 8 h after inoculation with S. epidermidis and the expression of both ARG and SAT1 was significantly induced in NHNE cells from 1 dpi (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that S. epidermidis shifted an intracellular environment in the direction of reducing polyamine synthesis and induced the export of polyamines from the NHNE cells.Fig. 4: Staphylococcus epidermidis creates a polyamine-depleted cellular environment by affecting enzymes involved in polyamine production.Staphylococcus epidermidis creates a polyamine-depleted cellular environment by affecting enzymes involved in polyamine production. A Schematic diagram of the urea cycle and polyamine metabolism, and B mRNA levels of polyamine enzymes and C protein expression of each enzyme.Full size imageDiscussionOur study revealed that human nasal commensal S. epidermidis might shape a polyamine-depleted cellular environment by affecting the enzymes involved in urea cycle metabolism and polyamine production resulting in the disturbance of IAV replication in the nasal epithelium. Here, we found that polyamines are essential for IAV replication in nasal epithelium and are required for the transcription or translation of IAV. Following inoculation with S. epidermidis, the concentration of cellular polyamines, including putrescine, spermine, and spermidine, was altered in the nasal epithelium, thereby skewing the polyamine balance of the nasal mucosa in favor of the host. We estimate that the depletion of polyamines by S. epidermidis contributes to restrict IAV replication in nasal epithelium and these observations makes an advance in our understanding of the antiviral mechanism of nasal commensal, S. epidermidis.The respiratory mucosa is the first target organ of environmental pathogens and the critical role of the respiratory mucosa as a barrier for restricting invasion of the host by respiratory viruses has been emphasized21,22. The compositional differences in the respiratory microbiome have drawn increased interest, and the importance of the respiratory microbiome, especially in immune protection, has been recognized23. There is also growing evidence that a microbiome community resides in the human nasal mucus and exhibits the potential for antiviral immunity regulated by nasal microbiome. Our previous study revealed that S. epidermidis is the most abundant commensal organism in the healthy human nasal mucus, and the presence of S. epidermidis strengthens the frontline antiviral immune defense response in the nasal mucosa through the modulation of innate immune mechanisms12. The current study also demonstrated that the transcription and translation of IAV were significantly limited in the nasal epithelium after the inoculation of S. epidermidis. We postulated that S. epidermidis might help to disrupt the spread of IAV from the upper airway to the respiratory tract and mediates a distinctive antiviral host–bacterial commensalism in the nasal epithelium.Polyamines are found in all mammalian cells, although at various concentrations in different organisms and within the context of a normal healthy cell, polyamines are involved in diverse cellular processes including protein synthesis, RNA folding and bending, membrane interactions, protein-RNA interactions, DNA structure, and gene expression14,15. Given the abundance of polyamines within the cell and the importance of these molecules for nucleotide charge neutralization, it is not entirely surprising that viruses manipulate polyamines for their own replication and rely on polyamines for numerous stages in their life cycle. In addition, some viruses also appear to stimulate polyamine synthesis upon infection, highlighting the importance of polyamine production for viral replication18. Therefore, inhibitors of polyamine biosynthesis may directly inhibit viral translation or may suppress the cellular factors which are essential to the metabolic process of virus replication. Indeed, we showed that IAV replication was significantly reduced in nasal epithelial cells in a polyamine-depleted cellular environment and the presence of polyamines might be necessary for IAV replication in nasal epithelium.Interestingly, the concentration of ornithine, putrescine, spermine, and spermidine in nasal epithelial cells changed following inoculation with S. epidermidis. In particular, the concentration of ornithine was markedly increased in both cell lysate and cell supernatant of nasal epithelium in response to S. epidermidis but the concentration of putrescine, spermine, and spermidine was completely reduced in cell lysate in concert with higher concentration in cell supernatant. This result led us to believe that the S. epidermidis induces the depletion of intracellular polyamines by inhibiting the transition from ornithine to putrescine or mediates the export of polyamines from the cells. Although we did not measure the levels of polyamine transporter that could be related to the inhibition of extracellular polyamines transport, we determined that the inoculation of S. epidermidis might affect the activity of enzymes that are involved in polyamine biosynthesis. Our data revealed that S. epidermidis inhibited the expression of ODC1 and increased ARG and SAT1 expression in nasal epithelium. That is, S. epidermidis can activate the enzyme involved in the production of ornithine from arginine among the polyamine biosynthesis-related signal pathway and downregulates the activity of the enzyme involved in the production of putrescine from ornithine in nasal epithelium. Furthermore, this also increases the activation of enzymes that promote the extracellular export of spermine and spermidine. Therefore, in the human nasal commensal, S. epidermidis induces a polyamine-depleted cellular environment in the nasal epithelium and the completely low intracellular concentration of polyamines disrupts IAV replication.Our previous data demonstrated the antiviral effect of S. epidermidis against IAV infection in nasal epithelium through type III interferon induction and activation of serine protease inhibitors8,12. The current findings also showed that the polyamine-depleted cellular environment in the presence of S. epidermidis might be related to an antiviral defense mechanism resulting in disturbing the transcription and translation of IAV in the nasal epithelium.Interest in the host defense system activated by S. epidermidis and cellular metabolites has increased and recent study revealed that S. epidermidis contributed the alteration of lipids such as SM or ceramide (Cer)24. Although these metabolites are key constituents of the skin barrier, the depletion of SM reduced the activity of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of influenza virus and may be directly associated with restriction of viral spread25. Soudani et al. found that the inhibition of Cer through the downregulation of sphingomyelinase, which is an enzyme that converts SM to Cer, leads to the suppression of influenza virus infection26. Furthermore, glycine and serine metabolism were emphasized for the inhibition of influenza virus replication and SM can be synthesized from serine and palmitoyl-CoA27. Although we emphasized that S. epidermidis may restrict IAV replication via modulating the metabolites of epithelial cell in addition to the induction of polyamine depletion, our metabolomics resulting from S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells also showed a reduction of glycine and serine metabolites (Fig. 1D). We presume that decreased concentrations of serine and glycine metabolites also can be involved in limiting IAV replication in nasal epithelium via the control of Cer production. Thus, a further study will be required to determine whether S. epidermidis might be involved in the alteration of other metabolites in nasal epithelium.Some studies have proved the influence of polyamine inhibitors that may modulate virus replication and therefore, the targeting of polyamine depletion may be considered an emerging broad therapeutic approach against multiple respiratory viruses that depend on polyamines for their replication14,15. We also propose that polyamine depletion has a strong impact in reducing IAV replication in nasal epithelium and the symbiotic character of S. epidermidis-depleted polyamines benefits the host to potentiate the antiviral immune responses which are connected to the host nasal mucosa-S. epidermidis interaction, such as induction of interferon, inhibition of cellular entry that we described previously.The limitations of our study include details in the clarification of cellular mechanisms how S. epidermidis affects the two enzymes that are involved in polyamine biosynthesis or cellular export in NHNE cells. Furthermore, the results about the alteration of metabolites following inoculation of S. epidermidis were obtained from in vitro experiments. However, nasal commensal S. epidermidis which was applied in the present study, were isolated from the nasal mucus of healthy volunteers and metabolome analysis was conducted using cultured fully differentiated nasal epithelial cells which obtained from healthy human nasal mucosa. The present study focused on verifying the hypothesis that S. epidermidis could shape a polyamine-depleted cellular environment in the nasal epithelium and we estimate that the interaction between the host and the symbiotic microorganism occurring in the actual human nasal mucosa might be mimicked by our experimental models.Here, we described that the nasal commensal S. epidermidis impedes IAV replication in the nasal epithelium through the downregulation of polyamine synthesis and induction of cellular export of polyamines. Our findings provide further understanding that polyamine depletion may be a distinctive antiviral strategy to interfere with IAV replication and indicate an alternative antiviral strategy of nasal commensal in favor of host nasal mucosa.Material and methodsEthics statementParticipation in this study was voluntary, with written informed consent obtained from all human subjects before enrollment. The institutional review board (IRB) of the Seoul National University College of Medicine approved the protocol for this study (IRB #C2012248 [943]).Isolation of S. epidermidis from human nasal mucusPreviously, nasal mucus from the middle turbinate of healthy volunteers was collected using sterile 3M Quick swabs (3M Microbiology Products, ST Paul, MN, USA) and a rigid 0-degree endoscope in an operating room8. The swabs were inserted into the nasal cavities of the subjects without touching either the nostril or the anterior part of the inferior turbinate, which are lined with stratified squamous epithelium, not respiratory epithelium. The swabs were then gently rotated around the middle turbinate. The swabs with mucus were fixed in a fixative solution and were transported immediately to the laboratory for identification and subsequent microbial analysis. For bacterial colony isolation, the mucus was placed in lysogeny broth (LB) plates. After 2 days of incubation, bacterial colonies were obtained from LB plates and the colony of S. epidermidis was identified using GS-FLX 454 Pyrosequencing by 16S rRNA Gene Amplification8.To detect possible contamination, negative controls were prepared and subjected to the same procedures. The first step in the analysis was the extraction of DNA from the bacterial pellet. The bacterial DNA from nasal mucosal swab samples was extracted with a Fast DNA Spin Kit for soil (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA). The extracted DNA was dissolved in sterile water containing 40 μg/mL RNase A and was quantified with a Nano Quant Infinite M200 spectrophotometer (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) using a ratio of absorbance values at 260 and 280 nm (A260/A280). We have a total of 50S. epidermidis (S epi 1–50) isolated from 50 healthy volunteers, and we used one S. epidermidis (S epi 1) in the present study for in vitro experiments.Clinical information of healthy volunteersThe frozen-storage S. epidermidis (Subject 1) and nasal mucosa (Subject 1–5) from a total of five healthy subjects were used in this study: 3 males (mean body mass index 22.4 kg/m2) and 2 females (mean body mass index 20.3 kg/m2), whose mean age was 35.2 years, and who were referred to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology Seoul National University Hospital (Seoul, Korea) primarily for septal surgery between March and May 2019 (Supplementary Table S1). Intranasal endoscopy, computed tomography of the paranasal sinus, and a skin allergy test were performed before sampling. None of the subjects showed signs of infection, and all showed negative results in the allergy test. Those subjects who had taken any kinds of antibiotics within 2 months; who were pregnant or smokers; who had diseases and medication histories related to asthma; and who had any other chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, hepatitis, cancer, and autoimmune or neurological diseases were excluded. Participation was voluntary and written informed consent was obtained from all participants and the IRB of the Seoul National University College of Medicine approved the protocol of this study (IRB #C2012248 [943]).Viruses and reagentsInfluenza A virus (IAV WS/33: H1N1, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) was used to induce acute viral lung infection. Virus stocks were grown in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in a virus growth medium according to a standard procedure4. Briefly, after 48 h incubation at 37 °C, the supernatants were harvested and spun by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 30 min to remove cellular debris. Virus stocks were titrated on MDCK cells using a tissue culture infectious dose assay and stored at −80 °C.Cell cultureNormal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) cells were cultured as described previously28. Briefly, passage-2 NHNE cells (1 × 105 cells/culture) were seeded in 0.25 ml of culture medium on Transwell clear culture inserts (24.5 mm, with a 0.45-mm pore size; Costar Co., Cambridge, MA, USA). Cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of basal epithelial growth medium and DMEM containing previously described supplements. Cultures were grown while submerged for the first 9 days. The culture medium was changed on Day 1, and every other day thereafter. An air–liquid interface (ALI) was created on Day 9 by removing the apical medium and feeding the cultures from the basal compartment only. The culture medium was changed daily after the initiation of the ALI. Antibiotics such as 1% penicillin and streptomycin were added to all subculture media and culture stages and the antifungal agent fungizone (1 ml/1000 ml media; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) was added after filtering the media. All experiments described here used cultured nasal epithelial cells 14 days after the creation of the ALI.Metabolite profiles obtained from cell lysate and cell supernatantCell lysate and supernatant were collected after centrifugation (5 min at 18,341 × g and 2 °C). NHNE cell pellets (3 × 106) were collected and suspended using 75 µl of ice-cold ethanol:0.1 M phosphate buffer (85:15, v:v). The mixture was then subjected to three freeze–thaw cycles using liquid nitrogen and then centrifuged for 5 min at 18,341 × g and 2 °C. Metabolites from the cell lysate and cell supernatant were analyzed using a Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit as described previously21. The samples were then analyzed with UPLC-MS/MS system (Waters ACQUITY ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with AB SCIEX 5500 QTrap mass spectrometer). The data were normalized by using MetIDQ software. Variables that were not detected at levels above 70% were eliminated, and missing values or values below the limit of detection were imputed by one-fifth of the minimum positive values of their corresponding variables using MetaboAnalyst 5.029.Real-time PCRNHNE cells were infected with WS/33 (H1N1) for 1 day, and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technology, Seoul, Korea). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 3 μg of RNA with random hexamer primers (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Waltham, MA, USA) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Amplification was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, amplification reactions with a total volume of 12 μL contained 2 μL of cDNA (reverse transcription mixture), oligonucleotide primers (final concentration of 800 nM), and TaqMan hybridization probe (200 nM). Real-time PCR probes were labeled at the 5′ end with carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and the 3′ end with the quencher carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA). To quantify the cellular viral level and host gene expression, cellular RNA was used to generate cDNA. The IAV level was monitored by performing quantitative PCR of the PA gene (segment 3) with forward and reverse primers and a probe (5′-ggccgactacactctcgatga-3′, 5′-tgtcttatggtgaatagcctggttt-3′, or 5′-agcagggctaggatc-3′). Primers for human ODC, arginase (ARG), and spermine or spermidine acetyl transferase 1 (SAT1) were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA). Real-time PCR was performed using the PE Biosystems ABI PRISM® 7700 sequence detection system. Thermocycling parameters were as follows: 50 °C for two minutes, 95 °C for 10 min, then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for one minute. Target mRNA levels were quantified using target-specific primer and probe sets for PA gene, ODC, ARG, and SAT1. All reactions were performed in triplicate, and all real-time PCR data were normalized to the level of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, 1 × 106 copies) to correct for variations between samples.Viral titer determinationViral titers were determined using a plaque assay. Virus samples were serially diluted with PBS. Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells in 12-well plates were washed twice with PBS, then infected in duplicate with 250 μL/well dilution of each virus. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min to facilitate virus adsorption. Following adsorption, a 1% agarose overlay in complete MEM supplemented with TPCK trypsin (1 μg/mL) and 1% fetal bovine serum was applied. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C, and cells were fixed with 10% formalin at 2 days post-infection (dpi).Western blot analysisThe IAV NP, ODC, SAT1, and ARG protein levels were assessed using western blot analysis. IAV NP antibody (molecular weight 55 kDa, primary antibody 1:500) was purchased from Fitzgerald (North Acton, MA, USA, cat #10R-2121). Human ODC1 antibody (molecular weight 61 kDa, cat# MAB2695-SP, primary antibody 1:500), anti-β-actin antibody (molecular weight 43 kDa, primary antibody 1:500), and human SAT1 antibody (molecular weight 20 kDa, cat #AF-1786) were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). The human ARG antibody (molecular weight 35 kDa, primary antibody 1:500) was purchased from Abcam (Waltham, MA, USA, cat #ab66705). The NHNE cells were lysed with 2× lysis buffer (250 mM Tris-Cl, pH of 6.5, 2% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromophenol blue, and 10% glycerol). Cell lysate (30 μg of protein) was electrophoresed in 10% SDS gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH of 7.5, 150 mM of NaCl) for one hour at room temperature. The membrane was incubated overnight with primary antibody (1:500) in Tween–TBS (TTBS; 0.5% Tween-20 in TBS). After washing with TTBS, the blot was incubated for one hour at room temperature with a secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA, USA) in TTBS and was visualized using an ECL system (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK). Raw figures of western blot analysis were shown in Supplementary Fig. S3.Data analysisAll data are shown as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analyses for comparisons were made using the Mann-Whitney U test and Prism8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05 (*) and p < 0.01 (**). Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was calculated with MetaboAnalyst 5.0. Metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) using significant metabolites (p < 0.05) was analyzed with MetaboAnalyst 5.0 in an SMPDB-based database. Chemical and biochemical relationships of all the detected metabolites were conceived by mapping onto MetaMapp and visualized with Cytoscape 3.8.230,31.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

An adjuvant is an immune-boosting agent added to vaccines.Previous studies have found the two vaccines to have similar effectiveness in older adults, including those who have at least one underlying health condition known to increase their risk of experiencing severe flu. But there is limited research on how multiple concurrent high-risk conditions affect vaccine effectiveness.aTIV more effective in adults with multiple risk factorsUsing electronic health record data linked with pharmacy and medical claims, researchers estimated the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) in 1,115,725 aTIV recipients and 2,561,718 HD-TIV recipients from August 2019 through January 2020. The primary measure was prevention of influenza-related medical encounters (IRMEs). The secondary outcome was outpatient IRME and flu- and pneumonia-related hospitalizations.Among older adults with risk factors for complications, aTIV was more effective than HD-TIV at preventing any IRME, with an rVE of 12.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.0% to 15.0%) for adults with 1 or more risk factor, 18.4% (95% CI, 13.7% to 22.8%) for adults with 1 or 2 risk factors, and 10.4% (95% CI, 7.4% to 13.3%) for adults 3 or more risk factors. No difference in rVE was observed among older adults with no risk factors. The same trends were observed for the secondary outcomes of outpatient IRMEs and flu- or pneumonia-related hospitalizations.The study authors suggest the broader immune response provide by the MF59 adjuvant may account for the higher vaccine effectiveness observed among the most vulnerable in the population study, but say further research is needed to investigate how the immune response generated by aTIV contributes to overall vaccine effectiveness across populations with different risk profiles. Study: Bad COVID lockdown memories faded in a year, but kids' mental health worsened News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics COVID-19 DMEPhotography / iStock Although memories of COVID-19 lockdowns in Danish school children dimmed in detail and emotion from 2020 to 2021, their mental health remained poor, particularly among girls, Aarhus University–led researchers report in Child Development.The researchers asked 247 students to write about their memories of the first lockdown and their psychological symptoms three times from June 2020 to June 2021. The students, recruited from five public and private schools, had a median age of 11.9 years.Denmark closed schools from March 11 to April 17, 2020, for younger students and to May 18 for older ones. A second closure occurred from December 17, 2020, to May 6, 2021. Other measures taken were restaurant closures, gathering bans, physical-distancing policies, and work-from-home orders.Older students, teen girls most emotionalStudents whose memories were more negative and contained more COVID-19 information fared worse over time, which may mean that they integrated lockdown experiences more profoundly in their development and sense of self, the researchers said. Only by examining the content of all these different memories will we know if these results reported here are specific to the first period of the pandemic... or if instead our patterns of results extend to other forms of remembering and imagining pandemic-related experiences. Tirill Fjellhaugen Hjuler, PhD Older students and adolescent girls were the most emotional in their memory descriptions, which may show that adolescents better integrate memories into their meaning-making narratives than younger students. And adolescent girls, the authors said, may be more likely than boys to elaborate on memories of COVID-19 and their emotional well-being. The researchers called for research on the association between children's tendency to include semantic (eg, facts about COVID-19) rather than episodic (eg, interactions with family) in their recall of significant events and their adjustment."Only by examining the content of all these different memories will we know if these results reported here are specific to the first period of the pandemic, when radical changes in children's and adolescents' lives occurred, or if instead our patterns of results extend to other forms of remembering and imagining pandemic-related experiences," lead author Tirill Fjellhaugen Hjuler, PhD, of Aarhus University, said in a news release from the Society for Research in Child Development, publisher of Child Development. CDC issues Oropouche virus alerts for clinicians and travelers News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Oropouche Virus The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently posted a Health Alert Network notice for Oropouche virus following reports of expanded disease activity in Cuba and parts of South America, which has so far resulted in 11 imported US cases. Ian Jacobs/Flickr cc Oropouche virus, spread by certain biting midges and possibly some types of mosquitoes, has recently been linked to severe fetal outcomes, including death and congenital abnormalities. The CDC said travel-related cases have been reported in the United States and Europe among some people who visited Brazil and Cuba.Though more cases from more countries are expected as surveillance and testing increase, no local transmission has been reported in any US state or territory, the CDC said.The CDC urged clinicians to consider Oropouche virus in people who traveled to areas with confirmed or suspected cases within 2 weeks of initial symptoms and rule out dengue infection. It also asked clinicians to be aware of the risk of vertical transmission and to monitor pregnancies in women with confirmed Oropouche infections.Travel notice for pregnant women considering Cuba travelIn a related development the CDC issued a level 2 travel notice regarding Oropouche virus for people planning travel to Cuba. It had previously issued a level 1 notice for travel to South America.The CDC recommended that clinicians warn pregnant women considering travel to affected areas about the risk to the fetus and that all visitors practice precautions.So far, Oropouche virus cases have been reported in 9 of Cuba's 15 provinces. The CDC urged pregnant women to reconsider nonessential travel to Cuba and if unavoidable to strictly follow the CDC's prevention recommendations, which include using insect repellent, window and door screens, and fans when outdoors to blow biting midges away. Salmonella outbreak linked to pet turtles sickens at least 51 people in 21 states News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Salmonella Foodborne Disease The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced a Salmonella outbreak linked to contact with small pet turtles, similar to several other outbreaks linked to the animals in previous years. Fernanda Saiter/Flickr cc In the latest outbreak, the CDC has received reports of 51 illnesses from 21 states, with 23 patients hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.Two subtypes are tied to the outbreak, Salmonella Stanley (38) and Salmonella Poona (13). Illness onsets range from August 20, 2023, through July 9, 2024. More than a third of the patients are children younger than 5 years old.Of 41 sick people who were interviewed, 27 (66%) had contact with pet turtles. Of 23 people who reported the size of the turtles, 21 said they had contact with turtles with shells less than 4 inches long. A similar outbreak in 2023 resulted in at least 80 illnesses in 24 states.Testing of turtles identifies outbreak strainGenetic sequencing of Salmonella samples from sick patients suggests that their illnesses are closely related, hinting at the same infection source. Also, California officials collected a sample from a sick patient's turtle in June, and tests revealed Salmonella Poona that was closely related to bacteria that infected humans. Testing of turtle and environmental samples from Illinois also yielded the Salmonella Poona outbreak strain.The patient from California had purchased the turtle from a street vendor, and the person from Illinois had gotten the turtle at a souvenir shop. A survey of sick patients found that people had bought the turtles at those and other outlets, which also included online retailers.The CDC urged people not to buy turtles with shells less than 4 inches long due to the well-known infection risk, and it noted that there's federal ban on the sale and distribution of small turtles as pets. Quick takes: WHO mpox panel report, Eastern equine encephalitis, FDA OKs at-home syphilis test News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Mpox Eastern Equine Encephalitis Sexually Transmitted Infections When the World Health Organization (WHO) mpox emergency committee met on August 14 to discuss the quickly evolving developments in Africa, it unanimously recommended that the situation warrants a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). In accepting the group's recommendation the same day, the WHO's director-general said the group would soon release its temporary recommendations and full report for countries, which the WHO published today. The recommendations cover but are not limited to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Among several recommendations, the emergency committee urged countries to prepare for mpox vaccination for emergency response by convening immunization advisory groups. It also emphasized the importance of standing recommendations that the WHO issued when it called the end of the earlier PHEIC for the global spread of the clade 2 virus.Massachusetts and Vermont last week reported their first human Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) cases of the year, according to notifications from the state health departments. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health said its case, the first since 2020, involved a man in his 80s who was exposed in Worcester County. Meanwhile, the Vermont Department of Health reported an EEE illness in a man in his 40s from Chittenden County. He was hospitalized in the middle of July, but has now been released. The case marks Vermont's first since 2012. EEE is a rare mosquito-borne illness that can lead to severe neurologic complications. Transmission is most common in and around freshwater hardwood swamps in Atlantic and Gulf Coast states and in the Great Lakes region. In its most recent update on August 13, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had received a report of only one case so far this season, involving a patient from New Jersey.The Food and Drug Administration on August 16 announced that it has approved the first at-home over-the-counter test for syphilis, which detects human antibodies to Treponema pallidum in human blood. The test, made by NOWDiagnostics, produces a result in 15 minutes and is designed to alert the user for a potential follow-up, which would require confirmation testing by a healthcare provider. Syphilis cases in the United States have been steadily rising since 2018, with congenital cases up even more sharply.

By contrast, the seasonal influenza vaccine has been administered for decades with a solid safety record and a high level of public acceptance. We compare the safety profile of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 booster vaccine to that of the seasonal influenza vaccine.MethodsWe study a prospective cohort of 5079 participants in Israel and a retrospective cohort of 250,000 members of MHS selected randomly. We examine reactions to BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 booster and to influenza vaccinations. All prospective cohort participants wore a smartwatch and completed a daily digital questionnaire. We compare pre-vaccination and post-vaccination smartwatch heart-rate data, and a stress measure based on heart-rate variability. We also examine adverse events from electronic health records.ResultsIn the prospective cohort, 1905 participants receive the COVID-19 booster vaccine; 899 receive influenza vaccination. Focusing on those who receive both vaccines yields a total of 689 participants in the prospective cohort and 31,297 members in the retrospective cohort. Individuals reporting a more severe reaction after influenza vaccination tend to likewise report a more severe reaction after COVID-19 vaccination. In paired analysis, the increase in both heart rate and stress measure for each participant is higher for COVID-19 than for influenza in the first 2 days after vaccination. No elevated risk of hospitalization due to adverse events is found following either vaccine. Except for Bell’s palsy after influenza vaccination, no elevated risk of adverse events is found.ConclusionsThe more pronounced side effects after COVID-19 vaccination may explain the greater concern associated with it. Nevertheless, our comprehensive analysis supports the safety profile of both vaccines.Plain language summary We compared the safety profiles of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. We analyzed data from Israel involving 5079 participants who wore smartwatches and completed daily questionnaires, as well as electronic health records from 250,000 members of Maccabi Healthcare Services. We found that side effects after the COVID-19 vaccine were more noticeable, based on self-reported symptoms and heart measures (heart-rate and stress) detected by smartwatches. The increase in heart measures was higher after COVID-19 vaccination than after influenza vaccination in the first 2 days post-vaccination. However, electronic health records showed no increased risk of adverse events with the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Our analysis supports the safety of both vaccines but may explain the greater concern about the COVID-19 vaccine.

However, despite the promising safety profile and effectiveness of mRNA vaccines in preventing severe outcomes of COVID-19, there has been a notable global public reluctance to be vaccinated1,2. For example, in the United States, nearly 20% of the population has received no COVID-19 vaccine doses3. As of May 4, 2024, 27.7% of Israel’s population had not received any COVID-19 vaccine. Among the elderly aged 65 and above, the coverage rates for the first and second COVID-19 boosters were 82.6% and 47.8%, respectively. Influenza vaccine coverage was 15.3% nationwide, while 52.3%–58.6% of the elderly population had been vaccinated against influenza4,5. A key reason for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is concerns about the safety of the vaccine6,7.One strategy to address such concerns is by comparing the side effects of the mRNA vaccines to the side effects of the seasonal influenza vaccine, which has been administered for decades with a solid safety record and a high level of public acceptance. Hundreds of millions of vaccines for seasonal influenza and COVID-19 have been administered to date8,9 but information comparing the safety of these vaccines is limited.Currently, information on vaccine side effects is primarily collected through self-reporting methods, but these methods may be subject to bias and underreporting. To address this issue and provide a more comprehensive assessment of vaccine safety, extensive, continuous, and detailed monitoring of physiological changes in vaccinated individuals is necessary. Wearable devices, such as smartwatches, offer a promising solution. They enable continuous, detailed monitoring of physiological changes in vaccinated individuals, which can help identify vaccine-associated adverse events more effectively than self-reporting alone.Wearable sensors have been shown to detect subtle medical conditions, such as atrial fibrillation, based on irregular heartbeats10. Several studies have shown that heart metrics, including heart rate, heart rate variability, and resting heart rate, can indicate COVID-19 infection in the pre-symptomatic stage and thus can be used for real-time detection11,12,13. These heart metrics have been previously reported to correlate with subjective symptoms after the COVID-19 vaccine14,15. In the context of COVID-19 vaccination, a number of studies using wearables have observed short-term changes in heart metrics following vaccination, even when such changes were not apparent to patients when self-reporting effects of vaccination16,17,18,19,20.In this study, our primary objective is to assess the safety profile of mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccines compared to seasonal influenza vaccines. To achieve this, we leverage both prospective and retrospective data sources. The prospective data include self-reported information and physiological measurements captured by Garmin Vivosmart 4 smartwatches, while the retrospective data are derived from electronic health records (EHRs). We focus on evaluating short-term (up to 42 days) self-reported and biomarker reactions following the administration of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccine, and compare these with reactions observed after the seasonal influenza vaccine. Our analysis is based on a prospective cohort comprising 5079 participants enrolled in an observational trial. To further investigate potential short-term severe adverse events within a 28-day window post-vaccination, we also examine a retrospective cohort comprising 250,000 randomly selected members from Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), one of Israel’s largest healthcare providers, serving ~25% of the population. Through this comprehensive approach, we aim to provide a thorough comparison of the safety profiles of both vaccine types.MethodsCohortsProspective cohortWe studied a cohort of 5079 participants from a prospective observational trial of individuals in the PerMed study16,17,18,19,21 who received a third or fourth BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and a seasonal influenza vaccine between July 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022 (Fig. 1a, b; see Supplementary Note 1—study protocol, pp. 2–12). Participants filled out a daily questionnaire about clinical symptoms and wore a smartwatch that measured, among other factors, heart rate and heart rate variability-based stress.Fig. 1: Trial profile.a, b Prospective study, c retrospective study.Full size imageUpon enrollment in the study, we gathered information on the participants’ sex, age, and pre-existing clinical risk factors. These underlying medical conditions included diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, chronic pulmonary conditions, weakened immune system, cancer, kidney failure, and a body mass index (BMI) >30 (BMI is determined by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters).We paired observations so that we could compare vaccine reactions in each individual. Among the 5079 participants in the prospective cohort, a total of 4334 COVID-19 vaccine doses and 2639 influenza vaccine doses were administered. For both types of vaccines, we had hourly smartwatch data on heart rate and a Garmin-computed stress measure based on heart rate variability (heart rate: 1877 COVID-19 vaccine doses, 901 influenza vaccine doses; stress measure: 1845 COVID-19 vaccine doses, 878 influenza vaccine doses) (see Supplementary Table 2). From these observations we extracted paired vaccine observations; these are observations for individuals who received both the COVID-19 vaccine (first or second booster) and at least one influenza vaccine.Retrospective cohortFor the retrospective cohort, we examined anonymized EHRs of 250,000 randomly selected members of MHS (Fig. 1c; see Supplementary Note 1—study protocol, pp. 2–12). Eligible members were individuals 18 years and older who received both a third or fourth BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and a seasonal influenza vaccine between July 31, 2021 and March 1, 2023. Individuals who were not members of MHS throughout the entire study period were excluded.Study designProspective cohortFor the prospective cohort, participants were asked to complete a daily survey via the PerMed mobile application21. This survey compiled self-reported clinical symptoms from participants, using a predefined list of reactions observed in the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine trial22, while also allowing participants to freely report any additional symptoms they experienced. The survey was crafted based on potential symptoms that may follow infections with infectious diseases and respiratory illnesses, drawing on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and Clinical Modification (ICD-9) codes related to influenza, influenza-like illnesses, acute respiratory infections, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), group A streptococcus, and COVID-19.Throughout the study, from the moment they were recruited until the end, participants wore a Garmin Vivosmart 4 smartwatch. The smartwatch data were used to estimate the effects of vaccination on physiological measures such as heart rate and stress levels. Stress levels, computed by Garmin, range from 1 to 100 and are classified into four categories: resting (1–25), low (26–50), medium (51–75), and high (76–100)23. A higher stress level correlates with lower heart rate variability24,25. Heart rate data (beats per minute) were collected in intervals of 15 s while stress measurements were documented every 3 min.To minimize participant attrition and discomfort, several preventive measures were implemented, thereby enhancing the quality, continuity, and reliability of the collected data. First, participants who did not complete their daily questionnaire by 7:00 p.m. received a reminder through the PerMed application. Second, a dedicated dashboard allowed the survey company to identify participants who repeatedly failed to complete the daily questionnaire or wear their smartwatch. These participants were contacted via text or phone call and encouraged to adhere to the study protocol. Third, to engage participants, a weekly summary report was provided in the PerMed application, and a monthly newsletter featuring recent findings and smartwatch tips was sent out. At the conclusion of the 2-year study, participants received all their insights and were gifted the smartwatch.Further information regarding the recruitment procedure, choice of smartwatch data analyzed, data collection architecture, and PerMed dashboard is provided in the Supplementary Materials (see Supplementary Notes 1–3) and elsewhere18.Retrospective cohortFor the retrospective cohort, we examined anonymized EHRs of the patients. These records are automatically collected from various clinics and medical facilities nationwide and updated monthly in MHS databases. The data are coded, anonymized, viewed, stored, and processed within the research room of the MHS. MHS uses the ICD-9 classification with procedures coded using Current Procedural Terminology codes. We obtained demographic details for each patient, along with diagnoses linked to 28 possible adverse events, as specified by ICD-9 codes.Outcomes and statistical analysisProspective cohortThough the majority of participants only filled out the survey once daily, if there were multiple entries by a single participant within a day, only the final entry was considered. Since questionnaires cannot be updated after submission, participants were instructed to submit a new response in case of filing errors; we assumed that the last entry provided a more accurate representation of the participant’s entire day.We defined a “baseline period” for each participant using their data (self-reported questionnaire and smartwatch) 7 days prior to vaccination. A participant’s “baseline” refers to the last questionnaire they submitted during the baseline period and smartwatch data for the entire baseline period. If a symptom was reported following the vaccination and was not noted during the baseline period, we interpreted this to be a side effect of the vaccine. Participants who did not complete the questionnaire during the baseline period were omitted from our analysis because we could not determine whether their symptoms existed prior to vaccination. We compared the baseline period to 7 and 14 days after vaccination inclusive of vaccination day (“post-vaccination” period), for discrete and continuous metrics, respectively. Since the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that vaccine side effects typically disappear after a few days, our analysis concentrates on the first 72 h post-vaccination26.We included participants who (1) submitted the questionnaire at least once during the baseline period, (2) completed the questionnaire at least once within 72 h after vaccination, (3) provided wearable device measurements during the same day-of-week and time-of-day during their post-vaccination and baseline periods, and (4) received both the seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccine.We excluded participants who provided data for only 1 day (either during the baseline or post-vaccination periods), with an exception if the participant provided data for the same hours-of-day and days-of-week during the baseline and post-vaccination periods.We differentiated participants based on their self-reported intensity of symptoms as recorded in a questionnaire during the 72 h following each vaccination. Participants were grouped into “No Reaction,” “Mild Reaction,” or “Severe Reaction” categories, based on their most severe symptom reported in the 72 h following each vaccination. Consequently, if a participant experienced a single severe symptom for a day, and mild symptoms for the remaining 3 days post-vaccination, they were designated as having a severe reaction. The severity categorization could vary for participants after each administered vaccine dose.In alignment with the CDC27 and the Pfizer clinical trial22, we categorized symptoms as follows:Mild symptoms: abdominal pain, feeling hot, back or neck pain, feeling cold, muscle pain, weakness, headache, dizziness, vomiting, sore throat, diarrhea, cough, leg pain, ear pain, loss of taste and smell, swelling of the lymph nodes, fast heartbeat, and hypertension; severe symptoms: chest pain, dyspnea (shortness of breath), fever, confusion, and chills.For participants who reported feeling hot and recorded their temperature, we divided them into two categories: above 38.9 °C (fever) or below 38.9 °C (feeling hot); in cases where the participant did not record their temperature, we assumed it to be below 38.9 °C.From the questionnaire data, we computed the proportion and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of participants who reported experiencing each side effect in the post-vaccination period. The 95% CI for each side effect was calculated using a binomial distribution Binom(n,p), where p = the proportion of participants reporting the symptom, and n = number of participants eligible to be included in the self-reported questionnaire analysis. In cases where participants received more than one dose of the COVID-19 or the seasonal influenza vaccine during the study period, and were eligible to be included for both inoculations, each self-reported event (i.e., specific symptoms or no symptoms) was considered as:$${{{{\rm{number}}}}\; {{{\rm{of}}}}\; {{{\rm{events}}}}}=\frac{1}{{{{\rm{number}}}}\; {{{\rm{of}}}}\; {{{\rm{vaccine}}}}\; {{{\rm{episodes}}}}}\left[{{{\rm{event}}}}\right]$$ (1) to avoid overcounting.For the continuous Garmin smartwatch data, we compared measurements from the post-vaccination period to the corresponding day-of-week and hour-of-day measurements from the baseline period at the individual level. For example, we compare a participant’s Wednesday average 9 a.m. heart rate with their previous Wednesday 9 a.m. heart rate. If these data were not recorded (e.g., if a participant did not wear the smartwatch in the same period before and after vaccination), we excluded the participant from this analysis. Then, we aggregated each hour’s differences divided by all participants to calculate a mean difference and the associated 95% CI. We present this analysis starting a week before and after vaccination. In cases where participants received more than one dose of the COVID-19 or the seasonal influenza vaccines during the study period, and were eligible to be included for both inoculations, we calculated the average differences over all inoculations.We also compared the difference of physiological changes between COVID-19 vaccination and seasonal influenza vaccination among individuals who received both vaccines. For each participant, we first calculated the daily mean changes in heart rate between the post-vaccination period and the baseline period. We did this separately for the mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccine and the seasonal influenza vaccine. Then we calculated the difference between these two mean values for each participant and each of the 7 days after inoculation. This is equivalent to a two-sided Welch’s t-test, which does not assume equal population variance.Retrospective cohortFor each individual in the retrospective cohort who received both vaccines, we noted the existence in the EHRs of 28 potential adverse events (see Supplementary Table 1) during the 28-day period before and after each vaccination. This set of adverse events was composed based on a previous large-scale study that examined the safety of the first and second (primary series) COVID-19 vaccine doses28.We calculated the number of adverse events shown in patients’ EHRs before and after each vaccine. Consistent with a previous study29, we chose a time interval of 28 days to evaluate the potential short-term effects of each of the vaccines separately. Similar to large cohort studies18,30, we evaluated the risk differences using a self-as-control method that compared adverse events in the same patient in two periods: a baseline period of 28 days (from 35 to 8 days before vaccination) and a post-vaccination period of 28 days (0–27 days after vaccination). We used a 7-day buffer period between the baseline and post-vaccination periods in accordance with the guidelines of the Israeli Ministry of Health31, which recommend that an individual should not receive inoculation if suffering from any apparent infection with severe symptoms, including a fever higher than 38 °C. This 7-day buffer period was also consistent with the assumption made by a large-scale safety study in which non-vaccinated individuals were not eligible to serve as controls if the person experienced any health event in the week before the follow-up period28.During outpatient visits in Maccabi’s clinics, past diagnoses also appear as part of the current visit’s diagnoses. Thus, in line with the previous study, for each adverse event, we omitted individuals who were previously diagnosed with the same event in the year prior to the baseline period28.We conducted a pairwise comparison for each individual, calculating the risk difference between pre- and post-vaccination values, which we denote \({Y}_{{diff}}^{i,j}\) for person i and event j. If an adverse event was recorded in the individual’s EHRs in the post-vaccination period (i.e., 0–27 days post-vaccination) but not in the pre-vaccination period (35–8 days pre-vaccination), then the event is potentially associated with the vaccine or a random event, and we set:$${Y}_{{diff}}^{i,j}=1$$ (2) If the converse was true and an adverse event appeared before vaccination but not after vaccination, the event is potentially a random event, and we set:$${Y}_{{diff}}^{i,j}=-1$$ (3) If a specific event was reported in both the pre- and post-vaccination periods, we assumed the event is not associated with the vaccine, and we set:$${Y}_{{diff}}^{i,j}=0$$ (4) and thus the individual was excluded from the analysis of event j. For a fair comparison between the baseline and the post-vaccination period, if an individual was found to be positive for COVID-19 during the post-vaccination period, we compared only the events recorded in the period between the inoculation and the week prior to the positive test date and matched this period with the same time interval in the baseline period. Likewise, as individual cannot die during the baseline period but can die during the post-vaccination period, if an individual died during the post-vaccination period, we compared only the events recorded in the period between the inoculation and the recorded time of death and matched this period with the same time interval in the baseline period.The risk difference for event \(j\) is the mean value of \({\bar{Y}}_{{diff}}^{\cdot ,j}\) calculated over all vaccinated individuals. This approach mirrors the standard estimation of risk differences in exposed and unexposed groups32, while taking into account the paired nature of the samples. To calculate the 95% CI for the difference without imposing any unknown distribution, we applied a non-parametric percentile bootstrap method with 10,000 repetitions, similar to previous safety studies28,30. In case an individual received more than one inoculation of COVID-19 vaccine or more than one inoculation of the seasonal influenza vaccine, for each repetition we chose randomly one of the inoculations for each vaccine type.Additionally, we assessed the relative risk between COVID-19 and influenza vaccines by analyzing the incidence of adverse events over a 28-day period following each vaccination. We employed a non-parametric percentile bootstrap method with 10,000 repetitions to calculate the 95% CI. We repeated the aforementioned analyses for hospitalizations due to adverse events, stratified by age group.Ethical approvalThe prospective study was approved by MHS’ Helsinki Institutional Review Board, protocol number 0122-20-MHS. All participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study and were advised both orally and in writing of the nature of the study. This study is part of a larger study (an observational clinical trial funded by a European Research Council grant) and is in accordance with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation: a cohort of 5000 participants are recruited, download a dedicated mobile application, receive smartwatches, grant access to their medical records, and are followed for 2 years. Since the retrospective data were pseudonymized, the Helsinki Institutional Review Board approved the use of this cohort data without requiring specific consent from MHS members (protocol number 0122-20-MHS).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.ResultsProspective cohortCohort characteristicsA total of 2115 participants received either the COVID-19 vaccine or the influenza vaccine during the study period (Table 1). Among these participants, 1905 received the COVID-19 vaccine, while 899 received the influenza vaccine. In the paired sample of 689 participants receiving both vaccines, 355 (51.5%) were female, and age ranged from 20 to 85 years, with a median of 58. This is significantly higher than the median age in Israel, which is 30.5 years33. Among the 689 participants, 357 (51.8%) reported that they had an underlying medical condition and 177 (25.7%) had a BMI of 30 or greater.Table 1 Cohorts characteristicsFull size tableWhen we paired observations for individuals who received both COVID-19 and influenza vaccines, we obtained 799 paired COVID-19 vaccine doses and 692 paired influenza vaccine doses for heart rate; and 779 paired COVID-19 vaccine doses and 672 paired influenza vaccine doses for the stress measure (see Supplementary Table 2). These numbers are representative of 577 and 544 individuals with heart rate and stress data, respectively, who received both vaccines. Similarly, we had 881 paired daily self-reports on symptoms for 7 days pre- and post-COVID-19 vaccination and 727 pre- and post-influenza vaccination paired self-reports, corresponding to 621 individuals.Questionnaire analysisFor the COVID-19 vaccine, 39.7% [95% CI 36.4%–42.9%] of individuals reported no systemic reaction; for the influenza vaccine, this fraction was 66.9% [95% CI 63.4%–70.3%] (Fig. 2a). The most common reactions reported for the COVID-19 vaccine were weakness (16.1% [95% CI 13.6%–18.5%] of vaccinated individuals), headache (13.1% [95% CI 10.9%–15.3%]), muscle pain (12.1% [95% CI 10.0%–14.3%]), fever (7.0% [95% CI 5.3%–8.7%]), and chills (5.7% [95% CI 4.2%–7.3%]). The most common reactions reported for the influenza vaccine were weakness (7.3% [95% CI 5.5%–9.2%]), headache (5.3% [95% CI 3.7%–7.0%]), muscle pain (3.6% [95% CI 2.3%–5.1%]), feeling cold (3.5% [95% CI 2.2%–5.0%]), and sore throat (3.0% [95% CI 1.8%–4.3%]).Fig. 2: Extent of reported reactions following vaccination.a Reported symptoms following COVID-19 and influenza vaccination. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals based on a binomial distribution. b Comparison of self-reported reaction severity for COVID-19 vaccination and influenza vaccination among 621 individuals receiving both vaccines: number and percent of individuals reporting various combinations of no reaction, mild reaction, and severe reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine and influenza vaccine.Full size imageWe compared the severity of symptoms for the 621 individuals who received both a COVID-19 and influenza vaccine and who self-reported symptoms for both (Fig. 2b). Using Spearman’s rank correlation test we found a weak, albeit significant, correlation in the severity of the symptoms for the two vaccines (r = 0.185, p value < 0.001). Specifically, individuals who reported a more severe reaction after influenza vaccination tended to likewise report a more severe reaction after COVID-19 vaccination. Of the 621 individuals, 278 (44.8%) reported no reaction to either vaccine, 173 (27.8%) reported no reaction to the influenza vaccine and a mild reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine, and 36 (5.8%) reported no reaction to the influenza vaccine and a severe reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine. Similarly, 58 individuals (9.3%) reported a mild reaction to both vaccines, 38 individuals (6.1%) reported a mild reaction to the influenza vaccine and no reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine, and 25 individuals (4.0%) reported a mild reaction to the influenza vaccine and a severe reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine. Only five individuals (0.8%) reported a severe reaction to both vaccines. Of the 621 individuals, 321 (54.9%) reported the same level of symptom severity for both vaccines, and 259 (41.7%) reported a higher level of symptom severity for the COVID-19 vaccine than for the influenza vaccine. Only 46 individuals (7.4%) reported a lower level of symptom severity for the COVID-19 vaccine than for the influenza vaccine.Wearables analysisWe examined mean pre- and post-vaccination differences in hourly heart rate and stress data for participants who received either the COVID-19 or influenza vaccine (Fig. 3). Following the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, we identified a statistically significant increase in heart rate during the first 3 days compared to the baseline period. This increase peaked 22 h after vaccination, with a mean difference of 4.48 (95% CI 3.94–5.01) more beats per minute compared to baseline. By the 6th day post-inoculation, heart rate levels returned to baseline. A similar trend was observed for stress data: the increase in stress measure was statistically significant with a peak 22 h after vaccination and a mean increase of 9.34 (95% CI 8.31–10.37) units in the stress measure. For influenza vaccination, no statistically significant changes in heart rate or the stress measure were observed.Fig. 3: Physiological reaction following vaccination.Mean difference in a, b heart rate (in beats per minute [bpm]) and c, d heart rate variability-based stress measure (in points) between the post-vaccination and baseline periods after a, c COVID-19 and b, d influenza vaccinations. Shaded regions represent 95% confidence intervals. bpm refers to beats per minute.Full size imageTo directly compare the effects of the two vaccines we conducted a pairwise comparative analysis in which we examined daily mean changes in heart rate and the stress measure for individuals receiving both vaccines (Fig. 4). For each such participant, we calculated the mean change in the indicator (either heart rate or stress) associated with COVID-19 vaccination compared to an individual’s baseline levels minus the mean change in the indicator associated with influenza vaccination compared to the individual’s baseline. Figure 4 shows that the increase in both heart rate and the stress measure for each participant was higher for COVID-19 vaccination than for influenza vaccination in the first 2 days after vaccination, and that this increase is statistically significant (using two-tail paired t-test: HR: p value = 0.0011, effect size = 0.2400; HRV: p value < 0.0001, effect size = 0.3247). However, these differences were small: for example, on the 2nd day after vaccination, mean heart rate was 1.5 (95% CI 0.68–2.20) beats per minute higher after COVID-19 vaccination than after influenza vaccination, compared to an individual’s baseline, and mean stress was 3.8 (95% CI 2.27–5.22) units higher. Moreover, these differences disappeared by the 3rd day after vaccination: for the third through 7th days after vaccination, there were no statistically significant differences in changes in these two indicators for the COVID-19 vaccine compared to the influenza vaccine.Fig. 4: Paired analysis.Daily mean changes in the smartwatch indicators for heart rate and the stress measure. For each participant, this was calculated as the mean change in the indicator (either a heart rate or b heart rate variability-based stress measure) associated with COVID-19 vaccination compared to an individual’s baseline minus the mean change in the indicator associated with influenza vaccination. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. bpm refers to beats per minute.Full size imageRetrospective cohortCohort characteristicsThe retrospective cohort included 31,297 Maccabi members who received both vaccines during the study period. Of these individuals, 16,956 (54.2%) were female (Table 1). Age ranged from 12 to 103 years, with a median of 59. An underlying medical condition was listed in the EHR for 14,437 (45.8%) individuals, and 5069 (16.2%) had a BMI of 30 or greater.EHR analysisWe found no elevated risk of hospitalizations for any of the 28 adverse events following the administration of either vaccine (Supplementary Data 1). Among the 31,297 individuals receiving both vaccines, 37 hospitalizations for adverse events occurred in the post-vaccination period compared to 51 in the baseline period for the COVID-19 vaccine and 32 hospitalizations occurred in the post-vaccination period compared to 30 in the baseline period for the influenza vaccine, corresponding to risk differences of −4.5 (95% CI: −10.2 to 1.3) and −0.6 (95% CI: −5.8 to 4.2) event/10,000 vaccinated individuals, respectively.We found no statistically significant increase in the risk of the examined adverse events for COVID-19 vaccination (Supplementary Data 1). Influenza vaccination was associated with an increased risk of Bell’s palsy (1.3 [95% CI 0.3–2.6] additional events/10,000 people), but was not associated with any other increase in risk of the examined adverse events.We examined the risk difference for adverse event hospitalizations stratified by age group and found no increase in such hospitalization risk after either vaccine across different age groups (Table 2).Table 2 Adverse events following vaccination stratified by age groupFull size tableDiscussionOur analyses of data from patient questionnaires and smartwatches (in a prospective study) and from EHRs (in a retrospective study) comparing side effects of COVID-19 booster vaccination and seasonal influenza vaccination further support the safety of the first and second BNT162b2 booster vaccinations in eligible populations. In the patient questionnaires, more individuals reported mild or severe effects after the COVID-19 vaccine than after the influenza vaccine (60.3% vs. 33.1%). We found a weak but significant positive correlation in the severity of the symptoms for the two vaccines. From the smartwatch data, we identified a small but statistically significant increase in heart rate and the stress measure in the 3 days after COVID-19 vaccination, with levels returning to normal within 6 days after vaccination. For influenza vaccination, no statistically significant changes in these measures were observed. Although our paired analysis of reactions to COVID-19 and influenza vaccination suggested that the differences are significant, they were small and do not indicate lack of safety. Importantly, for the retrospective cohort, our analysis of EHRs—which are based on diagnoses of physicians in clinics and hospitals—identified no significant change in risk of adverse events after either vaccine, except for an elevated risk of Bell’s palsy after the influenza vaccine, a rare event. This finding is in line with a recent large-scale study that also found this positive association34. Despite this finding, the benefits of influenza vaccination in preventing severe outcomes far exceed this risk.At both the aggregate level where we compared average changes in smartwatch measures pre- and post-vaccination for COVID-19 vs. influenza vaccination, and at the individual level where we compared each patient’s changes in these measures, we found an increase in heart rate: 4.48 (95% CI 3.94–5.01) beats per minute higher at the aggregate level, and 1.5 (95% CI 0.68–2.20) beats per minute higher 22 h after vaccination when we performed a pairwise comparison. Previous studies have found that even small long-lasting increases in heart rate are associated with an increased risk of death35,36. However, we found that the increases in heart rate disappeared within 6 days after vaccination. We also found increases in the heart rate variability-based stress measure. Some details are available on how the Garmin stress measure is calculated37,38, but the exact algorithm is proprietary and is not fully disclosed. Although the stress measures returned to baseline within 6 days after vaccination, the clinical significance of the short-term increases in the stress measure is unknown.The integration of both retrospective and prospective data methodologies in our study enables a comprehensive understanding of the safety profiles of mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccines and seasonal influenza vaccines. Prospective data collection, including self-reported information and physiological measurements, provides real-time insights into participants’ experiences following vaccination, allowing for the detection of immediate reactions and short-term outcomes. This approach enables us to capture a detailed snapshot of individual-level responses, facilitating the identification of reactions with a high level of granularity. Retrospective data derived from EHRs offer a broader population-level perspective, encompassing a larger sample size. By analyzing historical healthcare data, we gain insights into the occurrence of adverse events over time, including those that may manifest beyond the immediate post-vaccination period. However, each data source has its limitations: prospective data collection may be susceptible to biases inherent in self-reporting and wearable devices, while retrospective data may be subject to incompleteness or inaccuracies in healthcare records. Integration of these complementary datasets helps to overcome individual methodological shortcomings and enhances the robustness of our findings: our prospective data analysis provides granular insights into short-term reactions, while the retrospective analysis offers a broader perspective on vaccine safety. The synergistic combination of the two approaches enables a comprehensive evaluation of vaccine safety that can guide evidence-based decision-making for public health policy and vaccination strategies.Our analysis has several limitations. First, we considered only BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccines. Second, the median cohort age was greater than the median age in Israel, reflecting the fact that older individuals (55+ years age group) are more likely to receive both influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 booster shot than younger individuals (12-54 years age group). As we analyzed only individuals who got vaccinated in both vaccines, the total population vaccinated in each vaccine separately might be different. Third, the Garmin smartwatches are not medical-grade wearable devices, although previous studies have demonstrated the accuracy of smartwatches in measuring heart rates39,40 and our analysis considers relative heart rate values pre- and post-vaccination rather than absolute heart rate values.The composition of the cohorts may affect the extent to which our findings can be generalized to the broader Israeli population and to other populations. The Participants in our prospective cohort were mainly recruited through social media advertisements and word-of-mouth referrals, resulting in a convenience sample. The study’s rigorous requirements, such as the continuous use of smartwatches and daily questionnaire completion over a 2-year period, may have discouraged certain segments of the population from participating. Moreover, the retrospective cohort comprised members of MHS and may not fully represent all ethnic minority groups. However, it is essential to acknowledge that we do not anticipate differential adverse reactions based on ethnicity41.Another limitation involves the underreporting of short-term vaccine reactions in the EHR. There are several reasons why people might not report these reactions: mild or expected symptoms often go unreported; some individuals may not recognize that their symptoms are potential side effects of vaccination; others may attribute their symptoms to pre-existing health conditions or unrelated illnesses; and some have limited access to their general physician. The Israeli Ministry of Health addresses this gap by encouraging individuals to report any short-term reactions using a 3-min online survey42. Thus, individuals might find it sufficient to report adverse events via the online system rather than contacting their general physician. However, these data are not shared with the individual’s care provider (in this case, MHS). To mitigate this limitation in our retrospective cohort, we focused only on severe adverse events, which are more likely to be appear in the EHR because of individuals seeking care.Finally, our analysis does not necessarily represent the entire population eligible to receive COVID-19 booster doses or seasonal influenza vaccine according to the Israeli Ministry of Health guidelines, only those who received them. For example, the observation that individuals who had a severe adverse response to the COVID-19 primary vaccine series or influenza vaccine (see reports on adverse events after the primary series28) might opt not to receive the COVID-19 first or the second boosters or the seasonal influenza vaccine and would therefore not be represented in our analysis.Participants in the prospective study are also members of MHS, so future research could investigate whether the participants’ self-reported adverse events following immunization (AEFI) were documented in the EHR. This comparison could help quantify the extent of underreporting of AEFI, providing valuable insights into vaccine safety surveillance and potential strategies for improvement.Our analysis demonstrates the power of examining patient data from multiple sources. Although more individuals experienced side effects after COVID-19 vaccination than after influenza vaccination, as reflected both in patient self-reports and in smartwatch data, the differences in examined side effects detected by the smartwatches were small, the differences disappeared by 3 days after vaccination, and heart measures returned to their pre-vaccination baseline within 6 days after vaccination. Moreover, no statistically significant increase in the risk of adverse events, as reflected in EHRs, was associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Taken together, these findings support the safety of the first and second BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA COVID-19 booster shots.

The Phase I/II trial (NCT05972174) was evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1018 pandemic influenza candidate vaccines in healthy adults to enable the initiation of a large Phase III trial with one selected vaccine candidate. The trial enrolled 1,504 participants. The study was conducted in two parts (part A and part B) that would enroll and run concurrently. Part A of the study was designed to evaluate four vaccine candidates (H5N8, H7N9, H5 only, and H7 only) while part B of the study would evaluate a single vaccine candidate (H5 only-CG). Influenza A virus subtype H5 and H7 and its variants are forms of avian influenza. On July 2, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that it would give Moderna around $176m to accelerate the development of the mRNA-1018 vaccine amid an ongoing outbreak of avian influenza. The funds were awarded by HHS through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Investigator-led trial of BMS’s ricolinostat terminated Bristol Myers Squibb’ (BMS) ricolinostat has seen its PTSR fall in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma after an investigator-led Phase Ib/II trial studying the same indications was terminated. The PTSR for ricolinostat dropped in neuroblastoma by 24 points to 16% in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and by 20 percentage points to 13% in Hodgkin lymphoma. The trial listing on ClinicalTrials.gov status changed from completed” to terminated on July 16, with the listing citing the reason as lack of funding. GlobalData evaluated the asset on August 7. The trial was being sponsored by Dr. Jennifer Amengual, Columbia University. The Phase Ib/II trial (NCT02091063) was an open-label study investigating ricolinostat in patients with histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma, with an expansion cohort of patients with mantle cell lymphoma. The trial was terminated after 23 of the estimated 24 patients were enrolled, but just 21 were classified as baseline patients. Due to the early termination, primary endpoint data for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and objective response rate (ORR) were not reported. Phase II fibromyalgia trial completes UCB’s Rystiggo (rozanolixizumab) saw its PTSR rise following a Phase II trial completion in fibromyalgia. The drug’s PTSR rose by nine points, reaching 36% in this indication. The trial’s status was updated on its ClinicalTrials.gov listing from ongoing, not recruiting to completed on August 9 and GlobalData evaluated the asset on August 12. The Phase II study (NCT05643794) evaluated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Rystiggo in 63 adult study participants with severe fibromyalgia syndrome. The study’s primary endpoint evaluated the Brief Pain Inventory short form (BPI-SF) average interference score after a period of twelve weeks of treatment. The BPI is a self-administered questionnaire utilised to assess the severity of a participant’s pain and the impact of this pain on the patient’s daily functioning. The trial’s secondary endpoints evaluated the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events among other things. Rystiggo is a monoclonal antibody and anti-inflammatory agent marketed for generalized myasthenia gravis. The drug acts by blocking the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-IgG interaction, which regulates the responses of innate and adaptive immune cells. Phase II Angelman syndrome trial completed Neuren Pharmaceuticals’s NNZ-2591 saw a nine-point increase in its PTSR, reaching 45% in Angelman syndrome, following a Phase II trial completion. The study’s (NCT05011851) ClinicalTrials.gov status changed from recruiting to completed on August 6, and the PTSR change was recorded on August 8. The open-label Phase II study investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of NNZ-2591 in patients with Angelman syndrome. The trial evaluated the incidence, severity and frequency of adverse events as its primary endpoint. NNZ-2591 is a diketopiperazine that treats Angelman syndrome by crossing the blood-brain barrier to improve learning and memory processes. Angelman syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes dysfunction in the nervous system and severe physical and learning disabilities. The Melbourne, Australia-headquartered company is also developing NNZ-2591 for other rare diseases such as Phelan-McDermid syndrome, Pitt Hopkins syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. Phase I/II HNSCC trial terminated F-Star Therapeutics’s FS-118 saw its PTSR decrease in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and solid tumours after a Phase I/II trial was terminated. The PTSR dropped by eight points in HNSCC to 24% and 15 points in solid tumours to 5%. The Phase I/II trial’s (NCT03440437) status was updated from completed to terminated on ClinicalTrials.gov on August 7, and GlobalData evaluated the asset on the following day. According to the study’s ClinicalTrials.gov listing, the sponsor terminated the study due to a business decision. The purpose of the open-label study was to evaluate the safety and anti-tumour activity of FS-118 as a monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced malignancies. The study enrolled 80 patients before being terminated. FS-118 is a bispecific monoclonal antibody that acts by inhibiting programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) and elicits anti-neoplastic activity. It is under development for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Local News Kansas water treatment plants find moderate levels of influenza by: Colter Robinson Posted: Aug 21, 2024 / 10:02 AM CDT Updated: Aug 21, 2024 / 10:54 AM CDT by: Colter Robinson Posted: Aug 21, 2024 / 10:02 AM CDT Updated: Aug 21, 2024 / 10:54 AM CDT SHARE KANSAS (KSNT) – Earlier this month, four water treatment plants that serve a combined population of 180,000 in Kansas, reported moderate levels of influenza in wastewater. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been monitoring an outbreak of the influenza A (H5N1) bird flu. Since 2022, the H5N1 bird flu has killed more than 100 million birds and 191 dairy farm herds. The CDC has tested more than 41,000 specimens with 14 reported human cases. So far, 14 cases of H5N1 have been reported in humans since 2022. More recently, four poultry workers in Colorado were diagnosed with bird flu. There have also been reports of H5N1 infecting other mammals. The New York Times reported at least 21 domestic cats had been infected. Car stolen with child inside, two Topekans arrested “We looked at the global distribution and spread of bird flu infections in feline species between 2004 and 2024 and found a drastic rise in reports of feline infections starting in 2023, with a spike in infections reported among domestic cats, as opposed to wild or zoo-kept animals. This increase coincides with the rapid spread of the current strain of H5N1 among mammals,” Kristen Coleman, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health said. While no cases have been reported in Kansas, water treatment plants in Johnson, Reno and Saline counties reported low or moderate amounts of influenza found in water samples. According to the CDC, wastewater data can’t be used to determine which influenza virus subtype is detected or the source of the virus. Once influenza levels reach 80% or higher, the CDC works with partners to understand the reason for the high levels. Car stolen with child inside, two Topekans arrested In Kansas, Reno and Johnson counties reported having a 47.73 percentile for influenza this month. Two treatment plants in Saline County also reported low findings in the 20 percentile range for influenza. “The virus is going to sneak up in more places, just like it did in dairy farms. We know cats are being infected, so let’s get ahead of it,” Coleman told NewsNation. For more local news, click here.

Traditional monoclonal antibody generation relies on animal immunization procedures predominantly involving mice; however, recent advances in in-vitro expression methodologies have enabled large-scale production suitable for both industrial applications as well as scientific investigations. Methods: In this study, two mAbs against H7 subtype avian influenza viruses (AIV) were sequenced and analyzed, and the DNA sequences encoding heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) were obtained and cloned into pCHO-1.0 expression vector. Then, the HC and LC expression plasmids were transfected into CHO-S cells to establish stable cell lines expressing these mAbs using a two-phase selection scheme with different concentrations of methotrexate and puromycin. Recombinant antibodies were purified from the cell culture medium, and their potential applications were evaluated using hemagglutination inhibition (HI), western blotting (WB), confocal microscopy, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The results indicated that the obtained recombinant antibodies exhibited biological activity similar to that of the parent antibodies derived from ascites and could be used as a replacement for animal-derived mAbs. A kinetic analysis of the two antibodies to the AIV HA protein, conducted using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), showed concordance between the recombinant and parental antibodies. Discussion: The data presented in this study suggest that the described antibody production protocol could avoid the use of experimental animals and better conform to animal welfare regulations, and provides a basis for further research and development of mAbs-based diagnostic products. 1 Introduction Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are classified into low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. Most of the HPAI viruses belong to the H5 or H7 types, among them, first reported HPAI in history is the H7 subtype, which can cause severe disease and high mortality in infected poultry, leading to devastating impacts on the poultry industry. In early 2017, outbreaks of H7N9 HPAI on chicken farms in China caused considerable damage to the poultry industry (Shi et al., 2018, 2023). In 2020, an outbreak of H7N7 HPAI on farms in Australia led to a substantial loss of livestock and had a significant economic impact (Bisset and Hoyne, 2021). Historically, the H7 subtype avian influenza virus has caused human infections multiple times. For example, an outbreak of subtype H7 infections in humans occurred in spring 2003 when an HPAI H7N7 virus was detected on commercial poultry farms in the Netherlands (Munster et al., 2007). Between 2013 and 2017, five waves of H7N9 infection occurred in China, and the number of laboratory-confirmed cases and human deaths were 1,568 and 615 (Munster et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2013; Kile et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2021), respectively. H7 subtype influenza viruses not only have caused outbreaks in poultry in many countries, resulting in huge losses to the industry, but also have caused serious respiratory diseases in humans, with some even leading to death (Shi et al., 2017; Wan et al., 2022). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are crucial for the development of diagnostic reagents. Recombinant mAbs, produced through molecular cloning techniques, offer high batch consistency, and repeatability. Recombinant mAbs methods avoid the slight changes in antibody production caused by genetic drift in hybridoma cell lines as well as the use of mouse ascites and therefore the need for animal ethics board review. An additional advantage of recombinant antibodies is their potential for increased versatility, as researchers can genetically fuse the primary amino acid sequence to other molecules, such as fluorophores, to generate custom tools with diverse functionalities. In this study, we sequenced two mAbs against H7 subtype AIV derived from hybridoma cells and cloned them into an expression vector. We then established two stable cell lines that express these mAbs and obtained recombinant mAbs from the cell culture supernatant (Figure 1). Testing revealed that the biological activities of the recombinant mAbs were similar to those of the parent antibodies, demonstrating that antibodies expressed in vitro can effectively replace ascites-derived parent antibodies for use in diagnostics or basic research. Figure 1 Figure 1. A brief overview of the process for preparing recombinant antibodies. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Viruses and cells The A/chicken/Guangdong/SD008/2017(H7N9) virus, abbreviated hereafter as CK/SD008, was isolated and stored at the State Key Laboratory for Animal Disease Control and Prevention as previously described (Shi et al., 2017). SP2/0-AG14 myeloma cells and HEK-293T cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (ExCell) at 37°C and 5% CO2. CHO-S cells were cultured in CD FortiCHO™ Medium (Gibco) supplemented with Anti-Clumping Agent (Gibco) and GlutaMAX™ (Gibco) at 37°C and 8% CO2. 2.2 mAbs preparation and sequencing Virus CK/SD008 was proliferated in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs, inactivated with β-propiolactone, and purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Three 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized with intraperitoneal and subcutaneous injections of purified protein from CK/SD008 emulsified with Freund's adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich). Splenocytes were then fused with SP2/0-AG14 myeloma cells at a ratio of 10:1 with polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Sigma-Aldrich) according to standard procedures. The fused cells were screened in complete medium containing hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) (Sigma-Aldrich). Positive hybridoma cell lines were detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI). After three subcloning runs, the optimal single-cell mass was obtained. Total RNA was extracted from hybridoma cells, and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo (dT) primers. The major variable (V) and partial constant (C) regions of the heavy and light chains were amplified by multiple PCR runs and sequenced using a DNA analyzer (3500XL Genetic Analyzer; Applied Biosystems). The C-region gene fragment with the highest homology was screened against GenBank using Igblast (2023), and primers were designed to amplify the C region using PCR. Polyadenine deoxynucleotides were added to the 3′ end of the cDNA by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (Thermo Scientific), and the 5′ end of the cDNA was amplified using connector primers and gene-specific primers (5′ RACE), and then the 3′ end of the cDNA was amplified using the 3′ end of the rapid amplification technology (3′ RACE). Finally, the complete DNA sequences of the heavy and light chains of the mAbs were obtained. 2.3 Expression and purification of the recombinant mAbs DNA fragments of the heavy and light chains were cloned into the pCHO-1.0 expression vector and transfected into CHO-S cells via electroporation. The transfected cells were screened in medium containing 10 or 20 μg/mL puromycin (Gibco) for 7 days. Next, methotrexate (100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1,000 nM; Sigma-Aldrich) was used for pressure screening, and the cells were treated with the drug at each of the above concentrations for 7 days. The medium was changed every 3 days during screening. Positive cells were inoculated into medium at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/mL and incubated for 10 days. The glucose concentration was maintained at 5 g/L. Then, the culture supernatant was collected, and the antibody was purified using the AKTA Prime Plus System (GE Healthcare) and a HiTrap Protein G HP antibody purification column (Cytiva). 2.4 Hemagglutination inhibition assays Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays were performed according to the WOAH Manual (WOAH, 2023). Briefly, 25 μL of each sample was serially (two-fold) diluted with PBS (pH 7.4) in a V-bottom 96-well microtiter plate. Then, antigen (25 μL of 4 HA units of CK/SD008) was added to the plates and incubated at room temperature. After 30 min, 25 μL of 1% chicken red blood cell (RBC) was added to all wells and incubated at room temperature for 40 min. The reciprocal of the highest dilution of the antibody was defined as the HI titer. 2.5 Western blotting The purified CK/SD008 proteins were treated with RIPA lysate buffer (YEASEN), mixed with 4 × Protein Native PAGE Loading Buffer, separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (ExpressPlusTM PAGE Gels; GenScript), and then transferred to nitrocellulose (NC) membranes using an eBlot™ L1 (GenScript). The NC membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk at 37°C for 1 h and then incubated with purified mAb that was either expressed in CHO cells or obtained from ascites at 4°C overnight. Then, the membranes were incubated with IRDye® 800CW Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (Li-Cor BioSciences) at room temperature for 1 h, scanned, and analyzed with an Odyssey CLX infrared imaging system (Li-Cor BioSciences). 2.6 Confocal microscopy HEK-293T cells seeded in glass-bottom dishes were transfected with PCAGGS-CK/SD008-HA-flag plasmid (1.5 μg) or the PCAGGS empty vector as a mock/control. At 36 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% fixative solution (Solarbio) at 4°C overnight, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. The permeabilized cells were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h, and then incubated with antibodies (1 μg/mL) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes, the cells were incubated with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Beyotime) for 15 min to stain the nuclei. Images were captured using a LSM880 confocal microscope (Zeiss). 2.7 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay The recombinant mAbs were labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) using sodium periodate. Then, each well of the 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner) were coated overnight at 4°C with 100 μL of coating buffer (0.05 M carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) containing purified CK/SD008 proteins as inactivated whole virus particles at a concentration of 5 μg/mL. After blocking, the coated plates were incubated with serial, two-fold dilutions (1:100 to 1:6400) of HRP-labeled Re-mAbs (the initial concentration was 1 mg/mL) at 37°C for 1 h. After washing three times, 100 μL of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Abcam) substrate was added to each well, and the plate was incubated in the dark at 37°C for 10 min. Then, the reaction was terminated with 0.25% HF. The biological activity of the recombinant antibodies was determined at a wavelength of 655 nm. 2.8 Surface plasmon resonance The SPR analysis was conducted on the Biacore 8 K platform (GE Healthcare, Life Science, Milan, Italy) using a Sensor Chip NTA (Cytiva). The HA proteins of CK/SD008 were obtained from the Expi293 Expression System, purified using Ni-NTA, and captured on different channels of an NTA chip using the NTA Reagent Kit (Cytiva) at a density of approximately 300 relative units (RU). CHO-produced recombinant antibodies or mAbs from ascites at 0.03125, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 μM were flowed through the channels in six cycles, and the association kinetics were assessed over 180 s at a flow rate of 30 μL/min. Dissociation kinetics were then measured with running buffer at a flow rate of 30 μL/min for a duration of 600 s. The same protocol was used for each binding cycle. The KD of all antibodies with CK/SD008-HA protein was calculated using the Biacore Insight Evaluation Software v3.0.12. 3 Results 3.1 Generation and characterization of mAbs against CK/SD008-HA Six hybridoma cell lines (1H9, 2B3, 4F2, 1G4, 1H3, and 4G4) that stably secrete mAbs against CK/SD008-HA protein were screened by ELISA using plates coated with the immunizing antigen and HI assays. Mouse ascites was obtained by injecting hybridomas into paraffin-treated BALB/c mice. Hybridoma supernatants and ascites were collected from the mice for further characterization. The ELISA titers of the six obtained mAbs hybridoma supernatants ranged from 1:102 to 1:103, and the titers of mAbs from ascites were 1:104 to 1:108 (Table 1). The HI titers of the six mAbs from the hybridoma supernatants were 1:22-1:23 and the HI titers from ascites were 1:25-1:211 (Table 1). Isotype identification revealed that all six mAbs had kappa light chains, whereas the heavy chains of 1H9/2B3 and 4F2/1G4/1H3/4G4 belonged to subclasses IgG2a and IgG1, respectively (Table 1). Both the HI titer and ELISA titer of the 1H9 and 2B3 antibodies are higher than those of the other four antibodies. Therefore, these two antibodies were selected for subsequent experiments. Table 1 Table 1. Characterization of mAbs against CK/SD008-HA. 3.2 Molecular characteristics of the mAbs Two hybridoma cell lines (1H9 and 2B3) were selected for antibody gene sequencing, and the main variable region and partial constant region of the heavy and light chains were amplified using several PCRs. After comparison using Igblast (2023), the V, D, J, and C regions of the 1H9 and 2B3 heavy chains were determined by the germline genes IGHV3-2*02/IGHD1-1*01/IGHJ3*01/IGHG2A*01_BALB/c and IGHV3-2*02/IGHD2-3*01/IGHJ1*01/IGHG2A*01_BALB/c, respectively, and the light chain V, J, and C regions of the 1H9 and 2B3 antibodies were determined by the germline genes IGKV15-103*01/IGKJ2*01/IGKC*01_musculus (Table 2). The sequencing alignment results are shown in Table 2. Primers were designed based on the germline genes to amplify the constant regions of the light and heavy chains using PCR. Finally, 5′ RACE and 3′ RACE were used to obtain the end fragments of the antibody heavy and light chain cDNAs, and then the complete gene fragments of 1H9H, 1H9L, 2B3H, and 2B3L were amplified. Table 2 Table 2. Genetic analysis of mAbs against CK/SD008-HA. 3.3 Expression and purification of the recombinant antibodies The heavy chain and light chain genes of 1H9 and 2B3 were cloned into the pCHO-1.0 expression vector to construct pCHO-1.0-1H9H-1H9L and pCHO-1.0-2B3H-2B3L, respectively. These two plasmids were electrotransfected into CHO-S cells, and cell lines stably expressing 1H9 and 2B3 antibodies were screened using puromycin and methotrexate. The two cell lines were seeded into 96-well plates. Six cell lines expressing the monoclonal 1H9 antibody (R1H9-1C3, R1H9-2C5, R1H9-5A1, R1H9-5D1, R1H9-6A7, and R1H9-6A9) and five cell lines expressing the monoclonal 2B3 antibody (R2B3-1A5, R2B3-1B3, R2B3-2D1, R2B3-3G7, and R2B3-5B3) were screened using ELISA. Cell suspension culture was performed, and the proteins in the culture supernatant were purified using ProteinG affinity chromatography to obtain the recombinant antibodies. SDS-PAGE and native PAGE showed that the antibodies were effectively purified from the supernatants (Figures 2A–D). These results demonstrated that the recombinant antibody was highly expressed in the cell culture supernatant. Figure 2 Figure 2. Expression and purification of recombinant antibodies. SDS-PAGE assay with recombinant antibodies R1H9 (A) and R2B3 (B) to determine their molecular weight. Native-PAGE assay with R1H9 (C) and R2B3 (D) to determine their molecular weight. 3.4 R1H9 and R2B3 can be used in HI assays and for WB analysis To evaluate the activity of the recombinant mAbs, purified R1H9 (R1H9-1C3, R1H9-2C5, R1H9-5A1, R1H9-5D1, R1H9-6A7, and R1H9-6A9) and R2B3 (R2B3-1A5, R2B3-1B3, R2B3-2D1, R2B3-3G7, and R2B3-5B3) antibodies were diluted to 0.5 mg/mL for analysis. The HI test results showed that the HI titers of the R1H9 recombinant antibody and the 1H9 antibody obtained from the ascites of BALB/c mice reached 27 (Figure 3A). The six recombinant R2B3 antibodies were also tested using the same procedure. The results showed that the HI titers of the recombinant R2B3 and 2B3 antibodies also reached 27 (Figure 3B). These results showed that there was no significant difference in the HI activity between the recombinant R1H9 and R2B3 antibodies and the respective parent antibodies 1H9 and 2B3. As these antibodies target conformational epitopes of the HA protein, non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (native-PAGE) was used to separate the CK/SD008 influenza virus lysates. The results showed that the six R1H9 antibodies and five R2B3 antibodies could react with non-denatured CK/SD008-HA, and their binding was similar to that of the 1H9 and 2B3 antibodies (Figures 3C, D). These results confirmed that the recombinant antibody could replace the parent antibody in HI and WB assays. Figure 3 Figure 3. Comparing recombinant and parental antibodies in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays and western blot (WB) analysis. The initial concentration of 1H9 and R1H9 (A) and 2B3 and R2B3 (B) was 0.5 mg/mL. WB to determine the binding of each monoclonal antibody (mAb) to HA protein. Virus lysates were subjected to WB analysis with R1H9 (C) and R2B3 (D), respectively. 3.5 Application of R1H9 and R2B3 in confocal microscopy The ability of recombinant mAbs R1H9 and R2B3 to bind to CK/SD008-HA was also assessed by confocal microscopy. HEK-293T cells were transfected with a pCAGGS-CK/SD008-HA-flag plasmid or an empty pCAGGS plasmid as a mock/control. After transfection, the cells were subjected to confocal microscopy using the R1H9, 1H9, R2B3, and 2B3 antibodies. As shown in Figures 4A, B, the R1H9 (R1H9-1C3, R1H9-2C5, R1H9-5A1, R1H9-5D1, R1H9-6A7, and R1H9-6A9) and R2B3 (R2B3-1A5, R2B3-1B3, R2B3-2D1, R2B3-3G7, and R2B3-5B3) recombinant antibodies were able to stain CK/SD008-HA, and the staining effect was similar to that of the parent 1H9 and 2B3 mAbs obtained from ascites, on the premise of ensuring the successful expression of HA protein in HEK-293T cells. These results showed that the recombinant antibodies R1H9 and R2B3 could be used in confocal microscopy instead of the parental antibodies. Figure 4 Figure 4. Application of mAbs R1H9 and R2B3 in confocal microscopy. HEK-293T cells were transfected with an HA-expressing plasmid (pCAGGS-SD008HA-flag) or an empty pCAGGS plasmid as a mock/control. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were subjected to confocal microscopy with either R1H9 (A) or R2B3 (B) as the primary antibody. 3.6 Application of the recombinant antibodies for ELISA The activity of the recombinant antibodies R1H9-1C3 and R2B3-1A5 was assessed using ELISA. R1H9-1C3 and R2B3-1A5 were labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) using NaIO4 oxidation. Then, the R1H9-HRP and R2B3-HRP antibodies were two-fold serially diluted (1:100–1:6400) and tested using direct ELISA. The results showed that when HRP-R1H9-1C3 and HRP-R2B3-1A5 were diluted to 1:800 and 1:1600, respectively, the OD655 nm was >1.0, indicating that the recombinant antibody reacted well in the ELISA (Figures 5A, B). These results confirmed that antibodies R1H9 and R2B3 could be used for ELISA. Figure 5 Figure 5. Application of the recombinant antibodies R1H9 and R2B3 in an ELISA to determine their usefulness as enzyme-labeled antibodies. The OD655 of HA with different dilutions of enzyme-labeled HRP-R1H9-1C3 (A) and HRP-R2B3-1A5 (B) antibodies. The initial concentration was 1 mg/mL. 3.7 SPR binding analysis of R1H9 and R2B3 The KD values for the binding of 1H9, R1H9-1C3, R1H9-2C5, R1H9-5A1, R1H9-5D1, R1H9-6A7, and R1H9-6A9 to SD008 HA were 12.1, 9.52, 14.0, 13.0, 13.1, 17.3, and 9.17 nM (Figure 6A), respectively, showing that all these mAbs had similar affinities for their target antigens. The KD values for the binding of 2B3, R2B3-1A5, R2B3-1B3, R2B3-2D1, R2B3-3G7, and R2B3-5B3 to HA were 9.84, 8.45, 8.21, 8.45, 7.74, and 9.31 nM, respectively, indicating similar affinities for their antigen (Figure 6B). These results showed that both R1H9 and R2B3 had high affinities for HA, and there was no significant difference between these recombinant antibodies and the corresponding parental antibodies purified from ascites. Figure 6 Figure 6. KD values for binding of the mAbs to HA were determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). HA was captured in different channels, and 1H9 or R1H9 (A) and 2B3 or R2B3 (B) were flowed through the channels in six cycles at 31.25 (brown), 62.5 (yellow), 125 (red), 250 (green), and 500 nM (blue). 4 Discussion H7 viruses have caused numerous outbreaks in poultry (Shi et al., 2018), resulting in significant economic losses and public health concerns in recent decades. Effective serological testing in poultry can identify immune individuals and determine whether they have a history of mild or asymptomatic infections, which is crucial for the control and research of H7 AIV (He et al., 2013). Successful serological diagnostic tests depend on high-quality antibodies (Lobert et al., 2013; O'Hurley et al., 2014; Eisinger et al., 2015; Weller, 2016; Andersson et al., 2017). Since its discovery by Kohler and Milstein (1975), hybridoma technology has become a widely used method for producing monoclonal antibodies. However, a significant drawback of hybridoma-derived antibodies is that genetic drift can lead to variability between batches. In the worst-case scenario, the antibody genes may be completely lost, halting antibody production altogether (Bradbury and Pluckthun, 2015; Bradbury et al., 2018; Parray et al., 2020). Additionally, hybridoma cells can sometimes harbor two or more antibody-encoding genes, resulting in the production of a mixture of mAbs with varying affinities for the target antigen (Duan and Pomerantz, 1994; Ding et al., 2010; Bradbury et al., 2018). Recombinant antibodies offer significant advantages over conventional antibodies, including high specificity, sensitivity, and stability (Kennedy et al., 2018). Additionally, they can be easily optimized through genetic and chemical modifications (Orlandi et al., 1989; Ward et al., 1989; Kunert and Reinhart, 2016). Furthermore, the production of recombinant antibodies typically requires fewer animals, which enhances animal welfare (Sastry et al., 1989; Dumont et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016; Laustsen et al., 2021). In this study, six murine mAbs were generated against the HA protein of CK/SD008, and their reactivity with H7 subtype AIV was verified by HI and ELISA. The two strains of monoclonal antibodies (1H9 and 2B3) with the highest HI titers were selected and sequenced. Sequence alignment showed that the V, D, J, and C regions of the 1H9 and 2B3 heavy chains were determined by the germline genes IGHV3-2*02/IGHD1-1*01/IGHJ3*01/IGHG2A*01_BALB/c and IGHV3-2*02/IGHD23*01/IGHJ1*01/IGHG2A*01_BALB/c, respectively, and the light chain V, J, and C regions of the 1H9 and 2B3 antibodies were determined by the germline genes IGKV15103*01/IGKJ2*01/IGKC*01_musculus. The heavy chain and light chain of 1H9 and 2B3 were cloned into the pCHO-1.0 expression vector and transfected into CHO-S cells, and cell lines that stably expressed these antibodies were established. After cell suspension culture, the recombinant expressed antibody, with a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa, was successfully obtained under native-PAGE conditions. To evaluate the activity of the recombinant antibodies in serological applications, they were tested in HI assays, western blotting, confocal microscopy, and ELISA. The results showed that the activity of the recombinant antibody was similar to that of the parent antibody. Furthermore, kinetic analysis of the two antibodies against the HA protein of the AIV in the SPR assay showed concordance. The data showed that recombinant mAbs produced using this protocol could replace mAbs obtained from ascites. As recombinant antibody technologies continue to improve, they will likely become the primary method for producing mAbs, and thus recombinant antibodies will play an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of H7 influenza.

It's nothing to be concerned about or to alarm Tulsa County," said Bailey.Bailey says the reason behind the summer COVID-19 is because kids are out of school."We're seeing increased travel times. We're around people that we normally don't socialize with on a daily basis, which means that we are exposed in a different number and a different variant or in a different season than winter," said Bailey.SEE ALSO:Oklahoma Highway Patrol investigates rock-throwing incidents on TurnpikeWhen kids go back to school, and get back into routines, Bailey says behaviors change, people aren’t socializing and traveling as much, and we will see a decrease in cases.Douglas Drevets with OU Health and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences says we may see another peak in COVID-19 cases in the next two or three weeks."When a lot of people are together such as in classrooms you have a lot of opportunity for viral spread," saidDouglas Drevets, Chief of Infectious Diseases at OU Health and at University of Oklahoma Health Sciences.According to the Oklahoma State Department of Health’s website, Oklahoma’s COVID-19 Sentinel Laboratory Testing Percent Positivity is at 23.5%.In Tulsa County, it’s at 30.5%."We want to make sure Tulsa County residents are safe and healthy, and it's the same prevention methods for all respiratory guidance, for all respiratory viruses, COVID, flu, RSV," said Bailey. "Practicing hand hygiene, making sure you're washing your hands appropriately, respiratory etiquette, and then staying home when you're sick."Drevets says to stay updated with your vaccines and try to be healthy.He says if you are sick, get yourself tested or just take precautions so that you don't infect somebody else.SIGN UP FOR THE CHANNEL 8 NEWSLETTERStay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...Bird Flu Is Infecting Pet Cats. Here’s What You Need to Know | Scientific American Skip to main contentScientific AmericanAugust 19, 20246 min readBird Flu Is Infecting Pet Cats. Here’s What You Need to KnowAs bird flu spreads in cats, cows and other animals, it has more opportunity to adapt to easily infect humansBy Meghan Bartels owngarden/Getty ImagesFor two and a half years, a deadly strain of avian influenza often referred to as H5N1 has been ravaging poultry farms. More than 100 million birds have been killed in the U.S., either by the disease or attempts to halt its spread. Wild birds have also been dying in enormous numbers. In late March scientists confirmed that H5N1 was sickening cows on U.S. dairy farms; nearly 200 herds in 13 states were affected as of August 15. Confirmed cases in people have been much scarcer: only 13 human cases were reported from April to August 9, and they have mostly involved mild illness, particularly characterized by pink eye. It is likely that infections in people have been missed, however.Now the virus is being found in indoor pet cats. The Colorado Department of Public Health announced on August 9 that six cat infections in the state have been confirmed this year. Two of those detections were in samples collected in May, but at least three were in samples collected in July. What’s particularly worrying about the new announcement is that two of the infected cats were indoor animals. Scientists say this is a sign that the virus is widespread in animals and inching closer to touching the average American’s daily life.“This identification of H5N1 in indoor-only cats is a big concern,” says Meghan Davis, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Increasing our surveillance and trying to understand the scope of this and get better messaging out is something I think we should be doing right now.”On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

But some of the felines lived on dairy farms, plausibly roaming among infected cows and drinking milk chock-full of the virus. Outdoor cats can also get infected from birds or small animals they prey on.For the new cases, there aren’t many details available, and it’s possible that even the indoor cats did spend time outdoors or that they consumed raw milk or meat from infected animals. But if not, the possibilities are concerning: these cats might have caught the virus from an infected mouse inside the home or perhaps even picked it up from a human with an unknown, asymptomatic infection from contact with other animals. Either of these scenarios suggests that bird flu is even more entrenched than we realized.In Colorado the disease appears particularly pervasive: more than eight million commercial chickens to date have died because of the outbreak, more than 60 dairy herds have confirmed cases of avian influenza, and 10 human infections have also been confirmed. But epidemiologists say that doesn’t necessarily mean Colorado is more of a hotspot for the virus than other states. “They have really been taking it seriously, and I think they are highlighting to everyone else how much we may be missing,” says Seema Lakdawala, a molecular virologist at Emory University. “It’s not like, oh, everyone’s looking, and we’re only finding it here. It’s like, when you look, you find it.”That means scientists are concerned about what they’re seeing in Colorado but also in what they’re not seeing across the nation. Bird flu is “probably more widespread than we appreciate, and it’s not just in these areas where there are concentrations of livestock or reports [of positive cases],” says Michelle Barron, an epidemiologist at the University of Colorado Denver and UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital.*If the first concern is the sheer quantity of avian influenza virus in the environment, the second is the number and variety of animals it is continuing to infect unchecked. Each new infection represents an opportunity for the dairy strain of the avian influenza virus to meet and mingle with whatever other flu viruses are present in the new host. Flu “viruses are notorious for developing mutations or taking genes from other viruses,” Barron says. “At what point is there risk that the virus changes and now makes people severely ill?”Davis notes that pets are a particularly difficult population for epidemiologists to track because there are no state or federal regulatory agencies tasked with monitoring their health, as there are for humans and livestock, and because veterinary care can be an expense some owners can’t afford.Pet owners who are concerned about bird flu should be aware of potential routes of exposure for their animals, Davis says. Don’t feed them raw milk or raw foods, whether commercially purchased or prepared at home. (Humans should also take raw milk, eggs and meat off their own menus. Pasteurization has been shown to kill the virus in milk, and cooking food kills most pathogens.) Cats with access to the outdoors are at risk, particularly during unsupervised time when they could be hunting infected animals. Domestic dogs have not yet been reported with avian influenza, but Davis warns that those who might interact with waterbirds may be at a higher risk of exposure to H5N1. Watch for changes in behavior that indicate a pet might be sick, especially a loss of appetite or trouble breathing, and consult your veterinarian if you’re concerned. In addition, people with pet ferrets should be particularly cautious because these animals are highly susceptible to influenza viruses and can develop serious infections.Experts say the U.S. government and society at large need to start taking avian influenza seriously. “I think we are at an inflection point right now in the outbreak,” Lakdawala says. She wants to see a federal push for coordination among state agencies to increase surveillance and tamp down transmission between animals and into humans—efforts that, to date, have been primarily the responsibility of individual states.Barron particularly worries that people’s emotional baggage from the COVID pandemic is stopping them from mounting a strong response to avian influenza. “I want people to understand that testing is good, having knowledge is good,” she says. She’s concerned that the trauma and politicization of the pandemic are fresh in people’s mind and that a desire to avoid repeating the experience may prevent people from facing the threat of avian influenza.Right now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is emphasizing that for most people—excepting those who have direct contact with infected animals—avian influenza currently poses a very small threat. But the more the virus rages unchecked, the more likely that is to change. If bird flu was becoming more dangerous, one major signal would be a spate of human infections that were not connected with sick animals. That would indicate that the virus could jump directly between people. “I think that we’re only a short time away from actually seeing that, given how much virus there is in nature right now,” Lakdawala says.And regular flu season is only a few months away, adding to the risks at play. There’s no evidence that annual vaccines for seasonal flu viruses can protect against bird flu, she notes. And if someone is simultaneously infected with both bird flu and seasonal flu, the worst parts of each virus could combine into a nightmare pathogen. “The worst-case scenario would be something that would be highly transmissible and severe in humans as well as in animals,” Davis says. The CDC has launched an effort to vaccinate farm workers with the seasonal flu shot to reduce the likelihood of this happening, but vaccines tailored to avian influenza have not yet been approved for distribution.Even factoring in monitoring shortfalls, all three scientists emphasized that the dire scenarios they specialize in worrying about are not yet inevitable. “We have an opportunity now to work hard upfront so that we do not have a situation where we have to again be shutting down [society],” Lakdawala says. “Nobody wants an H5 pandemic. Nobody.”*Editor’s Note (8/19/24): This sentence was edited after posting to clarify Michelle Barron’s position at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital.Rights & PermissionsMeghan Bartels is a science journalist based in New York City.

FAO has, with a consultative process, revised the Global strategy for the prevention and control of highly pathogenic avian influenza in collaboration with The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) through the Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary (GF-TADs). The HPAI Global Strategy provides a high-level strategic direction to support and inform the development and/or revision of national and regional action plans for HPAI prevention and control. The strategy emphasizes poultry as the sector where animal health interventions can have the most impact, as part of a wider One Health approach to HPAI. The new Global HPAI Strategy builds on the lessons learned in addressing HPAI and calls for substantive shifts to protect human health and secure regional and global markets and trade in poultry and poultry products, while at the same time, protecting an important element of the livelihoods of poor farming communities. This is achieved through renewed efforts to reduce the incidence of HPAI, rapidly respond to and control outbreaks when they occur, and to transform high risk poultry production systems to improve their biosecurity and resilience. At the Second Session of the FAO Committee on Agriculture (COAG), Sub-Committee on Livestock, HPAI took center stage, as FAO’s Senior Animal Health Officer, Madhur Dhingra, the lead of the animal health, prevention, preparedness and rapid response cluster and the Head of Emergency Prevention System for Animal Health (EMPRES-AH) spoke of the alarming global spread of HPAI in recent years and the further evolution of avian influenza viruses, highlighting the need for increased engagement within Member Countries to confront this serious threat. Over the past two years, more than 200 million poultry and other domestic birds, and nearly 500,000 mammals (wild, farmed, or captive) are reported to have been impacted by the virus. This includes fur animals, such as minks, and livestock, including goats, llamas, and cattle. Additionally, the recent outbreaks of H5N1 in dairy cattle in the United States of America have highlighted the diverse impacts these viruses can have, with affected cattle experiencing decreased milk production, fever, reduced feed intake, and changes in milk appearance. More so, these events have highlighted the constant risk of spillover to humans, as farm workers from poultry farms and dairies have been affected by the virus. FAO has worked to enhance surveillance and information sharing efforts through a multitude of actions. Tools and platforms like the freely available Event Mobile Application (EMA-i), facilitate high-quality, real-time collection and reporting of animal disease and health-related threats from smartphones even in remote areas. FAO, through its Emergency Centres for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) has supported capacity development in diagnostic testing, risk-based surveillance, outbreak investigation and response, and development of technical guidance and other tools for risk reduction, surveillance, and outbreak response in 49 Low- or Middle-Income Country countries. Further on, the FAO’s Global Animal Disease Information System (EMPRES-i+) supports veterinary services by facilitating regional and global disease information sharing, periodic risk assessments, and publishing of surveillance guidelines. Additionally, EMPRES-i+ enhances risk forecasting to better anticipate and mitigate potential disease outbreaks. FAO promotes risk mitigation through the Progressive Management Pathway for Terrestrial Animal Biosecurity (FAO-PMP-TAB), a collaborative, stepwise approach that assists countries, industries, and producers to assess and manage biological risks at enterprise, community, and national levels. On the capacity development front, FAO’s Virtual Learning Centers (VLC) have trained over 3,100 individuals in avian influenza courses across English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish since March 2022. FAO also works with partners through multistakeholder collaborations and partnerships with animal, human, and wildlife health agencies. For example, FAO collaborates with the WOAH and the World Health Organization (WHO) through the Tripartite Global Early Warning System (GLEWS+) platform, which enhances disease intelligence and early warning using a One Health approach. Additionally, FAO partners with the global network of expertise on animal influenza (OFFLU), and the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) to strengthen surveillance and response efforts. These collective efforts ensure that FAO's work not only prevents disease spread and enhances production but also protects human health, livelihoods, and food security.

Photo by Adobe Stock/HealthDay News A universal flu vaccine that would protect against all influenza strains -- and that people might not need to take every year -- could be close at hand, researchers report. An experimental vaccine candidate produced a strong immune response in lab mice, and it provided protection against severe infection after the critters were exposed to the virus, researchers reported Thursday in the Journal of Virology. Advertisement The candidate flu vaccine combines eight proteins from five different types of influenza virus, in hopes of providing immune protection against any type of flu that might strike the United States, researchers said. However, more investigation needs to be done, since animal-based trials don't always pan out in humans. Using data from previous studies, researchers concluded that these eight proteins together could provide a sustained and universal immune response against the flu, said lead researcher Naoko Uno, a virologist and postdoctoral fellow with the Cleveland Clinic. Related HHS launches awareness campaign on viruses, vaccines What is mpox? The infectious virus that is cousin to smallpox CDC: Childhood vaccines have saved 1 million U.S. lives since 1994 "We've been able to whittle down this list, to say these are the best at spanning multiple seasons and eliciting a broadly reactive antibody response," Uno said of the eight proteins. "It's like creating a greatest hits album. We want to put only the best ones back in the vaccine." Advertisement Researchers believe the vaccine also might be able to last longer than a single season, potentially ending the annual ritual of flu jabs. "We want to make sure our vaccine can span multiple seasons, not just one, and protect against all the strains that affect humans," Uno said in a journal news release. Seasonal flu vaccines include proteins from three or four flu strains, which are chosen by looking at which strains are circulating on the other side of the world during their influenza season. But it's a guessing game, because the flu virus mutates so quickly. An unanticipated flu strain could burst into the United States without warning, or a chosen protein might produce an inadequate immune response because the virus has changed subtly but significantly. To craft a potential universal flu vaccine, researchers downloaded thousands of genetic sequences of flu strains spanning multiple seasons. They then analyzed those sequences to identify which proteins were common across all flu strains. The resulting vaccine includes proteins from H1, H2, H3, H5 and H7 types of influenza virus, researchers said. H1 and H3 commonly circulate among humans, while the other types occur in animals but have pandemic potential if they leap into humans, researchers said. Advertisement For example, the H5N1 bird flu has been spreading rapidly through poultry and livestock in the United States, raising concerns that the flu could jump into people. Researchers hope to launch human clinical trials for the universal vaccine within one to three years, Uno said.

The EDCC is an independent nonprofit organization that is supported by industry donations in order to provide open access to infectious disease information. About Equine Influenza Equine influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease that infects horses, ponies, and other equids, such as donkeys, mules, and zebras. The virus that causes it is spread via saliva and respiratory secretions from infected horses. Horses are commonly exposed via horse-to-horse contact; aerosol transmission from coughing and sneezing; and contact with humans’ contaminated hands, shoes, or clothes or contaminated tack, buckets, or other equipment. Clinical signs of equine influenza infection can include a high fever (up to 106°F); a dry, hacking cough; depression; weakness; anorexia; serous (watery) nasal discharge; and slightly enlarged lymph nodes. Consider monitoring your horse’s health at shows by taking his temperature daily, which can help you pick up on signs of infection early and take appropriate measures to reduce disease spread. ​Vaccination is an important and inexpensive way to protect your horse. US Equestrian requires proof that horses have had an equine influenza vaccination within the six months prior to attending organization-sanctioned competitions or events. Your veterinarian can help you determine what other vaccines your horse might benefit from. In addition to vaccinating, following strict biosecurity protocols can help reduce your horse’s chance of infection and disease. Such measures include quarantining new equine arrivals at barns, disinfecting buckets and equipment, and preventing nose-to-nose contact between horses.

Photo by Adobe Stock/HealthDay News A universal flu vaccine that would protect against all influenza strains -- and that people might not need to take every year -- could be close at hand, researchers report. An experimental vaccine candidate produced a strong immune response in lab mice, and it provided protection against severe infection after the critters were exposed to the virus, researchers reported Thursday in the Journal of Virology. Advertisement The candidate flu vaccine combines eight proteins from five different types of influenza virus, in hopes of providing immune protection against any type of flu that might strike the United States, researchers said. However, more investigation needs to be done, since animal-based trials don't always pan out in humans. Using data from previous studies, researchers concluded that these eight proteins together could provide a sustained and universal immune response against the flu, said lead researcher Naoko Uno, a virologist and postdoctoral fellow with the Cleveland Clinic. Related HHS launches awareness campaign on viruses, vaccines What is mpox? The infectious virus that is cousin to smallpox CDC: Childhood vaccines have saved 1 million U.S. lives since 1994 "We've been able to whittle down this list, to say these are the best at spanning multiple seasons and eliciting a broadly reactive antibody response," Uno said of the eight proteins. "It's like creating a greatest hits album. We want to put only the best ones back in the vaccine." Advertisement Researchers believe the vaccine also might be able to last longer than a single season, potentially ending the annual ritual of flu jabs. "We want to make sure our vaccine can span multiple seasons, not just one, and protect against all the strains that affect humans," Uno said in a journal news release. Seasonal flu vaccines include proteins from three or four flu strains, which are chosen by looking at which strains are circulating on the other side of the world during their influenza season. But it's a guessing game, because the flu virus mutates so quickly. An unanticipated flu strain could burst into the United States without warning, or a chosen protein might produce an inadequate immune response because the virus has changed subtly but significantly. To craft a potential universal flu vaccine, researchers downloaded thousands of genetic sequences of flu strains spanning multiple seasons. They then analyzed those sequences to identify which proteins were common across all flu strains. The resulting vaccine includes proteins from H1, H2, H3, H5 and H7 types of influenza virus, researchers said. H1 and H3 commonly circulate among humans, while the other types occur in animals but have pandemic potential if they leap into humans, researchers said. Advertisement For example, the H5N1 bird flu has been spreading rapidly through poultry and livestock in the United States, raising concerns that the flu could jump into people. Researchers hope to launch human clinical trials for the universal vaccine within one to three years, Uno said.

The continuous circulation of these viruses has led to their considerable genetic and antigenic evolution, resulting in the formation of eight subclades (2.3.4.4a–h). Here, we examined the antigenic sites that determine the antigenic differences between two H5 vaccine strains, H5-Re8 (clade 2.3.4.4g) and H5-Re11 (clade 2.3.4.4h). Epitope mapping data revealed that all eight identified antigenic sites were located within two classical antigenic regions, with five sites in region A (positions 115, 120, 124, 126, and 140) and three in region B (positions 151, 156, and 185). Through antigenic cartography analysis of mutants with varying numbers of substitutions, we confirmed that a combination of mutations in these eight sites reverses the antigenicity of H5-Re11 to that of H5-Re8, and vice versa. More importantly, our analyses identified H5-Re11_Q115L/R120S/A156T (H5-Re11 + 3) as a promising candidate for a broad-spectrum vaccine, positioned centrally in the antigenic map, and offering potential universal protection against all variants within the clade 2.3.4.4. H5-Re11 + 3 serum has better cross-reactivity than sera generated with other 2.3.4.4 vaccines, and H5-Re11 + 3 vaccine provided 100% protection of chickens against antigenically drifted H5 viruses from various 2.3.4.4 antigenic groups. Our findings suggest that antigenic regions A and B are immunodominant in H5 viruses, and that antigenic cartography-guided vaccine design is a promising strategy for selecting a broad-spectrum vaccine.

To date, 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and 9 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes have been found in aquatic birds1,2, and two HA and two NA subtypes have been identified in bats3,4. In their reservoir species, most influenza virus subtypes are low pathogenic, although two subtypes (H5 and H7) have evolved into highly pathogenic strains5. The H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs), with a mortality rate close to 100% in chicken and turkey, have caused substantial economic losses to the global poultry industry. According to the OIE-World Animal Health Information System (OIE-WAHS, https://wahis.woah.org), the H5 HPAIVs have led to the loss of 389 million poultry6. In addition to this damage to poultry, the H5 virus also exhibits pandemic potential. As of January 5, 2024, the H5 AIVs have caused 969 human infections, including 495 deaths7. It is therefore imperative to develop strategies to control and prevent H5 subtype virus infections.The antigenic drift and shift of influenza viruses necessitates frequent updates of vaccine strains, underscoring the need for broadly protective influenza vaccines. To expand the protection breadth of current vaccines, various strategies have been developed8. One such strategy is to combine multiple HA antigens. For example, a combination of three H1 HA immunogens improved the breadth of immunity against divergent H1 human influenza viruses9, demonstrating the efficacy of multi-antigen strategies to achieve comprehensive immunity. Another innovative approach, to developing an H3 vaccine, incorporated scrambled immunodominant epitopes, and was proven effective in expanding coverage in ferret models. This was achieved by reducing the immunodominance of HA head epitopes, thereby enhancing the vaccine’s protective range10. Moreover, a multivalent mRNA vaccine-induced protection against all 20 known influenza A virus subtypes and influenza B virus lineages in animals11. Another approach to generate broader subtype-specific immune responses is through consensus sequences12,13,14,15,16,17. For example, Giles et al. reported a broadly reactive H5 antigen that was optimized by using a computational algorithm; the efficacy of this design to elicit broadly reactive antibodies was confirmed in animal models14. Although a range of creative and varied strategies have been employed, only a few will reach clinical trials, and the quest for a universal influenza vaccine remains a formidable challenge.Understanding the mechanism of antigenic change is key to developing a vaccine. The antigenicity of influenza A viruses is mainly determined by the HA protein, especially its head region18. In the last century, five major antigenic epitopes have been identified in the head domain of HA by using mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)19,20,21,22,23. The antigenicity of influenza viruses was found to be primarily determined by a few key amino acid substitutions around the receptor-binding site by characterizing antigenic variants with polyclonal antibodies24,25,26. In the head domain of HA, the amino acids at positions 129, 133, 151, 183, 185, and 189 (H5 numbering, used hereafter)26, located at epitope sites A and B27, were found to be the key determinants of the antigenicity of H5 viruses. Although mAbs can detect subtly differences between antigenic variants, polyclonal antisera, which correlate with host immune response, are used the most to evaluate the antigenic distance between virus isolates. Hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays are also used to evaluate antigenic characteristics; however, it is difficult to interpret raw HI and MN data. Accordingly, antigenic cartography was developed to analyze and visualize the relationships among multiple antigen–antibody reaction data pairs25,28,29. Benefiting from antigenic cartography, the WHO has used this tool to supplement influenza surveillance activities and guide vaccine strain selection30.HPAIVs of the H5 subtype have evolved into 10 different genetic clades (0–9) and many subclades. Notably, subclade 2.3.4.4 of the H5 viruses, first identified in poultry in 2013 and spread worldwide by migratory birds, has branched into eight subclades (2.3.4.4a to 2.3.4.4h)31,32. To control outbreaks of clade 2.3.4.4 H5 virus in 2015, China developed the first 2.3.4.4 H5N1 vaccine (designated as H5-Re8)33, belonging to 2.3.4.4g clade31. Introduced by migratory birds, the new clade 2.4.4.4h emerged among China’s poultry in 2018, presenting a considerable antigenic difference from the vaccine strain H5-Re8 and leading to the development of a new, antigenically matched vaccine designated H5-Re1134. In this study, we sought to identify the key amino acid substitution(s) that determine the antigenic difference between H5-Re8 and H5-Re11 by using antigenic cartography analysis. We identified eight antigenic sites that determine the antigenic difference between H5-Re8 and H5-Re11. In addition, we identified a promising vaccine seed strain bearing three mutations that seem to confer solid protection against all circulating clade 2.3.4.4 (a–h) viruses.ResultsMapping of antigenic sitesThe vaccine strain H5-Re8 contains surface genes from a clade 2.3.4.4g virus, A/chicken/Guizhou/4/13(H5N1) (GZ/4/13), and six internal genes from the high-growth A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8) virus. It differs antigenically from the H5-Re11 strain that harbors surface genes from a clade 2.3.4.4h virus, A/duck/Guizhou/S4184/2017(H5N6) (GZ/S4184/17), and internal genes from PR834. Sequence analysis indicates that there are 20 amino acid differences in HA1 between these two vaccines (Fig. 1).Fig. 1: Key amino acid alterations in the HA proteins of H5 viruses.a Alignment of HA1 protein sequences (H5 numbering). Antigenic regions A, B, C, D, and E are delineated and highlighted in orange, green, cyan, blue, and pink, respectively. Sites with amino acid variations are marked and highlighted in red. b The site exhibiting amino acid variation is depicted in the HA monomer of an H5 virus, retrieved from the PDB database (5HUF). Amino acid substitutions at antigenic sites are denoted in red, and the respective antigenic regions are marked with corresponding colors.Full size imageTo elucidate which amino acid substitution(s) determines this antigenic difference, we used reverse genetics to rescue 20 H5-Re11 mutants. Firstly, we evaluated the growth properties of the mutants and then analyzed their antigenicity by using a HI assay with H5-Re8 and H5-Re11 antisera. As shown in Table 1, none of the mutations had an adverse effect on the growth properties; all the mutants grew to relatively high titers (Table 1). To our surprise, none of the substitutions changed the antigenicity of the mutants in the HI assay, except mutant H5-Re11_−126D (−, an amino acid deletion at position 126), which showed higher titer with H5-Re8 antiserum, with an HI titer that was 2-fold higher than that of the other mutants (Table 1). To distinguish the subtle antigenic difference, a panel of 19 mAbs was generated and used to evaluate the antigenicity of the mutants. The 19 mAbs identified seven mutants that displayed considerable antigenic differences in the HI assay (i.e., at least a 4-fold difference), namely H5-Re11_Q115L, H5-Re11_R120S, H5-Re11_N124D, H5-Re11_V140M, H5-Re11_T151I, H5-Re11_A156T, and H5-Re11_E185A (Fig. 2). Thus, eight antigenic sites in H5 HA, 115, 120, 124, 126, 140, 151, 156, and 185, were identified.Table 1 Cross-reactive HI antibody titers of mutant viruses with different antiseraFull size tableFig. 2: Antigenic heat map of H5-Re11 mutants.The antigenicity of the H5-Re11 variants was determined by quantifying HI titers utilizing a panel of 19 mAbs generated in our laboratory. A 4-fold difference in antigenicity was deemed significant.Full size imageMolecular basis of the antigenic difference between H5-Re8 and H5-Re11We next investigated which combination of antigenic substitutions changed the antigenicity of H5-Re11 to that of H5-Re8 or vice versa. First, we categorized the eight antigenic positions into three groups: Group 1 containing positions 115, 120, and 156, which were the three positions that most changed the antigenicity of H5-Re11 (Fig. 2); Group 2 containing positions 140, 151, and 185, which changed the antigenicity of H5-Re11 to a lesser extent (Fig. 2); and Group 3 containing positions 124 and 126, which affected the antigenicity of H5-Re11 and resulted in the formation of a glycosylation site (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Then, three mutants, H5-Re11_Q115L/R120S/A156T (H5-Re11 + 3), H5-Re11_Q115L/R120S/V140M/T151I/A156T/E185A (H5-Re11 + 6), and H5-Re11_Q115L/R120S/N124D/-126D/V140M/T151I/A156T/E185A (H5-Re11 + 8) were rescued by gradually adding groups of mutations into the H5-Re11 vaccine strain. Their antigenicity was analyzed by using the HI assay with chicken sera generated with one clade 2.3.4.4b virus, one clade 2.3.4.4g virus, and two 2.3.4.4h viruses that were antigenically different. Antigenic cartography showed that the antigenicity of mutant H5-Re11 + 8 was closest to that of GZ/4/13 (donor virus of H5-Re8), whereas mutants H5-Re11 + 6 and H5-Re11 + 3 were still antigenically different from GZ/4/13 (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 1). To confirm that the antigenic transition was caused by the mutations, a H5-Re8 mutant with eight corresponding mutations, H5-Re8_L115Q/S120R/D124N/D126-/M140V/I151T/T156A/A185E (H5-Re8 + 8), was generated and its antigenicity was evaluated. As expected, the antigenicity of H5-Re8 + 8 was similar to that of both H5-Re11 and GZ/S4184/17 (donor virus of H5-Re11) (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 1). Compared with the HI assay, the MN assay is considered the gold standard for the analysis of the antigenic properties of the viruses. Thus, the antigenicity of the mutants was further confirmed by the MN assay (Supplementary Table 2). Although the antigenic map generated with the HI data differed from that generated with the MN data (Fig. 3b), the MN map confirmed that the antigenic transition between H5-Re11 and H5-Re8 was caused by substitutions at the eight antigenic sites.Fig. 3: Antigenic cartography of the indicated mutants and reference viruses.a Antigen map constructed using HI titer data. b Antigen map generated based on MN titers. Each square represents a 2-fold difference in either HI or MN titers. Viruses and serum samples are represented by circles and rectangles, respectively.Full size imageSelection of a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate based on antigenic distanceSince the implementation of the first clade 2.3.4.4g vaccine (H5-Re8) in 2015, three more vaccines, H5-Re11 (2.3.4.4h), H5-Re13 (2.3.4.4h), and H5-Re14 (2.3.4.4b), were generated to control clade 2.3.4.4 antigenic variants in China34,35,36. The frequent updating of vaccine strains highlights the need to develop a vaccine strain with broader protective efficacy. Our antigenic cartography analysis revealed that the mutant H5-Re11 + 3 was located in the relative center of the map, indicating its potential to serve as a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate against H5 viruses bearing the clade 2.3.4.4 HA gene. To evaluate the protective breath of H5-Re11 + 3, homologous serum of H5-Re11 + 3 was generated and applied for antigenic analysis with all eight subclades of 2.3.4.4 viruses (2.3.4.4a–h). In the HI assay, viruses in subclades 2.3.4.4a, 2.3.4.4c, and 2.3.4.4f reacted poorly with the H5-Re11 + 3 serum, with an HI titer of 16, whereas the HI titer of H5-Re11 + 3 against viruses in other subclades was 32–512 (Supplementary Table 3). In the antigenic map generated with the HI data, the breadth of the H5-Re11 + 3 serum response was calculated as described by Ron et al. (Fig. 4a)37. The H5-Re11 + 3 serum covered viruses in six subclades of 2.3.4.4, except 2.3.4.4c and 2.3.4.4f, which have not circulated since 2019 and 2017, respectively38,39 (Supplementary Fig. 2). We also evaluated the protective efficacy by using the MN assay, the gold standard for evaluating a vaccine’s protective capabilities. Notably, the data indicated that H5-Re11 + 3 serum reacted well with viruses in all eight subclades, with MN titers ranging from 64 to 1028, above the typical protective value (titers > 40) (Supplementary Table 4). As expected, in the antigenic map generated with the MN data (Fig. 4b), H5-Re11 + 3 serum was found to be located in the relative center of the antigenic map, and its breadth covered all eight subclades of the 2.4.4.4 viruses. Together, these data suggest that H5-Re11 + 3 is a potential broad-spectrum vaccine candidate against viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4.Fig. 4: Protective breadth of serum generated with the Re11 + 3 mutant.a The scope of protective efficacy depicted in the antigenic map was constructed using HI titer data. b The scope of protective efficacy illustrated in the antigenic map was created with MN titer data. Each square represents a 2-fold difference in either HI or MN titers. Viruses and serum samples are represented by circles and rectangles, respectively. The dashed red circle on the map marks the region where the titers of the H5-Re11 + 3 serum fall below the thresholds of 32 or 64 for the HI and MN titers, respectively.Full size imageProtective efficacy of H5-Re11 + 3 inactivated vaccine against clade 2.3.4.4 virusesLastly, we assessed the protective efficacy of the H5-Re11 + 3 vaccine in chickens that were immunized with a single dose of the inactivated H5-Re11 + 3 vaccine. The chickens were then challenged with clade 2.3.4.4 antigenic variants that previously caused epidemics in poultry: one 2.3.4.4g virus, one 2.3.4.4b virus, and two 2.3.4.4h viruses belonging to two different antigenic groups (Fig. 4). The antigenic map (Fig. 4) indicated that H5-Re11 serum may confer relatively broad protection against other clade viruses. Therefore, vaccine strain H5-Re11 was used for comparison in the challenge study. The H5-Re11 + 3- inactivated vaccine was immunogenic in chickens; three weeks after the single dose, the mean HI titer in chickens against the homologous virus was 7.4 log2, which is 0.3 log2 higher than that of the H5-Re11 vaccine (Fig. 5a, d, g, and j).Fig. 5: Evaluation of the protective efficacy of H5-Re11 + 3 vaccine against clade 2.3.4.4 viruses in chickens.Groups of birds were administered either the H5-Re11 + 3 vaccine, the Re11 vaccine, or a PBS control. Three weeks post-immunization, sera were collected from all experimental chickens and analyzed for HI antibody titers against both the vaccine strain and the challenge virus (a, d, g, and j). To assess virus shedding, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were collected from all surviving chickens on days 3 and 5 post-challenge (b, e, h, and k). Subsequently, all the chickens were challenged with 105 EID50 of the indicated virus in a 100-μl volume of PBS. Following the challenge, chickens were monitored for two weeks to observe signs of disease progression and mortality (c, f, i, and l). Virus titers presented are the mean values derived from the birds that survived, with error bars indicating the standard deviations. The blue pound symbols denote the instances where birds died before the specified day. In cases where fewer than ten birds survived, the exact number of survivors is noted. The dashed lines represent the lower limit of virus detection. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined by using GraphPad software, utilizing an unpaired t-test method for the analysis.Full size imageThe H5-Re8 vaccine was used to control clade 2.3.4.4g viruses between 2015 and 2018 and provided full protection against GZ/S4184/17 (clade 2.3.4.4h), which emerged in 20176. In the GZ/4/13 (clade 2.3.4.4g) virus-challenged group, the H5-Re11 + 3 vaccine induced a significantly higher HI titer against GZ/4/13 than that induced by H5-Re11 (Fig. 5a). All chickens in the control groups died within 4 days post-challenge (p.c.), and the two chickens that survived on day 3 p.c. shed high titers of viruses through both the oropharynx and cloaca (Fig. 5b, c). In the H5-Re11-vaccinated group, 60% of the birds died during the 14-day observation period, and all the birds shed virus in the oropharynx and cloaca on days 3 and 5 p.c., except for one chicken that died on day 7 post-immunization (p.i). However, in the H5-Re11 + 3-vaccinated group, no virus was recovered from the organs, and all the vaccinated birds were healthy during the 14-day observation period (Fig. 5b, c). These data indicate that H5-Re11 provides only partial protection against the 2.3.4.4g virus, whereas H5-Re11 + 3 offers complete protection against the same virus.The H5-Re11 vaccine was used to control clade 2.3.4.4h viruses between 2018 and 20216. In the GZ/S4184/17 (clade 2.3.4.4h) virus-challenged group, the H5-Re11 + 3 vaccine induced a similar HI titer against GZ/S4184/17 to that induced by H5-Re11 (Fig. 5d). All chickens in the control groups died, and the three chickens that survived on day 3 p.c. shed high titers of viruses in collected organs. In the H5-Re11 + 3 and H5-Re11-vaccinated groups, no virus was recovered from the organs, and all the vaccinated birds were healthy during the 14-day observation period (Fig. 5e, f). These data demonstrate that H5-Re11 + 3, despite harboring three mutations, provides 100% protection against the GZ/S4184/17 virus.The H5-Re13 vaccine was used instead of H5-Re11 to control antigenic variants in clade 2.3.4.4h, beginning in 20226. In the A/duck/Fujian/S1424/2020(H5N6) (FJ/S1424/20, donor virus of H5-Re13) virus-challenged groups, the H5-Re11 + 3 vaccine induced a significantly higher HI titer against FJ/S1424/20 than that induced by H5-Re11 (Fig. 5g). All chickens in the control groups died, and the three chickens that survived on day 3 p.c. shed high titers of viruses in collected swabs. In the H5-Re11-vaccinated group, all the chickens survived the 14-day observation period, but they all shed viruses in the two tested organs on day 3 p.c., while 8 and 4 chickens shed viruses in the oropharynx and cloaca swabs, respectively, on day 5 p.c. In contrast, all the chickens in the H5-Re11 + 3-vaccinated group were healthy and shed no virus for 14 days (Fig. 5h, i). These results show that H5-Re11 mitigates lethality but fails to prevent virus shedding after FJ/S1424/20 challenge, whereas H5-Re11 + 3 affords comprehensive protection against the virus.The H5-Re14 vaccine was used to control clade 2.3.4.4b virus, beginning in 20206. In the A/whooper swan/Shanxi/4-1/2020(H5N8) (SX/4-1/20, donor virus of H5-Re14) virus-challenged group, the H5-Re11 + 3 vaccine induced a significantly higher HI titer against SX/4-1/20 than that induced by H5-Re11 (Fig. 5j). Chickens in the control group all died within 4 days p.c., and the surviving birds shed viruses to high titers. In the H5-Re11-immunized group, no chicken died and no virus was shed in the cloaca swabs; however, the virus was detected in oropharyngeal swabs from 4 chickens on days 3 and 5 p.c. For chickens immunized with the H5-Re11 + 3 vaccine, no virus was detected in the tested swabs, and no symptoms were observed for 14 days (Fig. 5k, l). These data indicate that H5-Re11 + 3 offers 100% protection against the 2.3.4.4b virus.Taken together, these results indicate that the H5-Re11 + 3 vaccine provides solid protection against four antigenically drifted clade 2.3.4.4 H5 viruses.DiscussionIn this study, we mapped the antigenic sites of H5 HPAIVs, leading to the discovery of a vaccine candidate that is stable in chicken embryonated eggs for at least five passages (data not shown) and offers broad-spectrum protection against clade 2.3.4.4 viruses. Analysis of the antigenic differences between H5-Re8 and H5-Re11 revealed that these differences arise due to substitutions at eight antigenic sites. These substitutions—Q115L, R120S, N124D, −126D, V140M, T151I, A156T, and E185A––result in H5-Re11 having antigenic properties similar to those of H5-Re8, and vice versa. Antigenic cartography placed H5-Re11 + 3 centrally on the antigenic map, indicating its antigenic similarity to neighboring viruses. Further studies, including antigenic analysis and protective efficacy testing, confirmed its broad-spectrum efficacy against all viruses within the 2.3.4.4 clade. Our results suggest that vaccine design guided by antigenic cartography is a promising strategy for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines.Five major antigenic regions (A–E) have been identified through the characterization of escape mutants from mouse mAbs directed at the HA of human influenza A viruses20,22,23,40. For human H3N2 viruses, antigenic region B has been shown to be immunodominant over antigenic region A in both humans and mice27,41,42. Similarly, the antigenic region B of HA plays a critical role in the antigenic drift of subclade 2.3.4.4 H5 HPAIVs43. However, computational analysis has revealed that antigenic regions A and B have the largest average information entropy, indicating that they are under the highest immune pressure44. In our study, the epitope mapping data revealed that all eight identified antigenic sites were located within two classical antigenic regions, with five in antigenic region A (115, 120, 124, 126, and 140) and three in antigenic region B (151, 156, and 185). Consistent with our data, multiple studies have shown that both antigenic regions A and B play a critical role in the antigenic evolution of H5 viruses45,46,47,48. Kaverin et al. identified nine antigenic sites in the HA of A/mallard/Pennsylvania/10218/84 (H5N2), including seven positions in antigenic region A (124, 126, 129, 136, 138, 140, and 141) and two positions in antigenic region B (152 and 153)48. Rudneva et al. identified 10 antigenic sites in A/duck/Novosibirsk/56/05 (H5N1), including nine sites (113, 115, 117, 118, 120, 121, 123, 139, and 141) in antigenic region A and one site (162) in antigenic region B46. Position 126 in antigenic region A, which is involved in the formation of a glycosylation site, is the only antigenic site that could be recognized by the HI assay in our study, indicating its important role in viral antigenicity. Gu et al. reported that the E126N mutation creates an N-linked glycosylation site and results in an antigenic change in A/chicken/Hebei/A/2012(H5N2). Wang et al. reported that the D124N mutation results in the formation of a glycosylation site at site 126 and antigenic changes in H5N6 viruses49. However, the role of antigenic site 156, another site involved in the formation of a glycosylation site in antigenic region B, has only been recognized by mAbs and not polyclonal antibodies (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating that antigenic region A may be immunodominant in certain H5 viruses.Diverging from other methods used to develop broad-spectrum vaccines, our approach involved selecting a candidate that offers more extensive protection. This choice was guided by antigenic cartography, based on the hypothesis that a virus positioned centrally in an antigenic map would exhibit the greatest range of immunity. Similarly, Hu et al. reported that a booster vaccine (SARS-CoV-1) selected based on antigenic distance outperforms other candidates to elicit broader neutralizing responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants50. In our study, the H5-Re11 + 3 vaccine was identified during the antigenic analysis of clade 2.3.4.4 viruses; however, the mechanism of how to relocate the antigenic position of a vaccine strain to the relative center position of the antigenic map remains to be investigated. Although the HI assay has been the most commonly used serological assay to assess virus antigenicity, HI titer and protective efficiency against H5 viruses are not strictly correlated51,52. As a result, the protective breadth of H5-Re11 + 3, which completely prevented death and virus shedding in chickens (Fig. 5), was not fully represented in the antigenic cartography generated with the HI data (Fig. 4a), but was perfectly exhibited in the antigenic map generated with the MN data (Fig. 4b).Cao et al. demonstrated that a mAb against H5N1 virus AFluIgG01 that targets three sites on the membrane-distal globular head of HA1 [Site I (Ile116, Ile117, and Pro118), site II (Trp122 and Ser123) and site III (Tyr164 and Thr167)] can inhibit virus-receptor binding and pH-induced, cell-cell membrane fusion53. Given that two of the mutations of H5-Re11 + 3, namely Q115L, and R120S, are located close to sites I and II identified by Cao et al., it is reasonable to speculate that the H5-Re11 + 3 vaccine may elicit antibodies that recognize conformational epitope(s) that result in broad protection. The mechanism that induces such broad protection remains to be investigated.In summary, our epitope mapping study identified eight antigenic sites of the H5 virus, and our antigenic analysis found a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate (H5-Re11 + 3) that conferred full protection against multiple subclades of 2.3.4.4 H5 viruses. Our study demonstrated that antigenic cartography-guided vaccine design is a promising strategy for selecting a broad-spectrum vaccine. Further antigenic analysis may identify additional vaccine candidates with broader protection.Materials and methodsBiosafety and animal welfareThe animal experiment protocols were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments (220706-01-GJ and 220815-02-GJ) at the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute (HVRI) of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS). All animal experiments were carried out under Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) conditions. Experiments involving HPAIVs were conducted in the BSL3 laboratory, whereas those involving LPAIVs were performed in the BSL2 laboratory.Viruses and cellsViruses A/duck/Chongqing/S1049/2014(H5N6) (2.3.4.4a), A/duck/Zhejiang/S4143/2017(H5N6) (2.3.4.4b), A/whooper swan/Shanxi/4-1/2020(H5N8) (SX/4-1/20, 2.3.4.4b), A/duck/Zhejiang/S1327/2016(H5N6) (2.3.4.4c), A/chicken/Jiangxi/5/2016(H5N6) (2.3.4.4d), A/chicken/Hunan/6/2015 (H5N6) (2.3.4.4e), A/chicken/Hunan/1/2016(H5N6) (2.3.4.4f), A/chicken/Guizhou/4/2013(H5N1), (GZ/4/13, 2.3.4.4g), A/duck/Guizhou/S4184/2017(H5N6), (GZ/S4184/17, 2.3.4.4h), and A/duck/Fujian/S1424/2020(H5N6) (FJ/S1424/20, 2.3.4.4h) were isolated during routine surveillance (GISAID Accession Numbers: EPI3279858, EPI3279859, EPI3279860, EPI3279861, EPI3279862, EPI3279863, EPI1921590, EPI_ISL_202553, EPI3279864, and EPI3279865). H5 vaccine strains H5-Re8, H5-Re11, H5-Re13, and H5-Re14, with the surface genes from GZ/4/13, GZ/S4184/17, FJ/S1424/20, and SX/4-1/20, respectively, developed in the backbone of PR8 were maintained in our laboratory34,35,36. Mouse myeloma cells (Sp2/0) and human embryonic kidney cells (293T) were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were cultured in a DMEM medium containing 5% FBS. All cell lines were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.Production and purification of mAbsmAbs were generated by using the hybridoma technique as previously described54. In brief, 6-week-old female BALB/c mice received intramuscular injections containing 50 μg of the pCAGGS vector, which facilitates the expression of the H5-Re11WT HA protein, suspended in 200 µl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The mice were boosted twice with 10 µg of inactivated Re11 vaccine with a two-week interval between boosts. Hybrid cells were generated by the fusion of Sp2/0 myeloma cells and antibody-secreting cells. The positive hybridoma cells were identified by using the HI assay, and then monoclonal hybridoma cells (1.0 × 104 per mouse) were intraperitoneally injected into BALB/c mice sensitized with Freund incomplete adjuvant (500 μl per mouse). To quantify the mAbs, ascites antibodies from mice were purified by using a protein G affinity column (GE Healthcare, USA), and the concentration of the mAbs was measured by using a BCA protein assay kit (Bevotime. China).Construction of recombinant mutant virusIn this study, the mutants were rescued with an avirulent HA gene featuring specified amino acid substitutions, along with the remaining gene segments from PR8. Initially, the HA gene from HPAIV was rendered avirulent by modifying the HA cleavage site, which contains multiple basic amino acids, to include only one basic amino acid—a characteristic typical of LPAIV. The recombinant viruses were then rescued using reverse genetics, as previously described55. In brief, 293T cells were seeded in a 6-well plate one day prior to transfection. Following the manufacturer’s instructions, the cells were transfected with 4 μg of eight DNA plasmids (approximately 0.5 μg per plasmid) using Lipofectamine® LTX (Invitrogen, USA). After 10 h, the medium was replaced with Opti-MEM containing 0.125 μg/ml TPCK-trypsin (Sigma, USA). The cells were then incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before harvesting the supernatant. To propagate the virus stocks, embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated with the supernatant from the transfected cells. After a 48 h incubation at 37 °C, the allantoic fluid was harvested, and the presence of introduced mutations, as well as the absence of any unwanted additional mutations, was confirmed through sequencing.HI and MN assaysIn accordance with methods delineated in previous studies56, HI assays were conducted using a panel of chicken antisera or mAbs as previously described56. Sera or mAbs were mixed with 25 μl of PBS that contained four hemagglutinating units of the indicated virus. The resulting mixture was then maintained at room temperature for 20 min. Then, 25 μl of 1% chicken erythrocytes was added to the mixture, which was incubated for an additional 20 min. The titers were recorded and expressed as the reciprocal value of the highest dilution of serum that completely inhibited the agglutination of the chicken erythrocytes.The MN assay was conducted as previously described56. Briefly, the serum was serially diluted 2-fold using DMEM medium supplemented with 1 mg/mL TPCK-trypsin. Then, 50 μl of the serially diluted serum was mixed with 50 μl of DMEM medium containing 100 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of the indicated virus and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The mixture was then transferred onto MDCK cells in 96-well plates, and the cells were cultured at 37 °C for 2 days. The MN titer is the highest dilution that inhibited virus replication.Western blottingThe glycosylation patterns of HA proteins were assessed through Western blot analysis. Briefly, the viruses were purified through ultracentrifugation on a 30% sucrose cushion at 28,000 rpm for 90 min. Then, the viruses were diluted with PBS and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. For Western blotting, the viruses were lysed with NP-40 buffer containing Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail for 30 min at 4 °C. The presence of protein bands was determined using the Odyssey infrared imaging system, following incubation with Re-11 chicken anti-sera and an IRDye™ 700DX-conjugated secondary antibody.Antigenic cartographyThe antigenicity distances between viruses were assessed at https://www.antigenic-cartography.org/, as previously described25,57. The HI or MN titers were subjected to mathematical transformation to generate a comprehensive table delineating antigenic distances. This transformation was conducted using the equation Dij = bj − log2 (Hij), where Hij represents the titer corresponding to antigen i reacting against serum j, b is the log of the peak titer identified in reactions with serum j, and Dij is the target distance between virus i and serum j. Subsequently, to optimize the representation, the error function represented as (Dij − dij)2 was minimized, with dij denoting the Euclidean distance between two respective points delineated on the map.Chicken studyTo make an inactivated vaccine, 10 ml of the indicated virus was diluted with PBS to contain 7 log2 HA units in a volume of 50 µl, and then thoroughly mixed with 20 ml of oil adjuvant in a vaccine-generating machine. To evaluate the protective efficacy of the indicated vaccine strain against four viruses, GZ/4/13 (2.3.4.4g), GZ/S4184/17 (2.3.4.4h), FJ/S1424/20 (2.3.4.4h), and SX/4-1/20 (2.3.4.4b), a total of 120 chickens were used. Groups of 30 three-week-old White Leghorn specific pathogenic free chickens (hen) were injected intramuscularly with one dose (0.3 ml) of H5-Re11, H5-Re11 + 3, or PBS (10 chickens each, randomly selected). Three weeks post-vaccination (p.v.), serum samples were collected from all experimental chickens and assessed for HI antibody titers against both the vaccine strain and the challenge virus. Subsequently, ten chickens, immunized with H5-Re11, H5-Re11 + 3, or with PBS, were intranasally challenged with 105 50% egg infective doses (EID50) of the indicated virus. These challenged birds were monitored for disease symptoms and mortality for two weeks following the challenge. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were collected on days 3 and 5 p.c. to detect the presence of the virus in 10-day-old embryonated eggs. All the chickens were euthanized by CO2 at the end of the experiment.Statistical analysisThe raw data obtained from the samples were transformed to a logarithmic scale prior to conducting further analysis. To evaluate the statistical significance between distinct groups, the Unpaired t-test was employed using GraphPad Prism (v8) software, assuming that both populations have an identical standard deviation (SD). A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

However, the influenza vaccination rate in China remains low. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people held different attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. In the post-pandemic era, do the varying attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine affect the intention to receive influenza vaccination? Methods: Based on the influence of presumed influence (IPI) model and spillover effects, this study employed structural equation modeling for multi-group comparison to analyze questionnaires from 613 participants, using instruments such as the Perceived Media Influence on Others Scale (PMIO), the Susceptibility to Influenza Scale (SI), and the Attitude toward Influenza Vaccine Scale (AIV). Results: The key findings are as follows: (1) Information exposure to the influenza vaccine significantly influences perceived media influence on others. (2) Perceived media influence on others does not directly impact the intention to receive influenza vaccination but rather affects it through attitude toward the influenza vaccine. (3) Moreover, multi-group analyses revealed differences in the IPI model among audiences with different attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. These differences demonstrated that prior attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine can influence attitudes toward similar influenza vaccines, thus demonstrating the existence of spillover effects. Conclusion: Attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine can influence the intention to receive the influenza vaccination. Those with a negative attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine are significantly influenced by susceptibility to influenza. Perceived media influence affects the intention to receive the influenza vaccination among those with a positive attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine. 1 Introduction COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and as of April 2023, 760 million confirmed cases have been reported globally, of which 6,887,000 have died (1). Its outbreaks have long disrupted people’s normal lives and inflicted devastating impacts on global health, safety, economy, and trade. Some studies have shown that vaccination is effective in preventing COVID-19. Statistics from the UK found that among adults aged 18–69 years, receiving two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine at least 2 weeks before the initial diagnosis reduced the infection rate by 41.1% (2). Although the COVID-19 pandemic is currently under control and the virus has become much less virulent, seasonal influenza remains a concern and apprehensions about it have not yet subsided. While many scholars have focused on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy due to the devastating nature of the disease, the situation with influenza vaccination is equally discouraging. Influenza viruses are life-threatening respiratory pathogens for people with weakened immune systems. Vaccination is an important preventive measure against seasonal influenza, but currently, influenza vaccination coverage remains low in many countries (3). It has been suggested that although COVID-19 and influenza are caused by different viruses, both are infectious respiratory illnesses. Therefore, a higher perceived risk of COVID-19 may lead to greater willingness to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine (4). There have been a few studies that have noted that attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine may influence attitudes toward the influenza vaccine and promote higher influenza vaccination rates. A study in Hong Kong found that COVID-19 may increase influenza vaccination rates to nearly 50% (5). For several seasons prior to the 2018–19 season, influenza vaccination coverage had remained the same for children (6). However, influenza vaccination coverage has changed following the COVID-19 outbreak. Notably, during the 2019–2020 season, both children and adults experienced an increase in influenza vaccination coverage compared to the preceding 2018–2019 season (7). In a survey of a certain region in China, changes in intention to receive influenza vaccination were also found. The influenza vaccination rate for the 2021–2022 season stood at 17.68%, marking a significant increase compared to the 11.8% rate observed in the 2018–2019 season. This upward trend was consistent across various age groups within the population (8). While the COVID-19 outbreak is currently under control and no longer considered a “public health emergency of international concern,” its impact persists. In particular, it remains unclear how vaccination against COVID-19 affects vaccination against influenza, a similar respiratory illness. Therefore, this paper asks: “How do pre-existing attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine affect intention to receive influenza vaccination?” To investigate this question, this study first explored whether the influence of presumed influence model (IPI model) is valid in the context of influenza vaccination, based on the theory of the influence of presumed influence. Specifically, it examined how people’s exposure to the influenza vaccine information affects their own attitudes and intentions toward influenza vaccination through perceived media influence on others. The influence of presumed influence model posits that people adjust their attitudes and behaviors according to perceived media influence on others (9). This study conducted a multi-group analysis based on the theory of the influence of presumed influence model to investigate whether there are differences in the model between respondents with varying attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. This examined the potential spillover effects of the COVID-19 vaccine on influenza vaccination. This study aimed to answer these questions in the context of both influenza vaccination and COVID-19 vaccination, although the COVID-19 outbreak and vaccination campaign are currently in the past. Concerns regarding the influenza vaccine remain prevalent, leading to cautious attitudes and behaviors toward this vaccine. It is hoped that exploring factors influencing vaccination may provide useful insights for future vaccination communication strategies. 2 Literature review 2.1 The influence of presumed influence model One’s intention to vaccine could be influenced by information exposure to vaccines on social media, and reading comments expressing opinions on vaccines can lead to changes in one’s attitude toward vaccines, which could guide vaccination behavior (10, 11). Studies on the indirect influence of media have received increasing attention compared to the studies on the direct influence of media. One focus of this study is to examine how people’s attention to the influenza vaccine information in media indirectly influences their attitudes toward the influenza vaccine and intention to receive influenza vaccination. In this paper, the influence of presumed influence model proposed by Gunther was used to test how information exposure to the influenza vaccine indirectly affects their attitudes toward the influenza vaccine and intention to receive influenza vaccination. Gunther first proposed the influence of presumed influence (IPI) model, which centers on the assumption that “people perceive the influence of media on others (presumed influence) and change their attitudes or behaviors as a result (influence of presumed influence)” [(12), p. 199]. The model posits that individuals infer others’ media information exposure based on their own exposure and the degree to which individuals believe they perceive media messages determines the degree to which others are influenced. Thus, whether or not an individual is influenced by a media message, they will make corresponding changes in attitude and behaviors through their perceived influence on others. Gunther’s study found that when adolescents were exposed to pro-smoking media messages, they perceived their peers to be more influenced, which, in turn, shaped their own intention to smoke (13). In other words, the IPI model produces behavioral outcomes, as individuals perceive media influences on others may alter personal attitudes and behaviors (9, 12). The IPI model, starting with perceived influence on others stemming from individual exposure, has been demonstrated in domains such as healthy lifestyles, violent video games, and more (14, 15). According to the IPI model, information exposure to the influenza vaccine affects perceived media influence on others. For example, when people encounter pro-vaccine comments, they will think that others have been influenced by COVID-19 vaccine promotional posts and thus accepted the COVID-19 vaccine (16). Therefore, perceived media influence on others occurs when exposed to the influenza vaccine messages. Exposure is significantly correlated with perceived influence on others, leading to the hypothesis: H1: Information exposure to the influenza vaccine significantly affects perceived media influence on others. Perceived media influence on others can lead to subsequent changes, as people shift attitudes based on how exposure affects others. Studies have found that people’s perception of media influence on others can predict their own intention to engage in health behaviors, which has been validated across domains, including weight loss, safe sex practices, healthy eating, and skin cancer prevention (17, 18). In other words, information exposure to the influenza vaccine creates a perceived influence on others leading people to change their attitude toward the influenza vaccine. Some studies also suggest that perceived influence directly changes behavioral intention, even without direct effects (12) or concurrently with them (19). Therefore, this paper proposes the following hypotheses: H2: Perceived media influence on others significantly affects intention to receive influenza vaccination. H3: Perceived media influence on others significantly affects attitudes toward the influenza vaccine. Studies have shown that when respondents perceive avian influenza news as influencing others, individuals are more likely to seek out avian influenza vaccine and related information (20). This study predicts that audiences’ attitudes toward the influenza vaccine will affect their intention to receive influenza vaccination. Based on the established relationship between attitude and intention, the current study hypothesizes: H4: Attitude toward the influenza vaccine significantly affects intention to receive influenza vaccination. 2.2 Susceptibility to influenza Moreover, perceived susceptibility is a crucial factor in health decision-making and preventive behaviors (21). In addition, this study also examines the effect of susceptibility on attitude toward the influenza vaccine and intention. According to the health belief model (HBM), research has found that susceptibility can all shape decisions to vaccinate against seasonal and pandemic flu (22). Prior studies have explored the relationship between information exposure to disease can alter susceptibility. One study found static advertising positively associated with smoking susceptibility in adolescents, while movie/TV exposure was not significant (23). In COVID-19 research, social media information exposure positively correlated with susceptibility in pregnant women (24). However, some intergenerational studies find no direct relationship between media exposure and susceptibility (25). Based on these findings, this paper hypothesizes: H5: Information exposure to the influenza vaccine will significantly increase susceptibility to influenza. Influenza vaccination studies show high-risk, unvaccinated individuals believe prevention measures besides vaccines are effective, while those with lower perceived susceptibility have lower vaccination intentions (21). In the context of HPV vaccination, perceived susceptibility positively correlates with vaccination intention (26). A study of 300 female students found that increased susceptibility led to higher vaccination intention (27). A study found no direct, significant influence, perhaps due to optimism bias reducing perceived susceptibility (25). Despite some inconsistent findings, most studies observe a positive correlation between susceptibility to influenza and intention to receive influenza vaccination. Therefore, this paper also hypothesizes: H6: Susceptibility to influenza will significantly increase the intention to receive influenza vaccination. 2.3 Spillover effects A number of studies have verified the IPI model. Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness generally caused by influenza A and B viruses. However, characterized by antigenic variability, rapid spread, and annual seasonal epidemics, influenza results in approximately 1 billion infections and 300,000–500,000 deaths per year according to World Health Organization estimates (28). Vaccination is the most cost-effective prevention method; however, influenza vaccination coverages in China remain relatively low compared to other countries (29). Studies have confirmed vaccination policy, knowledge, and history are key factors influencing influenza vaccination (28–31). Meanwhile, vaccine misinformation online can negatively impact willingness (32). Individuals’ perceptions of one familiar technology may spill over into their assessment of a new technology (33). Research shows perceptions of genetically modified foods influence views on nanofoods and nanotechnology labeling. If people see GMOs as beneficial, they are less supportive of nano labeling even if unconvinced of nanotechnology benefits (34). Numerous studies have focused on cross-vaccine effects, meaning attitudes toward one vaccine can influence views of similar vaccines. For example, past research found those vaccinated against influenza were more likely to receive pandemic vaccines (35). While most cost-effective for public health, some vaccine hesitancy driven by safety concerns persists, being named a top 10 threat in 2019 by WHO. Studies show associations between influenza and COVID-19 vaccine intent. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk increases seasonal influenza vaccine intent given similar transmission and symptoms (4). A study in Italy found that regardless of people’s views on vaccines, intentions to the influenza vaccine increased with higher perceived risk. At the same time, research shows that people who have received the influenza vaccine are more willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine (36). While prior research has suggested some positive association between COVID-19 vaccine attitude and influenza vaccine uptake, the mechanism behind this correlation remains unclear. Therefore, this paper addresses the following question: Q1: Do variations in attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine moderate the influence of the presumed influence (IPI) model? In conclusion, information exposure to the influenza vaccine is an important factor influencing audience attitudes toward the influenza vaccine and intention to receive influenza vaccination. Figure 1 outlines the assumptions and research questions examined in this paper. Accordingly, based on the IPI model, this paper specifically examines how exposure to the influenza vaccine information indirectly affects people’s intention to receive influenza vaccination, in other words, how people’s perceived media influence on others affects their intention. At the same time, this paper explores whether individuals’ attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine spill over into their attitudes toward the influenza vaccine. Figure 1 Figure 1. Model of this paper. 3 Data and method 3.1 Data This study employed a questionnaire survey targeting college students, conducted via the “Wenjuanxing” platform from 1 June to 7 June 2023. A total of 631 questionnaires were collected, and after excluding responses with logical conflicts, 613 questionnaires were deemed valid, resulting in a recovery rate of 97.15%. 3.2 Measures 3.2.1 Information exposure to the influenza vaccine Respondents answered the question about their information exposure to the influenza vaccine, which was adapted from Gunther and Storey (12). Data were collected using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = fairly agree, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree) for this question. Higher values on the scale indicated greater concern about information regarding the influenza vaccine. 3.2.2 Perceived media influence on others Respondents answered 3 perceived influences of the influenza vaccine on others scenarios, with reference groups including family members, friends, and others, with higher scores indicating that self-perceived influenza vaccine messages have a greater influence on others. This study used the Perceived Media Influence on Others Scale (PMIO), adapted from Paek and Gunther (37, 38). The data were collected using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = very small, 5 = very large) for this question. 3.2.3 Susceptibility to influenza Individuals have different subjective perceptions when dealing with different diseases. Susceptibility to influenza is a term commonly used in the medical literature, and this paper used the Susceptibility to Influenza Scale (SI), referred to the paper (39). Measuring the susceptibility to influenza: “I am susceptible to colds, influenza, and other infectious diseases”, “I think I am at a higher risk of getting the influenza than the people around me”, “If I get the influenza”, “I will not be able to do my daily activities”, and “I worry that the influenza will make me very sick”, and scores were calculated using a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores indicated higher perceived illness. 3.2.4 Attitude toward the influenza vaccine This paper measures attitudes toward the influenza vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine using the same set of items, which used Attitude toward the Influenza Vaccine Scale (AIV), adapted from Martin’s study (40). After testing the scale for high internal consistency and reliability, a series of adaptations were made to measure attitudes toward the influenza vaccine separately, taking into account the national context and reality. Attitudes toward the influenza vaccine were measured using three questions: “Getting influenza vaccine makes me feel safe”, “I can rely on the influenza vaccine to stop me being attacked by the influenza”, and “Getting influenza vaccine makes me feel protected”. The question was used to collect data on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = fairly agree, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree), with larger values indicating more positive attitudes toward the influenza vaccine. 3.2.5 Intention to receive influenza vaccination In this paper, the same Likert 5-point scale was used to collect data on the intention to receive influenza vaccination (4): “I am willing to receive influenza vaccination” (1 = very unwilling, 5 = very willing). Finally, demographic factors and seven demographic variables were used as control variables in this study: gender, age, nation, place of origin, major, grade, and monthly consumption level. The specific coding for these variables is as follows: “gender” (male = 1; female = 0), “nation” (Han Chinese = 1; minority = 0), “major” (natural science = 1; humanities and social science = 0), “place of origin” (eastern region = 1; midwestern region = 0), and “grade” (freshmen = 1; non-freshmen = 0). Age was measured as a continuous variable. The monthly consumption level was collected by asking respondents to indicate their consumption interval, after which the midpoint of the interval was calculated and divided by 1,000 to represent the monthly consumption level. Based on the compilation and generalization of related research literature, this study identified questions to measure the variables and revised them to take into account the national context. These revised questions were then validated through pre-survey tests, and the results met the reliability and validity requirements. 3.3 Analytical approach Data analysis was performed using MPlus for structural equation modeling (SEM). To account for the non-normal data distribution, the analysis employed a robust maximum-likelihood estimator (MLMV). The model included gender, age, nation, place of origin, major, grade, and monthly consumption level as control variables. Model fit was evaluated based on the following criteria: (a) an insignificant maximum-likelihood chi-square ( χ 2 ) value ( p > 0.05 ); (b) a relative chi-square ratio ( χ 2 / d f ) less than 5 (41); (c) a root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) below 0.08 (42); (d) a standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) below 0.08 (43); and (e) comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker–Lewis index (TLI) exceeding 0.95 (44). To answer the research questions posed in this paper, and to test whether there is a difference in the IPI model between those with different attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine, participants were categorized into two groups: those with negative attitudes ( M attitude ≤3.0) and those with positive attitudes ( M attitude >3.0). In particular, 20.4% of respondents had negative attitudes. Multi-group comparative analyses were conducted to test for differences between these two groups. First, a multi-group model was run for two groups—those with negative attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine and those with positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Following this, a similar multi-group model was run with all path coefficients constrained to be equal. Using the DIFFTEST command in Mplus, a chi-square difference test was performed to compare the unconstrained and constrained multi-group models. For statistically different groups, the chi-square difference test should produce significant changes (45). Subsequently, a series of multi-group models were conducted, which contained only specific path coefficients constrained to be equal. These constrained multi-group models were compared to unconstrained multi-group models by performing a series of chi-square difference tests to check whether the differences were located on specific individual paths within the models. 4 Results 4.1 Descriptive statistics This paper mainly focuses on the college student group. Of the 613 respondents, 45.4% ( n = 278 ) were men and 54.6% ( n = 335 ) were women, which is consistent with the gender ratio of the college student population. The age ranged from 17 to 35 years with a median of 22 years, matching the profile of college students. In terms of geographic distribution, 47% were from eastern provinces and 53% from central and western provinces. Ethnically, 92.8% were Han Chinese, reflecting the ethnic composition. Regarding academic majors, 47.8% were in natural sciences and 52.2% in humanities and social sciences. Freshmen accounted for 23.7% of the sample. The mean monthly consumption level was 2,400 yuan. In summary, the sample characteristics, including gender, age, nation, place, major, grade, and monthly consumption level, are largely representative of the college student population (see Table 1). Table 1 Table 1. Descriptive statistics. 4.2 Measurement models To examine the reliability of the indicators (attitude toward the influenza vaccine, perceived media influence on others, and susceptibility to influenza), Cronbach’s α and composite reliability (CR) coefficients were utilized in this study. Factor loadings above 0.5, Cronbach’s alpha above 0.7, and CR above 0.6 suggested adequate internal consistency. Moreover, average variance extracted (AVE) was inspected for each latent variable to ensure the items sufficiently contributed to the intended constructs, with values above 0.5 deemed satisfactory. As shown in Table 2, the findings supported the reliability of the measures used to address the research questions. Table 2 Table 2. Results of the confirmatory factor analysis. As shown in Table 3, these models’ fit indices indicated adequate fit. Table 3 Table 3. Fit indices for measured and structural models. 4.3 Hypothesis testing 4.3.1 Validation of the IPI model results The model fit for this paper was good (Table 3), indicating the model was supported by the data. The results showed a positive correlation between respondents’ information exposure to the influenza vaccine and perceived media influence on others ( β = 0.365 , p < 0.001 ). This correlation was statistically significant, confirming H1. Hypothesis 3 proposed a significant association between perceived media influence on others and attitudes toward the influenza vaccine. The results revealed a positive correlation between these two variables ( β = 0.159 , p < 0.01 ), providing statistical support for H3. Hypothesis 4 proposed that attitude toward the influenza vaccine significantly influences the intention to receive influenza vaccination. The analysis uncovered a positive correlation between these variables ( β = 0.0649 , p < 0.001 ), confirming this hypothesis. Hypothesis 5 states that exposure to vaccine information relates to susceptibility to influenza. The data revealed a positive association ( β = 0.242 , p < 0.001 ), supporting H5. Hypothesis 6 proposed an association between susceptibility and intention to receive influenza vaccination. Results showed a positive correlation ( β = 0.097 , p < 0.05 ), confirming this hypothesis. Perceived media influence did not directly relate to the intention to receive influenza vaccination ( β = 0.012 , p > 0.05 ). Thus, H2 was not supported. Regarding controls, gender, age, nation, and origin place impacted attitude and susceptibility. However, monthly consumption level, major, and grade did not relate to vaccine intention. In summary, the model was supported, confirming all hypotheses except H2. Figure 2 visualizes these results. Figure 2 Figure 2. Results of the structural model. The coefficients in the graphs are standardized beta coefficients; dashed lines indicate unconfirmed; and solid lines indicate confirmed. * p < 0.05 ; ** p < 0.01 ; *** p < 0.001 is reflective of significance. 4.3.2 Validation of the results of multi-group analysis To examine whether there were differences in the IPI model between those with positive and negative attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine, a multi-group analysis was conducted. The results of the chi-square test of variance showed a significant between-group difference between the two models ( Δ χ 2 6 = 26.238 , p < 0.001 ), indicating the IPI model varied based on attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine. A series of follow-up chi-square variance tests revealed significant between-group differences in three specific model paths. First, there was a difference between attitude toward the influenza vaccine and intention to receive influenza vaccination ( Δ χ 2 1 = 6.510 , p < 0.05 ). Second, a difference existed between susceptibility to influenza and intention to receive influenza vaccination ( Δ χ 2 1 = 7.208 , p < 0.01 ). Finally, a difference was found between perceived media influence on others and attitudes toward the influenza vaccine (∆ χ 2 (1) = 7.490, p < 0.01 ). Taken together, these results demonstrate that attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine moderated the relationships between attitude toward the influenza vaccine and intention to receive influenza vaccination, susceptibility to influenza and intention to receive influenza vaccination, and information exposure to the influenza vaccine and attitude toward the influenza vaccine (see Table 4). Table 4 Table 4. Multi-group analysis. Specifically, attitude toward the influenza vaccine significantly predicted intention to receive influenza vaccination in both the positive ( β = 0.776 , p < 0.001 ) and negative ( β = 1.010 , p < 0.001 ) COVID-19 vaccine attitude groups, although the strength differed (Figure 3A). Additionally, susceptibility to influenza only was associated with the intention for those negative attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine ( β = 0.130 , p < 0.05 ), implying increasing susceptibility may raise the intention to receive influenza vaccination in this group (Figure 3B). Finally, perceived media influence was related to attitude toward the influenza vaccine for those positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccine ( β = 0.117 , p < 0.01 ), but not for those negative ( β = − 0.100 , p > 0.05 ), suggesting perceived media influence on others does not directly affect attitude to the influenza vaccine among this group (Figure 3C). In summary, this multi-group analysis showed that attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine significantly impacted the IPI model pertaining to influenza vaccination, answering the core research question. Figure 3 Figure 3. (A) Effect of interaction between attitude toward influenza vaccine and attitude toward COVID-19 vaccine on intention to receive influenza vaccination. (B) Effect of interaction between susceptibility to influenza and attitude toward COVID-19 vaccine on intention to receive influenza vaccination.

CA = Attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine. 5 Discussion This study analyzed the IPI model on influenza vaccination intention using an online questionnaire grounded in the frameworks of the IPI model and spillover effects. The results showed all hypotheses were supported except for the non-significant relationship between perceived media influence on others and intention to receive influenza vaccination ( β = 0.012 , p > 0.05 ). A multi-group analysis based on spillover effects tested models’ differences between those with positive and negative attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Significant between-group differences emerged for three pathways: (1) the path from attitude toward the influenza vaccine to intention to receive influenza vaccination ( Δ χ 2 1 = 6.510 , p < 0.05 ); (2) the path from susceptibility to influenza to intention to receive influenza vaccination ( Δ χ 2 1 = 7.208 , p < 0.01 ); and (3) the path from perceived media influence on others to attitude toward the influenza vaccine ( Δ χ 2 1 = 7.490 , p < 0.01 ). Overall, the IPI model is still valid in the context of the intention to receive influenza vaccination. Greater information exposure to the influenza vaccine increased perceived media influence on others. In turn, the higher perceived influence was related to a more positive attitude toward the influenza vaccine and a greater intention to receive influenza vaccination. Additionally, information exposure to the influenza vaccine was associated with higher susceptibility to influenza, which also predicted intention to receive influenza vaccination. In particular, perceived media influence on others did not directly impact intention to receive influenza vaccination, indicating wariness about the vaccine. Attitudes may need to shift before intention strengthens this critical health behavior. In summary, while perceived social influence alone did not motivate intention to receive influenza vaccination, changing attitudes and overcoming barriers may generate intention to receive influenza vaccination. This study also conducted a multi-group analysis based on spillover effects to examine models’ differences between those with positive or negative attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. The results revealed significant differences in the IPI model between the two vaccine attitudes groups, demonstrating a “spillover effect.” This aligns with past research showing individuals’ attitudes toward one vaccine can influence their attitudes toward a similar vaccine, impacting vaccination behavior (46, 47). The further multi-group analysis uncovered spillover effects for three pathways: attitude toward the influenza vaccine and intention to receive influenza vaccination; susceptibility to influenza and intention to receive influenza vaccination; and perceived media influence on others and attitude toward the influenza vaccine. This shows a positive relationship between attitude toward the influenza vaccine and intention to receive influenza vaccination. However, the strength of this influence can vary depending on their attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. The effect was stronger for those with negative attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. In the context of positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine, the greater the perceived media influence on others and the greater susceptibility to influenza, making them more likely to want to get the influenza vaccine themselves. In the case of negative attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine, the higher the susceptibility to influenza, the more likely intention to receive influenza vaccination. The greater the perceived media influence on others, the lower the intention to receive influenza vaccination. These findings highlight that attitude toward the influenza vaccine remains the most important factor for intention to receive influenza vaccination, but the strength of this association can be modulated by attitude toward COVID-19 vaccine and susceptibility to influenza. The multi-group analysis successfully answered the research questions, revealing spillover effects between COVID-19 and attitude toward the influenza vaccine and intention to receive influenza vaccination. In summary, the multi-group analysis provided important insights into the spillover effects between influenza and COVID-19 vaccine attitudes. Overall, influenza vaccine attitude significantly and positively predicted intention to receive influenza vaccination regardless of COVID-19 vaccine attitude. However, susceptibility only influenced intention among those negative attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. This implies increasing perceived susceptibility could improve the intention to vaccinate against influenza in this group. Additionally, perceived media influence on others was related to more positive attitudes toward the influenza vaccine and, in turn, greater intention to receive influenza vaccination, but only for those positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, the multi-group analysis demonstrated pre-existing spillover effects between vaccine attitudes, though the pathways differed based on COVID-19 vaccine attitudes. For those negative attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine, influencing susceptibility to influenza could improve the influenza vaccine uptake. However, for those positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine, leveraging media influence to shape attitudes may increase the intention to receive the influenza vaccine. In conclusion, accounting for COVID-19 vaccine spillover effects allows tailored targeting of the critical factors shaping influenza vaccination for each attitude group. 5.1 Limitations Of course, there are some limitations of the research presented in this paper. First, the survey was primarily conducted online, which may introduce selection bias in the sample. Although efforts were made to maximize sample diversity during recruitment, the randomness of the sample cannot be guaranteed. As such, the results may not fully generalize to the broader population. Future research should aim to achieve a more representative sample through diverse recruitment strategies and should include populations from different geographical, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds. Additionally, the survey captured attitude at a single point in time. We cannot elucidate how attitudes shift in response to changes in virus risk or vaccine availability. Future research should further examine whether spillover effects from domains outside of vaccination significantly influence the IPI model. Other limitations include the reliance on self-reported survey measures, which can be prone to biases like social desirability. The cross-sectional nature of the data also precludes determining causality. Longitudinal or experimental data could provide stronger evidence for causal relationships between the assessed factors over time. Overall, while this study provides meaningful insights into spillover effects on vaccine attitude, the limitations highlight important avenues for future research. Further studies with more representative, diverse samples, and multiple timepoints could build upon these findings. 5.2 Implications for research and practice This study makes several key contributions to the literature. First, it demonstrates the applicability of the IPI model in the vaccine context, providing theoretical backing for factors shaping attitudes toward the influenza vaccine and intention to receive influenza vaccination. More importantly, it reveals prior vaccine attitude can impact the model for related vaccines—there are group differences based on COVID-19 vaccine attitude. For those negative attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine, susceptibility to influenza strongly was associated with the intention to receive influenza vaccination, while media influence was related to more positive influenza attitudes for those positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. These findings allow more targeted communication to different attitude groups to optimize vaccine uptake. Though the COVID-19 pandemic has passed, vaccine hesitancy persists for other public health vaccines like influenza. While the specific virus changes, vaccine reluctance itself remains an obstacle to promoting population health. By elucidating the pathways shaping the influenza vaccine attitude and intent among different COVID-19 vaccine attitude groups, this study provides valuable insights to inform targeted, effective health communication to improve vaccine acceptance. Overall, accounting for spillover effects between vaccine attitudes allows tailored messaging to address the key drivers of vaccine hesitancy for each group. 6 Conclusion This study has found that attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine can impact the intention to receive influenza vaccination. Specifically, susceptibility to influenza affects individuals who hold a negative attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine. On the other hand, for individuals who hold positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine, perceived media influence on others affects their intention to receive influenza vaccination. This paper aims to explore the impact of information exposure to the influenza vaccine on attitude and intention toward influenza vaccination, with the hope of providing insights for vaccine promotion strategies and fostering the development of health communication.

What to Know About Bird Flu and Dogs Back To News Can Dogs Get Bird Flu? What to Know About Bird Flu and Dogs By Nandini Maharaj Published: Aug 23, 2024 | 4 Minutes Published: Aug 23, 2024 | 4 Minutes vaccinations respiratory health bird flu A massive outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in the US has led to widespread rates of infection in both wild birds and farmed birds. With recent cases of the virus detected in humans, dairy cows, and other mammals, you might wonder about the risk of bird flu in dogs. Bird flu is highly contagious between birds and although rare, it can spread to humans. Fortunately, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the current public health risk for bird flu is low. Still, it’s worth keeping an eye on updates to limit your dog’s exposure to the virus. Read on for veterinary advice on the symptoms of a respiratory infection and how to keep your dog and the rest of your family safe. What Is Bird Flu? Bird flu is a common name for avian flu or avian influenza, a virus that mainly infects birds. However, bird flu can also spread to humans and other mammals. There are four types of influenza viruses and several subtypes of each, such as H5N1 bird flu. These subtypes get their name from the proteins on the virus’ surface. The “H” stands for hemagglutinin, which is “a surface protein that has to fit with a particular type of cell in order for influenza to infect the animal,” says Dr. Amy Attas, VMD of New York-based practice City Pets. The “N” stands for another protein called neuraminidase. Typically, H5N1 tends to infect waterfowl, ducks, and geese, in addition to domestic fowl like chickens and turkeys, she says. Alexander Raths via Getty Images Are Dogs at Risk for Bird Flu? The short answer is yes. H5N1 can infect dogs, as well as humans. As the virus replicates, its genes may develop errors or mutations, causing changes in the virus’ surface proteins. It’s common for viruses to mutate as they move between host animals. Some mutations result in the virus becoming more transmissible or better at evading the immune system’s natural defenses. Dogs are at risk for bird flu “because H5N1 is a pretty good mutator,” Dr. Attas says. “However, dogs are not one of the mammals that are overly represented in cases of bird flu. The virus can spread among wildlife and cows, but there are extremely sporadic reports of dogs getting infected.” So, while it helps to be aware of infectious disease outbreaks, dog owners don’t need to be overly alarmed since there are so few cases of bird flu in dogs and people. That said, whenever you’re dealing with an influenza virus that can mutate, you wouldn’t want to risk exposing a beloved pet. Symptoms of Respiratory Disease in Dogs With so few cases of bird flu in dogs, what’s known about respiratory disease comes from other influenza outbreaks. For example, H3N2 is a subtype of influenza that normally spreads in pigs but can infect other mammals and birds. Both H3N2 and H3N8 can cause canine influenza or dog flu, the symptoms of which can mirror human respiratory infections and include the following: Sneezing Nose and eye discharge Decreased appetite Congestion Coughing Malaise Fever Occasional vomiting When there was an outbreak of canine influenza, “dogs had no natural immunity, and so 100% of those who came in contact with this flu virus were infected,” Dr. Attas says. “These dogs weren’t all symptomatic, but a great percentage of them got sick.” Similar to flu outbreaks in people, some dogs developed complications like pneumonia and others died as a result of the infection. How to Limit or Prevent Transmission Although rare, bird flu and other influenza viruses can be transmitted from dogs to people and vice versa. Viruses are transmitted by being in direct contact with an infected animal, inhaling aerosolized droplets from coughing or sneezing, or touching or licking items contaminated with the virus. Other routes of transmission are contact with feces or discharge from the eyes, mouth, or nose. vm via Getty Images Dogs with no signs of illness can still be infectious and spread the virus. Moreover, “a dog could be exposed to both a bacterium and influenza virus and get that much sicker,” Dr. Attas says. Here are some tips on how to keep your dog safe. Stay Away from Dead Birds and Wildlife Although bird flu isn’t prevalent in dogs, “it’s possible for dogs to get the disease if they come in contact with infected birds,” Dr. Attas explains. Her advice is to keep your dog away from dead birds, bird feces, wild birds, and poultry. Also, dogs should avoid or be very careful in locations where there has been a dead bird or if bird flu has been reported. Keep Vaccines Up-to-Date When there’s a new virus of concern like bird flu, experts recommend vaccinating your dog against similar viruses to minimize their risk of infection. Vaccines can prevent infection or lessen the severity of illness should your dog become infected. As always, it’s best to consult with your veterinarian about appropriate vaccines for your dog. For example, Bordetella bronchiseptica is a bacterium associated with respiratory disease in dogs or what’s known colloquially as kennel cough. Dr. Attas recommends that dogs be adequately vaccinated against Bordetella if they’re going to be in locations with other dogs like doggy daycare, dog parks, dog shows, boarding kennels, and grooming facilities. “That way, they’re less likely to develop a respiratory illness from an infected dog,” she says. Likewise, if there are any cases of canine influenza where you live, she recommends having your dog vaccinated. In the rare event, your dog is infected with bird flu, “there may be some cross immunity from another influenza vaccine, although I have no scientific data to support this,” she says. FatCamera/Getty Images Plus Monitor Outbreaks in Your Area Stay informed about outbreaks using resources that are properly vetted and up-to-date. For finding reliable information online, Dr. Attas recommends visiting the webpage of a local veterinary society, emergency hospital, or veterinary school. You can also find information from the American Veterinary Medical Association. What to Do If Your Dog Becomes Infected If your dog shows signs of respiratory illness like coughing, decreased appetite, and mucous discharge, isolate them from other pets and contact your veterinarian. Sometimes influenza can mimic symptoms of another condition. For instance, coughing can be a sign of heart disease or heartworm disease, Dr. Attas explains. In dogs that attend daycare regularly, coughing may be a sign of a respiratory infection. But, for a senior dog who doesn’t have much contact with other dogs, coughing may point to something else besides influenza. In either case, “if your dog isn’t eating or feeling well, I recommend a veterinary exam and sometimes even a chest X-ray to make sure we’re not dealing with something more serious.” As with any type of influenza, the primary treatment for dogs is supportive care, she says. This includes giving your dog water, food, and antibiotics if they develop a secondary infection. Some dogs may need appetite stimulants or intravenous fluids if they’re not eating. “In general, the best way to protect your dog is to keep them in good health, well-vaccinated, and don’t allow them to be in contact with wild birds, domestic fowl, or dead birds,” she says.</p> https://www.akc.org/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php Get Your Free AKC download Puppy Vaccination Schedule Download and print this vaccination schedule to help keep your puppy on track for its first year of life!

The flock involved 300,800 pullets.The only other instances of HPAI to be reported since that time have been in non-commercial flocks in Florida, with those cases being confirmed in July 24 and August 5. However, according to World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) rules, those cases should not have an impact on international trade.So far in 2024, the following states have had confirmed cases of HPAI in commercial poultry flocks: Minnesota, Michigan, Colorado, Iowa, Texas, South Dakota, Missouri, North Carolina, Nebraska, Indiana, Kansas, California and Wisconsin.The last time the United States went this long without any new HPAI detections in commercial poultry was in 2023. However, that gap between confirmed cases was longer. During that year, two commercial turkey flocks were affected on April 19, with one of those in North Dakota and the other in South Dakota. After those two cases were confirmed, the next case of HPAI in a U.S. commercial flock was not confirmed until another South Dakota flock was infected on October 4.Elsewhere in North America, Canada has not had any confirmed cases of HPAI in commercial poultry since February 19, 2024. Mexico’s last case of HPAI in a commercial flock was reported on October 28, 2023.View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.

However, the potential outbreak of avian influenza A, commonly known as bird flu, in mammal species – including humans – poses a substantial public health threat.Mutations help bird flu cross species barriersThe Cusack group at EMBL Grenoble has been focusing on the replication processes of influenza viruses, and their latest study sheds light on the mutations that allow the avian influenza virus to replicate within mammalian cells.Certain strains of avian influenza can cause severe disease and mortality, but key biological differences between birds and mammals usually prevent these viruses from spreading to other species. How does bird flu infect mammal species?To infect mammals, the avian influenza virus must overcome two primary barriers: it must gain the ability to enter mammalian cells and replicate within them. To trigger an epidemic or pandemic, the virus must also evolve to transmit effectively between humans.Unfortunately, incidents of avian influenza infecting wild and domestic mammals are becoming increasingly common. A particularly concerning development is the recent infection of dairy cows in the United States by an avian H5N1 strain, which risks becoming endemic in cattle. This development could facilitate the virus’s adaptation to humans, with a few cases of human transmission already reported, though these have so far resulted in only mild symptoms.Enzyme responsible for virus replication Central to this process is the viral polymerase, an enzyme responsible for the virus’s replication within host cells. This versatile protein can rearrange itself to perform various functions during the infection process, including transcription – where viral RNA is copied into messenger RNA to produce viral proteins – and replication, where copies of the viral RNA are created to package into new viruses.Studying viral replication is challenging because it involves two viral polymerases and a host cell protein called ANP32. These three proteins form the replication complex, a molecular machine essential for replication. ANP32 acts as a stabilizer for certain cellular proteins, thanks to its long acidic tail. Although ANP32’s critical role in influenza virus replication was identified in 2015, its precise function remained unclear until now.Polymerases perform distinct functions The new study, published in Nature Communications, reveals that ANP32 serves as a bridge between the two viral polymerases – replicase and encapsidase. These polymerases take on different conformations to perform distinct functions: replicase is involved in creating copies of viral RNA, while encapsidase helps package these copies into a protective coating, with the aid of ANP32.ANP32’s tail plays a crucial role in stabilizing the replication complex, enabling its formation within the host cell. Interestingly, while the core of the ANP32 protein is similar in birds and mammals, the tail differs significantly. This difference explains why avian influenza viruses struggle to replicate in mammals and humans.“The key difference between avian and human ANP32 is a 33-amino-acid insertion in the avian tail, and the polymerase has to adapt to this difference,” explained Benoît Arragain, a postdoctoral fellow in the Cusack group and first author of the study. “For the avian-adapted polymerase to replicate in human cells, it must acquire certain mutations to be able to use human ANP32.”Insights into the influenza replication complexTo delve deeper into this process, Arragain and his collaborators obtained the structure of the replicase and encapsidase conformations of a human-adapted avian influenza polymerase from the H7N9 strain while interacting with human ANP32. This structural information pinpoints the amino acids crucial for forming the replication complex and identifies the mutations that could allow avian influenza polymerase to adapt to mammalian cells.These findings were made possible through in vitro experiments conducted at EMBL Grenoble, utilizing the Eukaryotic Expression Facility, the ISBG biophysical platform, and the cryo-electron microscopy platform via the Partnership for Structural Biology. “We also collaborated with the Naffakh group at the Institut Pasteur, who carried out cellular experiments,” Arragain added. “Additionally, we obtained the structure of the human type B influenza replication complex, which closely resembles that of influenza A. The cellular experiments confirmed our structural data.”These new insights into the influenza replication complex are valuable for studying polymerase mutations in other similar avian influenza strains. The structure obtained from the H7N9 strain can be adapted to study other strains such as H5N1.Broader implications of the study “The threat of a new pandemic caused by highly pathogenic, human-adapted avian influenza strains with a high mortality rate needs to be taken seriously,” said Stephen Cusack, EMBL Grenoble Senior Scientist and study leader, who has been studying influenza viruses for 30 years. “One of the key responses to this threat includes monitoring mutations in the virus in the field. Knowing this structure allows us to interpret these mutations and assess if a strain is on the path of adaptation to infect and transmit between mammals.”These findings are also significant for the long-term development of anti-influenza drugs, as there are currently no existing drugs that specifically target the replication complex. “But it’s just the beginning. What we want to do next is to understand how the replication complex works dynamically, in other words, to know in more detail how it actively performs replication,” Cusack concluded. —–Like what you read?

PDF FILE After several months of respite, the French poultry industry is once again grappling with the resurgence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). This recent outbreak, detected in August 2024, marks the return of a virus that had been absent since January 2024. The reappearance of HPAI in France underscores the persistent threat that avian influenza poses to poultry farming and the broader agricultural sector. Background and recent developments France has a long history of battling avian influenza, with significant outbreaks occurring in recent years. The country had declared itself free of avian influenza in August 2023, following a period of rigorous control measures and vaccination campaigns. However, the virus’s return highlights the challenges in maintaining disease-free status in a globalized world where animal movement and trade are constant. The latest outbreak was identified in a commercial poultry farm in the northwestern region of Brittany, specifically in Ille-et-Vilaine. This region, known for its dense poultry farming, is particularly vulnerable to the spread of avian influenza. The detection of the virus has prompted immediate action from French agricultural authorities to contain the outbreak and prevent further spread. Impact on the poultry industry The resurgence of avian influenza has significant implications for the French poultry industry. The immediate response involves culling infected flocks, which, while necessary to control the virus, results in substantial economic losses for farmers. Additionally, movement restrictions and biosecurity measures are reinstated, affecting the entire supply chain from production to distribution. The French government has been proactive in its response, leveraging lessons learned from previous outbreaks. Enhanced surveillance, rapid testing, and strict biosecurity protocols are being implemented to mitigate the impact. The Ministry of Agriculture and Food has also emphasized the importance of vaccination as a long-term strategy to protect poultry populations.Continue after advertising. Vaccination efforts and challenges France’s vaccination campaign against avian influenza has been a cornerstone of its disease control strategy. Initiated in late 2023, the campaign aimed to vaccinate millions of birds, particularly ducks, which are highly susceptible to the virus. The initial results were promising, with a significant reduction in the number of outbreaks compared to previous years. However, the recent resurgence of the virus raises questions about the efficacy and coverage of the vaccination program. Experts suggest that while vaccination can reduce the severity and spread of the disease, it is not a foolproof solution. Continuous monitoring and adaptation of vaccination strategies are essential to address emerging strains of the virus. Global context and future outlook The return of avian influenza in France is not an isolated incident. Globally, the poultry industry faces ongoing challenges from various strains of avian influenza. Countries must collaborate on research, surveillance, and response strategies to effectively combat this persistent threat. For France, the focus remains on containing the current outbreak and preventing future occurrences. The government, in collaboration with industry stakeholders, is committed to enhancing biosecurity measures, improving vaccination coverage, and investing in research to develop more effective vaccines. In conclusion, the resurgence of avian influenza in the French poultry industry serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing battle against this formidable virus. While significant progress has been made in controlling the disease, continuous vigilance and adaptive strategies are crucial to safeguarding the health of poultry populations and ensuring the stability of the agricultural sector.

With over 9,000 H1N1 cases, India has registered 178 deaths by H1N1, also known as swine flu, till the end of July in 2024. The highest number of cases have been recorded in Delhi, Gujarat, and Kerala. The last surge in cases, numbering 13,202, was seen in 2022, which led to 410 deaths.Influenza A or H1N1, also known as swine flu, is a respiratory disease that can affect both pigs and humans. It’s a subtype of the influenza A virus that causes infections in the upper and sometimes lower respiratory tract. The virus spreads through the air by coughing, sneezing, breathing, and talking, and can also enter the body via contaminated surfaces. The virus is contagious from about a day before symptoms appear until about four days after they start. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be able to spread the virus for a slightly longer period of time.Also read | The story of how the deadliest virus to humans was revivedThe first confirmed case of swine flu in India was documented in May 2009, but huge numbers of cases have been reported thereafter. India reported 778 cases of H1N1 in 2021 with 12 deaths; 13,202 cases and 410 deaths in 2022; and 8,125 cases and 129 deaths in 2023.The Central government has been keeping a strict vigil on zoonotic diseases across India. Zoonoses are infectious diseases that can transfer between animals and humans, including rabies, anthrax, influenza (H1N1 and H5N1), Nipah, COVID-19, brucellosis, and tuberculosis. These diseases are caused by various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi.A senior Health Ministry official noted that the prevention and control of zoonotic diseases is achieved by vaccination, good hygiene and animal husbandry practices, and vector control.

CSL Seqirus, a global vaccine company, said Tuesday that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has expanded its recommendation to include the availability of the adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV) for adults 18-64 years of age who have received a solid organ transplant. (Credit: Getty Images) People who have received a solid organ transplant must take immunosuppressive medications for life and may experience more severe symptoms from the flu. ACIP's decision is in response to the high risk of complications from influenza in solid organ transplant recipients, who are known to develop lower respiratory tract illnesses, including pneumonia, in 22-49 percent of cases, and 69 percent of those who get the flu are hospitalized, 11 percent of whom are admitted to the intensive care unit, 8 percent require ventilators, and 3 percent die within 30 days. ACIP analyzed nine studies that compared the effectiveness of vaccination with an adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3) and a high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) vs. a standard-dose vaccine (SD-IIV) in recipients who were at least six months post-transplant for adequate protection against influenza, particularly among those who had undergone a solid organ transplant. The results confirmed that aIIV and HD-IIV provided better immune responses than SD-IIV in recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Based on these studies and analyses, ACIP recommends aIIV3 and HD-IIV3 vaccination for SOT recipients aged 18-64 who receive immunosuppressive drug therapy.
