Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. For each recipient, a licensed and age-appropriate vaccine should be used.With the exception of vaccination for adults aged ≥65 years, ACIP makes no preferential recommendation for a specific vaccine when more than one licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate vaccine is available. All seasonal influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2022–23 season are quadrivalent, containing hemagglutinin (HA) derived from one influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, one influenza A(H3N2) virus, one influenza B/Victoria lineage virus, and one influenza B/Yamagata lineage virus. Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4s), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) are expected to be available. Trivalent influenza vaccines are no longer available, but data that involve these vaccines are included for reference. Influenza vaccines might be available as early as July or August, but for most persons who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season, vaccination should ideally be offered during September or October. However, vaccination should continue after October and throughout the season as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. For most adults (particularly adults aged ≥65 years) and for pregnant persons in the first or second trimester, vaccination during July and August should be avoided unless there is concern that vaccination later in the season might not be possible. Certain children aged 6 months through 8 years need 2 doses; these children should receive the first dose as soon as possible after vaccine is available, including during July and August. Vaccination during July and August can be considered for children of any age who need only 1 dose for the season and for pregnant persons who are in the third trimester if vaccine is available during those months. Updates described in this report reflect discussions during public meetings of ACIP that were held on October 20, 2021; January 12, 2022; February 23, 2022; and June 22, 2022. Primary updates to this report include the following three topics: 1) the composition of 2022–23 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines; 2) updates to the description of influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2022–23 season, including one influenza vaccine labeling change that occurred after the publication of the 2021–22 ACIP influenza recommendations; and 3) updates to the recommendations concerning vaccination of adults aged ≥65 years. First, the composition of 2022–23 U.S. influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria lineage components. U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell culture–based or recombinant vaccines); an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for cell culture–based or recombinant vaccines); an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus; and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. Second, the approved age indication for the cell culture–based inactivated influenza vaccine, Flucelvax Quadrivalent (ccIIV4), was changed in October 2021 from ≥2 years to ≥6 months. Third, recommendations for vaccination of adults aged ≥65 years have been modified. ACIP recommends that adults aged ≥65 years preferentially receive any one of the following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines: quadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), or quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4). If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used. This report focuses on recommendations for the use of vaccines for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza during the 2022–23 influenza season in the United States. A brief summary of the recommendations and a link to the most recent Background Document containing additional information are available at: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/flu.html. These recommendations apply to U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines used according to Food and Drug Administration–licensed indications. Updates and other information are available from CDC’s influenza website (https://www.cdc.gov/flu). Vaccination and health care providers should check this site periodically for additional information. Top View LargerCloseDownload Image[JPG] Introduction Influenza viruses typically circulate annually in the United States, most commonly from the late fall through the early spring. Most persons who become ill after influenza virus infection recover without serious complications or sequelae. However, influenza can be associated with serious illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, particularly among older adults, very young children, pregnant persons, and persons of all ages with certain chronic medical conditions (1–7). Influenza also is an important cause of missed work and school (8–10). Routine annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications has been recommended by CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2010 (11). Vaccination provides important protection from influenza illness and its potential complications. The effectiveness of influenza vaccination varies depending on several factors, such as the age and health of the recipient; the type of vaccine administered; the types, subtypes (for influenza A), and lineages (for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses; and the degree of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in the vaccine (12). During each of the six influenza seasons from 2010–11 through 2015–16, influenza vaccination prevented an estimated 1.6–6.7 million illnesses, 790,000–3.1 million outpatient medical visits, 39,000–87,000 hospitalizations, and 3,000–10,000 respiratory and circulatory deaths each season in the United States (13). During the severe 2017–18 season, notable for an unusually long duration of widespread high influenza activity throughout the United States and higher rates of outpatient visits and hospitalizations compared with recent seasons, vaccination prevented an estimated 7.1 million illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits, 109,000 hospitalizations, and 8,000 deaths (14), despite an overall estimated vaccine effectiveness of 38% (62% against influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 viruses, 22% against influenza A[H3N2] viruses, and 50% against influenza B viruses) (14). Influenza circulated at historically low levels in the United States and globally during the 2020–21 influenza season (15). This was coincident with widespread implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., masking, social distancing, and suspension of in-person work and school) intended to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). Influenza activity increased during the 2021–22 season, although severity indicators (e.g., influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths) were overall lower than in recent previous seasons (16). Timing, intensity, and severity of the 2022–23 influenza season cannot be predicted. Influenza vaccination remains an important tool for the prevention of potentially severe respiratory illness, which might decrease stress on the U.S. health care system during ongoing circulation of SARS-CoV-2. Guidance for vaccine planning during the COVID-19 pandemic is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html. This report updates the 2021–22 ACIP recommendations regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines (17) and provides recommendations and guidance for vaccination providers regarding the use of influenza vaccines in the United States for the 2022–23 season. Various formulations of influenza vaccines are available (Table 1). Contraindications and precautions for the use of influenza vaccines are summarized (Tables 2 and 3). Abbreviations are used in this report to denote the various types of vaccines (Box). This report focuses on recommendations and guidance for the use of seasonal influenza vaccines for the prevention and control of influenza during the 2022–23 season in the United States. A summary of these recommendations and a Background Document containing additional information on influenza, influenza-associated illness, and influenza vaccines are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/flu.html. Top Methods ACIP provides annual recommendations for the use of influenza vaccines for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza in the United States. The ACIP Influenza Work Group meets by teleconference once to twice per month throughout the year. Work group membership includes several voting members of ACIP, representatives of ACIP liaison organizations, and consultants. Discussions include topics such as influenza surveillance, vaccine effectiveness and safety, vaccination coverage, program feasibility, cost effectiveness, and vaccine supply. Presentations are requested from invited experts, and published and unpublished data are discussed. The Background Document that supplements this report is updated periodically to reflect recent additions to the literature related to recommendations made in previous seasons and minor changes in guidance for the use of influenza vaccines (e.g., guidance for timing of vaccination and other programmatic issues, guidance for dosage in specific populations, guidance for selection of vaccines for specific populations that are already recommended for vaccination, and changes that reflect use that is consistent with indications and prescribing information licensed by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]). The summary included in the Background Document for such topics is not a systematic review; it is intended to provide an overview of current literature, with updated articles being identified primarily through a broad search for English-language articles on influenza and influenza vaccines. Typically, systematic review and evaluation of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (18) are performed for new recommendations or substantial changes in the current recommendations (e.g., expansion of the recommendation for influenza vaccination to new populations not previously recommended for vaccination or potential preferential recommendations for specific vaccines). Systematic review, GRADE, and the ACIP Evidence to Recommendations Framework were used in the development of the updated recommendations for influenza vaccination of adults aged ≥65 years discussed in this document. Primary updates and changes to the recommendations described in this report include 1) the vaccine virus composition for 2022–23 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines; 2) updates to the description of influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2022–23 season, including one influenza vaccine labeling change that occurred after the publication of the 2021–22 ACIP influenza recommendations; and 3) updates to the recommendations concerning vaccination of adults aged ≥65 years. Information relevant to these changes includes the following: Recommendations for the composition of Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines are made by the World Health Organization (WHO), which organizes a consultation, usually in February of each year. Surveillance data are reviewed, and candidate vaccine viruses are discussed. Information about the WHO meeting on February 25, 2022, for selection of the 2022–23 Northern Hemisphere vaccine viruses is available at https://www.who.intews/item/25-02-2022-recommendations-announced-for-influenza-vaccine-composition-for-the-2022-2023-northern-hemisphere-influenza-season. Subsequently, FDA, which has regulatory authority over vaccines in the United States, convenes a meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). This committee considers the recommendations of WHO, reviews and discusses similar data, and makes a final decision regarding vaccine virus composition of influenza vaccines licensed and marketed in the United States. Materials from the VRBPAC discussion on March 3, 2022, during which the composition of the 2022–23 U.S. influenza vaccines was discussed, are available at https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-march-3-2022-meeting-announcement. Regarding recommendations concerning newly licensed influenza vaccines and changes to the licensed indications for existing vaccines, ACIP relies on FDA for review of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy and effectiveness data pertaining to licensure and labeling of influenza vaccines. Vaccines that are expected to be available for the 2022–23 season are described (see Vaccines Available for the 2022–23 Season) (Table 1). Regulatory information pertinent to the change in age indication for Flucelvax Quadrivalent discussed in this report is available at https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/flucelvax-quadrivalent. Regarding updated recommendations for influenza vaccines for adults aged ≥65 years, a summary of the review of evidence on this topic is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acipecs/grade/influenza-older-adults.html. A summary of the ACIP Evidence to Recommendations Framework for this discussion is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acipecs/grade/influenza-older-adults-etr.html . Top Primary Changes and Updates Routine annual influenza vaccination of all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications continues to be recommended. Primary updates in this report include the following: The composition of the 2022–23 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria components. For the 2022–23 season, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain hemagglutinin (HA) derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell culture–based and recombinant vaccines); an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for cell culture–based or recombinant vaccines); an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus; and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. Influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2022–23 season, their age indications, and their presentations are described (Table 1). Afluria Quadrivalent is not expected to be available in a 0.25-mL prefilled syringe presentation. When using Afluria Quadrivalent for children aged 6 through 35 months (who require a 0.25-mL dose), the dose must be obtained from a multidose vial. One labeling change is described. In October 2021, FDA granted approval for the use of Flucelvax Quadrivalent (cell culture–based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [ccIIV4]) for children aged 6 months through <2 years. As of March 2021, Flucelvax Quadrivalent had been approved for persons aged ≥2 years. Approval for children aged 6 months through <2 years was based on results of a randomized, observer-blind study that compared immunogenicity and safety of Flucelvax Quadrivalent with that of a licensed comparator IIV4 among 2,402 children aged 6 through 47 months, of whom 894 were aged 6 through 23 months. Flucelvax Quadrivalent is now approved for persons aged ≥6 months. On the basis of review of evidence concerning high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV), and MF59-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV), recommendations for influenza vaccination of persons aged ≥65 years have been modified. ACIP recommends that adults aged ≥65 years preferentially receive any one of the following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines: quadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), or quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4). If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used. Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard-dose vaccines (60 µg for HD-IIV4 and 45 µg for RIV4, compared with 15 µg for standard-dose inactivated vaccines). Adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4) contains MF59 adjuvant. Top Recommendations for the Use of Influenza Vaccines, 2022–23 Groups Recommended for Vaccination Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. Recommendations regarding timing of vaccination, considerations for specific populations, the use of specific vaccines, and contraindications and precautions are summarized in the sections that follow. Timing of Vaccination Because timing of the onset, peak, and decline of influenza activity varies, the ideal time to start vaccinating cannot be predicted each season. Decisions about timing necessitate balancing considerations regarding this unpredictability of the influenza season, possible waning of vaccine-induced immunity over the course of a season, and programmatic considerations. Influenza vaccines might be available as early as July or August; however, vaccination during these months is not recommended for most groups because of the possible waning of immunity over the course of the influenza season (19–32). For most persons who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season, vaccination should ideally be offered during September or October. However, vaccination should continue after October and throughout the influenza season as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. Considerations for timing of vaccination include the following: For most adults (particularly adults aged ≥65 years) and for pregnant persons in the first or second trimester: Vaccination during July and August should be avoided unless there is concern that vaccination later in the season might not be possible. Children who require 2 doses: Certain children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine for the season (see Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years: Number of Influenza Vaccine Doses) (Figure). These children should receive their first dose as soon as possible (including during July and August, if vaccine is available) to allow the second dose (which must be administered ≥4 weeks later) to be received, ideally, by the end of October. Children who require only 1 dose: Vaccination during July and August can be considered for children of any age who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season. While waning of immunity after vaccination over the course of the season has been observed among all age groups (19–32), there are fewer published studies reporting results specifically among children (19–22). Moreover, children in this group might visit health care providers during the late summer months for medical examinations before the start of school. Vaccination can be considered at this time because it represents a vaccination opportunity. Pregnant persons in the third trimester: Vaccination during July and August can be considered for pregnant persons who are in the third trimester because vaccination might reduce risk for influenza illness in their infants during the first months after birth, when they are too young to receive influenza vaccine (33–36). For pregnant persons in the first or second trimester during July and August, waiting to vaccinate until September or October is preferable, unless there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible. Community vaccination programs should balance maximizing the likelihood of persistence of vaccine-induced protection through the season with avoiding missed opportunities to vaccinate or vaccinating after onset of influenza circulation occurs. Efforts should be structured to optimize vaccination coverage before influenza activity in the community begins. Vaccination should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. To avoid missed opportunities for vaccination, providers should offer vaccination during routine health care visits and hospitalizations. No recommendation is made for revaccination (i.e., providing a booster dose) later in the season of persons who have been fully vaccinated for the season, regardless of when the current season vaccine was received. During the 2022–23 influenza season, SARS-CoV-2 is expected to continue to circulate in the United States, and COVID-19 vaccinations are expected to continue. Current guidance for the administration of COVID-19 vaccines (“Coadministration of COVID-19 vaccines with other vaccines” at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#recommendations) indicates that these vaccines can be administered with influenza vaccines; providers should consult this page for updated information. Guidance for vaccine planning during the COVID-19 pandemic is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html. Optimally, vaccination should occur before onset of influenza activity in the community. However, because timing of the onset, peak, and decline of influenza activity varies, the ideal time to start vaccinating cannot be predicted each season. Moreover, more than one outbreak might occur in a community in a single year. In the United States, localized outbreaks indicating the start of seasonal influenza activity can occur as early as October. However, in 29 (76%) of 38 influenza seasons from 1982–83 through 2019–20, peak influenza activity (which often is close to the midpoint of influenza activity for the season) has not occurred until January or later, and in 23 (61%) seasons, the peak was in February or later (37). Activity peaked in February in 17 (45%) of these seasons (37). An increasing number of observational studies (19–32) have reported decreases in vaccine effectiveness with increasing time postvaccination within a single influenza season. Waning effects have not been observed consistently across age groups, influenza viruses (types, subtypes, and lineages), or seasons. Certain studies suggest waning occurs to a greater degree against influenza A(H3N2) viruses than against influenza A(H1N1) or influenza B viruses (26,27). This effect also might vary with recipient age; in certain studies, waning was more pronounced among older adults (19,23,26,30,32) and younger children (19). Relatively fewer reports include results specific to children (19–22); findings suggestive of waning have been reported in certain studies (19–21) but not others (22). Rates of decline in vaccine effectiveness also varied. A multiseason (2011–12 through 2014–15) analysis from the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (U.S. Flu VE) Network found that vaccine effectiveness decreased by approximately 7% per month for influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B and 6%–11% per month for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (25). Vaccine effectiveness remained greater than zero for at least 5–6 months after vaccination. In the Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) during the 2015–16 through 2018–19 seasons, vaccine effectiveness against influenza-associated hospitalizations declined by approximately 8%–9% per month for all adults and approximately 10%–11% per month for those aged ≥65 years (32). An analysis of the 2010–11 through 2013–14 seasons noted estimated effectiveness ranging from 54% to 67% during days 0–180 postvaccination; estimated vaccine effectiveness was not significant during the period between days 181 and 365 (20). A third multiseason analysis (2010–11 through 2014–15) conducted in Europe noted a decline in vaccine effectiveness to 0% at 111 days postvaccination against influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Vaccine effectiveness against influenza B viruses decreased more slowly, and vaccine effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses remained roughly stable at 50%–55% throughout the influenza season (27). A meta-analysis of 14 studies examining waning of influenza vaccine effectiveness using the test-negative design found a significant decline in effectiveness within 180 days after vaccination against influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B but not against influenza A(H1N1) (38). In addition to the factors observed to be associated with waning immunity across studies, observed decreases in protection might be at least in part attributable to bias, unmeasured confounding, or the late-season emergence of antigenic drift variants of influenza viruses that are less well-matched to the vaccine viruses. Varying data concerning the presence and rate of waning immunity after influenza vaccination, coupled with the unpredictable timing of the influenza season each year, prevent determination of an optimal time to vaccinate. Programmatic issues also are a consideration. Although delaying vaccination might result in greater immunity later in the season, deferral also might result in missed opportunities to vaccinate as well as difficulties in vaccinating a population within a more constrained period. The potential contributions of these factors among persons aged ≥65 years have been assessed using a simulated mathematical model examining various scenarios of vaccination timing, timing of onset of the influenza season, vaccine effectiveness, and rate of waning (39). In this model, during an influenza season beginning in October and peaking in January, delaying vaccination until October resulted in more hospitalizations if >14% of persons aged ≥65 years who would have been vaccinated in August or September failed to get vaccinated. However, these predictions varied considerably with assumed timing of season onset, rate of waning immunity, and vaccine effectiveness. Vaccination efforts should continue throughout the season because the duration of the influenza season varies, and influenza activity might not occur in certain communities until February, March, or later. Providers should offer influenza vaccine routinely, and organized vaccination campaigns should continue throughout the influenza season, including after influenza activity has begun in the community. Although vaccination by the end of October is recommended, vaccine administered in December or later, even if influenza activity has already begun, might be beneficial in most influenza seasons. Providers should offer influenza vaccination to unvaccinated persons who have already become ill with influenza during the season because the vaccine might protect them against other circulating influenza viruses. Guidance for Influenza Vaccination in Specific Populations and Situations Populations at Higher Risk for Medical Complications Attributable to Severe Influenza All persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications should be vaccinated annually. However, vaccination to prevent influenza is particularly important for persons who are at increased risk for severe illness and complications from influenza and for influenza-related outpatient, emergency department, or hospital visits. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on vaccination of persons at higher risk for medical complications attributable to severe influenza who do not have contraindications. These persons include the following (no hierarchy is implied by order of listing): All children aged 6 through 59 months. All persons aged ≥50 years. Adults and children who have chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (excluding isolated hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus). Persons who are immunocompromised due to any cause (including but not limited to immunosuppression caused by medications or HIV infection). Persons who are or will be pregnant during the influenza season. Children and adolescents (aged 6 months through 18 years) who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection. Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. American Indian or Alaska Native persons. Persons who are extremely obese (body mass index ≥40 for adults). An IIV4 or RIV4 (as appropriate for the recipient’s age) is suitable for persons in all risk groups. LAIV4 is not recommended for certain populations, including certain of these listed groups. Contraindications and precautions for the use of LAIV4 are noted (Tables 2 and 3). Persons Who Live with or Care for Persons at Higher Risk for Influenza-Related Complications All persons aged ≥6 months without contraindications should be vaccinated annually. However, emphasis also should be placed on vaccination of persons who live with or care for those who are at increased risk for medical complications attributable to severe influenza. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on administering vaccination to persons at higher risk for influenza-related complications as well as persons who live with or care for such persons, including the following: Health care personnel, including all paid and unpaid persons working in health care settings who have the potential for exposure to patients or to infectious materials. These personnel might include but are not limited to physicians, nurses, nursing assistants, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, therapists, technicians, emergency medical service personnel, dental personnel, pharmacists, laboratory personnel, autopsy personnel, students and trainees, contractual staff persons, and others not directly involved in patient care but who might be exposed to infectious agents (e.g., clerical, dietary, housekeeping, laundry, security, maintenance, administrative, and billing staff persons and volunteers). ACIP guidance for vaccination of health care personnel has been published previously (40). Household contacts (including children aged ≥6 months) and caregivers of children aged ≤59 months (<5 years) and adults aged ≥50 years, particularly contacts of children aged <6 months. Household contacts (including children aged ≥6 months) and caregivers of persons with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza. Health care personnel and persons who are contacts of persons in these groups (with the exception of contacts of severely immunocompromised persons who require a protected environment) may receive any influenza vaccine that is otherwise indicated. Persons who care for severely immunocompromised persons requiring a protected environment should not receive LAIV4. ACIP and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) have previously recommended that health care personnel who receive LAIV should avoid providing care for severely immunocompromised persons requiring a protected environment for 7 days after vaccination and that hospital visitors who have received LAIV should avoid contact with such persons for 7 days after vaccination (41). However, such persons need not be restricted from caring for or visiting less severely immunocompromised persons. Influenza Vaccination of Persons with COVID-19 Vaccination of persons who have tested positive for COVID-19 or who are in quarantine after an exposure should include multiple considerations, such as whether bringing the person into a vaccination setting could expose others to COVID-19, whether the person is acutely ill and the severity of the illness, the presence of risk factors for severe influenza illness, the likelihood of being able to vaccinate at a later date, and the desire to avoid confusing postvaccination symptoms with those of COVID-19. Usually, persons who are in quarantine or isolation should not be brought to a vaccination setting if doing so could expose others to COVID-19. For those who have moderate or severe COVID-19, vaccination should usually be deferred until they have recovered, which is consistent with ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization (42). For persons who have mild or asymptomatic COVID-19, further deferral might be considered to avoid confusing COVID-19 symptoms with postvaccination reactions. Because recommendations for vaccination of this population might continue to evolve, clinicians should check CDC guidance (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html) for up-to-date information. Children Aged 6 Through 35 Months: Influenza Vaccine Dose Volumes Five IIV4s are approved for children aged ≥6 months (Table 1). Four of these vaccines are egg based (Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, Flulaval Quadrivalent, and Fluzone Quadrivalent), and one is cell culture based (Flucelvax Quadrivalent). For these vaccines, the approved dose volumes for children aged 6 through 35 months are as follows (Table 4): Afluria Quadrivalent: 0.25 mL per dose. However, 0.25-mL prefilled syringes are not expected to be available for the 2022–23 season. For children aged 6 through 35 months, a 0.25-mL dose must be obtained from a multidose vial (43). Fluarix Quadrivalent: 0.5 mL per dose. Flucelvax Quadrivalent: 0.5 mL per dose. FluLaval Quadrivalent: 0.5 mL per dose. Fluzone Quadrivalent: either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose. Per the package insert, each dose may be given at either volume (44); however, the 0.25-mL prefilled syringes are no longer available. For all of these IIV4s, persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose. Alternatively, healthy children aged ≥24 months (≥2 years) may receive LAIV4, 0.2 mL intranasally (0.1 mL in each nostril). LAIV4 is not recommended for certain populations and is not approved for children aged <2 years (see Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of LAIV4) (Table 2). RIV4 is not approved for children aged <18 years. High-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4) and adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4) are not approved for persons aged <65 years. Care should be taken to administer an age-appropriate vaccine at the appropriate volume for each dose. For IIV4s, the recommended volume may be administered from a prefilled syringe containing the appropriate volume (as supplied by the manufacturer), a single-dose vial, or a multidose vial. Single-dose vials should be used for only 1 dose, and multidose vials should be used only for the maximum number of doses specified in the package insert. Any vaccine remaining in a vial after the maximum number of doses has been removed should be discarded, regardless of the volume of the doses obtained or any remaining volume in the vial. Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years: Number of Influenza Vaccine Doses Children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine administered a minimum of 4 weeks apart during their first season of vaccination for optimal protection (45–48). Determination of the number of doses needed is based on 1) the child’s age at the time of the first dose of 2022–23 influenza vaccine and 2) the number of doses of influenza vaccine received in previous influenza seasons. For children aged 6 months through 8 years, the number of doses of influenza vaccine needed for the 2022–23 influenza season is determined as follows (Figure): Those who have previously received ≥2 total doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine ≥4 weeks apart before July 1, 2022, require only 1 dose for the 2022–23 season. The 2 previous doses of influenza vaccine do not need to have been received in the same season or consecutive seasons. Those who have not previously received ≥2 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine ≥4 weeks apart before July 1, 2022, or whose previous influenza vaccination history is unknown, require 2 doses for the 2022–23 season. The interval between the 2 doses should be ≥4 weeks. Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses of influenza vaccine should receive their first dose as soon as possible (including during July and August, if vaccine is available) to allow the second dose (which must be administered ≥4 weeks later) to be received, ideally, by the end of October. Two doses are recommended even if the child turns age 9 years between receipt of dose 1 and dose 2. Adults and children aged ≥9 years need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the 2022–23 season. Pregnant Persons Pregnant and postpartum persons have been observed to be at higher risk for severe illness and complications from influenza, particularly during the second and third trimesters. Influenza vaccination during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk for respiratory illness and influenza among pregnant and postpartum persons as well as infants during the first several months of life (33–36,49). ACIP and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that persons who are pregnant or who might be pregnant or postpartum during the influenza season receive influenza vaccine (50). Any licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4 may be used. LAIV4 should not be used during pregnancy but can be used postpartum. Influenza vaccine can be administered at any time during pregnancy (i.e., during any trimester), before and during the influenza season. Early vaccination (i.e., during July and August) can be considered for persons who are in the third trimester during these months if vaccine is available because this can provide protection for the infant during the first months of life when they are too young to be vaccinated. Although experience with the use of IIVs during pregnancy is substantial, data specifically reflecting administration of influenza vaccines during the first trimester are limited (see Safety of Influenza Vaccines in the supplementary Background Document). Most studies have not noted an association between influenza vaccination and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) (51–61). One observational Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) study conducted during the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons noted an association between receipt of IIV containing influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and risk for miscarriage in the 28 days after receipt of IIV, when an H1N1pdm09-containing vaccine also had been received the previous season (62). However, in a larger VSD follow-up study, IIV was not associated with an increased risk for miscarriage during the 2012–13, 2013–14, and 2014–15 seasons, regardless of previous season vaccination (63). Substantially less experience exists with more recently licensed IIVs (e.g., quadrivalent and cell culture–based vaccines) during pregnancy than with previously available products. For RIV (available as RIV3 from 2013–14 through 2017–18 and as RIV4 since 2017–18), data are limited to reports of pregnancies occurring incidentally during clinical trials, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports, and pregnancy registries. Pregnancy registries and surveillance studies exist for certain products, for which information can be found in package inserts. Older Adults ACIP recommends that adults aged ≥65 years preferentially receive any one of the following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines: quadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), or quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4). If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be administered. Older adults (aged ≥65 years) are at increased risk for severe influenza-associated illness, hospitalization, and death compared with younger persons (4,16,64). Influenza vaccines are often less effective in this population (65). HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have been evaluated in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs in this age group. Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA antigen per virus compared with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs (60 µg for HD-IIV4 and 45 µg for RIV4, compared with 15 µg for standard-dose inactivated vaccines). The adjuvanted vaccine contains 15 µg of HA per virus, similarly to nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, but contains the adjuvant MF59. HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (66–68) and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code–defined (rather than laboratory-confirmed) outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (69–79). Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations. The size of this relative benefit has varied from season to season and is not seen in all studies in all seasons, making it difficult to generalize the findings to all or most seasons. Studies directly comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with one another are few and do not support a conclusion that any one of these vaccines is consistently superior to the others across seasons (70–72,79–81). Of note, for the 2020–21 season, quadrivalent formulations of high-dose (HD-IIV4) and adjuvanted (aIIV4) influenza vaccines were introduced. Trivalent formulations of these vaccines are no longer available. Data summarizing comparisons of these newer quadrivalent formulations relative to nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4s against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes are not yet available. Literature concerning the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs and of each of these three vaccines with one another was reviewed, focusing on published studies performed during nonpandemic influenza seasons. A description of the systematic review and GRADE is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acipecs/grade/influenza-older-adults.html. An abbreviated summary follows. Randomized Studies Comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with Nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs: Prevention of Influenza Illnesses. Randomized studies comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza illness are few in number and were conducted over few influenza seasons. HD-IIV3 was more effective than SD-IIV3 in prevention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or culture-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI) in a two-season randomized study conducted among 32,000 persons aged ≥65 years (relative efficacy: 24%; 95% CI: 10%–36%; certainty level: 1, high) (66). Two single-season randomized trials of RIV versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV, one a comparison of RIV3 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 that assessed culture-confirmed ILI (67) and the other a comparison of RIV4 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 that examined PCR-confirmed ILI (68), did not demonstrate relative benefit of RIV among those aged ≥65 years (pooled relative efficacy: 18%; 95% CI: −17% to 43%; certainty level: 2, moderate). The larger of these two studies noted a relative benefit of RIV4 over nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 in prevention of PCR-confirmed influenza among the full study population of persons aged ≥50 years (relative efficacy: 30%; 95% CI: 10%–47%) as well as against culture-confirmed ILI among those aged ≥65 years (relative efficacy: 42%; 95% CI: 9%–65%) (68). No data are available from randomized trials of aIIV versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes during nonpandemic influenza seasons. Randomized Studies Comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with Nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs: Prevention of Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations and Other Serious Events. No data are available from randomized trials evaluating prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations as a primary outcome. In a secondary analysis from a two-season randomized trial of HD-IIV3 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 assessing serious adverse events (SAEs) (including hospitalizations) associated with laboratory confirmation of influenza performed outside of the study (82) and a post hoc analysis of pneumonia- and influenza-related hospitalizations from a randomized study of HD-IIV3 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 (83), there was no difference in risk for these events between the two groups (certainty level: 2, moderate). However, additional data are available from two single-season, cluster-randomized studies conducted among U.S. nursing homes (in which nursing homes were randomized to vaccine groups rather than individual persons) that examined prevention of pneumonia and influenza diagnostic–coded hospitalizations. One such study noted a benefit of HD-IIV3 relative to nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 (adjusted relative risk: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.66–0.95; certainty level: 2, moderate) (84). The second noted a benefit of aIIV3 relative to nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.65–0.96; certainty level: 2, moderate) (85). Observational Studies Comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with Nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs: Prevention of Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations and Deaths. Observational studies comparing HD-IIV and aIIV with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs are more numerous than randomized studies and cover more influenza seasons. Many of these studies assessed diagnostic code–defined (rather than laboratory-confirmed) outcomes. In these studies, an overall modest relative benefit in prevention of diagnostic code–defined influenza-associated hospitalizations has been observed for HD-IIV3 (70–77) and aIIV3 (70–72) versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3s. Relative benefit was not found in every study for all evaluated seasons for either HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Published observational studies of RIV are fewer than for HD-IIV and aIIV. A retrospective analysis of relative effectiveness of RIV4 versus SD-IIV4 against influenza-coded hospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries during the 2019–20 season noted a relative effectiveness of 17% (95% CI: 9%–24%; certainty level: 3, low) (72). Observational studies that address relative benefit in protection against influenza-associated deaths are limited. Two retrospective cohort studies including three influenza seasons noted a relative benefit of HD-IIV3 compared with nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 (69,78) diagnostic code–defined deaths (pooled rate ratio: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57–0.84; certainty level: 3, low). Observational Studies Comparing Effectiveness of HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with One Another. Data reflecting comparisons of HD-IIV, aIIV, and RIV with one another are more limited than comparisons with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs. Observational studies have compared HD-IIV3 versus aIIV3 (70–72,79–81), HD-IIV3 versus RIV4 (72), and aIIV3 versus RIV4 (72). A retrospective cohort analysis noted relative effectiveness of RIV4 compared with HD-IIV3 (relative effectiveness: 11%; 95% CI: 3%–18%; certainty level: 3, low) and with aIIV3 (relative effectiveness: 11%; 95% CI: 3%–17%; certainty level: 3, low); these data covered only a single influenza season. Data do not point to a consistent relative benefit of one of these three influenza vaccines over another across multiple seasons. Safety. In comparative safety studies, certain injection site and systemic reactions were observed more frequently in older persons vaccinated with HD-IIV3 and aIIV3 compared with nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 (86,87). In a randomized trial of RIV4 versus nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4 among persons aged ≥50 years, frequencies of solicited injection site events were similar or lower among RIV4 recipients; frequency of fever was similar between the two vaccines. Frequencies of SAEs were similar between the two groups, and none was judged to be related to a study vaccine (68). One postlicensure randomized clinical trial in the United States evaluated the comparative safety of aIIV3 compared with HD-IIV3 in 757 adults aged ≥65 years (88). For the primary outcome, the proportion of participants who reported moderate to severe injection site pain that limited or prevented activity after aIIV3 (12 participants [3.2%]) was noninferior compared with the proportion reporting this outcome after vaccination with HD-IIV3 (22 participants [5.8%]). No participant sought medical care for a solicited reaction symptom, and none had a SAE determined by study investigators to be related to vaccine within 43 days after vaccination. Immunocompromised Persons ACIP recommends that persons with compromised immunity (including but not limited to persons with congenital and acquired immunodeficiency states, persons who are immunocompromised due to medications, and persons with anatomic and functional asplenia) should receive an age-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4. ACIP recommends that LAIV4 not be used for these groups because of the uncertain but biologically plausible risk for disease attributable to the live vaccine virus. Use of LAIV4 in persons with these and other conditions is discussed in more detail (see Dosage, Administration, Contraindications, and Precautions) (Table 2). Immunocompromised states comprise a heterogeneous range of conditions with varying risks for severe infections. In many instances, limited data are available regarding the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in the setting of specific immunocompromised states (89). Timing of vaccination might be a consideration (e.g., vaccinating during a period either before or after an immunocompromising intervention). The Infectious Diseases Society of America has published detailed guidance for the selection and timing of vaccines for persons with specific immunocompromising conditions (90). Immune response to influenza vaccines might be blunted in persons with certain conditions, such as congenital immune deficiencies, and in persons receiving cancer chemotherapy or immunosuppressive medications. Persons with a History of Guillain-Barré Syndrome After Influenza Vaccination A history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of a previous dose of any type of influenza vaccine is considered a precaution for influenza vaccination (Table 2). Persons who are not at higher risk for severe influenza complications (see Populations at Higher Risk for Medical Complications Attributable to Severe Influenza) and who are known to have experienced GBS within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination typically should not be vaccinated. As an alternative to vaccination, providers might consider using influenza antiviral chemoprophylaxis for these persons (91). However, the benefits of influenza vaccination might outweigh the possible risks for certain persons who have a history of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of influenza vaccine and who also are at higher risk for severe complications from influenza. Persons with a History of Egg Allergy Most available influenza vaccines, with the exceptions of RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent, licensed for those aged ≥18 years) and ccIIV4 (Flucelvax Quadrivalent, licensed for those aged ≥6 months), are prepared by propagation of virus in embryonated eggs and might contain trace amounts of egg proteins, such as ovalbumin. For persons who report a history of egg allergy, ACIP recommends the following: Persons with a history of egg allergy who have experienced only urticaria (hives) after exposure to egg should receive influenza vaccine. Any licensed, recommended influenza vaccine (i.e., any IIV4, RIV4, or LAIV4) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient’s age and health status can be used. Persons who report having had reactions to egg involving symptoms other than urticaria (e.g., angioedema or swelling, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent vomiting) or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention can similarly receive any licensed, recommended influenza vaccine (i.e., any IIV4, RIV4, or LAIV4) that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health status. If a vaccine other than ccIIV4 or RIV4 is used, the selected vaccine should be administered in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting, including but not necessarily limited to hospitals, clinics, health departments, and physician offices. Vaccine administration should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. All vaccination providers should be familiar with their office emergency plan and be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (42). No postvaccination observation period is recommended specifically for egg-allergic persons. However, ACIP recommends that vaccination providers consider observing patients (seated or supine) for 15 minutes after administration of any vaccine to decrease the risk for injury should syncope occur (42). Persons with Previous Allergic Reactions to Influenza Vaccines As is the case for all vaccines, influenza vaccines contain various components that might cause allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Most influenza vaccine package inserts list among contraindications to their use a history of previous severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine. For ccIIV4 and RIV4, a history of a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine component is listed as a contraindication; no labeled contraindication is specified for a history of allergic reaction to any other influenza vaccine. However, severe allergic reactions, although rare, can occur after influenza vaccination, even among persons with no previous reactions or known allergies. Although vaccine components can be found in package inserts, identifying the causative component without further evaluation (i.e., through evaluation and testing for specific allergies) can be difficult. Severe allergic reactions after vaccination with an RIV have been reported to VAERS, some of which have occurred among persons reporting previous allergic reactions to egg or to influenza vaccines and which might represent a predisposition to development of allergic manifestations in affected persons (92–94). Because these rare but severe allergic reactions can occur, ACIP recommends the following for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of an influenza vaccine (Table 3): For egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4: A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a contraindication to future receipt of all egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4. Each individual egg-based IIV4 and LAIV4 is also contraindicated for persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of that vaccine (excluding egg) (see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). For ccIIV4: A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution for the use of ccIIV4. If ccIIV4 is administered in such instances, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers also can consider consultation with an allergist to help determine the vaccine component responsible for the allergic reaction. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency or to any component of ccIIV4 is a contraindication to future receipt of ccIIV4. For RIV4: A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution for the use of RIV4. If RIV4 is administered in such instances, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consultation with an allergist to help determine the vaccine component responsible for the allergic reaction. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any RIV of any valency or to any component of RIV4 is a contraindication to future receipt of RIV4. Vaccination Issues for Travelers In temperate climate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, influenza activity is seasonal, occurring during approximately October–May in the Northern Hemisphere and April–September in the Southern Hemisphere. In the tropics, influenza might occur throughout the year. Travelers can be exposed to influenza when traveling to an area where influenza is circulating or when traveling as part of large tourist groups (e.g., on cruise ships) that include persons from areas of the world where influenza viruses are circulating (95–98). Travelers who want to reduce their risk for influenza should consider influenza vaccination, preferably at least 2 weeks before departure. In particular, persons who live in the United States and are at higher risk for influenza complications and who were not vaccinated with influenza vaccine during the previous Northern Hemisphere fall or winter should consider receiving influenza vaccination before departure if they plan to travel to the tropics, to the Southern Hemisphere during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season (April–September), or with organized tourist groups or on cruise ships to any location. Persons at higher risk who received the previous season’s influenza vaccine before travel should consult with their health care provider to discuss the risk for influenza and other travel-related diseases before embarking on travel during the summer. All persons (regardless of risk status) who are vaccinated in preparation for travel before the upcoming influenza season’s vaccine is available should receive the current vaccine the following fall or winter. Influenza vaccine formulated for the Southern Hemisphere might differ in viral composition from the Northern Hemisphere vaccine. For persons traveling to the Southern Hemisphere during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season, receipt of a current U.S.-licensed Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulation before departure might be reasonable but might not be feasible because of limited access to or unavailability of Southern Hemisphere formulations in the United States. Most Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulations are not licensed in the United States, and they are typically not commercially available. More information on influenza vaccines and travel is available at https://wwwnc.cdc.govravel/diseases/influenza-seasonal-zoonotic-and-pandemic. Use of Influenza Antiviral Medications Administration of IIV4 or RIV4 to persons receiving influenza antiviral medications for treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza is acceptable. Data concerning vaccination with LAIV4 in the setting of influenza antiviral use are not available. However, influenza antiviral medications might interfere with the action of LAIV4 because this vaccine contains live influenza viruses. The package insert for LAIV4 notes that antiviral agents might reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine if given within the interval from 48 hours before to 14 days after vaccination (99). However, the newer influenza antivirals peramivir and baloxavir have longer half-lives than oseltamivir and zanamivir, approximately 20 hours for peramivir (100) and 79 hours for baloxavir (101), and could interfere with the replication of LAIV4 if administered >48 hours before vaccination. Potential interactions between influenza antivirals and LAIV4 have not been studied, and the ideal intervals between administration of these medications and LAIV4 are not known. Assuming a period of at least 5 half-lives for substantial decrease in drug levels (102), a reasonable assumption is that that peramivir might interfere with the mechanism of LAIV4 if administered from 5 days before through 2 weeks after vaccination and baloxavir might interfere if administered from 17 days before through 2 weeks after vaccination. The interval between influenza antiviral receipt and LAIV4 during which interference might occur could be further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that delay medication clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency). Persons who receive these medications during these periods before or after receipt of LAIV4 should be revaccinated with another appropriate influenza vaccine (e.g., IIV4 or RIV4). Administration of Influenza Vaccines with Other Vaccines IIV4s and RIV4 may be administered simultaneously or sequentially with other inactivated vaccines or live vaccines. Injectable vaccines that are given concomitantly should be administered at separate anatomic sites. LAIV4 can be administered simultaneously with other live or inactivated vaccines. However, if two live vaccines are not given simultaneously, at least 4 weeks should pass after administration of one live vaccine (such as LAIV4) before another live vaccine is administered (42). Current guidance concerning administration of current U.S.-approved or -authorized COVID-19 vaccines indicates that these vaccines may be given with influenza vaccines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html). Providers should be aware of the potential for increased reactogenicity with coadministration and should consult updated CDC guidance as more information becomes available. If administered simultaneously, COVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines that might be more likely to cause an injection site reaction (e.g., aIIV4 or HD-IIV4) should be administered in different limbs, if possible. In an interim analysis of a study of concomitant administration of HD-IIV4 and a booster dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (administered in separate upper arm sites) compared with administration of either vaccine alone among 296 persons aged ≥65 years, overall reactogenicity up to 7 days postvaccination was similar between the coadministration group and the group that received the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine alone; reactogenicity rates in the group receiving HD-IIV4 alone were lower. No SAEs were observed. Immune response was similar between the mRNA COVID-19 and coadministration groups (103). Relatively limited data are available on the concomitant administration of influenza vaccines with other vaccines. Studies of live attenuated zoster vaccine and IIV3 (104) or IIV4 (105) among persons aged ≥50 years noted similar antibody responses whether the two vaccines were administered concomitantly or 4 weeks apart. In certain studies, reduced responses have been noted to 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) (106,107), tetanus antigens (108), and pertussis antigens (108) when coadministered with IIV3 to adults; in most instances, the clinical significance of this is uncertain. Simultaneous administration of IIV4 and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) to persons aged ≥65 years was associated with lower seroprotection rates to one influenza B antigen at 4–6 weeks postvaccination compared with sequential administration 2 weeks apart. Seroprotection was not significantly different between the two groups for any of the four influenza antigens at 6 months postvaccination (109). Reassuring safety profiles have been noted for simultaneous administration of IIVs with live attenuated zoster vaccine (104,105); PCV13 (106,107); PPSV23 (109,110); tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine among adults (108); and Tdap in pregnancy (111). Although increased prevalence of injection site or systemic adverse reactions has been noted with concurrent administration in certain studies, these symptoms have usually been reported to be mild or moderate. Among children aged 6 through 23 months, coadministration of IIV3 and PCV13 was associated with increased risk for fever on the day of vaccination and the day after (i.e., days 0–1 postvaccination) in an observational study conducted during the 2011–12 season (112). A randomized clinical trial during the 2017–18 influenza season suggested that delaying IIV4 administration by 2 weeks in children receiving diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) and PCV13 did not reduce fever prevalence after vaccination (113). Increased risk for febrile seizures in this age group has been noted within days 0–1 after coadministration of IIV with PCV7, PCV13, or DTaP vaccines during the 2006–07 through 2010–11 seasons (114) and with PCV13 during the 2014–15 season (115). Although concerning to parents, most febrile seizures are brief and have a good prognosis (116). After considering the risks and benefits, no changes in the recommendations for administration of these vaccines were made. Surveillance of febrile seizures is ongoing through VAERS, and the VSD annual influenza safety surveillance includes monitoring for seizures after vaccinations. Studies of concomitant administration of LAIV with other vaccines are limited. Concurrent administration of LAIV3 with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccine to children was not associated with diminished immunogenicity of antigens in any of the vaccines in one study (117); diminished response to rubella was observed in another study examining coadministration of LAIV3 and MMR (118). No safety concerns were noted in these studies. In recent years, several vaccines containing nonaluminum adjuvants have been licensed for use in the United States for the prevention of various infectious diseases. These include AS01B (in Shingrix, recombinant zoster subunit vaccine) (119), MF59 (in Fluad Quadrivalent [aIIV4]) (120), and cytosine phosphoguanine oligodeoxynucleotide (in Heplisav-B, a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen vaccine) (121). Data are limited regarding coadministration of these vaccines with other adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines. Coadministration of Shingrix with nonadjuvanted IIV4 has been studied, and no evidence of decreased immunogenicity or safety concerns was noted (122). The immunogenicity and safety of simultaneous or sequential administration of two nonaluminum adjuvant–containing vaccines have not been evaluated, and the ideal interval between such vaccines when given sequentially is not known. In the study of Shingrix and IIV4 (122), most reactogenicity symptoms resolved within 4 days. Because of the limited data on the safety of simultaneous administration of two or more vaccines containing nonaluminum adjuvants and the availability of nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine options, selection of a nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine may be considered in situations in which influenza vaccine and another vaccine containing a nonaluminum adjuvant are to be administered concomitantly. However, influenza vaccination should not be delayed if a specific vaccine is not available. As recommended for all vaccines, vaccines with nonaluminum adjuvants should be administered at separate anatomic sites from other vaccines that are given concomitantly (42). Top Influenza Vaccine Composition and Available Vaccines Influenza Vaccine Composition for the 2022–23 Season All influenza vaccines licensed in the United States will contain components derived from influenza viruses antigenically similar to those recommended by FDA (https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-march-3-2022-meeting-announcement). All influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2022–23 season will be quadrivalent vaccines. For the 2022–23 season, U.S. egg-based influenza vaccines (i.e., vaccines other than ccIIV4 and RIV4) will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus, an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus, and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. For the 2022–23 season, U.S. cell culture–based inactivated (ccIIV4) and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an influenza A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus, an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus, and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. Vaccines Available for the 2022–23 Season Availability of specific types and brands of licensed seasonal influenza vaccines in the United States is determined by the manufacturers of the vaccines. Information presented concerning vaccines expected to be available and their approved indications and usage reflects current knowledge and is subject to change. Various influenza vaccines will be available for the 2022–23 season (Table 1). For many vaccine recipients, more than one type or brand of vaccine might be appropriate within approved indications and ACIP recommendations. A licensed influenza vaccine that is appropriate for the recipient’s age and health status should be used. Specific age indications for licensed influenza vaccines are summarized (Table 1). Current prescribing information should be consulted for authoritative, up-to-date information. Contraindications and precautions for the different types of influenza vaccines are summarized (Tables 2 and 3), as are dose volumes (Table 4). Not all influenza vaccines are likely to be uniformly available in any specific practice setting or geographic locality. Vaccination should not be delayed to obtain a specific product when an appropriate one is available. Within these guidelines and approved indications, ACIP makes no preferential recommendation for the use of any one influenza vaccine over another when more than one licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate vaccine is available, with the exception of selection of influenza vaccines for persons aged ≥65 years (see Older Adults). Since the publication of the previous season’s recommendations, FDA has approved a labeling change for Flucelvax Quadrivalent (see Recent Influenza Vaccine Labeling Changes). Additional new licensures and changes to FDA-approved labeling might occur after publication of this report. As these changes occur and new vaccines become available, they will be reflected in the online version of Table 1, available at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/acip/2022-2023/acip-table.htm. Dosage, Administration, Contraindications, and Precautions Quadrivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccines (IIV4s) Available Vaccines. As in recent seasons, various inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) are expected to be available for 2022–23 (Table 1); all are expected to be quadrivalent (IIV4s). Standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4s are licensed for persons aged as young as 6 months. However, for certain IIV4s, the approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months differs from that for older children and adults (Table 4). Two IIV4s, the MF59-adjuvanted IIV4 (aIIV4) and the high-dose IIV4 (HD-IIV4), are approved for persons aged ≥65 years. Care should be taken to administer the appropriate dose volume of an age-appropriate vaccine to each recipient. Standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4s contain 15 μg of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose (7.5 μg of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.25-mL dose). For 2022–23, this category is expected to include five different vaccines (Table 1). Four of these are egg-based vaccines, and one is a cell culture–based vaccine. All are approved for persons aged ≥6 months. Egg-based and cell culture–based vaccines differ in the substrate in which reference vaccine viruses supplied to the manufacturer are propagated in quantities sufficient to produce the needed number of doses of vaccine. For the IIV4s Afluria Quadrivalent (43), Fluarix Quadrivalent (123), FluLaval Quadrivalent (124), and Fluzone Quadrivalent (44), reference vaccine viruses are propagated in eggs. For Flucelvax Quadrivalent, reference vaccine viruses are propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells instead of eggs (125). Two additional IIV4s that will be available for the 2022–23 season are approved for persons aged ≥65 years. These vaccines are egg based. Quadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent; HD-IIV4) contains 60 μg of HA per vaccine virus (240 μg total) in a 0.7-mL dose (126). Quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluad Quadrivalent; aIIV4) contains 15 μg of HA per vaccine virus (60 μg total) and MF59 adjuvant (120). Dosage and Administration. Standard-dose nonadjuvanted IIV4s are approved for children aged as young as 6 months. Certain of these IIV4s are approved at different dose volumes for very young children than for older children and adults. Care should be taken to administer an age-appropriate vaccine at the approved dose volume for each needed dose (see Children Aged 6 Through 35 Months: Influenza Vaccine Dose Volumes) (Tables 1 and 4): Afluria Quadrivalent: The approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months is 0.25 mL per dose. Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose. Fluarix Quadrivalent: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months. Flucelvax Quadrivalent: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months. FluLaval Quadrivalent: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months. Fluzone Quadrivalent: The approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months is either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose. Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose. If prefilled syringes are not available, the appropriate volume can be administered from a single-dose or multidose vial. If a 0.5-mL single-dose vial is used for a 0.25-mL dose for a child aged 6 through 35 months, only half of the vial volume should be administered, and the remaining half should be discarded. Of note, dose volume is distinct from the number of doses. Children in this age group who require 2 doses for 2022–23 need 2 separate doses administered ≥4 weeks apart, regardless of the specific IIV4 used and volume given for each dose (see Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years: Number of Influenza Vaccine Doses) (Figure). For children aged 36 months (3 years) through 17 years and adults aged ≥18 years, the dose volume for IIV4s is 0.5 mL per dose, with the exception of Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent (HD-IIV4, licensed for persons aged ≥65 years), for which the correct volume is 0.7 mL per dose. If a smaller vaccine dose (e.g., 0.25 mL) is inadvertently administered to a person aged ≥36 months, the remaining volume needed to make a full dose should be administered during the same vaccination visit or, if measuring the needed remaining volume is a challenge, administering a repeat dose at the full volume is acceptable. If the error is discovered later (after the recipient has left the vaccination setting), a full dose should be administered as soon as the recipient can return. Vaccination with a formulation approved for adult use should be counted as a single dose if inadvertently administered to a child. IIV4s are administered intramuscularly (IM). For adults and older children, the deltoid muscle is the preferred site. Infants and younger children should be vaccinated in the anterolateral thigh. Additional specific guidance regarding site selection and needle length for IM injection is provided in the ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization (42). One IIV4, Afluria Quadrivalent, is licensed for IM injection via the PharmaJet Stratis jet injector for persons aged 18 through 64 years (43). Persons in this age group may receive Afluria Quadrivalent via either needle and syringe or this specific jet injection device. Children aged 6 months through 17 years and adults aged ≥65 years should receive this vaccine by needle and syringe only. No other IIV4s are licensed for administration by jet injector. Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of IIV4s. Manufacturer package inserts and updated CDC and ACIP guidance should be consulted for information on contraindications and precautions for individual influenza vaccines. Each IIV, whether egg-based or cell culture–based, has a labeled contraindication for persons with a history of a severe allergic reaction to any component of that vaccine (Table 2). Although egg is a component of all IIV4s other than ccIIV4, ACIP makes specific recommendations for the use of influenza vaccine for persons with egg allergy (see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). All egg-based IIV4s are contraindicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine (any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency). Use of ccIIV4 is contraindicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency. A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution for the use of ccIIV4 (see Persons with Previous Allergic Reactions to Influenza Vaccines) (Tables 2 and 3). If ccIIV4 is administered in such an instance, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consultation with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for the reaction. Information about vaccine components can be found in the package inserts for each vaccine. Prophylactic use of antiviral agents is an option that can be considered for preventing influenza among persons who cannot receive vaccine, particularly for those who are at higher risk for medical complications attributable to severe influenza (91). Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever is a general precaution for vaccination (42). A history of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of a previous dose of influenza vaccine is considered a precaution for the use of all influenza vaccines (Table 2). Quadrivalent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022–23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged ≥18 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell-derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (127). Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 μg of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 μg total). Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of RIV4. RIV4 is contraindicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any RIV of any valency or any component of RIV4. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution for the use of RIV4. If RIV4 is administered in such an instance, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for the reaction. Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever is a general precaution for vaccination (42). A history of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of a previous dose of influenza vaccine is considered a precaution for the use of all influenza vaccines (Table 2). RIV4 is not licensed for children aged <18 years. Quadrivalent Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV4) Available Vaccine. One live attenuated influenza vaccine, FluMist Quadrivalent (LAIV4), is expected to be available during the 2022–23 influenza season. LAIV4 is approved for persons aged 2 through 49 years. LAIV4 contains live attenuated influenza viruses that are propagated in eggs. These viruses are cold adapted (so that they replicate efficiently at 25°C) and temperature sensitive (so that their replication is restricted at higher temperatures, 39°C for influenza A viruses and 37°C for influenza B viruses). These viruses replicate in the nasopharynx, which is necessary to promote an immune response (99). No preference is expressed for LAIV4 versus other influenza vaccines used within specified indications. Dosage and Administration. LAIV4 is administered intranasally using the supplied prefilled, single-use sprayer containing 0.2 mL of vaccine. Approximately 0.1 mL (i.e., half of the total sprayer contents) is sprayed into the first nostril while the recipient is in the upright position. An attached dose-divider clip is removed from the sprayer to permit administration of the second half of the dose into the other nostril. If the recipient sneezes immediately after administration, the dose should not be repeated. However, if nasal congestion is present that might impede delivery of the vaccine to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, deferral of administration should be considered until resolution of the illness, or another appropriate vaccine should be administered instead. Each total dose of 0.2 mL contains 106.5–7.5 fluorescent focus units of each vaccine virus (99). Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of LAIV4. Conditions considered by ACIP to be contraindications and precautions for the use of LAIV4 are summarized (Table 2). These include two labeled contraindications that appear in the package insert (99) and other conditions for which there is uncertain but biologically plausible potential risk associated with live viruses or limited data for use of LAIV. Contraindications to use of LAIV4 include the following: Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency; a labeled contraindication noted in the package insert). However, ACIP makes an exception for allergy to egg (see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). Children and adolescents receiving concomitant aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications, because of the potential risk for Reye syndrome (a labeled contraindication noted in the package insert). Children aged 2 through 4 years who have received a diagnosis of asthma or whose parents or caregivers report that a health care provider has told them during the preceding 12 months that their child had wheezing or asthma or whose medical record indicates a wheezing episode has occurred during the preceding 12 months. Children and adults who are immunocompromised due to any cause, including but not limited to immunosuppression caused by medications, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency states, HIV infection, anatomic asplenia, or functional asplenia (such as that due to sickle cell anemia). Close contacts and caregivers of severely immunosuppressed persons who require a protected environment. Pregnancy. Persons with active communication between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the oropharynx, nasopharynx, nose, or ear or any other cranial CSF leak. Persons with cochlear implants, because of the potential for CSF leak that might exist for a period after implantation (providers might consider consultation with a specialist concerning the risk for persistent CSF leak if an age-appropriate inactivated or recombinant vaccine cannot be used). Receipt of influenza antiviral medication within the previous 48 hours for oseltamivir and zanamivir, previous 5 days for peramivir, and previous 17 days for baloxavir. The interval between influenza antiviral receipt and LAIV4 during which interference might potentially occur might be further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that delay medication clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency). Precautions for use of LAIV4 include the following: Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever. History of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of any influenza vaccine. Asthma in persons aged ≥5 years. Other underlying medical condition (other than those listed under contraindications) that might predispose to complications after wild-type influenza virus infection (e.g., chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular [except isolated hypertension], renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders [including diabetes mellitus]). Recent Influenza Vaccine Labeling Changes Flucelvax Quadrivalent Since the publication of the 2021–22 ACIP influenza vaccine recommendations, a labeling change for Flucelvax Quadrivalent (ccIIV4) has occurred. Flucelvax Quadrivalent was initially approved in 2016 for persons aged ≥4 years. Approval for persons aged ≥18 years was based on a randomized immunogenicity and safety trial that compared Flucelvax Quadrivalent with the previously approved trivalent formulation of Flucelvax (ccIIV3), which had previously been licensed for persons aged ≥18 years on the basis of data from a randomized clinical efficacy trial. Approval for children aged 4 through 17 years also was based on immunogenicity and safety data compared with ccIIV3, with a postmarketing requirement to conduct a clinical efficacy study (128). In March 2021, FDA approved Flucelvax Quadrivalent for persons aged ≥2 years on the basis of a randomized clinical efficacy trial conducted among 4,514 children aged ≥2 to <18 years over three influenza seasons (Southern Hemisphere 2017 and Northern Hemisphere 2017–18 and 2018–19) (129). Subsequently, in October 2021, FDA approved Flucelvax Quadrivalent for persons aged ≥6 months. Approval was based on a randomized immunogenicity and safety study conducted among 2,402 children aged 6 through 47 months (of whom 894 were aged 6 through 23 months). Children were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Flucelvax Quadrivalent (0.5 mL/dose containing 15 µg HA per virus for all ages) or a licensed comparator egg-based IIV4 (0.25 mL/dose containing 7.5 µg HA per virus for those aged 6 through 35 months and 0.5 mL/dose containing 15 µg HA per virus for those aged 36 through 47 months) (130). Flucelvax Quadrivalent met prespecified immunogenicity criteria for all four viruses. No new safety signals were noted, and prevalence of solicited injection site and systemic reactions was similar between the two groups. Top Storage and Handling of Influenza Vaccines In all instances, approved manufacturer packaging information should be consulted for authoritative guidance concerning storage and handling of specific influenza vaccines. Typically, influenza vaccines should be protected from light and stored at temperatures that are recommended in the package insert. Recommended storage temperatures are typically 36°F–46°F (2°C–8°C) and should be maintained at all times with adequate refrigeration and temperature monitoring. Vaccine that has frozen should be discarded. Specific recommendations for appropriate refrigerators and temperature monitoring equipment can be found in the Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit, available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storageoolkit/index.html. Vaccines should not be used beyond the expiration date on the label. In addition to the expiration date, multidose vials also might have a beyond-use date (BUD), which specifies the number of days the vaccine can be kept once first accessed. After being accessed for the first dose, multidose vials should not be used after the BUD. If no BUD is provided, then the listed expiration date is to be used. Multidose vials should be returned to recommended storage conditions between uses. Package information might also specify a maximum number of doses contained in multidose vials (regardless of remaining volume). No more than the specified number of doses should be removed, and any remainder should be discarded. Single-dose vials should not be accessed for more than 1 dose. Providers should contact the manufacturer for information on permissible temperature excursions and other departures from recommended storage and handling conditions that are not discussed in the package labeling. Top Additional Sources of Information Regarding Influenza and Influenza Vaccines Influenza Surveillance, Prevention, and Control Updated information regarding influenza surveillance, detection, prevention, and control is available at https://www.cdc.gov/flu. U.S. surveillance data are updated weekly throughout the year on FluView (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly) and can be viewed in FluView Interactive (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluviewinteractive.htm). In addition, periodic updates regarding influenza are published in MMWR (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html). Additional information regarding influenza and influenza vaccines can be obtained from CDCINFO by calling 1-800-232-4636. State and local health departments should be consulted about availability of influenza vaccines, access to vaccination programs, information related to state or local influenza activity, reporting of influenza outbreaks and influenza-related pediatric deaths, and advice concerning outbreak control. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires health care providers to report any adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to future doses of the vaccine or any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccination (https://vaers.hhs.gov/docs/VAERS_Table_of_Reportable_Events_Following_Vaccination.pdf) that occurs within the specified period after vaccination. In addition to mandated reporting, health care providers are encouraged to report any clinically significant adverse event after vaccination to VAERS. Information on how to report a vaccine adverse event is available at https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html. National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), established by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, as amended, is a mechanism through which compensation can be provided to persons who might have been injured as a result of receiving a vaccine covered by VICP. The Vaccine Injury Table (https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vicp/vaccine-injury-table-01-03-2022.pdf) lists the vaccines covered by VICP and the associated injuries and conditions that might receive a legal presumption of causation. If the injury or condition is not in the table or does not meet the requirements in the table, persons must prove that the vaccine caused the injury or condition. Claims must be filed with specified time frames. Persons of all ages who receive a VICP-covered vaccine might be eligible to file a claim. Additional information is available at https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation or by calling 1-800-338-2382.

Helen Keipp Talbot reports receiving financial support from CDC. No other potential conflicts of interest were disclosed. This report includes discussion of the unlabeled use of influenza vaccines in the instance of influenza vaccination of persons with a history of egg allergy. A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to the vaccine or any of its components (which include egg for certain vaccines) is a labeled contraindication to receipt of most IIV4s and LAIV4. However, ACIP recommends that persons with a history of allergic reaction of any severity to egg should receive any licensed, recommended influenza vaccine that is appropriate for their age and health status. Persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to egg who receive egg-based vaccines (i.e., vaccines other than cell culture–based inactivated influenza vaccine [ccIIV4] or recombinant influenza vaccine [RIV4]) should be vaccinated in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting (including, but not necessarily limited to, hospitals, clinics, health departments, and physician offices); vaccine administration in such instances should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. No postvaccination waiting period is recommended specifically for egg-allergic persons. However, ACIP recommends that vaccine providers consider observing patients seated or supine for 15 minutes after administration of any vaccine (regardless of allergy history) to decrease the risk for injury should syncope occur. Top CDC Adoption of ACIP Recommendations for MMWR Recommendations and Reports, MMWR Policy Notes, and Immunization Schedules (Child/Adolescent, Adult) Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, adolescents, and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a Federal Advisory Committee to provide expert external advice and guidance to the Director of CDC on use of vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible with recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of vaccinations in adults are harmonized with recommendations of AAFP, ACOG, and the American College of Physicians (ACP).

Availability and characteristics of specific products and presentations might change or differ from what is described in this table and in the text of this report. † Although a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to egg is a labeled contraindication to the use of egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4, ACIP recommends that persons with a history of egg allergy may receive any licensed, recommended influenza vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health status. Those who report having had reactions to egg involving symptoms other than urticaria (e.g., angioedema or swelling, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent emesis) or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention should be vaccinated in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting (including but not necessarily limited to hospitals, clinics, health departments, and physician offices) supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions, if a vaccine other than ccIIV4 or RIV4 is used. § The approved dose volume for Afluria Quadrivalent is 0.25 mL for children aged 6 through 35 months and 0.5 mL for persons aged ≥3 years. However, 0.25-mL prefilled syringes are not expected to be available for the 2022–23 season. For children aged 6 through 35 months, a 0.25-mL dose must be obtained from a multidose vial. ¶ IM-administered influenza vaccines should be given by needle and syringe only, with the exception of the MDV presentation of Afluria Quadrivalent, which may alternatively be given by the PharmaJet Stratis jet injector for persons aged 18 through 64 years only. For adults and older children, the recommended site for intramuscular influenza vaccination is the deltoid muscle. The preferred site for infants and young children is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. Additional specific guidance regarding site selection and needle length for intramuscular administration is available in the ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/index.html. ** Not applicable. †† Fluzone Quadrivalent is currently approved for ages 6 through 35 months at either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose; however, 0.25-mL prefilled syringes are not expected to be available for the 2022–23 influenza season. If a prefilled syringe of Fluzone Quadrivalent is used for a child in this age group, the dose volume will be 0.5 mL per dose. Top TABLE 2.

Vaccine administration should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. § Labeled contraindication noted in package insert. ¶ If administered, vaccination should occur in a medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who can recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can consider consultation with an allergist in such cases, to assist in identification of the component responsible for the allergic reaction. ** Age-appropriate injectable vaccines are recommended for persons with cochlear implant due to the potential for CSF leak, which might exist for a period after implantation. Providers might consider consultation with a specialist concerning risk for persistent CSF leak if an age-appropriate inactivated or recombinant vaccine cannot be used. †† Use of LAIV4 in context of influenza antivirals has not been studied; however, interference with activity of LAIV4 is biologically plausible, and this possibility is noted in the package insert for LAIV4. In the absence of data supporting an adequate minimum interval between influenza antiviral use and LAIV4 administration, the intervals provided are based on the half-life of each antiviral. The interval between influenza antiviral receipt and LAIV4 for which interference might potentially occur might be further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that delay medication clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency). Influenza antivirals might also interfere with LAIV4 if initiated within 2 weeks after vaccination. Persons who receive antivirals during the period starting with the specified time before receipt of LAIV4 through 2 weeks after receipt of LAIV4 should be revaccinated with an age-appropriate IIV or RIV4.

General best practice guidelines for immunization: best practices guidance of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/index.html). In addition to the contraindications based on history of severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccines that are noted in the table, each individual influenza vaccine is contraindicated for persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of that vaccine. Vaccine components can be found in package inserts.

Providers can consider using the following vaccines in these instances; however, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting with supervision by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions: 1) for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV or LAIV of any valency, the provider can consider administering ccIIV4 or RIV4; 2) for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency, the provider can consider administering RIV4; and 3) for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any RIV of any valency, the provider can consider administering ccIIV4. Providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help determine which vaccine component is responsible for the allergic reaction. TopBOX. Abbreviation conventions for influenza vaccines discussed in this report Main influenza vaccine types: IIV = inactivated influenza vaccine RIV = recombinant influenza vaccine LAIV = live attenuated influenza vaccine Numerals following letter abbreviations indicate valency (the number of influenza virus hemagglutinin [HA] antigens represented in the vaccine): 4 for quadrivalent vaccines: one A(H1N1), one A(H3N2), and two B viruses (one from each lineage) 3 for trivalent vaccines: one A(H1N1), one A(H3N2), and one B virus (from one lineage) All influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2022–23 season are quadrivalent vaccines. However, abbreviations for trivalent vaccines (e.g., IIV3) might be used in this report when discussing information specific to trivalent vaccines. Abbreviations for general vaccine categories (e.g., IIV) might be used when discussing information that is not specific to either trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines. Prefixes are used when necessary to refer to certain specific IIVs: a for MF59-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (e.g., aIIV3 and aIIV4) cc for cell culture–based inactivated influenza vaccine (e.g., ccIIV3 and ccIIV4) HD for high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (e.g., HD-IIV3 and HD-IIV4) SD for standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (e.g. SD-IIV3 and SD-IIV4) Top FIGURE. Influenza vaccine dosing algorithm for children aged 6 months through 8 years* — Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, United States, 2022–23 influenza season * Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses of influenza vaccine should receive their first dose as soon as possible (including during July and August, if vaccine is available) to allow the second dose (which must be administered ≥4 weeks later) to be received, ideally, by the end of October. For children aged 8 years who require 2 doses of vaccine, both doses should be administered even if the child turns age 9 years between receipt of dose 1 and dose 2. Top TABLE 4.

This study looked at the link between influenza vaccination and the severity of COVID-19 infection. We searched five databases until August 2021. We included studies that reported the relationship between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 outcomes. We pooled the data as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), the data pooled using fixed and random effects models according to the heterogeneity of results. Sixteen observational studies with 191,496 COVID-19 patients were included. In terms of mechanical ventilation, our analysis showed a significant favor for the influenza vaccinated group over the non-vaccinated group (RR = 0.72, 95% CI [0.54, 0.96], P = 0.03). However, the analysis indicated no statistically significant differences between vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups in the term of mortality rate (RR = 1.20, 95% CI [0.71, 2.04], P = 0.50), hospital admissions (RR = 1.04, 95% CI [0.84, 1.29], P = 0.75), intensive care admissions (RR = 0.84, 95% CI [0.44, 1.62], P = 0.60). There were no significant differences between those who had received the influenza vaccine and those who had not in COVID-19 clinical outcomes, except for mechanical ventilation which showed a significantly lower risk in the influenza vaccinated group compared to the non-vaccinated one. However, future research is encouraged as our data have limitations, and the influenza vaccine is regularly updated. Also, this does not exclude the importance of the influenza vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 is a respiratory syndrome with a wide range of severity that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)2. COVID-19 pandemic has invaded the world, leading to global physical and mental health effects3. The pandemic's severity emphasizes how crucial it is to administrate FDA-authorized vaccines successfully. On the other hand, vaccine hesitancy can be considered a significant hazard towards achieving this4.Meanwhile, influenza also represents a considerable public health burden despite the presented therapeutic and preventative measures5. Vaccines against influenza have been used for over 60 years. There have been evolved and improved methods to evaluate the vaccine efficacy and effectiveness in that time; however, there are still challenges. Those include influenza vaccine effectiveness being a moving target. Influenza viruses keep evolving, so vaccine strains are regularly updated, the population's immune profile changes and novel vaccine products are being developed to provide improved protection6.According to the WHO and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), COVID-19 and influenza viruses share similarities in terms of disease presentation and modes of transmission7. However, there are some differences, for example, the speed of transmission, as influenza has a shorter incubation period as well as serial interval compared to COVID-19. The influenza virus's serial interval is three days, but, that for COVID-19 was estimated as five to six days, indicating that influenza could spread faster than COVID-197. On the hand, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently stated that, generally, COVID-19 virus is more contagious than influenza viruses, and that COVID-19 can spread, in a quick and easy way, to plenty of people. Overall, resulting in a continual spreading among people as time progresses8. Another difference includes that COVID-19 appeared to cause more severe illnesses, and that COVID-19 serious illness could lead to hospitalization and mortality even in healthy individuals8.The suggested theoretical mechanisms for a potential protective effect of the influenza vaccine against COVID-19 included the MF59 presence in the influenza vaccine, which was shown to help in potentiating an immune response against SARS-CoV variants9. Another proposal included if the vaccine could stimulate enough trained innate immune memory; so, that when another respiratory pathogen such as SARS‐CoV‐2 occurred, the local lung immune system would be primed for a rapid response10. Overall, this could affect the SARS‐Cov‐2 acquisition or the COVID‐19 disease course10. Furthermore, another theory was based on the suggestion that influenza and COVID-19 viruses engage with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and tetraspanin antibodies. Therefore, ACE-2 and tetraspanin antibodies might inhibit covid-19 and low-pathogenic influenza A virus11.There have been controversial results about whether there is an association between influenza vaccination and the severity of COVID-19 outcomes or not12,13. Therefore, this study aims to solve the controversial results by investigating whether influenza vaccination reduces the severity of COVID-19 in patients or not.MethodsProtocol and registrationThis review follows the recent updates of PRISMA-P14, and MOOSE15 guidelines. Our protocol was a priori registered in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42021273299).Literature searchWe conducted our searches in the following databases; Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, OVID, and Cochrane Central database, till the 5th of August 2021. We used the following search strategy for our search on PubMed: ((Flu OR Influenza OR Influenza virus) AND (“COVID 19” OR COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR SARS2 OR 2019-nCoV OR Coronavirus OR Corona OR “Coronavirus Disease 2019” OR “Coronavirus Disease-19” OR “Novel Coronavirus”)) AND (vaccination* OR vaccine* OR shot OR jabs). Then we adapted to other databases: We also conducted a manual search including the references of our including studies and the google scholar search.Selection criteriaOur criteria include observational retrospective or prospective studies (case–control, and cohort studies) of living human beings that met the following criteria: (1) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19; (2) studies that compared COVID-19 patients who received influenza vaccine against patients who did not receive it. We excluded (1) any study that did not report health-related outcomes; (2) studies that did not use influenza vaccine as exposure; (3) studies that did not identify the status of patients if they are COVID-19 or not; (4) ecological studies; (5) duplicated studies or studies with untrusted data; (6) studies written in a language other than English; (7) animal studies, conference abstract, book chapter, letter, editorial, comment.Two independent reviewers (H.W.A. and A.H.) screened the titles and abstracts of retrieved records; then they screened the eligibility of studies to our criteria by full-text screening. They classified them into included, excluded, or undecided studies. We solved disagreements by consulting a third reviewer (M.S.Z) whenever necessary.Quality assessmentWe evaluated our included studies using the Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for case–control or cohort studies16. This scale consists of a star-awarding system for each specific methodological section, and according to this system, an overall quality score was generated for each study. The scale ranges from 0 to 9 points, where the studies were categorized as high risk (0–3 score), moderate risk (4–6 score), or low risk (≥ 7 scores). Two investigators (M.K. and H.W.A.) independently performed the quality assessment. In case of disagreements, a final decision was reached by consulting a third investigator (A.H.).Data extractionThis review aimed to investigate the association between health-related outcomes of COVID-19 patients and previous influenza vaccination. By using formatted excel sheets, four authors (A.F., M.E., F.A., and K.R.) independently extracted: (1) The summary data of the eligible studies including country, study design, patients number, influenza vaccinated and non-vaccinated numbers, year of vaccination, and COVID-19 test results; (2) patient data at the start of the study including mean age, gender, and comorbidities as Hypertension, Diabetes, COPD, or asthma, renal failure, or Cardiovascular diseases; (3) outcomes including mortality rate, hospital admission, intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, hospitalization time, ICU time, mechanical ventilation, and incidence of COVID-19 symptoms or pneumonia. A discussion with another author (H.W.A.) solved disagreements in data extraction.Data synthesis and statistical analysisWe analyzed the data using mean difference (MD) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data. By using the Mantel Haenszel (M–H) method, homogenous data were pooled in a fixed-effect model, while heterogeneous data were pooled using a random-effect model, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the heterogeneity using inspection and chi-square test, and the proportion was identified by I-square tests17. The statistical significance was detected by P value < 0.05. We conducted the subgroup analysis for mortality rate to stratify patients into three groups USA, Italian, and other patients. We pooled our data using Review Manager software Version 5.4.ResultsLiterature search and study selectionOur search collected 6058 papers from six online databases and 450 papers from other sources, including manual search and google scholar. Of the total retrieved 6508 papers, we excluded 1818 duplications. Then 4667 papers were excluded from 4690 papers after the title and abstract screening. The remaining 23 articles were screened for the eligibility criteria. A total of 1611,12,13,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 papers were finally included for the final qualitative analysis, and only 1311,12,13,19,20,21,22,24,25,27,28,29,30 of them underwent quantitative analysis (Fig. 1).Figure 1PRISMA flow chart which summarizes the literature search, and included studies.Full size imageStudy characteristicsFourteen included studies were cohort studies12,13,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,28,29,30, while the remaining two were case-controls11,27. The included studies had a total sample size of 244,642 patients, of them, 191,496 COVID-19 positive patients. Most of the studies were performed in Italy13,20,22,23,26,27 and the USA12,24,25,28,29, while the others were conducted in Brazil18, Poland19, Spain21, Iran11, and England30. For SARS-CoV-2 infection identification, all studies used Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, however, three studies did not report the SARS-CoV-2 infection identification test used12,22,29. The summary of all included studies is presented in (Table 1) and patient data is presented in (Table 2).Table 1 Summary of the included studies.Full size tableTable 2 Baseline characteristics of patients in the included studies.Full size tableThe quality of the included studiesThe quality assessment was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale. Based on the scale, nine11,12,19,20,21,22,25,26,28 out of the sixteen included studies were scored 9/9, and the other seven studies13,18,23,24,27,29,30 were scored 8/9. All included studies scored a low risk of bias. (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).Quantitative synthesisMortality rateThe pooled effect estimates of seven studies12,13,19,20,22,28,30 with a total sample size of 125,658 COVID-19 patients showed no significant difference between influenza vaccinated group and non-vaccinated group in the term of mortality rate (RR = 1.20, 95% CI [0.71, 2.04], P = 0.50; Fig. 2a). Pooled results were heterogeneous (P < 0.00001, I2 = 98%). After introducing subgroups according to the countries: USA12,28, Italian13,20,22, and other countries19,30, the results remain non-significant in USA and other group (RR = 0.82, 95% CI [0.60, 1.13], P = 0.22), (RR = 0.97, 95% CI [0.86, 1.09], P = 0.58), and also non-significant in the Italian group (RR = 1.87, 95% CI [1.00, 3.49], P = 0.05), (Fig. 2b). The heterogeneity resolved in USA, and other groups (P = 0.16, I2 = 49%), and (P = 0.88, I2 = 0%) respectively, while it remains heterogeneous in Italian group (P = 0.0007, I2 = 86%).Figure 2Mortality rate. This figure shows the forest plot of (a) Mortality rate between influenza vaccinated group and non-vaccinated group, (b) Subgroups of mortality rate according to countries USA, Italian, and other patients.Full size imageHospital admissionThe pooled effect estimates of eight studies12,13,19,22,25,27,29,30 (N = 132,460 COVID-19 patients) showed no significant difference between influenza vaccinated group and non-vaccinated group in the term of hospital admissions (RR = 1.04, 95% CI [0.84, 1.29], P = 0.75); Fig. 3a). Pooled results were heterogeneous (P < 0.00001, I2 = 98%), the heterogeneity cannot be resolved. Wilcox et al.30 reported the hospitalization and death, following its removal from the analysis, the results remained non-significant (RR = 1.01, 95% CI [0.71, 1.45], P = 0.94), and heterogeneous (P < 0.00001, I2 = 98%).Figure 3Hospital and ICU outcomes. This figure shows the forest plot of (a) Hospital admission, (b) Hospitalization time, (c) ICU admission, (d) ICU time.Full size imageHospitalization time (days)The pooled effect estimates of four studies12,19,20,28 with a total sample size of 1716 COVID-19 patients indicated no significant difference between influenza vaccinated group and non-vaccinated group in the term of time staying at hospital (MD = − 0.16 , 95% CI [− 2.76, 2.45], P = 0.91; Fig. 3b). Pooled results were heterogeneous (P = 0.004, I2 = 78%), and the heterogeneity could be resolved when removing Conlon et al.12 but the results remained non-significant (RR = 0.97, 95% CI [− 1.23, 3.17], P = 0.39), P = 0.13, I2 = 50%).ICU admissionThe pooled effect estimates of six studies12,13,20,25,28,29 (N = 116,399 COVID-19 patients) showed non-significant difference between influenza vaccinated group and non-vaccinated group in the term of ICU admissions (RR = 0.84, 95% CI [0.44, 1.62], P = 0.60); Fig. 3c. Pooled results were heterogeneous (P < 0.00001, I2 = 95%), the heterogeneity cannot be resolved. Massari et al.13 reported the rate of ICU admission and death composite, after removing this study from the analysis, the results remained non-significant (RR = 0.71, 95% CI [0.44, 1.16], P = 0.17). Pooled results showed heterogeneity (P = 0.002, I2 = 77%).ICU time (days)The pooled effect estimates of two studies20,28 (N = 202 COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU) revealed no significant difference between the influenza vaccinated group and the non-vaccinated group in the term of time staying at ICU (MD = 0.99, 95% CI [− 2.15, 4.13], P = 0.54); Fig. 3d. Pooled results were homogenous (P = 0.32, I2 = 0%).Mechanical ventilationThe pooled effect estimates of four12,19,20,28 studies of 1716 COVID-19 patients showed a significant favouring towards the influenza vaccinated group over the non-vaccinated group in the term of mechanical ventilation (RR = 0.72, 95% CI [0.54, 0.96], P = 0.03; Fig. 4a). Pooled results were homogenous (P = 0.10, I2 = 52%).Figure 4Mechanical ventilation and symptom’s appearance. This figure shows the forest plot of (a) mechanical ventilation, (b) symptomatic cases, (c) asymptomatic cases.Full size imageSymptoms appearing on the patientThe pooled effect estimates of three studies11,21,24 of 1372 COVID-19 patients indicated no significant difference between influenza vaccinated group and non-vaccinated group in the term of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases (RR = 0.55, 95% CI [0.23, 1.36], P = 0.20; Fig. 4b), (RR = 1.17, 95% CI [0.76, 1.80], P = 0.49; Fig. 4c) respectively. Pooled results were heterogeneous (P < 0.00001, I2 = 95%), (P < 0.00001, I2 = 94%) respectively, and the heterogeneity cannot be resolved.Qualitative synthesisFink et al.18 a retrospective cohort study report data from 53,752 Brazilian COVID-19 patients reported that patient who receive influenza vaccine were 16% lower odds of death (95% CIs [0.78, 0.90]), 7% lower odds of needing ICU treatment (95% CIs [0.87, 0.98]), and 17% lower odds of requiring respiratory support (95% CIs [0.77, 0.88]); while Pedote et al.26 another retrospective cohort study reported no association between influenza vaccination and mortality rate (OR = 1.6, 95% CI [0.8–3.2], P = 0.165), or hospitalization (OR = 1.2, 95% CI [0.7–1.9], P = 0.51). Also, Pastorino et al.23 reported the same non association results with influenza and pneumococcal vaccine.DiscussionOur pooled results demonstrated a significant favouring of mechanical ventilation in influenza vaccinated COVID-19 patients over the non-vaccinated ones. However, it showed no statistical differences between influenza vaccinated and non-vaccinated COVID-19 patients, in any of the mortality rates, hospital admission, hospitalization time, ICU admission, ICU time, and appearance of symptoms. Still, it is worth noting that a study by Fink et al.18, (N = 53,752 COVID-19 cases), could not enter the analysis but was included in the systematic review. They reported that recently influenza vaccinated patients had an average of 7% lower odds, 17% lower odds, and 16% lower odds of ICU treatment, invasive respiratory support requirement, and death, respectively. So, the results might have differed if this study was applicable to enter the analysis.Thindwa et al.31 concluded that there was a relatively small magnitude of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality prevention by influenza vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, while at that time, they could not eliminate the probability of a considerable amount of prevention of COVID-19 related mortality. Our findings are similar to Wang et al.32 as they reported no statistical association between both groups in terms of mortality, hospitalization, or ICU in COVID-19 patients. However, they reported that patients who received the influenza vaccine showed a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, McIntosh et al.33 stated that pneumococcal and influenza vaccination could reduce SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial transmission by reducing hospitalizations for pneumonia and COVID-19 severity. They also noted that exploring co-administration of pneumococcal and influenza vaccines with a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is needed33.Fink et al.18 discussed a suggestive explanation of the association between the influenza vaccine and lower risk of COVID-19 adverse outcomes. This included that the life vaccines can trigger the trained innate immunity34,35, and result in a recognized ‘off-target’ protection against various pathogens besides those directly targeted by the given vaccine36,37.The CDC supported the safety of the influenza vaccine for pregnant women, and still, the CDC keeps on gathering data regarding this matter. The given flu shots in pregnancy aid in protecting both the pregnant woman and the baby from influenza38. Despite de la Cruz Conty et al. not observed a significant association between the maternal vaccination and the COVID-19 outcomes, they reported several limitations to the study. The limitations included the small sample size of influenza-vaccinated patients and their characteristics. Some of them had respiratory co-morbidities or other medical history-related factors that suggested the influenza vaccination21.In children, influenza infection without vaccination increases the susceptibility to other serious illnesses24,39,40. So, it is crucial to consider the effect of the influenza vaccine on COVID-19 patients. One of our included studies, which involved paediatric patients, concluded that seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccination might be protective in symptomatic COVID-19 diseases24.Globally, COVID-19 led to critical supply shortages, including ICU, hospital bed supply, hospital staff, and mechanical ventilators for affected regions41. Our results of significantly decreased mechanical ventilation rates in influenza vaccinated COVID-19 patients could spare efforts and lessen the burden on the healthcare system, as well as potentially provide better patients outcomes. However, this is limited because only four studies were included in the mechanical ventilation outcome, including retrospective studies. Even though our results showed no significant differences between influenza vaccinated and non-vaccinated in several COVID-19 patients' severe outcomes, this shall never deny the importance of influenza vaccination, especially during a pandemic. This can be clarified by that influenza and COVID-19 share similar symptoms and that there have been reports of their co-infections, which showed a more severe course, complications, or a fatal outcome42,43. In addition, COVID-19 and influenza have common high-risk groups. They are deleterious for older people and people with chronic co-morbidities, such as obesity, and residents of long-term care facilities44,45. Moreover, improving influenza vaccination rates will improve influenza morbidity and mortality and spare the overloaded health system during COVID-19. Eventually, this will preserve efforts and allow proper functioning without draining the resources46.This study included large sample size and included studies, and each step was conducted at least twice. Moreover, all included studies had a low risk of bias. On the other hand, the limitations include the inclusion of retrospective studies which are liable to bias. Also, the results showed heterogeneity which sometimes could not be resolved. There has been a wide variety of included populations, as some studies included all COVID 19 patients, others included only hospitalized ones, one study only included pregnant patients21, and another one only included paediatrics population24. Also, there were different follow-up periods.ConclusionThe analysis showed a significant favor for mechanical ventilation in influenza vaccinated COVID-19 patients over the non-vaccinated ones, on the other hand, there were no significant differences between influenza vaccinated and the non-vaccinated groups among COVID-19 patients in the mortality rate, hospital admission, hospitalization time, ICU admission, ICU time, and appearance of symptoms. However, the study is limited by the heterogeneity of data and the inclusion of retrospective studies, besides that most of the included studies have not assessed viral infections other than COVID-19. Also, this should not overlook the importance of influenza vaccination, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research of high-quality randomized controlled trials is recommended to further assess the efficacy of the influenza vaccine in COVID-19 patients. The regular updating of the influenza vaccine should also be put into consideration. Other possible important confounding factors should also be taken into consideration, such as patient's health literacy, and socioeconomic status. ReferencesArchived: WHO Timeline—COVID-19.

It’s a new sign of trouble that only recently arrived.The young gull’s gray and white speckled feathers get blown by the wind, and it makes no attempt to shift to a more comfortable position. With exhausted blinks, it dips and droops its beak toward the sand.This great black-backed gull would have grown up to be one the biggest of all the gulls, growing its adult-size wingspan to over five and a half feet. But it will never again soar above the North Atlantic.The same goes for the dozens of gannets lying along this beach, and uncounted corpses across the archipelago. There’s no mistaking them for sleeping birds. They lie like fallen angels might, head flung back, wings splayed, one blueberry eye staring skyward.More than 150,000 northern gannets nest on Bass Rock, a site off the coast of Scotland that once housed prisoners. Here, flocks of seabirds flock around a lighthouse on May 19, 2022, just before bird flu struck.Photograph by Camille SeamanDead and dying birds like these were what first alerted people to the 2022 outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Also known as bird flu, the virus making these birds sick can be traced back to a goose farm in China in 1996. Since then, the virus has killed millions of poultry and in the past jumped lethally to humans. Sometime in the last year, a strain of the virus mutated and became even more transmissible. This year’s strain is hitting seabirds especially hard. (See photos of how bird flu affected China.)“It’s grim,” says Kevin Kelly, Shetland site manager for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) who’s been witnessing the disaster unfold on the ground.There is no euthanasia program for suffering birds—there are too many for that. Every week or so, Kelly zips himself into full PPE gear, and gathers and incinerates up to 50 corpses scattered around inland water bodies where live birds gather to bathe. He thinks these corpses could accelerate the spread of the virus. These are a small fraction of all the dead birds across the islands.Shetland saw some of the earliest outbreaks this year in Europe, possibly brought by waterbirds migrating north toward their breeding grounds in the Arctic. Over the last few months, the list of mass mortalities among wild species has been growing, in particular among breeding colonies where birds cluster in large numbers, from Dalmatian pelicans in Greece and knots in the Netherlands, to Caspian terns on Wisconsin’s Lake Michigan. In July, bird flu was confirmed among unusually high numbers of stranded, dying seals off the coast of Maine.Photographer Rachel Bigsby took detailed photographs of the gannets' colorful plumage on July 4, 2022. "It was harrowing to think that beneath their delicate white and golden feathers, their organs were shutting down," she says.Photograph by Rachel BigsbyNorthern gannet carcasses strew the rock face of Hermaness National Nature Reserve on Shetland, which is home to 30,000 northern gannets, on July 4, 2022. Photograph by Rachel Bigsby“It’s definitely a crisis,” Kelly says. “Without a doubt.”James Pearce-Higgins, director of science at the British Trust for Ornithology, agrees. “We have not seen this level of population impact before,” he says. “It is completely unprecedented.”Seabirds already under threatSeabird populations that are now being slashed by bird flu are already at risk from a great many other threats. More than half of all seabird species are thought to be in decline, with combined threats of climate change, overfishing of their prey, by-catch in fisheries, and non-native mammalian predators eating their eggs and chicks, such as rats and cats. (Read how we can help seabirds survive a warming world.)As well as being sentinels of ocean health, seabirds also play vital roles in ecosystems on sea and land. They move essential nutrients in their feces, and as top ocean predators, many seabird species help regulate the rest of the food web. Just as the ocean misses sharks when they’re overfished, declining seabirds could also have major impacts and likely upset the balance of ecosystems, including those that support major fisheries.“We've been banging the drum for a long time, as many conservationists have, about the declines in seabirds and the pressures that they face,” says RSPB’s Kevin Kelly. “This is a new thing that wasn't on the radar.” (Learn how plastic is harming seabirds.)Summer crowdsPrevious bird flu outbreaks have generally struck wildfowl in their wintering grounds and subsided when they dispersed at the end of the season. This year, however, when the virus showed up among birds soon after arriving at their summertime colonies in Shetland, local experts knew something new was happening.“Alarm bells were ringing straight away about the speed in which they were getting it pre-breeding season this time, rather than post-breeding season,” says Kelly.The bird flu viruses, known as H5, are continually evolving into new strains that can infect the same host at the same time. In the decades since it first arose, the virus has mutated and recombined many times, but until now it has not been very effective at spreading into major outbreaks.A great skua prepares to feast on a gannet carcass on July 5, 2022. Predatory birds that eat the infected carcasses will likely catch bird flu themselves. Photograph by Rachel Bigsby“What we've seen with this particular strain of virus is that it seems much better at being passed on,” says Ruth Cromie, councillor for Wildlife Health at the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.How this newly transmissible form of the virus was carried over from winter to spring is not yet clear, but it puts seabird populations at especially high risk while they congregate in densely packed breeding colonies.Scotland is home to around half of the world’s breeding population of gannets, the biggest North Atlantic seabirds and close relatives of tropical boobies. Shetland has traditionally been a stronghold for them, partly because lying near the edge of Europe's continental shelf makes the surrounding, upwelling seas highly productive and full of food.Visitors in mid-July, taking a boat ride from Shetland’s capital, Lerwick, to the nearby island of Noss are hit with the spectacle of thousands of gannets nesting on narrow ledges on the 600-foot sheer, sandstone cliffs. The air overhead is alive with soaring birds, like arrows being fired from all directions and slicing through the din of raucous kraak kraak calls. Now and then, the wind delivers wafts of fishy guano, from the solid stains that hang down like stalactites off the ledges. A closer look through binoculars at the gannetry, however, reveals dead bodies slumped between nests. At the base of the cliffs, water currents have swept together a raft of white clumps made of the recently fallen corpses. A short way off, a great skua is busy feasting on one of the floating gannets. (Why birds matter, and are worth protecting.)There have been times this spring and summer when the devastation was even harder to ignore. Phil Harris, a tour leader who brings visitors to the seabird colonies at Noss, describes weaving his boat between the floating bodies of 50 or 60 gannets.“On three occasions we actually had adult dead birds coming from somewhere up on the cliff and dropping dead next to the boat,” he says.You May Also LikeSCIENCEShould you be concerned about bird flu in your milk?ANIMALSBird flu is spreading from pole to pole. Here’s why it matters.ANIMALSDeadly bird flu threatens Israel's wildlife, triggers hunting banInfecting the food chainOther worrying changes are taking place in bird behavior. Scotland is home to around sixty percent of the global breeding population of great skuas, notoriously aggressive birds that dive-bomb anyone who dares go near their nests and harass other birds for a free meal. Normally at Noss, Harris sees gangs of great skuas chasing gannets and forcing them to regurgitate their fish catch. “You don’t see that now, probably because there are so many dead gannets to feed on,” he says.In some cases, after a matter of hours, birds start showing neurological signs of infection, becoming disoriented as the virus replicates in their brain and results in multiple-organ failure. Gannets in Shetland have been observed sitting helplessly on beaches, having apparently lost their eyesight. After great skuas scavenge their carcasses, their infection is plain to see as some barrel roll through the air.“It’s heartbreaking to see when they're normally so full of attitude,” says Kevin Kelly. “You've got this big brute of a bird that can't hold its own head up. It massively affects them neurologically.”At a population level, the situation is even more worrying. Numbers of great skuas in sites across Shetland are down by at least half compared to this time last year. In some places, only around one in 10 birds survive. James Pearce-Higgins is hearing similar reports of great skua mass mortalities on other Scottish islands. If current trajectories continue, the species could be one or two years from extinction.So far, reports on gannets are not quite so dire, but in some colonies as much as a quarter of the adults have already died this breeding season. (Read: How many birds are there in the world?)Elsewhere, entire breeding colonies are being wiped out, including sandwich terns on Texel Island in the Netherlands. Hundreds of roseate terns have died on Coquet Island, the U.K.’s rarest seabird colony.“Very rapidly, you can see how that could translate into really big impacts at the global level for these species,” says Pearce-Higgins.Added stressorsMany seabirds that are catching the virus are long lived, slow breeders. Great skuas take around seven years to reach maturity and lay two eggs per year. Gannets lay just one. It means that any recovery of populations will be innately slow.“We’re looking at an impact which will be seen for decades to come,” says Pearce-Higgins. He likens this bird flu outbreak in seabirds to the devastating crash in populations of bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and many other birds of prey from DDT poisoning, which American author Rachel Carson brought to the public eye in her 1962 book Silent Spring. The ubiquitous pesticide contaminated food webs, thinned birds’ shells, and killed their embryos. “It really puts the priority on understanding what’s left,” Pearce-Higgins says.Seabird populations that are now being slashed by bird flu are already at risk from a great many other threats. More than half of all seabird species are thought to be in decline, with combined threats of climate change, overfishing of their prey, by-catch in fisheries, and non-native mammalian predators eating their eggs and chicks, such as rats and cats.As well as being sentinels of ocean health, seabirds also play vital roles in ecosystems on sea and land. They move essential nutrients in their feces, and as top ocean predators, many seabird species help regulate the rest of the food web. Just as the ocean misses sharks when they’re overfished, declining seabirds could also have major impacts and likely upset the balance of ecosystems, including those that support major fisheries. (Read about a bird flu outbreak in Israel.)“We've been banging the drum for a long time, as many conservationists have, about the declines in seabirds and the pressures that they face,” says RSPB’s Kevin Kelly. “This is a new thing that wasn't on the radar."A response strategyThe big and for now unanswerable question is what will happen next. So far, there is only a single, asymptotic report of this strain of bird flu jumping to humans, although future zoonotic outbreaks remain a possibility.In wild species, a worrying prospect is that migrating seabirds will transfer this new transmissible form of the virus to more populations, in particular in the southern hemisphere, which for now remains largely unaffected.It’s unclear as yet which species can carry the virus asymptomatically. James Pearce-Higgins thinks a group of birds in the U.K. that could be acting as a vector for the virus are gulls.“They occupy a lot of the wetland areas that some of these water birds will have been in and then potentially will be going to the seabird colonies to breed,” he says. A winter census of the U.K.’s gull populations was last done in 2006, and Pearce-Higgins hopes that this emergency will help secure funding for repeat surveys this year.In the meantime, what’s urgently needed, Ruth Cromie says, is for national and regional response plans to be put in place before more outbreaks hit wild birds.Possible strategies she suggests include not building poultry farms near wild bird colonies, keeping dog-walkers out of important areas, and creating no-fly zones to avoid stressing out birds while they’re nesting. Officials also need to know whether it’s a good idea to collect up bird carcasses, an issue that’s not been clear-cut throughout the current outbreak.“These are not the last crises that are going to happen in our increasingly polluted planet, with all of these different interfaces between wildlife and people,” she says.Until now, most attention has been focused on tracking the virus among domestic birds. Many conservationists and scientists are arguing for much more funding to study the spread of the virus among wild birds.Kelly hopes the bird flu crisis will help convince governments to commit more funds to conservation programs that will help reduce the obvious, preexisting threats to seabirds so they stand as good a chance as possible of recovering.In Shetland, locals are nervously waiting for the breeding season to end and for seabirds to leave their nesting sites and disband, hopefully bringing temporary relief for this year.“I want this season to be over and for the birds to be gone, to try and break this,” says Shetland seabird tour leader Phil Harris. “Then we’ll see what comes back next year.”Related TopicsSEABIRDSINFLUENZADISEASESANIMAL DISEASESENDANGERED SPECIESYou May Also LikeANIMALSWhy do animals eat their own poop—and other animals’ too?ANIMALSThis worm-like parasite is killing off Florida’s native snakesANIMALSA deadly disease that affects cats big and small found in U.S.ANIMALSAmid amphibian apocalypse, ‘frog saunas’ offer promising solutionANIMALSFish along the Florida Keys are spinning in circles until they die—and no one knows whyLegalTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationOur SitesNat Geo HomeAttend a Live EventBook a TripBuy MapsInspire Your KidsShop Nat GeoVisit the D.C.

Download PDF Copy By Pooja Toshniwal PahariaReviewed by Danielle Ellis, B.Sc.Aug 25 2022 In a recent study published in Scientific Reports, researchers performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether influenza vaccinations could reduce coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity outcomes. Study: The effect of influenza vaccine in reducing the severity of clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Image Credit: MedstockPhotos/Shutterstock Background Studies have reported potential mechanisms for the protective efficacy of influenza vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 infection severity, including (i) the presence of MF59 adjuvant in influenza vaccines, which potentiates anti-SARS-CoV immune responses, and (ii) influenza vaccines could stimulate innate immunological memory cells primed for immune responses against other respiratory pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and (iii) influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 interact with tetraspanin antibodies and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). However, results on the potential protection against COVID-19 severity by influenza vaccines have been contradictory. About the study In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, researchers assessed the association between influenza vaccinations and COVID-19 severity. Databases such as PubMed, Embase, Scopus, OVID, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science were searched till August 5, 2021. Additionally, the team manually searched for relevant studies from google scholar and references to the included studies. The analysis was performed in accordance with MOOSE (meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology) and PRISMA-P (preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols) guidelines. Studies were included if (i) they were observational prospective or retrospective studies (cohort and case-control type), (ii) were conducted on COVID-19 patients, and (iii) compared SARS-CoV-2-positive patients who were administered influenza vaccines and SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were not administered influenza vaccines. Studies were excluded if (i) health-related outcomes were not reported, (ii) influenza vaccinations were not the exposure, (iii) included patients without confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, (iv) ecological type studies (v) data was untrusted or duplicated, (vi) studies published in non-English languages, (vii) conference abstracts, book chapters, editorials, letters, commentaries, and animal studies. Studies included were reviewed independently by two reviewers, data were extracted by four reviewers, and disagreements were resolved by an additional reviewer. Data were obtained on information summary of eligible studies, study design, country, number of COVID-19 patients, influenza vaccinees, vaccination year, and SARS-CoV-2 testing reports. Patient data on demographics, comorbidities, outcomes such as mortality rates, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, duration of hospitalization, duration of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation requirements, and COVID-19-associated pneumonia and symptom incidence. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS), and a subgroup analysis was performed for mortality rates by geographically stratifying patients as those residing in Italy, the United States of America (USA), and other nations. Dichotomous and continuous data were obtained and pooled as risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD), respectively. Fixed and random effects models were used for homogeneous data and heterogeneous data, respectively. Results A total of 6058 records and 450 records from databases and other data sources, respectively, were identified, of which only 23 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility after the removal of duplicate records (n=4690), studies conducted on SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (n=4), duplicate studies (n=1), commentaries (n=1) or letters to the editor (n=1). As a result, 16 and 13 studies were included in the qualitative analysis (systematic review) and quantitative analysis (meta-analysis), respectively. Related StoriesOne in four healthy young Marines report long-term physical, cognitive, or psychiatric effects after mild COVID-19Public trust in COVID-19 vaccine science influences vaccine uptake in the USCanada’s proactive policies reduce drug shortages far more effectively than the U.S.The review comprised cohort studies (n=14) and case-control studies (n=2) comprising 244,642 individuals, of whom 191,496 individuals were SARS-CoV-2-positive. The studies were conducted in Italy (n=6), the USA (n=5), Poland, Brazil, Iran, England, and Spain. On the basis of the NOS scale, nine studies (out of 16) were allocated full scores, whereas the remaining seven studies were scored eight (out of nine), and all the included studies had low bias risks. Regarding mechanical ventilation requirements, the analysis results significantly favored the patients who had received influenza vaccines over those who did not receive influenza vaccines (RR= 0.7). However, no significant differences were observed between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in mortality rates (RR= 1.2), hospitalizations (RR= 1.0), and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions (RR= 0.8). After the subgroup analysis, the results remained non-significant for individuals residing in the USA (RR=0.8), Italy (RR=1.9), and other nations (RR=1.0). Conclusions Overall, the study findings significantly favor mechanical ventilation for influenza-vaccinated SARS-CoV-2 patients who received influenza vaccines over the unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. However, no statistically significant differences between the influenza-vaccinated and unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in mortality rates, hospitalizations, duration of hospitalization, ICU admissions, ICU duration, and development of COVID-19 symptoms. However, the study has a few limitations, such as (i) the inclusion of the retrospective type of studies, (ii) data heterogeneity, and (iii) viral infections apart from COVID-19 were not assessed in the majority of the included studies. The importance of vaccinations against influenza must not be overlooked in the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research must be conducted, including high-quality RCTs (randomized controlled trials), to explore further the efficacy of regularly-updated influenza vaccines against COVID-19 severity. Potential confounding factors such as socioeconomic status and health literacy must also be considered. Journal reference: Almadhoon, H. et al.

It has also been shown that it is possible to vaccinate against COVID-19 and influenza at the same time to build up immune protection against both viruses without reducing tolerability. As of mid-August 2022 (end of calendar week 33), the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut had released nearly 17 million doses of influenza vaccine. This is almost twice as many doses as this time last year. The batch tests are carried out based on the master adjustments approved by the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut or by the EU Commission for the 2022/23 season. The Paul-Ehrlich-Institut publishes a weekly online account of the number of influenza vaccine doses that it has released for the German market after batch testing. Master Adjustment Completed for 2022/23 Different influenza virus variants and potentially influenza virus subtypes circulate in the population during each influenza season. This means that influenza vaccines need to be adapted each year to the virus variants expected to circulate in order to ensure protection against influenza. The World Health Organization (WHO), supported in the EU by the CHMP at the EMA, makes annual recommendations on influenza vaccine adaptations. The WHO recommendations form the basis for the master adaptation of influenza vaccines for each season. The Paul-Ehrlich-Institut has approved the master adaptations for all influenza vaccines that hold a national marketing authorisation and submitted an application for the 2022/23 season. The EU Commission has granted approval for the master adaptations of vaccines centrally authorised in the EU. This year, a total of nine tetravalent influenza vaccine products containing four different antigen components are available for use in Germany. Authorisation of Influenza Vaccine Products and Approval of the Master Adaptation Seasonal influenza vaccine products for the annual influenza vaccination first receive an initial marketing authorisation with an exact specification of the amount and origin of the antigens contained in different influenza virus strains. For several years now, these vaccines have contained antigens of the globally circulating subtypes of influenza virus A-H1N1 and influenza virus A-H3N2, as well as of the influenza virus B lineages Victoria and/or Yamagata. The annual master adaptation specifies precisely which virus variants of the recommended subtypes and lineages collected in the laboratory during an influenza season (virus isolates) are to be used for the production of the influenza vaccines. It is important that the virus components (antigens) contained in the vaccine fit as well as possible to the virus strains and virus variants whose circulation is expected in the coming influenza season. This ensures the best possible immune protection. For influenza vaccines that are to be placed on the market in Germany and the EU during a flu season, the marketing authorisation holder receives the approval for the seasonal master adaptation from the European Commission (for centrally authorised vaccine products) or the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (for nationally authorised vaccine products). The master adaptation for the coming influenza season contains the antigenic components of the virus subtypes recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the northern hemisphere. The list of seasonal influenza vaccines authorised in Germany posted on the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI) website indicates whether the master adaptation has been approved by including the adaptation year in the name of the vaccine product. This means 2022/2023 will be indicated in the name of the seasonal influenza vaccine products with approved master adaptations for the upcoming influenza season, which runs from the end of 2022 to the beginning of 2023. Influenza vaccine products included in the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut's list that do not have years indicated in their names are not authorised for the upcoming influenza season and cannot be placed on the market because there has been no master adaptation. Variations in Age Indication The initial marketing authorisation of influenza vaccine products is for adults, usually aged 18 years or over. After completion of clinical trials with other age groups, these vaccines may also receive marketing authorisation for those groups as a type 2 variation of the original marketing authorisation. However, certain vaccines are also developed specifically for certain age groups. Examples are the high-dose vaccine and the vaccine with adjuvant, both developed for the elderly, as well as the live attenuated vaccine for children and adolescents, which was developed as a nasal spray.

Randomly selected doses (test samples) of each batch (production unit) of each influenza vaccine product are tested by the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut before being placed on the market in Germany. If the specification has been complied with, the batch is released. Only then can it be placed on the market. Experts at the Institute check for compliance with the specification by reviewing the manufacturing documents and the results of the quality control examinations. In addition, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut or an Official Medicines Control Laboratory (OMCL) in another European country evaluates the test samples of the batches produced in order to ensure a high quality of each batch of influenza vaccines. The Paul-Ehrlich-Institut will only grant batch release if the quality criteria laid down in the marketing authorisation of the vaccine have been met. Vaccinated individuals can rely on the fact that the vaccines administered in Germany are safe and effective in accordance with the marketing authorisation.

These viral infections can spread through tiny droplets that form when people talk, cough, or sneeze.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), influenza causes 3–5 million cases of severe disease along with 250,000–500,000 deaths every year globally. However, many options are available to prevent acquiring the flu virus and to reduce severity of symptoms.In this article, we will discuss the available treatment options for influenza.VaccinesShare on PinterestDesign by MNT; Photography by simonkr/Getty Images & FG Trade/Getty ImagesInfluenza vaccines, often known as flu shots, help to protect against infection by influenza viruses. There are many available flu vaccines. People must consult with doctors to know which vaccine is most suitable for them.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), all people who are 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine every year to prevent flu along with its serious complications. The different flu vaccines that are available include:Unadjuvanted quadrivalent influenza shotExperts manufacture this vaccine using viruses from eggs. As the name suggests, this vaccine can protect against 4 different flu viruses, including two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses. Examples include Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, and Fluzone Quadrivalent.Quadrivalent cell-based influenza shot Instead of using eggs, this vaccine uses viruses from cell cultures. This vaccine has approval for people 6 months and older. An example of this vaccine is Flucelvax Quadrivalent.Recombinant quadrivalent influenza shotAnother egg-free option, this vaccine has approval for people over 18 and uses a recombinant approach. This means it uses a specific part of the flu virus, such as the antigen, to generate an immune response. An example of this vaccine is Flublok Quadrivalent.Adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza shotAn adjuvant refers to an ingredient in some vaccines that can help create a stronger immune response. This vaccine includes MF59, an oil-in-water emulsion that helps to reduce the amount of virus necessary for producing a vaccine. Fluad Quadrivalent has approval for people 65 years of age and older and is an example of this type of vaccine.High-dose quadrivalent influenza shotThis type of vaccine contains 4 times the antigen compared with a standard dose. This vaccine has approval only for people aged 65 years and older. The higher dose of antigen in the vaccine intends to give older adults a better immune response, and, therefore, better protection against flu. The brand name of this vaccine is Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent.Live attenuated quadrivalent influenza shotSome people may refer to this type as a nasal spray vaccine. Rather than an injection, a person receives this vaccine through their nose. It uses a live attenuated, or weakened, version of the flu virus. This vaccine has approval for healthy nonpregnant people aged 2–49 years old. The brand name for this vaccine is FluMist Quadrivalent.Jet injector quadrivalent influenza shotInstead of a needle, this type of vaccine uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin. Evidence suggests that the jet injector method provides a similar level of protection to traditional flu shots. The brand name of this vaccine is AFLURIA Quadrivalent.Although these vaccines are effective in protecting against influenza, they can cause side effects such as swelling or redness in the region of the shot, muscle ache, fever, and headache. Live flu vaccines may also cause a runny nose and wheezing. As with any medicine, there is a remote chance of a life threatening allergic reaction to these vaccines.Antiviral drugsFlu antiviral drugs describe prescription medicines that target flu viruses. They are available in different forms, such as pills, liquid, powders, or an intravenous solution. These drugs typically work best when a person starts them within 2 days of becoming sick with flu symptoms. They can help to lessen flu symptoms and speed up recovery time. Antiviral drugs that are useful in the treatment of influenza include:Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu)Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor that is effective against both influenza A and B viruses. It blocks the viral neuraminidase enzyme, which is essential for influenza reproduction. It is available in oral forms such as capsules or powder suspensions. Side effects may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps.Zanamivir (Relenza)Zanamivir is another type of neuraminidase inhibitor. It is available as an inhalation powder, which a person breathes in using a special inhaler that comes with the drug. Side effects can include bronchospasm, dizziness, and sinusitis.Peramivir (Rapivab)Peramivir is also a neuraminidase inhibitor. This drug is available as a colorless liquid solution inside vials. A person receives it intravenously, typically through a vein in the arm over a period of time. Side effects may include diarrhea, skin reactions, and neuropsychiatric events.Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza)Unlike the other flu antivirals, baloxavir marboxil is a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor. This means it stops the virus from multiplying in the body by interfering with viral RNA transcription. This is the process viruses use to multiply and blocking this process stops viral replication. It is available in oral forms such as capsules or powder suspensions. Side effects can include bronchitis, diarrhea, nausea, and headache.AnalgesicsAnalgesics, also known as pain relievers, can help to lessen pain and fever symptoms that result from influenza. Common examples of over-the-counter nonopioid analgesics include acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and aspirin.Among them, acetaminophen is one of the most commonly available pain-relieving and fever-reducing medications available. The dose that doctors recommend for an adult usually ranges from 650–1000 milligrams (mg) every 4–6 hours, with a maximum dose of 4 grams per day. The dosage that doctors recommend for NSAIDs will depend on the specific drug, and the product label should provide guidelines and instructions.Nonopioid pain relievers are relatively safe for use in both adults and children when a person takes them correctly. Possible side effects can include nausea, constipation, and hypersensitivity reactions. Because excessive quantities of these drugs can be harmful, it is advisable for people to stick to recommended dosages. Additionally, if taking other products to relieve flu symptoms, a person should check ingredients to ensure they ingest a safe amount. For example, other flu products may contain Tylenol or NSAIDs, which is why it is important for people to check all the products they take to stay within the maximum daily dose that doctors recommend.AntitussivesAntitussives, which some people may refer to as cough suppressants, are compounds that can help reduce coughs. Coughing is a common symptom of the flu, which can irritate the throat and disrupt sleep.Dextromethorphan is a common ingredient in many antitussive products. While researchers are still unsure exactly how it works, it may prevent coughs by suppressing the cough receptors of the central nervous system. The dosage will vary depending on the formulation of the product. For example, for a liquid solution, adults and children aged over 12 can take a 10 milliliter (ml) dose every 6–8 hours and should not exceed 4 doses in a 24-hour period.The most common side effects from antitussives may include nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, drowsiness, and dizziness.ExpectorantsExpectorants help clear mucus from the airways, which can relieve congestion. Guaifenesin is a common ingredient in many expectorants. It is usually available as a solution, and the recommended dosage for adults and children aged over 12 is 10–20 ml every 4 hours, and not to exceed six doses in a 24-hour period. Side effects can include irritation of the digestive tract, nausea, and vomiting.DecongestantsDecongestants are compounds that can help provide relief from a blocked or stuffy nose. They are available in many formulations, such as nasal sprays, tablets, and liquids. They typically work by reducing blood flow to the sinuses, which reduces swelling and opens up the nasal passages.Dosage recommendations will vary between formulations. For example, adults and children aged over 12 can take two 30 mg tablets every 46 hours and should not exceed eight tablets in a 24-hour period. Side effects can include nervousness, dizziness, and sleeplessness.Multisystem treatmentMultisystem treatment involves a dual, triple, or quadruple combination of decongestants, analgesics, antihistamines, and expectorants into a single medication. This can be useful for taking and keeping track of a single product. However, it is important for a person to be aware of the active ingredients and be careful if taking additional medicines to avoid an accidental overdose.Overall, the safety of such multi-ingredient compounds is similar to that of conventional single-ingredient drugs if a person takes them according to the doses on the label.SummaryInfluenza is a common respiratory infection that can affect people of any age. Several treatment options are available to either prevent the condition or help relieve symptoms. It is highly advisable for people to receive their flu shots to reduce the risk of seasonal flu. Medications such as antivirals, analgesics, antitussives, expectorants, and decongestants can help lessen symptoms and speed up recovery.Flu / Cold / SARSFluHow we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

CassellShare on PinterestExperts say the best time to get a flu shot is before the illness starts circulating in your community. FG Trade/Getty ImagesExperts say the flu season in the United States could start early this year.They add the illness could also be stronger this season due to the low number of cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, a situation that has produced a gap in immunity.Federal health officials have released new recommendations, saying people should try to get vaccinated by the end of October.Experts note the vaccines’ protection last from four to six months, so it’s important not to get vaccinated too early.The Southern Hemisphere has been experiencing an unusual surge in flu cases early this season and experts say the same could happen in the United States later this year.The Australian flu season usually spans from May to September, but this year the number of flu cases from mid-April exceeded the 5-year average.“The Australian experiences is suggestive that this could be a really bad flu season in the Northern Hemisphere as well,” Dr. Dean Blumberg, the chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of California Davis Children’s Hospital, told Healthline.Blumberg says the influenza season in the United States has been unusual since the COVID-19 pandemic began and this could have consequences for this year’s season.“We saw historically low rates of influenza during that 2021 flu season and relatively low rates during 21/22 in the U.S., and yet, we had lingering influenza cases that occurred in May and June and we were still seeing patients admitted to the hospital in May and June, treating them for influenza, which is highly unusual,” he said.“I worry about it because I think with all the social distancing and mask wearing people have not been getting infected, which is a great thing, but they also haven’t been building up immunity,” Blumberg explained. “So those people who don’t get immunized, there’s going to be a significantly larger proportion of them who don’t have any recent experience with influenza infections. And that could lead to a higher rate of infection and also more severe cases.”In Australia so far this year, children younger than 5 and those aged between 5 and 19 had the highest rates of reported flu.Flu shot recommendationsThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new flu vaccination recommendations on August 26.In it, they advise that every person over 6 months of age should be vaccinated against flu.This year, there are six options for the flu vaccine, including egg-free vaccines, a nasal spray vaccine, and higher potency vaccines for those aged 65 and over.In June, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to preferentially recommend three higher potency flu vaccines for people aged 65 and older.In this age group, these specific vaccines may produce a more effective immune response than the standard dose.“Fortunately, everyone aged 65 and older, in essence in the United States, is a Medicare recipient. And for them, there is no out-of-pocket cost for influenza vaccine, including these vaccines,” Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, told Healthline.“Each year, we vaccinate two-thirds of the population aged 65 and older. That’s a great achievement. But interestingly enough, it means that a third of people in the United States 65 years of age and older, the very population that suffers disproportionately the most severe aspects of influenza, do not avail themselves of the vaccine. When it’s free. As I like to say, all they have to do is roll up their sleeves,” Schaffner said.When to get a flu shotIn recent years, experts say manufacturers of vaccines have shipped their products to pharmacies, hospitals, and clinics relatively early in the flu season. But experts stress it is important not to get the flu vaccine too early, even if it is available.“Historically, we’ve been recommending as soon as the influenza vaccine is available. However, with recent data showing that the protection lasts between four and six months it’s been recommended by some to push back the vaccination date to late September or early October to provide the maximum protection during the peak months of infection,” Blumberg said.The CDC advises that it is best to get vaccinated before influenza starts circulating in the community, with September and October being good times to be vaccinated.It advises that ideally everyone should have received their influenza vaccination by the end of October.However, in some cases, early vaccination can be considered. Some children require two doses of flu vaccine and these children can get vaccinated with their first shot as soon as vaccines are available, even if this is in July or August.Those in the third trimester of pregnancy can also consider an early vaccination.It will take two weeks following vaccination for antibodies to develop to protect against an influenza infection.Experts say relying on last year’s vaccine is not a good idea, as protection from the vaccine decreases over time and the influenza virus changes every year, which is why an annual vaccine is necessary.“We have to adapt the vaccine. We have to update it in order to account for the strains that we think will be more prominent to come in the winter,” Schaffner said.With a “twindemic” of both COVID-19 and influenza expected this winter, experts say the influenza vaccination is an important tool to prevent respiratory illness.“I would hope people would take advantage of a simple preventative measure, to get the influenza vaccine to try to prevent a respiratory illness,” Schaffner said. “And then also think about, if you do get influenza, you’re going to have a fever, you’re going to have a cough, you’re not sure what you have at the time, you’re probably going to be worried that you have COVID. So who needs that anxiety?”How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by Elizabeth Pratt on August 25, 2022 — Fact checked by Dana K.

Despite some cases and research findings regarding the death of children with IAV and S. aureus, coinfection included, there were few details about successful treatment of pleural empyema and necrotizing pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection following IAV. In this case report, we describe the clinical symptoms and treatment of a teenager with pleural empyema and necrotizing pneumonia related to S. aureus secondary infection who was initially infected by IAV. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and application of thoracoscopy for this potentially fatal pleural empyema caused by MRSA and IAV coinfection. We conclude that this is a significant case that contributes to raising awareness regarding rarely occurring severe respiratory infections by MRSA in a child with normal immune function after IAV. In addition, further studies are needed to explore risk factors for IAV coinfection with S. aureus. Introduction Retrospective studies of samples from the four pandemic influenza outbreaks of the last century have identified secondary bacterial infections as the fatal cause of co-morbidity and co-mortality, which reportedly manifested especially in the following week after viral infection symptoms are manifested, in 40–95% of influenza A -associated cases (1). IAV infections are associated with increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections, such as S. aureus and Streptococcus infections, wherein morbidity and mortality increase significantly (2). Children with IAV and S. aureus coinfection appear to have a great possibility of causing severe complications, and the mortality rate is very high as well. However, the details about the successful treatment of complications caused by coinfection of IAV and S. aureus have been rarely reported. In the present study, we report a unique case of pleural empyema and necrotizing pneumonia related to MRSA in a 13-year-old boy who was initially infected by IAV. Meanwhile, based on previous literature reports, we summarized the clinical characteristics and treatment of IAV and S. aureus coinfection. Case description A previously healthy 13-year-old boy was hospitalized with a three-day history of cough and fever. He was diagnosed with IAV infection in the local hospital. On admission, he was in respiratory distress and complained of left-sided chest pain. Laboratory indicators were shown in Table 1. His oxygen saturation level was 89–94% with an oxygen supply and he could not even lie down. The computed tomography (CT) scan of his chest showed atelectasis and a small amount of pleural effusion (Figure 1A). He was provided with oxygen support, anti-infection therapy and nutritional support. A diagrammatic representation of the treatment and outcome was presented in Figure 2. TABLE 1 Table 1. Changes of various laboratory values. FIGURE 1 Figure 1. (A) CT scan of his chest, show the left lung and the right lower lobe consolidation, with atelectasis in the lower lobe of the left lung. The left pleural cavity showed a small amount of pleural effusion, and the lumen of the bronchial branch of the left lower lobe was not unobstructed. (B) Bronchoscopy, show the basal segment of left lower lobe, the bronchial mucosa was rough, a large number of yellow and white mucus plugs were found in the opening, and the ventilation was not smooth. (C) Chest CT scan. Indicate consolidation of left and right upper and lower lobes with signs of atelectasis and multiple cavities in the left lung, partially wrapped left pneumothorax. (D) Thoracoscopy, show the lung surface covered with a yellow purulent moss-like layer. FIGURE 2 Figure 2. Diagrammatic representation of the treatment and outcome. The following day, the patient was not doing well and developed a stridor; hence, the decision was made to perform a flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) under ECG monitoring and respiratory oxygen support after employing local anesthesia (Figure 1B). Because the patient’s severe pneumonia progressed rapidly and even endangered his life, an early and accurate etiological diagnosis was very important for the implementation of pathogen-specific treatment. Therefore, the next-generation sequencing analysis from BAL fluid was performed, and it indicated S. aureus as the infectious pathogen residing in the patient’s lungs. Blood culture for microbial infection was also found positive for S. aureus. On the fourth day of hospitalization, the chest X-ray showed no improvement, so the bronchoscope was continued to be used for BAL. Tracheal aspirate showed heavy growth of MRSA sensitive to linezolid, vancomycin, and rifampicin. Meanwhile, it was resistant to tetracyclines and quinolones. Unfortunately, the patient was very ill, remained pyrexial (38.8°C) and developed a left-sided pyopneumothorax on day 8 of hospitalization with recurring fever, and the body temperature increased to 38.8°C. The patient complained of chest pain related to breathing abnormality, accompanied by apparent breath-holding. B-scan ultrasound and CT imaging (Figure 1C) of thorax revealed massive bilateral pleural effusions and multiple cavities in the left lung. Based on the laboratory and imaging diagnostic investigations, thoracentesis was performed on the patient’s left chest, and the chest tube was placed on the same side. Even after 12 days of hospitalization and treatment, the patient’s condition did not improve due to poor drainage of empyema as a result of cellulose and thick pus accumulation. The patient underwent thoracoscopy to diagnose and treat pleural effusion (Figure 1D). After thoracoscopic investigations of the pleural cavity, the lung surface was cleared of the thick yellow moss-like layer of pus, and the left chest cavity was repeatedly flushed until the outflow was clear. At the end of the surgical procedure, the light bloody liquid could be seen in the chest bottle, and the chest tube was connected to the closed thoracic drainage system to prevent further pleural effusions. On the 19th day of hospitalization, the chest drainage tube was removed. His cough condition was improved, and his breathing rate was stable without the occurrence of shortness of breath. The patient was discharged without any complaints of breathing discomfort. The patient was followed up for a chest X-ray examination after ten months of hospital discharge. The prognosis was good and the patient was in good physical condition. Discussion Influenza is considered as a known potential risk factor for Staphylococcal diseases (3). There are strong and consistent pieces of evidence of epidemiologically and clinically important interactions between the influenza virus and secondary bacterial respiratory pathogens (4). A study in the United States (5) showed that S. aureus was the most common bacterial pathogen (44%) among the 36 children who died of bacterial co-infection reported during the 2004–2007 influenza season, while MRSA accounted for 60%. The complication of co-infection progresses rapidly, and children cannot get accurate and timely treatment, which is one of the reasons for its high mortality rate. There are several hypothetical mechanisms of bacterial co-infection secondary to influenza virus infection. It is reported that the influenza virus can increase the adhesion of bacteria by destroying the epithelial layer of the tracheobronchial tree and neuraminidase activity (6, 7). At the same time, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is a pore-forming cytotoxin produced by S. aureus genes, acting synergistically to induce a strong lytic effect on host defense cells, notably with poly-morphonuclear leucocytes but especially on neutrophils (8). Previously infected influenza virus can enhance the proinflammatory and cytotoxic effects of PVL on neutrophils. Disintegration of the epithelial airway results in hemorrhage and tissue damage, which leads to the development of necrotizing pneumonia (7). In addition, nasal carriage of S. aureus is a significant risk factor for secondary staphylococcal pneumonia in IAV (9). Therefore, children with a history of S. aureus infection should be more alert to the risk of IAV and S. aureus co-infection. Finelli et al. found that compared with children without S. aureus infection, children with S. aureus infection were more prone to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome during the influenza season (5). We reviewed 16 clinical reports of IAV and S. aureus coinfection; however, five of them lack detailed clinical information (Table 2). Reviewing the literature of 16 children with IAV and S. aureus co-infection, we can find that S. aureus is almost always characterized by MRSA. Most of these children are older than 10 years old, which is consistent with the result of Finelli et al. (5). Complications in these children mainly include sepsis, empyema, DIC, pneumothorax, lung abscess, emphysema, necrotizing pneumonia, and so on. However, most detection of virulence factors of S. aureus were missing. Two cases presented PVL (+) and one presented PVL (−). A study suggested that an early confirmed presence of the PVL toxin is particularly important in choosing antibiotics and administrating immunoglobulin that inhibits PVL toxin release in early stage (10). Notably, the application of bronchoscopy was important for early detection of the patient’s respiratory conditions. However, bronchoscopic results have rarely been reported and utilized in treating children with S. aureus co-infection that is secondary to IAV. In this case, we removed the obstruction of the trachea and lung with the assistance of bronchoscopy findings. Moreover, we could wash the diseased area of alveoli through alveolar lavage and subsequently analyzed the BAL fluid for bacterial infection. Bronchoscopy has also been reported in the case of Sharp et al. (12). Copious cloudy secretions, fibrinous debris, and patchy plaques were found in the main bronchi and distal trachea. We should pay more attention to the application opportunity of bronchoscope. Thoracoscopy was also the key for this potentially fatal pleural empyema caused by MRSA and IAV coinfection when patient developed pleural adhesion and multiple cavities. In addition, the application of drugs was also critical. In our case, we covered the positive cocci in the initial treatment. We timely adjusted antibiotics by detecting the drug resistance of S. aureus, which effectively controlled the S. aureus infection. Due to the application of flexible bronchoscopy, thoracoscopy and adequate anti-infective treatment, we could successfully relieve the patient’s uncomfortable respiratory conditions, and let the patient be discharged within 3-weeks of hospitalization. TABLE 2 Table 2. The clinical characteristics and results of the literature review of the IAV and S. aureus coinfection. In conclusion, due to the synergistic pathogenic effects between the influenza virus and coinfecting respiratory bacteria, we should raise awareness regarding the rarely occurring severe respiratory infections by S. aureus, following influenza for early diagnosis and rapid recovery from respiratory complications in children. In addition, this study suggests a need for further research about risk factors of secondary S. aureus infection of IAV.

(Courant file photo)ExpandBy Hartford CourantUPDATED: August 23, 2022 at 2:09 PM ESTCOVID-19 has dominated global attention for more than two years, but the flu also is deadly, particularly among older adults.The University of Connecticut and Jackson Lab are now researching age-related changes in the immune system and will recruit and follow 60 older adults who will receive three influenza vaccines over three years.The $9 million study funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases will examine changes in the immune system that reduce individuals’ responses to the influenza vaccine and try to determine if immune responses can be boosted with next-generation vaccines.“Older adults are the most likely to be hospitalized or die from any infection, but particularly an influenza infection or COVID for that matter,” said George Kuchel, a professor of medicine and director of the UConn Center on Aging.Influenza causes about 36,000 deaths each year in the U.S. and disproportionally affects adults over the age of 65, researchers say. The vulnerability to infections is due to an age-related decline in the immune system, Kuchel said.Changes due to age weaken the immune system, placing older people at greater risk for severe illness from influenza. Aging may also reduce the body’s ability to mount a strong immune response after receiving the influenza vaccine.Jackson Lab, which specializes in genomic research — sequencing and analyzing an organism’s genome, or the DNA content within one cell of an organism, contributing to personalized medicine — is participating by using genomic technology.By profiling blood antibodies and immune cells over time, the study will associate age-related immune changes that will, or will not, respond to vaccines. It will allow researchers to identify biological pathways to make the vaccine effective, said Duygu Ucar, an associate professor at Jackson Lab and a faculty member at the UConn School of Medicine Genomics and Genome Medicine. Kuchel said researchers will test which vaccines work best and those that are best for each person. “That gets to the issue of the personalized, the precision component,” he said.Researchers are looking for volunteers to participate in the three-year study. To participate, participants must be 65 or older by Sept. 1, must have no history of heart disease, kidney failure, diabetes requiring insulin, autoimmune disorders, immunosuppressive disorders or be on immunosuppressive medications.Participants will receive a standard vaccine the first year. In the second year they will receive FLUAD, a vaccine that adds an immune stimulant. In the third year, participants will receive a Messenger RNA, or (mRNA) using anti-COVID-19 technology, to induce cells to make a protein triggering an immune response.Volunteers will make six visits in each of the first two years, and seven visits in the third year and blood samples will be collected at 16 visits.Flu cases rose in Connecticut last winter after posting little activity the previous year. In January, 76 hospitalizations and three deaths related to the flu were recorded, up from 14 hospitalizations and one death the previous year’s entire flu season.Nationally, 20,000 to 50,000 deaths are recorded in a typical flu season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Ucar said researchers have learned from studying COVID-19 that age and sex are factors in the severity of the virus. Researchers want to improve their predictions of who will respond to which vaccine and “who might benefit from which vaccine,” she said.The studies will help researchers understand what predicts strong responses to each vaccine and eventually personalize vaccine recommendations, she said.Stephen Singer can be reached at ssinger@courant.com.

Daily Paws' Editorial Guidelines Updated on August 23, 2022 In This Article View All In This Article Can Dogs Get the Flu from Humans? How Dog Flu Spreads Signs and Symptoms Treatment Prevention Unfortunately, getting sick is just a part of life—Even for our dogs. Dogs can and do get the flu, but it's different from the flu humans get. For dogs, this is an almost purely respiratory illness (unlike human versions which can include the stomach flu). There are two distinct viruses that cause canine flu or influenza. The first dog flu virus to be isolated in North America was the H3N8 influenza virus in 2004 in Florida in racing greyhounds. The second one, which showed up in Chicago in 2015, is the H3N2 canine influenza virus. Can Dogs Get the Flu from Humans? First, it is important to note that dogs and people don't share their flu viruses. So dogs can't get the flu from humans and vice versa. You could carry canine virus particles on your clothes if you were around a sick dog, but the risk is low. Still, change before petting your dog if you have any concerns of passing the virus from one dog to another. Can Dogs Get Colds? How Dog Flu Spreads Since these viruses are airborne, most dogs become infected from being around another dog who has the flu virus and coughs, barks, or sneezes—which puts the virus into the air that your dog then breathes in. It typically takes 2 to 4 days after exposure before you'll notice your dog showing signs of illness. Dogs with the H3N8 flu virus are considered to be contagious for 10 days after exposure, while dogs with the H3N2 strain of flu can be contagious for up to 26 days. About a quarter of the dogs who are exposed and infected will not show any signs of illness but they can still spread the virus. melissabrock1 / Getty Virus particles can also live for a time on food and water dishes, toys, and blankets used by infected dogs. Coughing and sneezing dogs should be isolated from other dogs in your family. We Probably Need to Start Washing Our Dogs' Food Bowls More Often Dog Flu Symptoms Mild cases of dog flu can mimic other respiratory illnesses like a cold or kennel cough. Unfortunately, many cases are more serious. Dogs with canine flu show symptoms such as: Coughing Sneezing Discharge from the eyes and nose Fever Difficulty breathing Lethargy Very serious cases can progress to pneumonia and some of these dogs can potentially die. It's important to seek prompt help from your veterinarian if you start to spot any of these signs of dog flu. Here's Why the Bordetella Vaccine Is So Important Canine Influenza Treatment There is no specific treatment for dog flu. Because this is a virus, antibiotics won't help, though if your dog gets a secondary pneumonia, your veterinarian will prescribe antibiotics for that. Very ill dogs will need hospitalization including supplemental oxygen. If you notice your dog showing signs of canine flu, contact your vet. He or she may give you tips for home care such as feeding your dog chicken broth (low sodium please!), and possibly giving some extra vitamins or supplements to support his immune system. Here's When to Take Your Dog to the Vet Cough suppressants are used in some cases, but do not give your dog human cough medications on your own! If your dog has a fever and is lethargic, has trouble breathing, and is not eating or drinking well, he should be seen at the vet clinic. Give the clinic a heads up that your dog has a respiratory illness as they will need to keep your dog isolated from other patients. If your pup has any eye or nose discharge, gently clean the affected areas at least twice a day. Warm compresses are best for softening up crusty discharges, but test it on yourself to ensure it is not too hot before applying to your dog's skin. Preventing Illness With Dog Flu Shots Luckily, there is a vaccine that covers both versions of the canine flu virus. This is not a "core" vaccine, meaning it is recommended for dogs who are at risk of getting the flu, not all dogs. If your dog goes to dog training classes, competes in dog sports, spends time at a boarding facility, or hangs out at doggy daycare, your vet will probably recommend the vaccination. Like the human versions of flu vaccines, the dog flu vaccine may not totally prevent any illness in your dog, but it should reduce the severity of symptoms.

Back Annual report 2022 Home News Mechanism behind deadly fungal infection on top of influenza or Covid-19 deciphered Mechanism behind deadly fungal infection on top of influenza or Covid-19 deciphered 25 August 2022 Over 15 per cent of all critically ill patients who end up in intensive care with severe influenza or Covid-19 additionally develop aspergillosis, a pulmonary fungal infection. This doubles their mortality rate. A UZ Leuven and KU Leuven trial with international partners has revealed that multiple dysfunctions of the immune response lie at the basis of higher susceptibility to fungal infections. These insights were published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine and constitute an important first step towards increasing the survival rate of patients with these severe lung infections. Op deze pagina Compromised immune system Therapeutic target More about the study Related In healthy people, an Aspergillus infection hardly ever leads to illness. For critically ill patients with an underlying influenza or Covid-19 infection, however, aspergillosis can be deadly. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people worldwide end up in intensive care with influenza or Covid-19. About 15 per cent of them develop an additional lung infection with the common fungus Aspergillus (aspergillosis). In healthy people, this infection hardly ever leads to illness. For critically ill patients with an underlying influenza or Covid-19 infection, however, aspergillosis can be deadly: the fungus can start to grow in the tissue of their respiratory tract and lungs and cause irreversible damage. The mortality rate of these patients becomes 40%-50%, about twice as high as that of ICU patients who only have severe influenza or Covid-19. Compromised immune system To find out why some patients with severe influenza or Covid-19 also develop aspergillosis and what to do about it, UZ Leuven and KU Leuven researchers set up an observational study, together with international colleagues. The study uncovered part of the mechanism that opens the door to an additional fungal infection in patients with an influenza or coronavirus infection. Prof. dr. Joost Wauters (UZ Leuven/KU Leuven), intensivist and the principal investigator of the study, explained: “We discovered that, in patients with serious influenza or Covid-19 who develop this type of fungal infection, the innate immune system had been affected in various areas. Their immune cells, which in healthy people are responsible for eliminating fungal spores in the lungs, were compromised. Furthermore, the white blood cells that would normally clean up fungal hyphae did not seem to function properly in those influenza or Covid-19 patients. It was surprising to see that partly similar deviating immune processes come into play in both Covid-19 and influenza.” Dr. Simon Feys, internist in training at UZ Leuven and doctoral researcher at KU Leuven, added: “In tissue stainings, we also saw that the corona or influenza virus affects the epithelium of the lungs. This is the layer of cells that lines the respiratory tract and lung tissue, which forms the first barrier against infections. For Covid-19, we were able to show that specifically in the locations where the virus affects the epithelium, the fungus also penetrates the tissue.” Therapeutic target Johan Van Weyenbergh (KU Leuven Rega Institute), PhD, who is the co-lead of the study, said: “With this information, we can develop biomarkers that help to predict which patients are more susceptible to a fungal infection and therefore need close follow-up.” Professor Agostinho Carvalho (University of Braga, Portugal), who also co-lead the study, added: “Our results also lead the way for further research into medication that can repair the affected processes of the immune system and, as a result, suppress the fungal infection.” More about the study The study was performed using lung samples of 169 patients with influenza or Covid-19, with or without aspergillosis. Most of the samples were collected over the last couple of years via bronchoalveolar lavage, a classical diagnostic technique for suspected lung infections, and stored in the Leuven biobank. In 2018, Professor Joost Wauters and his team were the first to report the dangerous combination of aspergillosis and influenza, which led to worldwide vigilance in intensive care units. The current follow-up study now uncovers the mechanism, which will pave the way for the development of biomarkers and modified treatments for patients with this double infection. The corona pandemic made it interesting to include the samples of patients with Covid-19 as well as samples of patients with influenza. The study was performed in collaboration with various research groups of KU Leuven and UZ Leuven, as well as researchers from ZNA (Belgium), the University of Braga (Portugal), the Max Planck Research Unit for Neurogenetics in Frankfurt (Germany), CHU Amiens-Picardie (France) and the Radboud Universiteit in Nijmegen (The Netherlands). The study was part of the Horizon 2020 HDM-FUN project. Read the published article in the leading medical journal The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. Wauters Joost, prof. dr.

Thousands of gannets, puffins and murres have died from avian influenza.Ian Jones suggests halting the murre hunt, covering garbage and improving bio-security at poultry farmsMike Moore · CBC News · Posted: Aug 26, 2022 6:30 AM EDT | Last Updated: August 26, 2022Social SharingThousands of gannets, puffins and murres have died from avian influenza in Newfoundland and Labrador this summer. (Patrick Butler/Radio-Canada)It has been a disastrous summer for Newfoundland and Labrador's bird populations. Thousands of gannets, puffins and murres, which once overran seaside cliffs that now sit half-empty, have died from avian influenza.Memorial University biology professor Ian Jones is one of the experts watching the tragedy unfold."We're a little bit helpless as to responding tactically to it. In other words, we can't offer the birds a vaccine, we can't try to rehabilitate birds that are ill," Jones said Thursday. "All we can do right now is count carcasses."Jones has come up with three suggestions that he thinks could reduce the spread of the fast-spreading and deadly strain of the virus.First, the province should halt the hunting of the common murre, one of the species most impacted by the spread of the virus, he said.Like most seabirds, said Jones, murres — also known as turrs — need to live about four or five years before they're able to breed. As the avian flu spreads through the population, killing younger murres, there are few left to breed and replace the adult birds killed by the virus.Even then, said Jones, most seabirds have a clutch size of only one egg, so they are unable to easily replace adult birds killed in a flu outbreak.Memorial University biology professor Ian Jones says he would like to see a halt to Newfoundland and Labrador's annual murre hunt. (Wikimedia Commons)He said Newfoundland and Labrador's annual murre hunt needs to be carefully managed over the next few years and account for the loss of a substantial proportion of the population. "I would like to see a halt in the hunt while we consider what's going on," said Jones."If we have thousands of hunters pursuing and hunting murres, which have already been devastated by the virus, that's not good for the hunt and that's not good for the birds."Landfills In recent months, government officials have asked people to take down their backyard bird feeders and stop feeding birds in parks to prevent birds from congregating and potentially causing the flu situation to get worse. Preventing birds from grouping in large numbers is good idea, said Jones, but landfills are a much bigger problem than backyard bird feeders."The idea that congregating huge numbers of birds in concentrated locations by feeding them is likely to be a problem, I'm totally on board with that," he said. "In St. John's, at the Robin Hood Bay landfill, we have tens of thousands of gulls congregating on basically free food all year, especially in the winter. Those birds are interacting with each other and I hypothesize that that's a giant avian flu spreader."Covering up garbage at landfills would reduce the number of gulls and, in turn, reduce the virus's spreadFarming concernsLastly, industrial agriculture, such as chicken farms, are a source of high spread, said Jones. "It's the interaction between wild birds and the commercial poultry industry that is particularly tragic right now. The farmers, especially on the Prairies, had to do huge culls related to this because avian flu got into their flocks," he said. "It's economically devastating."Avian flu responsible for thousands of dead birds in Newfoundland, suggest preliminary testsAvian flu spreads further into Newfoundland's bird populations — but deaths seem to have slowedJones said the commercial operators could protect themselves and other businesses by improving their flocks' bio-security."Absolutely prevent any contact between wild birds and commercial poultry, ducks, things like that," he said. "It's tragic but unfortunately that means a lot of outdoor operations will have to drastically change."Impact of the virus uncertainEarlier this summer, Chris Mooney, who was an interpretation officer at the Cape St. Mary's Ecological Reserve for two decades, said the population had taken a big hit due to the disease. "They live an average of 30 years and they mate for life, so we're losing mates," he said at the time. "We don't know the impact. Nobody knows the impact."Read more from CBC Newfoundland and LabradorWith files from The BroadcastCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Avian flu responsible for thousands of dead birds in Newfoundland, suggest preliminary tests Avian flu spreads further into Newfoundland's bird populations — but deaths seem to have slowedAdd some “good” to your morning and evening.Subscribe to our daily newsletter for the top stories in Newfoundland and Labrador.Email address:SubscribeCurrent TimeIgnore this field.

This common flu was first recognized in the year 2009. The virus can be transmitted to humans when they come in contact with the infected pigs or environments which are contaminated with swine influenza viruses. Several studies have showed that in this flu; virus is made up of genes that were very similar to the ones that caused influenza among swine (pigs). Just like humans, pigs can even get the flu. However, we now know that the H1N1 flu virus is made up of genes from several different flu viruses which normally circulate among pigs, birds and humans. Similar to the regular flu, swine flu can lead to some serious illnesses like lung infection, pneumonia and other breathing problems. Also, the flu can make an illness even more worse like diabetes or asthma.The flu was first recognized in the spring 2009.Photo Credit: iStockAlso read: Swine Flu: 7 Best Home RemediesCauses of H1N1 virus are:H1N1 influenza virus primarily infects the cells in your nose, throat and lungs.

Coughs and sneezes It is quite possible that while suffering from the flu you cough and sneeze quite often. For this, it is always better that you cover your face with a mask. This will help you avoid contaminating your hands. Also change your handkerchiefs and tissue quite often.4. Avoid contactIf possible, stay away from crowds. Also keep in mind that if you are at a high risk of complications from the flu (for instance, if you are younger than five years of age, older than 65 years of age, or pregnant) you should avoid going to crowded and public places.5. LiquidsYou should drink plenty of fluids during this illness in order to avoid dehydration. Warm soups, water, fresh fruit and vegetable juices will help you keep hydrated all day long.Keep yourself hydrated.Photo Credit: iStock6.

Despite this, in 1918, while World War One was still being fought, there was an outbreak of a deadly disease that killed thousands of people in Britain. This was known as Spanish influenza.Spread and impactFigure caption, A man spraying an anti-flu preparation on a London General Omnibus Co bus to try to kill the Spanish flu virus in London in 1920Nobody is certain about the origins of Spanish influenza (usually called Spanish flu). The first confirmed cases were in the United States in March 1918. However, some people believe it started in China and was carried to the trenches in Europe by labourers who were working in French army camps. In any case, it soon spread to almost every nation in the world.The virus came in waves. The second wave was the most deadly and it struck Britain between October and December 1918. It spread at an alarming rate as soldiers returned home from the trenches of World War One and as crowds celebrated the armistice in November. It died down but a third wave hit the country between February and May 1919.Altogether, around 25 per cent of the British population caught the flu and 228,000 of those people died. Globally, the virus is believed to have killed at least 50 million people.SymptomsThe Spanish flu was unusual in the sense that fit, younger people, between ages 20 and 40, were worst affected. The symptoms were initially the same as those of other types of flu:high temperature chills headaches painsHowever, the virus often attacked the immune system and caused victims to develop a bacterial pneumonia.closepneumoniaA deadly disease that affects the respiratory system. This caused skin to turn red, blue and black. Victims bled from the nose, mouth and ears. People often died within just hours of their first symptoms. It was very frightening.ResponsesNational responsesThis was an epidemiccloseepidemicAn infectious disease which spreads rapidly to a large number of people in a short period of time. on a scale not previously seen in the modern era. It hit at a time when huge numbers of medical staff were still away at war.The government issued a public information film that advised people to:stay at home and avoid public transport and crowds if they had symptoms ventilate rooms allowing air to enter and circulate freely keep fit use handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing keep places of work clean wear face masks if it was necessary to be near flu patientsThe film was designed to shock people so that they paid attention to the dangers and took preventative measures. To achieve this, it showed the number of deaths. However, the film was not distributed until late in the second wave, and there were insufficient copies.There was no nationwide or coordinated lockdowncloselockdownAn official order to control the movement of people because of a dangerous situation. across the country and local authorities were mostly left to organise themselves. Nevertheless, the epidemic did, in part, lead to the Ministry of Health being set up in 1919. This was a national organisation dedicated solely to developing health policy.Local responsesThe effectiveness of local responses to the Spanish flu varied a great deal:The medical officer in Manchester, Dr James Niven, was very thorough and worked tirelessly to limit the fluâs spread. For example, he published advice about hygiene and organised the closure of businesses and schools. The death rate was lower in Manchester than in other cities, such as Glasgow and London. Many towns and cities shut schools, theatres, cinemas and dance halls. Some also disinfected public transport daily. However, factories kept going, pubs mostly stayed open and Armistice Day celebrations went ahead. The press wasnât always helpful. The News of the World told its readers to âeat plenty of porridgeâ. The Manchester Guardian mocked some of the suggested measures: âWomen are not going to wear ugly masks.â Several âquackâ remedies appeared on the market, such as Dr Williamsâ Pink Pills for Pale People. These were medical treatments not based on science or evidence.Next pageResponses to HIV and AIDSPrevious pageLiving conditions - air and inactivityMore guides on this topicThe people's health overview - OCR B Medieval Britain and the people's health, c.1250-c.1500 - OCR B Early modern Britain and the people's health, c.1500-c.1750 - OCR B Industrial Britain and the people's health, c.1750-c.1900 - OCR B Exploring change and continuity - OCR B Related linksPersonalise your Bitesize!

Fourteen cases within area wild bird populations have been recorded in so far. The cases are concentrated in Sonoma, Solano and Mendocino counties, with no known cases in Marin and Napa counties. When it comes to poultry, no cases of H5N1 have been detected among the North Bay’s flocks of chickens, according to the California Department of Fish & Wildlife, state Food and Agriculture agency as well as county ag commissioners and farm bureaus. Symptoms in birds include reduced food and water consumption and lethargy, according to the state Department of Food and Agriculture. Though rare, avian influenza may affect humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that as a general precaution, whenever possible, people should avoid contact with wild birds and observe them only from a distance. Besides chickens, the virus may afflict turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese and guinea fowl. It’s carried by free-flying waterfowl. But the idea that the flu is present in some places is raising alarm bells for agriculture leaders and veterinarians, fearing the migratory season may increase the chances of a spread from wild birds to domesticated flocks. There’s no cure or treatment. That worry increases because of the severe drought along birds’ migratory routes. “Yes, drought has definitely had an impact. When you have migratory birds in the Pacific byway looking for sources of water, few and far between, they’re going to land in the same ponds,” Sonoma County Agriculture Commissioner Andrew Smith told the Business Journal. Smith’s office sent a letter to local egg producers a few weeks ago warning them of the county’s 11 recorded cases from July 21 to Aug. 9. The virus was found in Canada geese, white pelican, wood duck and turkey vulture populations. The last outbreak of avian flu under a different variant in Sonoma County was reported in 2014 and 2015. In Solano County, Agriculture Commissioner Ed King said: “It’s been found in multiple states and now California. We expected it. The whole county should be on alert.” King, while following guidance from the state, has advised his county’s poultry farmers to limit the number of people who have contact with the chickens and for handlers to wear protective gear. The deadly bird disease was found in a swan and two white pelicans in this county. “This way they don’t pick something up inadvertently and give it to the birds,” King said, also suggesting the farmers try to keep the birds indoors where they have access to their own water source. In Petaluma, Tara Firma Farms’ logistics manager, Brandon Connaughton, noted his farm is already ahead of the game on that matter. The flock of about 500 chickens at the Sonoma County facility has water dispensaries to drink out of instead of sharing a water source with other birds. The public is not allowed access. “We don’t have that many people tend to them (either),” he said. “They’re outside, but that’s their lifestyle.” On Aug. 17 Solano County Farm Bureau Manager Lisa Shipley put out a bulletin to warn her organization’s farming members. Shipley has already brought her backyard chickens inside the coops. “Commercial operations are cognizant on biosecurity, but even people who have backyard coops should care,” she said. “Once it gets into a poultry farms, it’s hard to control because it spreads too fast.” Once evidence of infection is found, all birds in the group must be destroyed. “If one is detected, they have to euthanize the entire barn,” said Maurice Pitesky, a UC Davis Cooperative Extension associate professor in the Poultry Health and Food Safety Epidemiology department in the School of Veterinary Medicine. Oddly, vaccination can allow the virus to spread as the vaccinated birds can become asymptomatic carriers. “So, there’s an economic incentive not to,” he said of vaccinations. Also, the United States could see souring trade relations, if it’s exporting infected birds, allowing the virus to spread. Our nation represents one in three of the largest poultry providers in the world, along with China and Brazil. Pitesky said it’s the first time this type of variant has shown up in wild birds in the North Bay. “I’ve never seen it as ubiquitous like this before,” Pitesky said.

In an interview with Pharmacy Times, Francesca Ceddia, MD, senior vice president of respiratory vaccines at Moderna, said the company is in early stages of development for a combined mRNA vaccine for influenza, COVID-19, and RSV. Such a vaccine could prove effective, while also improving vaccine rates.Aislinn Antrim: Excitingly, Moderna is also developing a new combination respiratory vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV. So where does this work currently stand?Francesca Ceddia, MD: So, currently it is preclinical, but by the end of the year we will be able to start a phase 1 clinical trial. And we have observed in preclinical results a very strong immune response against all the antigens. So, this is very encouraging. And we have also started a combination COVID and flu [vaccine], which is clearly very relevant, particularly when it comes to the fall season. And then, you know, we will progress more and more into additional combinations. That's another important feature of mRNA vaccines, particularly our mRNA platform, which allows for including more and more antigens in combination.Aislinn Antrim: Absolutely. And how would such a combination vaccine change the immunization landscape for people?Francesca Ceddia, MD: Well, imagine that if you have to go to the doctor and get a shot, that’s either 2 shots in 2 different arms, or you can get 1 shot in the same arm. I think we would all want to have a combination vaccine, right? And this is quite typical in the pediatric space, because the majority of the pediatric vaccines are vaccines in combination, to avoid giving too many injections to children who have to be up to date with a number of vaccines. So, having, for example, a COVID [and] flu vaccine or COVID, flu, [and] RSV vaccine, also in adults who are less familiar with vaccination, then younger children, is a major advantage in adherence to vaccination. And, and therefore, I mean, we have the opportunity to tackle 2 diseases or 3 diseases at the same time. That will be quite brilliant.Aislinn Antrim: Definitely. COVID-19 booster shots have been a major area of interest, particularly with upcoming colder months and rumors that there may be more booster shots coming out soon. What work is Moderna doing in this area?Francesca Ceddia, MD: So, clearly COVID-19 remains a critical area of focus for us. We're still in the pandemic, there are a lot of things that we are all learning, and the epidemiology is shifting very rapidly. So, we have made major progress with our booster strategy because we have identified the opportunity to put together the original Wuhan strain with an additional strain. And now we did several studies with different strains, depending on which epidemiological stage we were. We tried, for example, the Wuhan strain with beta when beta was relevant, and now we are in the Omicron era. And so, we have just come out with in 1 country—actually the UK was the first country to approve our bivalent vaccine, which contains Wuhan plus the BA.1 Omicron variant of concern. And we believe that there are a number of countries who will follow and will continue to approve this vaccine very soon.In the US, we have guidance from the FDA to include another variant of concerns, which is again, a sub-variant of Omicron, which is BA.4 and BA.5 in this vaccine. So, upon request of the regulatory authority, we rapidly shifted to also produce this vaccine, which is currently in testing. And we will hopefully be submitting soon to the FDA for approval in preparation for the fall. So, there is a lot ongoing. We are constantly scouting the epidemiological environment to understand what the next variant to come is, but at this stage, we believe we're really ahead of the curve because for once we are not reacting but we were prepared to address the Omicron advent quite rapidly.Aislinn Antrim: Wonderful. That's good to hear. You touched on this, but a combination vaccine could reduce the need for multiple seasonal shots. How could this potentially improve vaccination rates as people are kind of tired of getting more and more boosters, and the flu shot? And it's a little overwhelming for a lot of people.Francesca Ceddia, MD: So, there are several elements where people don't get vaccinated. And sometimes it's some fatigue, like in the case of COVID-19, but sometimes it's a practical aspect, right? You know, if you imagine an adult that has to go to maybe several visits for several vaccinations, I mean, that can be a bit overwhelming, right? So, I think a combination is an amazing, pragmatic approach to vaccination. How could you refuse to get protection against multiple viruses into 1 shot, whereas you would normally receive, let's say, 2 to 3 shots. And I mean, I think that can be an opportunity to enhance vaccination rates and coverage. And this is extremely important, particularly in an age category with the adults and older adults. They are, as I mentioned before, less acquainted with vaccination. And so hopefully, we will have a way forward with a combination vaccines.Aislinn Antrim: Wonderful. We've covered a lot of ground. What should pharmacists know about respiratory vaccines when they're talking to patients or counseling patients?Francesca Ceddia, MD: In the pharmacy, pharmacists play an incredibly important role. And we have seen this through COVID-19. I think the collaboration of the pharmacists and many other health care practitioners has definitely helped a lot in addressing the emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic. So many more [patients] have gotten more and more acquainted with vaccination. So, on top of flu, which many of them were probably more aware of, now they're aware of COVID-19 and so in the future, hopefully, they will be aware also of RSV. And so, explaining the importance to patients when they go to the pharmacist, to the pharmacies, how important it is to get vaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases. Nobody wants to get an acute lower respiratory tract infection, nobody wants to run the risk of ending up hospitalized, right? So, I think pharmacists play a very important role. And ultimately, for vaccination, of course, patients have to consult also with their doctors, but information given by the pharmacist is going to be more and more of absolute importance.Related VideosRelated Content AdvertisementNovember 9th 2024Staying in the Know: Pharmacists, Drug Shortages, and What Lies AheadOlivia Riggi, PharmD CandidateSeptember 19th 2024Public Health Matters: The Difference Between Misinformation and Disinformation, and How Information Can Inform Evidence-Based DecisionsNovember 8th 2024Researchers Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Brivudine as Oral Shingles Treatment Kennedy Ferruggia, Assistant EditorAugust 22nd 2024Public Health Matters: Healthcare Advocate Summit Emphasizes Advocates Have a Voice in Creating SolutionsNovember 8th 2024Moderna Bivalent COVID-19 Vaccine More Effective at Preventing Hospitalization in High-Risk Patients Compared With Pfizer-BioNTech VaccineLuke Halpern, Assistant EditorNovember 8th 2024History of Concussion Associated With Higher Risk of Adverse Psychiatric Outcomes PostpartumGillian McGovern, Assistant EditorRelated Content AdvertisementNovember 9th 2024Staying in the Know: Pharmacists, Drug Shortages, and What Lies AheadOlivia Riggi, PharmD CandidateSeptember 19th 2024Public Health Matters: The Difference Between Misinformation and Disinformation, and How Information Can Inform Evidence-Based DecisionsNovember 8th 2024Researchers Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Brivudine as Oral Shingles Treatment Kennedy Ferruggia, Assistant EditorAugust 22nd 2024Public Health Matters: Healthcare Advocate Summit Emphasizes Advocates Have a Voice in Creating SolutionsNovember 8th 2024Moderna Bivalent COVID-19 Vaccine More Effective at Preventing Hospitalization in High-Risk Patients Compared With Pfizer-BioNTech VaccineLuke Halpern, Assistant EditorNovember 8th 2024History of Concussion Associated With Higher Risk of Adverse Psychiatric Outcomes PostpartumGillian McGovern, Assistant EditorConsent PreferencesAbout UsClinical ForumsAdvertiseContact UsEditorial StaffPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDo Not Sell My InformationContact Info2 Commerce Drive Cranbury, NJ 08512609-716-7777© 2024 MJH Life Sciences All rights reserved.Flu Vaccinations For Children: Don&#039;t Ignore Them During The COVID-19 Pandemic | TheHealthSite.com ENG LatestNewsDiseasesType 1 DiabetesType 2 DiabetesCancerHeart AttackPneumoniaDiseases A-ZDiet & FitnessPregnancyConceivingInfertilityLabour & DeliveryPregnancy week-by-weekBreastfeedingBaby NamesWomen's HealthMen's HealthSexual HealthVideosMental HealthYogaPhotosWeb StoriesHome remediesAYUSHHerbsUnaniSiddhaHomeopathyNaturopathyParentingAyurveda LatestNewsDiseasesType 1 DiabetesType 2 DiabetesCancerHeart AttackPneumoniaDiseases A-ZDiet & FitnessPregnancyConceivingInfertilityLabour & DeliveryPregnancy week-by-weekBreastfeedingBaby NamesWomen's HealthMen's HealthSexual HealthVideosMental HealthYogaPhotosWeb StoriesHome remediesAYUSHHerbsUnaniSiddhaHomeopathyNaturopathyParentingAyurveda Select Language English इंग्लिश Hindi हिंदी Home Parenting Childrens Health Parenting Flu Vaccinations For Children: Don't Ignore Them During The COVID-19 Pandemic Amid COVID, many diseases like influenza took a backseat which needs equal importance. Here's why your child should be vaccinated against COVID. Written by Editorial Team |Updated : August 24, 2022 6:01 PM IST Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it's essential to remember that influenza is also a highly contagious respiratory virus leading to severe illness and even death in children. So, parents need to see t it that they get their children vaccinated on time. Children should be given a flu shot to be able to stay hale and hearty during the pandemic. Read on to know more about this, and schedule the vaccination right away! After all, you cannot take it lightly when it comes to your child's health. Flu cases are on the rise due to a sudden change in the climate. Not many children get vaccinated for flu and tend to suffer a lot. If the children avoid taking the flu shot then they might end up being hospitalized. Hence, you need to take the shot as recommended by the doctor. The flu vaccination lowers the risk of having respiratory issues like pneumonia, which increase one's risk of COVID-19, and protects against viral infection. Don't forget to administer the shot the doctor has prescribed.

For Kim Marty, senior data manager at the VEC, one of the biggest challenges was ensuring the success of the study in the face of unprecedented enrolment. Kim Marty, senior data manager, Vaccine Evaluation Center. Credit: BC Children’s Hospital Research Institute “That study ballooned really quickly and we ended up enrolling over 1.8 million participants,” she says. The Vaccine Evaluation Center (VEC) is Canada’s first academic center for independent vaccine research and an international leader in vaccinology research. Marty’s data management team at the VEC helps design study databases and maintain data quality control. They worked more closely than ever with the faculty of medicine’s digital solutions team and BC Children’s Hospital Research Institute’s IT department and data management team to tackle the technical challenges. “We ended up amalgamating 70 databases to complete phase one of the CANVAS-COVID project,” says Marty, noting the study continues as six-month to four-year-olds are now being vaccinated. She’s proud that her team — with the enthusiastic help of collaborators — was able to provide weekly safety reports to the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canada’s COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, provincial stakeholders and study investigators, as well as weekly study summaries on the CANVAS-COVID study results webpage. “That study ballooned really quickly and we ended up enrolling over 1.8 million participants.” Kim Marty The study has delivered real-world, real-time evidence to show that COVID-19 vaccines are safe, helping inform public policy decisions and vaccination campaigns. A recent paper from the team, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, clearly demonstrated that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy – providing much needed reassurance to concerned parents-to-be. “In the early stages of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, there was low vaccine uptake among pregnant people due to concerns about data availability and vaccine safety,” says Dr. Manish Sadarangani, director of the VEC and an associate professor of pediatrics at UBC. “This study adds to the growing body of evidence that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are safe during pregnancy.” How the previous pandemic prepared the team for COVID-19 The VEC has studied the safety of the flu vaccine every year for the past decade, but those studies enrol approximately 50,000 participants. That is less than three per cent of current enrollment in the CANVAS-COVID study. Experts at the VEC had completed preliminary work on a pandemic preparedness plan when COVID-19 hit. The framework from the influenza vaccine surveillance studies, pandemic planning and Marty’s 30 years of experience in data management at the VEC helped them spring into action. Since so many COVID-19-related studies started at the same time, with constantly shifting public health guidelines and new developments, it was sometimes overwhelming for Marty’s team. When it came to monitoring vaccine side effects, the team expected to have more time. The first COVID-19 vaccine was forecast to be approved by June 2021, and then that date kept shifting earlier — from April, to February, to January to December 2020. “We thought we had another six months to work out our data management systems,” Marty says, “but then we realized that we had to be ready before Christmas. This meant several teams putting in a lot of long hours to be ready in time. The first project went live on December 23, 2020.” The hours were similar to those she logged when the H1N1, or swine flu, pandemic swept into Canada from the southern U.S. in 2009 with high hospitalization rates in young children. Marty worked around the clock to ensure data from half-a-dozen simultaneous clinical trials of new vaccines could be swiftly collected and analyzed to stop swine flu in its tracks. The processes and procedures that she and her team developed remain the core part of the pandemic preparedness plan for the Canadian Immunization Research Network. In 2019, UBC president Santa Ono cited this H1N1 pandemic work when he awarded Marty the President’s Staff Award for Creativity and Innovation — one of only 19 awards given to the university’s more than 16,000 employees. The hard work is worth it Marty says the intense times are worth it because the VEC is a great place to work and she values its mission to lead high-quality, independent vaccine research to inform safe, effective and trusted immunization programs for all. “The research we do is really important, which makes me strive to get it done and contribute to knowledge and decision-making.” Kim Marty “I’m super proud of the VEC, the work we do, and our approach of being an objective evaluator,” Marty says. “The research we do is really important, which makes me strive to get it done and contribute to knowledge and decision-making.” The Vaccine Evaluation Center is jointly supported by UBC and the BC Children’s Hospital Research Institute.

Know the difference in symptoms of the two diseases from an expert. India has reported a sudden spurt in tomato flu cases in children. As many as 82 cases of tomato fever which was first found in Kerala's Kollam district, have been reported so far. Like coronavirus and monkeypox, tomato flu too is a viral infection and is said to be a variant of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD). It mainly affects kids under 5 years of age. Some of its symptoms are similar to Covid, monkeypox, dengue and chikungunya. Like monkeypox, patients infected with tomato flu too develop skin rashes, fever and influenza like symptoms. (Also read: Tomato flu: Know the common symptoms, prevention tips from experts) Monkeypox vs tomato flu: Like monkeypox, patients infected with tomato flu too develop skin rashes, fever and influenza like symptoms. The common symptoms of tomato fever in kids with are high fever, rashes, intense pain in joints. The red and painful blisters gradually enlarge to the size of a tomato. The blisters also resemble those seen with the monkeypox virus in young people. Other symptoms include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, dehydration, swelling of joints, body aches, and common influenza-like symptoms. MONKEYPOX VS TOMATO FEVER: DIAGNOSIS"The side effects of monkeypox in people are similar to those of smallpox or chickenpox as it is caused by the same type of virus. Monkeypox is a communicable disease and is transmitted through close human contact with an infected person or animals like rats, monkeys, or squirrels. However, there is no information on the type of virus responsible for tomato flu. There is no diagnostic test available for tomato flu but we can suspect it basis the symptoms and if no other viral infection is present," says Dr Ravindra Gupta, Department of Internal Medicine, CK Birla Hospital, Gurgaon. MONKEYPOX VS TOMATO FEVER: SYMPTOMSDr Gupta says monkeypox often comes with symptoms like fever, chills, fatigue, weakness, body and muscle aches or swollen lymph nodes and a rash frequently occurs after a couple of days. MONKEYPOX SYMPTOMS:- The rash is a painful red, flat bump, and these bumps covert into blisters that are filled with pus. These are commonly seen on the face, inside the mouth, or hands. It is rare to find rashes on the stomach or legs. - The rashes develop after 2-3 days of fever and these lasts usually from 2-4 weeks. - The symptoms of viral fever and monkeypox are the same but monkeypox shows no signs of cough and cold. - In monkeypox, one of the most important factors examined by doctors is that the patient experiences an increased size of rash. These can be found in the neck or thighs. TOMATO FLU SYMPTOMS- Tomato flu is only found in kids. - There are no known reasons that support or spread tomato flu at this time. - The primary reasons for tomato fever are still being investigated by health authorities. - The infection is called ‘tomato’ flu because of the red and painful blisters that form all over the body and gradually enlarge to the size of a tomato. - Tomato flu has symptoms like viral fever such as body aches, skin irritation, fever, vomiting, loose motions, swelling of joints, etc. MONKEYPOX VS TOMATO FEVER: TREATMENTThere is no specific anti-viral drug used for their treatments. In both cases, the patient is asked to get isolated and avoid meeting other people until the rashes are completely recovered. The infection can spread through rashes as these are communicable diseases. "Prevention depends on decreasing human contact with an infected animal and limiting person-to-person spread. Patients should cover their mouth and nose through masks when in a crowded place. The guideline of covid can also be followed for monkeypox and tomato flu," says Dr Gupta.

Image used for representational purpose only PUNE: The state government has procured 1 lakh doses of the quadrivalent flu shot for free vaccinations among high-risk individuals, including pregnant women and those with underlying conditions, following the rise in H1N1 cases and deaths since June this year.The quadrivalent flu shot protects against four influenza viruses including H1N1/swine flu and three other influenza strains including influenza A and influenza B.The vaccine has been made available at state-run medical colleges and hospitals, district hospitals and municipal hospitals."The flu shot is expensive and many expecting mothers and other high-risk people cannot afford one. So the state government's move to reintroduce the swine flu vaccination will help many," said senior public health expert Dr Subhash Salunke.Pune circle has been allocated the most doses, 43,150. A total of 28,400 doses have been allocated to the Mumbai circle, a senior state health official said.In 2015, the Maharashtra government made the swine flu vaccine (inactivated trivalent flu shot) available for pregnant women and people with obesity, diabetes or hypertension at state-run hospitals, medical colleges, and municipal hospitals following a massive spurt in cases and deaths."Influenza is more likely to cause severe illness in pregnant women. Changes to the immune system, heart and lungs during pregnancy make people more susceptible to influenza severe enough to cause hospitalisation. Influenza may also harm the developing baby," Dr Salunke said. Doctors running maternity units vouch for the vaccine's efficacy in preventing infection. "We advise the flu shot to all pregnant women in the fourth month itself and this has helped us keep expecting mothers safe from swine flu/influenza and its complications," said senior gynecologist Dr Sanjay Gupte.In a developing baby, a common influenza symptom fever may be associated with neural tube defects and other adverse outcomes. "Vaccination of an expecting mother can help protect the baby from influenza after birth," said gynecologist Dr Pankaj Sarode.About the AuthorUmesh IsalkarUmesh Isalkar is principal correspondent at The Times of India, Pune.

Reports of dead birds are rare, but over the last few weeks more than 50 have been recorded.One of the first dead birds collected was fitted with a 3G tracker in 2015 as part of the island’s Track-a-Gannet programme and had flown farthest north of all the tagged gannets that year – 358km.It was found dead on Saye Beach on 22 July and tested positive for bird flu.‘A lot of the birds are washing up dead and we are not seeing all of them, it is very hard to judge.’ said Mr Gauvain.Due to the recording work taking place over the last 15 years, AWT has said it is in a unique position as it allows for progress of the disease to be charted so findings can be reported to the scientific community.French authorities have reported significant numbers washing up onto the country's coastline. A small flock of poultry was culled on 16 August after one case of the disease was discovered within it.Mr Gauvain said that any sick bird will be euthanised in a bid stop the spread.A small flock of chickens has already been destroyed due to the outbreak. Owners are advised to take measures to prevent wild birds having contact with their poultry.‘Avian Influenza is primarily a disease affecting birds and therefore the health risk to the general public is very low,’ said GSC chairman Boyd Kelly.‘However, we want to protect our domestic flocks as well as do our best for our amazing wildlife.’n Anyone finding a dead bird should call the States of Alderney 01481 820080, in Guernsey 01481 234567 and Jersey 01534 441600.
