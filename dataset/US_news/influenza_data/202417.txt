In contrast to other bat influenza viruses, the virus was related to avian A(H9N2) viruses and was probably the result of a bird-to-bat transmission event. To determine the cross-species spill-over potential, we biologically characterize features of A/bat/Egypt/381OP/2017(H9N2). The virus has a pH inactivation profile and neuraminidase activity similar to those of human-adapted IAVs. Despite the virus having an avian virus–like preference for α2,3 sialic acid receptors, it is unable to replicate in male mallard ducks; however, it readily infects ex-vivo human respiratory cell cultures and replicates in the lungs of female mice. A/bat/Egypt/381OP/2017 replicates in the upper respiratory tract of experimentally-infected male ferrets featuring direct-contact and airborne transmission. These data suggest that the bat A(H9N2) virus has features associated with increased risk to humans without a shift to a preference for α2,6 sialic acid receptors.

Influenza A viruses (IAVs) can be found in various animals, with occasional transmission between species2. Although waterfowl are the major natural reservoir for IAVs, infections in mammalian hosts pose the greatest threat to humans. Bats, accounting for approximately 20% of all global mammal species, carry RNA and DNA viruses asymptomatically and are natural reservoirs for multiple zoonotic viruses, including rabies, Nipah, Ebola, and coronaviruses3,4,5,6.In 2009–2010, the first bat-associated IAV was discovered in an asymptomatic little yellow-shouldered bat (Sturnira lilium) in Guatemala. Although the virus had the key structural and genomic properties of IAVs, it was phylogenetically divergent from all known IAV subtypes. With its hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) having only 45% and 24% amino acid identity, respectively, with those of other IAVs, the terminology HA-like and NA-like was adopted for these surface proteins7. This new virus (A/bat/Guat/2009) has, subsequently, been classified as a separate subtype A(H17N10)8. In 2010, another bat-associated influenza virus, A/bat/Peru/2010, was detected in asymptomatic New World flat-faced fruit bats (Artibeus planirostris) in Peru. This virus also could not be classified as any of the existing IAV subtypes, including A(H17N10), and was, therefore, classified as A(H18N11)8.The HA and NA of the A(H17N10) and A(H18N11) viruses are functionally distinct from those of other IAVs3. Whereas conventional IAVs initiate virus replication by entering cells via their apical sides, bat A(H17N10) and A(H18N11) influenza viruses were shown to initiate infection of polarized MDCK II cells through the basolateral surface9. Unlike other IAV HAs, H17 and H18 do not use sialic acid as ligands for attachment. Instead, both H17 and H18 use the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule for entry into host cells2,9. The A(H18N11) virus replicated poorly in mice and ferrets but could infect Jamaican fruit bats, inducing minor signs of disease that were limited to nasal and ocular discharge with virus shedding in rectal specimens10. A(H17N10) and A(H18N11) bat viruses were initially detected in rectal swabs, which suggests a fecal–oral rather than a respiratory mode of transmission11.The high A(H17N10) and A(H18N11) seroprevalence in the bat populations of Central America and South America, respectively, is evidence of the widespread geographic distribution and sustained transmission of these viruses in bat species12. In contrast, no evidence has been found of IAV in European bats13.In 2017, a novel IAV (A/bat/Egypt/381OP/2017) was isolated in Egypt from Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus)3,14. This virus was phylogenetically distant from the A(H17N10) and A(H18N11) viruses and instead represented a distinct HA and NA lineage within the A(H9N2) subtype3. The remaining gene segments of the Egyptian virus also clustered phylogenetically with avian influenza viruses3. A/bat/Egypt/381OP/2017 was primarily detected in oral swabs and, unlike the previous bat influenza viruses, was successfully isolated in chicken eggs3. A study by Halwe et al. showed that inoculating Egyptian fruit bats with A/bat/Egypt/381OP/2017 led to a productive infection and seroconversion. Although viral RNA could not be detected in organs or swabs of contact animals, histopathologic analysis of the contact animals suggested that bat-to-bat transmission of the virus had indeed occurred15.Together, the available data show that bats are hosts to at least two distinct forms of IAV. The first of these groups is represented by the A(H17N10) and A(H18N11) viruses, which are genetically and functionally separated from other IAVs. The genesis of these viruses is unclear. The second group is represented by the A(H9N2)-like virus, which is most parsimoniously explained by a bird-to-bat transmission event. The bat A(H9N2)-like virus has many amino acid changes when compared to avian A(H9N2) viruses, yet the impact of these changes with regard to human health risk is unknown.In this study, we extensively characterize the A/bat/Egypt/381OP/2017 virus to identify the capacity of bats to act as an intermediate host selecting for viral traits associated with mammalian influenza viruses. Our results show that, although the bat A(H9N2)-like virus binds preferentially and strongly to α2,3 glycans, a property associated with avian influenza viruses, it is capable of infecting ex vivo human respiratory cell cultures and replicates in the lungs of mice and in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets, properties associated with human influenza viruses.ResultsHA activation and inactivation pH of the Egyptian bat virusHA stability, or the pH at which the HA protein becomes activated for membrane fusion or inactivated in the absence of target cells, contributes to IAV pathogenicity and transmissibility16. To measure the HA acid stability of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 and A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991, we conducted syncytium formation and virus inactivation assays (Fig. 1A, B). For A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991, the highest pH value at which the HA protein was activated to induce syncytium formation was 5.6, and the midpoint of pH-induced inactivation of infectivity was pH 5.5. In contrast, A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 had an HA activation pH of 6.0 and an inactivation pH of 5.0 (with a 90% reduction in titer at pH 5.3). Such disparities in HA activation pH versus virus inactivation pH have been observed for several swine H1N1 and H3N2 viruses17. At the midpoint of inactivation of A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 (pH 5.5), the titer of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 was reduced by only 0.5 log10 when compared to the titer at higher pH values (Fig. 1B). Therefore, A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 shows resistance to inactivation by exposure to extracellular pH that is similar to that of human-adapted IAV16.Fig. 1: Phenotypic properties of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 (H9N2) influenza virus.A Syncytium formation assay. Monolayers of Vero cells were infected with viruses at an MOI of 3 PFU/cell. At 16 h post infection, cells were treated with TPCK-trypsin, washed, and then treated with pH-adjusted buffers. Cells were then left to recover for 3 h, washed, fixed, and stained for microscopy. Representative images from three independent experiments are shown. B Acid inactivation assay. Viruses were exposed to pH-adjusted buffers at 37 °C for 1 h then neutralized, after which the infectious virus titer was measured by TCID50 assay in MDCK cells. Data from three independent experiments were analyzed with a non-linear regression model by GraphPad Prism, and the calculated virus inactivation pH50 values are shown.

The N10 bat NA, which is highly divergent from the well-established N1–N9 subtypes of IAV NA, lacks NA activity19. To determine whether A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 possessed sialidase activity, we used a modified fluorescence-based assay to measure the NA activity of the virus and of control human influenza A and B viruses. The NA activity of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 was comparable to that of A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) (which has a group 1 NA) and A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) (which has a group 2 NA) (Fig. 1C), indicating that the A(H9N2)-like virus had maintained sialidase activity upon propagation in bats.Receptor specificityWe had previously shown that A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 had receptor-binding residues typical of most avian influenza viruses, with a receptor preference for α2,3-linked sialic acids, as measured by solid-phase binding3. To extend these studies, we conducted a glycan microarray analysis to examine the receptor specificity of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 in finer detail. The glycan microarray comprised synthetic glycans representing various natural sialylated O-linked and N-linked glycans, of which 62 were capped with α2,3-linked sialic acids (avian type) and 50 with α2,6-linked sialic acids (human type). We found that the A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 (H9N2) virus bound exclusively to avian type α2,3-sialosides, including O-linked glycans, N-linked glycans, and linear fragments, including structures terminating with the sialy-Lewis X determinant (NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-4[Fucα1-3]GlcNAc) (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Table 1). The only structures with α2,3-linked sialic acids that were not bound were those that had sialic acid as a branch to an internal galactose (glycans 62–64). Therefore, this bat virus exhibits a receptor specificity typical of avian H9N2 viruses isolated in North America20.Ex vivo replication efficiency in the human respiratory systemTo model the replication potential of A/Bat/Egypt/390OP/2017 in humans, bronchus and lung cells were grown in culture at an air–liquid interface and infected with A/Bat/Egypt/381 OP/2017 (H9N2), A/Hong Kong/483/1997 (H5N1) and A/Duck/Hong Kong/Y280/97 (H9N2) as representative avian influenza viruses, and A/Hong Kong/415742/2009 (H1N1pdm09) as a representative human virus. Consistent with its human origin, A/Hong Kong/415742/2009 replicated to significantly higher titers (P < 0.05) than any other virus in bronchus cells (Fig. 2A, B), whereas the viruses of bat origin replicated at low levels in bronchus cells, similar to the levels observed with the avian viruses. In contrast to their low replication in bronchus cells, the bat and avian viruses replicated to high titers in lung cells, attaining titers similar to those of the human virus and consistent with the higher concentration of α2,3-sialosides in lung tissue (Fig. 2C, D). Although all tested viruses, including bat-origin H9N2 viruses, replicated in airway organoids, the human virus had the highest viral titers and areas-under-the-curve (AUC) among the viruses compared.Fig. 2: Replication of avian, bat, and human-origin influenza viruses in ex vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung cells and in human airway organoids.A, C Human bronchial (n = 3 individual donors) and lung tissues (n = 4 individual donors) were infected with A/Hong Kong/415742/2009 (415742pdm), A/Hong Kong/483/1997 (483/H5N1), A/Duck/Hong Kong/Y280/97 (Y280), or A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 (381) at 1 × 106 pfu/mL at 37 °C. Viral titers in culture supernatants collected at 1, 24, and 48 h after infection were determined by TCID50 assays in MDCK cells. B, D The viral loads from (A, C) are depicted as areas-under-the-curve (AUCs). E Human airway organoids (n = 6 individual donors) were infected with the above viruses at 1 × 106 pfu/mL at 37 °C. Viral titers in culture supernatants collected at 1, 24, and 48 h after infection were determined by TCID50 assays in MDCK cells. F Viral titers from (E) are depicted as AUCs. Bar charts show the data as the mean + SD of the results for at least three individual donors. The horizontal line denotes the limit of detection in the TCID50 assay. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test (A, C, E) or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-test (B, D, F). P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance, and exact P values are presented. Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageReplication in alveolar epithelial cellsWe next assessed the replication and subsequent cytokine expression of the bat and control viruses in cultured primary human alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). Except for A/Hong Kong/483/1997 (H5N1), no significant differences in titers were observed among tested viruses when infecting AECs (Fig. 3). To assess the expression of cytokines (IFN-β and IFN-λ1) and chemokines (IP-10, RANTES, and MCP-1), RNA was extracted from infected AECs and the mRNAs encoding cytokines and chemokines were quantified. A/Hong Kong/483/1997 (H5N1) induced the highest levels of mRNA for all tested cytokines and chemokines, whereas A/Bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 showed a trend to induce the least mRNA encoding cytokines and chemokines.Fig. 3: Virus titers and cytokine and chemokine gene expression detected in the supernatant of infected alveolar epithelial cells.A Alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) were infected with the A/Hong Kong/415742/2009 (415742pdm), A/Hong Kong/483/1997 (483/H5N1), A/Duck/Hong Kong/Y280/97 H9N2 (Y280), or A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 H9N2 (381) viruses at an MOI of 0.01 and maintained in culture at 37 °C. Viral titers in culture supernatants collected at 1, 24, and 48 h post inoculation (hpi) were determined by TCID50 assays in MDCK cells. Bar charts show the data as the mean +/− SD (n = 6 individual donors). B Viral titers from panel A are depicted as AUCs. Bar charts show the data as the mean + SD (n = 6 individual donors). The horizontal line denotes the limit of detection of the TCID50 assay. C AECs were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 2 and maintained in culture at 37 °C. Expression of the mRNA of viral M genes and of the mRNAs encoding cytokines (IFN-β and IFN-λ1) and chemokines (IP-10; regulated on activation, normal T cell–expressed and secreted [RANTES]; and MCP-1) in AECs at 24 hpi is shown. Bar charts show the data as the mean + SD of the results for five individual donors. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test (A) or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-test (B, C); P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance, and exact P values are presented. Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imagePathogenicity of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 in miceTo evaluate the pathogenicity of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 in mice, we inoculated DBA/2J animals with A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 and A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 A(H9N2) viruses. A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 was substantially more virulent than A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 (Fig. 4A, B). A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 induced weight loss of up to 15% of starting body weight at a dose of 103 EID50, whereas A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 induced weight loss only at a dose of 106 EID50 (Fig. 4C, D). A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 infected mice met human endpoints at doses of 1 × 104 EID50 and above. Consistent with the differences in morbidity and mortality, significantly higher viral loads were detected in the lungs of mice infected with A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 than in the lungs of mice infected with A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 (Fig. 4E). Only A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 was detected in nasal turbinates (Fig. 4F).Fig. 4: Pathogenicity of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 (H9N2) and A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 (H9N2) viruses in mice.Groups of 5- to 6-week-old DBA/2J mice (n = 5) were inoculated i.n. with the indicated doses (101, 102, 103, 104, 105, or 106 EID50) of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 (H9N2) and A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 (H9N2) viruses. The mean values +/− SD of body weight loss (A, B) and survival (C, D) were evaluated daily for 14 days. Groups of mice (n = 3) that were infected with 106 EID50 were euthanized at 3 or 5 dpi (E, F), and their lungs and nasal turbinates were harvested, homogenized, and used to quantify the viral titers by EID50 assays. Viral titers expressed as the log10 EID50/ml were plotted as the mean. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA (***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001). Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageTo further detail the pathologic consequences of virus infection in mice, we immunostained fixed tissue sections for viral nucleoprotein antigen. At 3 days post inoculation (dpi), A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 infection was characterized by diffuse infection of respiratory epithelial cells in the airways of the nose and lungs. At the same time, there was extremely limited infection of and damage to the alveolar epithelium (Supplementary Figs. 1A–C, G–I and 2A, B). By 5 dpi, there was extensive loss of respiratory epithelium in the nose, trachea, and bronchioles of mice infected with A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 (Supplementary Figs. 1M–O, S–U and 2E). In marked contrast to the extensive A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 infection by 3 dpi, animals inoculated with A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 showed no detectable infection of the nasal respiratory epithelium and just a few patches of infected respiratory epithelium in the trachea and bronchioles (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). There were still no A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991-infected cells or lesions in the nose on day 5 post infection, but virus-infected cells were diffusely scattered within well-defined areas of the lungs in two of the three mice.Pathogenicity and transmission of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 in ferretsTo further assess the zoonotic risk of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017, we conducted ferret transmission studies. Ferrets inoculated with A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 or A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 attained peak mean titers in nasal washes of 6.25 ± 0.25 and 5 ± 0.5 log10EID50/mL, respectively, at 2 dpi (Fig. 5A, B). Clinical signs in the infected animals were mild with both viruses (Fig. 5C–F); the only detectable change was a slight increase in temperature at 2 dpi in each of the animals infected with A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 (Fig. 5C). A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017, but not A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991, transmitted to contact ferrets by 2 dpc, as demonstrated by the detection of virus in nasal secretions (Fig. 5B, C) and seroconversion at 14 days post contact (Supplementary Table 4). Similarly, A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 was detected in the nasal washes of all airborne-contact animals, whereas no virus was detected in contacts of A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 (Fig. 5A, B). Virologically confirmed airborne transmission was further confirmed by demonstration of seroconversion (Supplementary Table 4). Of note, the infections with A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 in airborne-contact animals were accompanied by a slight decrease in body temperature around day 9 or 10, concomitant with virus detection in nasal washes.Fig. 5: Pathogenicity and replication of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 and A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 viruses in ferrets.A, B Ferrets (n = 3/group) were inoculated i.n. with 106 EID50 of each virus studied. Each ferret was paired with an individual naïve ferret at 24 h post inoculation. Viral titers in nasal washes from individual inoculated ferrets (D; red), direct-contact ferrets (DC; blue), and airborne-contact ferrets (AC; green) on the days post inoculation or post contact were determined and presented as the log10EID50/mL. The mean values +/− SD of body weight loss (C, D) and changes in body temperature (E, F) of individually inoculated (D), direct-contact (DC), and airborne-contact (AC) ferrets up to 12 days post inoculation or post contact and the data are presented as mean values +/− SD using GraphPad Prism. Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageTo examine the virus distribution in animals, ferrets (N = 2 at each timepoint) infected with A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 were euthanized at 3 and 5 dpi and their lung, trachea, nasal turbinate, brain, liver, spleen, intestine, and heart tissues were collected for virus titration (Fig. 6). At 3 dpi, virus was detected in lung and nasal turbinate tissue. The infected tissue expanded by 5 dpi to include the trachea and brain, albeit with only moderate to low levels of virus being present in those organs.Fig. 6: Replication of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 in ferret tissues.Ferrets (n = 2) were inoculated with 106 EID50 of virus and then humanely euthanized on days 3 and 5 post inoculation. Tissues were collected, and infectious viral titers were determined by EID50 assays. Each bar represents an individual ferret, and the dotted line indicates the lower limit of virus detection by the assay (1.0 log10EID50/mL). Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageTo confirm some of the tissue distribution findings, we immunostained 3 dpi tissue for influenza virus nucleoprotein. In the respiratory tract, scant virus antigen was detected in the lungs, consistent with the low infectious titers detected (Supplementary Fig. 3). There was extensive sloughing of olfactory neuroepithelium; however, there was only multifocal involvement of respiratory epithelium in the nose and the nasopharynx was spared. There was diffuse labeling of affected epithelium, which was characterized by anoikis. Minimal extension into olfactory nerves was detected.Replication and transmission in mallard ducksTo assess the ability of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 and A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 to replicate in mallard ducks, we infected birds at a dose of 106 EID50. No infected ducks exhibited clinical symptoms during the 14-day observation period. A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 appeared to be unable to replicate in mallard ducks, with no infectious virus or seroconversion being detected in infected or contact birds (Supplementary Fig. 4B, D and Supplementary Table 5). Conversely, A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 was detected in cloacal swabs of infected and contact ducks (100.75–107.75 EID50/mL); virus was detected only sporadically in oropharyngeal swabs (Supplementary Fig. 4A, C and Supplementary Table 5).DiscussionThe identification of the A(H17N10) and A(H18N11) viruses that are genotypically and phenotypically distinct from other influenza A viruses suggests that bats harbor their own lineages of virus. Although the origin of these viruses is unclear, the phylogenetic positioning of their internal genes at the base of influenza A genes, just downstream of the influenza A/B split1, could mean that the viruses have been in bats for a long time. Without definitive precursors, it has been difficult to assess the impact of bat adaptation of an influenza virus on the risk posed to humans. However, the identification of the A(H9N2)-like virus offers the possibility of investigating this impact. This virus has been in bats for a shorter period than the A(H17N10) and A(H18N11) viruses and is clearly derived from avian A(H9N2) viruses. The objective of this study was to examine the phenotypic properties of the bat A(H9N2) virus and compare it with their avian-origin counterparts.Avian influenza viruses generally exhibit a strong preference for α2,3-sialoside receptors. However, this is not always the case for A(H9N2) viruses. In the 1990s, A(H9N2) viruses became established in land-based poultry, and over time a significant number of isolates have been identified with Leu 226 in the hemagglutinin, which is considered a signature for human-type receptor specificity20,21,22. Indeed, A(H9N2) viruses with Leu 226 were found to bind human-type α2,6-sialoside receptors, and this mutation increases infection and contact transmission in ferrets, raising concern about pandemic potential21,23,24. In this regard, it is of interest that the bat A(H9N2) viruses have Gln at 226, which is a signature of avian virus receptor specificity. Consistent with previous findings3 and in contrast to the finding that A(H17N10) and A(H18N11) viruses have evolved to use entirely different receptors2,10, we found that A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 bound preferentially and strongly to α2,3 glycans. The binding to α2,3-sialosides is consistent with findings that little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), which are widely distributed in North America, contain both α2,3 and α2,6 sialic acids throughout their respiratory tracts25. Assuming similar distributions in other bat species, this would suggest that there is little selective pressure for avian influenza viruses to evolve α2,6 binding upon bat adaptation. The bat A(H9N2) virus also maintained typical influenza A virus NA function, a feature that has been lost in the A(H17N10) and A(H18N11) viruses. Consistent with the avian-like molecular signatures of the bat A(H9N2) viruses, their replication in primary cells of human origin more closely resembled that of the control avian viruses than that of the control human virus. This was manifested as lower replication in bronchus and airway organoids but similar replication in lung cell cultures when compared with the human A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. It is not clear why the bat virus replicated better in lung culture compared to airway organoid culture requiring further studies.Somewhat paradoxically, and despite receptor binding features that were most similar to those of avian influenza viruses, the bat A(H9N2) virus had other properties that were more similar to those of mammalian-adapted viruses. The pH stability of the HA is an important component of avian influenza adaptation to mammalian hosts26. A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 had activation and inactivation pH values of 6.0 and 5.0, respectively. An activation pH of 6.0 is a more characteristic of an avian virus, whereas an inactivation pH of 5.0 is more characteristic of a human virus19. Although human viruses typically have similar activation and inactivation pH values, some swine viruses have been found to have mismatches. The ability of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 to transmit between ferrets, and although requiring further examination, suggests that HA inactivation is a better predictor of transmission potential than is HA activation in ferret models. It was this ability to transmit via contact and airborne routes that was the most striking and unexpected feature of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017, especially considering its receptor usage. Direct and, more rarely, airborne transmission of A(H9N2) viruses have been reported, but typically in the setting of viruses that were isolated from humans27 or that possessed some level of α2,6-sialoside binding capacity21,28. The robust transmission of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 to both sets of contact animals does imply an elevated risk to human health. The ability to transmit between ferrets is a highly weighted element in the World Health Organization’s Tool for Influenza Pandemic Risk Assessment (TIPRA) (https://www.who.int/publications/i/itemool-for-influenza-pandemic-risk-assessment-(tipra)-2nd-edition) and the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention29. TIPRA and IRAT are designed to assign the relative pandemic risk of animal influenza viruses, using scoring elements, including ferret transmission, selected by subject matter experts. Nonetheless, it is worthwhile repeating ferret transmission studies using other experimental designs. Although the bat A(H9N2) virus could propagate in eggs, it was unable to replicate to any detectable level in mallard ducks, the natural reservoir of IAV. An inability to replicate in ducks has also been reported for poultry-adapted A(H9N2) viruses30, and it is unclear whether this is necessarily a consequence of replication in bats.Our data indicate that the bat A(H9N2)-like virus has a mix of biologic properties, some typically associated with avian influenza viruses, some with human influenza viruses. This mix of phenotypes makes it difficult to assess the pandemic risk of the virus in relation to other zoonotic threats. The capacity of the virus to transmit between ferrets and its HA stability profile do, however, indicate a certain level of zoonotic threat. Therefore, further investigating the abundance and nature of influenza viruses in bats and comparisons with other avian viruses with different levels of mammalian adaptations appears prudent.MethodsEthics statement and facilityThe animal studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (IACUC) (protocol number 428) and were performed according to the guidelines set by the committee. All experiments with infectious A(H9N2) viruses were conducted in an Animal Biosafety Level 3 enhanced facility.Cells and virusesMadin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC CCL-34) and African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells (ATCC CCL-81) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in MEM (cellgro; Corning, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 5% (for MDCK cells) or 10% (for Vero cells) fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and a mixture of antibiotics and antimycotics (100 U of penicillin, 0.1 mg of streptomycin, and 0.25 μg of amphotericin B per milliliter) (Gibco).A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 (H9N2) was selected as a control virus as it was an ancestral avian virus with 99% protein sequence similarity to the bat virus and was available in our collection. A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 (H9N2) and A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 (H9N2) viruses were propagated and titrated by 50% egg infectious doses (EID50) in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs at 35 °C for 48 h. Allantoic fluid was pooled from multiple eggs, clarified by centrifugation, and frozen in aliquots at −80 °C. Virus titers were determined by injecting 100 μL of serial 10-fold dilutions of virus into the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (eggs) and then calculating the EID50 by the method of Reed and Muench31. A highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus (A/Hong Kong/483/1997, 483/H5N1) isolated from a fatal human infection, a 2009 pandemic influenza virus (A/Hong Kong/415742/2009, 415742pdm) isolated from a patient in Hong Kong, and duck A(H9N2) viruses (A/duck/Hong Kong/Y280/97, Y280) were used as controls for ex vivo replication efficiency studies in human respiratory system.Furthermore, HA and NA segments of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 (H9N2) virus were cloned into dual-promoter expression vector pHW2000. Plasmids encoding cDNAs of HA and NA segments of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 (H9N2) and six plasmids encoding the remaining segments of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus were transfected into HEK293T cells (ATCC CRL-3519) by using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Thermo Fisher). At 48 h post transfection, the cell supernatant was harvested, and 0.2 mL of the supernatant was injected into 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs to propagate the virus. The rg virus was used in HA stability assay, glycan array, and neuraminidase activity assay.HA stability assayThe HA activation pH was measured by a syncytium formation assay32. In brief, monolayers of Vero cells were infected with viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell for 1 h at 37 °C. At 16 h post inoculation (hpi), the cells were incubated in TPCK-treated trypsin for 10 min, washed, and incubated with pH-adjusted DPBS buffers for 10 min before removal. The cells were then neutralized by adding DMEM with 5% FBS and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. They were then washed with PBS, fixed with methanol, and stained with a Hema 3 Stat Pack staining kit (Fisher Scientific, Rochester, NY), used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Representative images were acquired with a Nikon D70 digital camera attached to a Nikon Eclipse TS100 inverted microscope. To measure the virus inactivation pH, aliquots of virus were incubated in pH-adjusted PBS buffers for 1 h at 37 °C, after which they were neutralized and the infectious virus titer was determined by tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay in MDCK cells33. The curves were fitted to a nonlinear regression model, and the values for virus inactivation at pH 5.0 were calculated using GraphPad Prism software.Neuraminidase activity assayNeuraminidase activity was measured by a fluorometric assay using 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) (Sigma-Aldrich) as a substrate34. All tested viruses were standardized to an equivalent dose of 107.0 TCID50/mL, and two-fold serial dilutions of the virus were incubated with MUNANA at a final concentration of 100 μM for 30 min at 37 °C in 96-well flat-bottom, black, opaque plates (Corning Costar, Corning, NY). The reaction was terminated by adding a stop solution of 25% ethanol and 12.5% glycine (Fisher Scientific, Rochester, NY) in distilled water. Two-fold serial dilutions of 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) were used for each assay plate, with a concentration range of 0.6–80 µM to generate a standard curve. The fluorescence of the released 4-MU was measured with a Synergy 2 multimode microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT), using excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. The results were calculated as the means from two or three independent determinations and were expressed as the amount of released 4-MU in micromoles.Glycan bindingA custom glycan binding array, consisting of 122 glycans, was used35. In brief, viruses analyzed on glycan binding arrays were inactivated with 0.1% (vol/vol) β-propriolactone. Inactivated virus stocks with a titer of 2056 hemagglutination units (HAU/ml) were diluted to a final titer of 512 HAU/ml in PBS containing 1% BSA and incubated on the array surface in a humidified chamber protected from light for 1 h at room temperature. The virus was then removed, and the array was washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4. For detection, virus-incubated arrays were overlaid with anti-H9N2 polyclonal ferret antiserum (diluted 1:10 in PBS containing 1% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. The antiserum was then removed, and the array was washed a further three times with PBS, pH 7.4. Finally, antiserum-labeled virus was detected with Goat anti-Ferret IgG-FITC (Fisher Scientific; diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 1% BSA). Arrays were then dipped three times in PBS and then three times in distilled water. The slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned using a ProScanArray Express HT confocal slide scanner (PerkinElmer). Signal data were collected using ImaGene software (BioDiscovery), and the signal data were processed to determine the average values (mean signal minus mean background) for four replicate spots on the array for each unique printed glycan. A complete summary of the array experiment and raw data in MIRAGE format36 are provided in Supplementary Tables 1–3.Ex vivo cultures and infection of the human respiratory tractFresh non-tumor bronchus and lung tissues were obtained from patients undergoing elective surgery in the Department of Surgery at Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. The use of human respiratory tract tissue (lung and bronchus) to setup ex vivo explant culture for studying influenza and coronavirus infection was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong and the Hospital Authority (Hong Kong West) (approval no. UW 20-862). Consent forms were signed by participants. All consent forms were collected and kept by the operating surgeon.The tissues were removed as part of clinical care, but the surplus was used for routine diagnostic requirements as detailed previously37. Tissues collected were convenience samples. The fragments of human tissues were infected with each virus at 1 × 106 pfu/mL for 1 h at 37 °C. Mock-infected tissues served as negative controls. The explants were washed three times with PBS and placed in culture medium (F-12K nutrient mixture with L-glutamine and antibiotics), with or without a sterile surgical pathology sponge to establish an air–liquid interface condition, in 24-well culture plates, which were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Infectious viral titers in the culture supernatants were assessed at 1, 24, and 48 hpi by titration in MDCK cells. At 48 hpi, bronchus and lung tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and processed for immunohistochemical staining.Influenza virus infection of human airway organoidsThree-dimensional (3D) human airway organoids were generated from adult stem cells isolated from the non-tumor lung tissue obtained from patients undergoing lung resection in the Department of Surgery at Queen Mary Hospital. Organoid cultures (approximately 100 µm in diameter) were extracted from droplets of Matrigel (Growth Factor Reduced Basement Membrane Matrix; Corning) by using Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (STEMCELL Technologies) and sheared by mechanical disruption with 1-mL pipettes to allow viruses to gain access to the apical and basolateral sides of the epithelium. Around 100–200 organoids were infected with each influenza virus at 106 pfu/mL for 1 h at 37 °C. Organoids were washed with culture medium three times, re-embedded in Matrigel, and plated in prewarmed 24-well suspension culture plates (Greiner). Once solidified, the Matrigel droplets were maintained in complete organoid medium38, and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The viral titers in the culture supernatants were assessed at 1, 24, and 48 hpi by TCID50 assays in MDCK cells.In vitro culture and infection of alveolar epithelial cellsPrimary human AECs were isolated from three donors and infected37. In brief, AECs were infected with A(H9N2), A(H1N1pdm09), and A(H5N1) viruses at an MOI of 0.01 to study the viral replication kinetics or at an MOI of 2 to analyze the expression of cytokines (interferon-beta [IFN-β] and IFN-lambda 1 [IFN-λ1]) and chemokines (IP-10; regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted [RANTES]; and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1]). Cell lysates were collected at 24 hpi for real-time PCR studies of the expression of mRNAs encoded by the influenza matrix gene and by the genes encoding cytokines and chemokines. Mock-infected cells served as negative controls. Viral titers in supernatants were determined by TCID50 assays.Viral titration by TCID50 assayMDCK cells were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates 24 h before the virus titration (TCID50) assay was performed. Cells were washed once with PBS and replenished with serum-free MEM supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 2 µg/mL of L-tosylamido 2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ). Serial dilutions of each virus supernatant were added to the plates in quadruplicate. The plates were observed for cytopathic effect (CPE) daily. The endpoint of the viral dilution that resulted in CPE in 50% of the inoculated wells was estimated using the Kärber method39.Real-time PCR assayThe RNA from virus-infected cells was extracted at 24 hpi by using a MiniBEST Universal RNA Extraction Kit (TaKaRa). RNA was reverse-transcribed by using oligo-dT primers with a PrimeScript™ RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa). Expression of target gene mRNA was measured using an Applied Biosystems ViiATM 7 real-time PCR system. All procedures were performed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The gene expression profiles of cytokines and chemokines were quantified and normalized with β-actin40,41,42.Mouse experimentsGroups of 6- to 8-week-old female DBA/2 J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with 30 µL of PBS or with 30 µL of virus diluted in PBS, using 10-fold serial dilutions containing 101–106 EID50 of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 virus or A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 virus to determine the MLD50 values. After virus inoculation, mice were weighed daily and monitored for mortality (actual death or loss of ≥25% of their body weight), weight loss, and any clinical signs of infection for 14 days post inoculation (dpi). To assess virus replication, groups of three mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and inoculated i.n. with 106 EID50 of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 virus or A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 virus (in a volume of 30 μl). The mice were euthanized at 3 or 5 dpi, their nasal turbinates and lungs were collected, and the virus infectivity was titrated in eggs. All collected organs were homogenized in sterile PBS with a Qiagen Tissue Lyser II (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD). Organ homogenates were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min, then the supernatants were transferred to clean tubes. Virus titers were determined by EID50 assays.Histology and immunohistochemical staining of murine tissueThe lungs and nasal turbinates of mice (n = 3) were collected at 3 and 5 dpi and fixed via intratracheal infusion and immersion in a 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution. Tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on serial histologic sections to determine the distribution of AIV antigens. A goat primary polyclonal antibody against influenza A/USSR/1977 (H1N1) virus (US Biological, Swampscott, MA; diluted 1:1000) was used on tissue sections that were previously subjected to antigen retrieval for 30 min at 98 °C with Dako Target Retrieval Solution, pH 9 (Agilent, Santa Clara CA). To quantify the extent of viral infection in the lungs, digital images of whole-lung sections stained for viral antigens were acquired with an Aperio ScanScope XT Slide Scanner (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Both uninfected and virus-positive regions were then manually outlined, and the areas of the outlined regions were determined with ImageScope software (Leica Biosystems).Pathogenicity and transmission in ferretsFour-month-old male ferrets (Triple F Farms, Sayre, PA) that were serologically negative for influenza viruses were used in these studies. To investigate virus replication, groups of six ferrets were anesthetized and inoculated i.n. with 106 EID50 of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 in a 1-mL volume (500 μL per nostril). Three ferrets were euthanized at each of 3 and 5 dpi, and the nasal turbinates, trachea, lung, spleen, liver, intestine, heart, and brain were collected for virus titration by EID50 assay.For the transmission studies, groups of three ferrets (designated as donor ferrets) were inoculated i.n. with 106 EID50 of test virus and then housed individually in a multilevel cage system inside an isolator. Twenty-four hours later, a naïve ferret was co-housed with an inoculated donor ferret to examine contact transmission (these were designated as direct-contact ferrets) and a naïve animal was placed in an adjacent cage, separated by a double-layered net divider, to examine respiratory droplet transmission (these were designated as airborne-contact ferrets). These cages allow the free passage of air. Nasal washes were collected from donor ferrets at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 dpi and recipient ferrets at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 days dpc and titrated by EID50 assay. Sera were collected from all animals at 14 and 21 dpi to evaluate the seroconversion.Replication and transmission in mallard ducksThree donor 3–4 months old male ducks were individually infected with 5 × 105 EID50 of A/bat/Egypt/381-OP/2017 or A/mallard/Alberta/17/1991 in 0.5 mL of PBS via the ocular, nasal, and oropharyngeal routes. Two 3-4 months old male ducks inoculated with 0.5 mL of sterile PBS were used as negative controls. To examine virus transmission, three naïve 3-4 months old male ducks (designated contact ducks) were added to each group at 2 dpi and shared the food and drinking water for 24 h before being moved to a separate cage. Body weights were determined at 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 dpi for donor and contact ducks. Ducks were observed for clinical signs over 14 days. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were collected from all birds at 2, 4, and 6 dpi to detect virus shedding. Viral titers in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were determined by EID50 assays. Blood samples were collected from donor and contact ducks at day 14 and at day 21 post infection to evaluate the seroconversion.Statistical analysisData were analyzed using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison post hoc test, and univariant log-rank analysis (survival curves) in GraphPad Prism v9.4.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

The Conversation — The confirmed presence of bird flu in American dairy cattle in a March 25 report from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) — and a case in Texas where a human working with cattle was infected — has put Canadian public health experts on high alert. But, what is bird flu and what do we know about influenza in both poultry and cattle? Bird flu, also called avian flu, refers to infection caused by the avian influenza Type A viruses. In the wild, influenza viruses generally spread among migratory waterfowls, such as ducks and geese. Within avian species, domestic poultry are highly susceptible to infection with Type A avian influenza viruses, including H5N1. Canada itself is amid an H5N1 avian influenza virus outbreak, with over 11 million domestic poultry estimated to be affected and culled to date. In fact, a major concern for the Canadian poultry supply chain is the incurred financial loss from culling birds. This virus is highly contagious among domestic poultry and can spread through an entire flock within a matter of days. The most common route of transmission from an infected bird to a nonvaccinated bird is via direct physical contact or contact with virus-contaminated surfaces with bodily fluids such as oral mucus and feces. Bird Flu in Mammals Nonavian species, like mammals, can also become infected with the H5N1 virus. In Canada, sporadic cases of mammals becoming infected with bird flu have been reported in raccoons, striped skunks, red foxes, cats and dogs. As of March 2024, various reports from the USDA, Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the presence of H5N1 in dairy cattle across 8 states, of which Idaho, Ohio and Michigan are the most northern states bordering Canada. Although there are no known reports indicating the current bovine strain has made its way into Canada, there is no doubt that it is getting too close for comfort. As of March 27, 2024, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has established various primary control zones in Alberta to prevent the spread of H5N1. The emerging bovine H5N1 virus is novel to the cattle industry, a backbone of the Canadian food and agriculture industry. The close environmental relationship between humans and cattle would seem to make both species more vulnerable to influenza transmission, but that is not the case. Interestingly, only a few cases of cattle-to-human influenza transmission have been documented. In contrast, pigs are the main mixing vessel for avian influenza A viruses, as exemplified in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The 2009 swine H1N1 virus was a mixing event that led to mammalian adaptation, a process that is not straightforward in any intermediate host. A natural mixing event in pigs would result from exchange of genetic material following co-infection with both an avian and human influenza virus. However, in the current scenario, the emerging bovine H5N1 strain that has infected American dairy cattle has undergone a specific adaptation in an enzyme called polymerase. Changes to this viral enzyme are concerning, as it could allow for faster adaptation and maybe even support cattle-to-cattle transmission. This raises numerous questions for which the answers are not yet clear. Among these, the key questions are: How are dairy cattle getting infected? Is viral transmission from infected to non-infected cattle, or strictly direct contact with contaminated surfaces or infected birds? Are cattle relevant as an intermediary in the transmission chain of Type A influenza viruses such as H5N1 from poultry to cattle, eventually infecting humans? The answers will support new regulations to control H5N1 spread within dairy cattle and to other farms, poultry, mammals and humans. The greater concern would be if this virus has entered the pig industry. Are There Vaccines Against H5N1 for Humans and Livestock? According to a CDC report, the H5N1 viral strain that infected a human in Texas is closely related to 2 candidate vaccines. It is also reassuring to know that the World Health Organization maintains a list of candidate vaccines that could be mass-produced against H5N1 influenza viruses. In fact, some countries maintain a small stockpile of vaccine doses against H5N1, should there be a need to vaccinate at-risk populations. Until such an outbreak event occurs where vaccines against H5N1 for people might be required, the Canadian government has a list of preventive measures that people can take. Members of the public need to keep their distance and avoid direct contact with wild birds that look sick or have died. People should also avoid touching surfaces where there are likely to be bird droppings. As for livestock species, both the American and Canadian governments have been reluctant to approve the use of vaccines in the poultry industry. The long-standing strategy against avian influenza has been eradication, and not vaccination, by culling all infected and affected chickens. While it has been successful at preventing the virus from becoming endemic, it may not be economically sustainable with H5N1 outbreaks predicted to occur on a yearly basis. In the wake of this unprecedented news, efforts have to be directed to study avian influenza transmission from poultry into cattle. Such proactive efforts will hopefully generate necessary data to establish a decision-making framework to safeguard our livestock industry and protect human health.

Medscape Medical NewsAvian Flu Threat Still Low and Vaccine Measures Are ReadyMarcia Frellick April 26, 2024 00After cow-to-cow transmission of avian influenza A subtype H5N1 in US dairy herds led to a cow-to-human transmission in Texas, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials convened a panel of experts for a scientific symposium on Thursday to talk about the public health implications."The risk to the general public remains low," said Vivien Dugan, PhD, director of the Influenza Division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And should there be an outbreak, vaccine development measures are in place, she added.From the sequencing data, "we can expect and anticipate that [the candidate vaccine viruses] will provide good protection," she explained.Establishing candidate vaccine viruses "are the precursor to moving into large-scale vaccine production," Dugan explained. Should that be needed, the candidate viruses can be used by manufacturers to produce new vaccines.The CDC is also actively partnering with commercial diagnostic developers and testing companies in case there is a need to scale-up testing, Dugan said.The only current human case in the United States was reported on April 1 and confirmed by the CDC within 24 hours, reported Sonja Olsen, PhD, associate director for preparedness and response of the Influenza Division at the CDC.The person had direct exposure to cattle and reported eye redness, consistent with conjunctivitis, as the only symptom. The person received treatment and has recovered, and there were no reports of illness among the person's household contacts, Olsen said.Person With the Virus Has RecoveredThe only other detection of the virus in a human in the United States was in 2022 and it was associated with infected poultry exposure. That person also had mild illness and recovered, Olsen explained.Since 1997, when the first case of human infection was reported globally, "there have been 909 [human cases] reported from 23 countries," Olsen said. "About half [52%] of the human cases have resulted in death." Only a small number of human cases have been reported since 2015, but since 2022, more than two dozen human cases have been reported to the World Health Organization.Experience with the virus in the United States has been about a year behind that in Europe, said Rosemary Sifford, DVM, chief veterinary officer at the US Department of Agriculture. In the United States, the first detection — in January 2022 — was in wild birds; this was followed the next month by the first detection in a commercial poultry flock.In March of this year, the United States had its first detection in cattle, specifically dairy cattle. But testing has shown that "it remains very much an avian virus. It's not becoming a bovine virus," Sifford reported.Detected in CattleEarlier this week, in an effort to minimize the risk of disease spread, the USDA issued a federal order that requires the reporting of positive influenza tests in livestock and mandatory testing for influenza of dairy cattle before interstate movement."As of today, there are affected herds in 33 farms across eight states," reported Olsen.Tests are ongoing to determine how the virus is traveling, but "what we can say is that there's a high viral load in the milk in the cattle, and it appears that the transmission is happening mostly within the lactating herds," Sifford reported. It is unclear whether that is happening during the milking of the cows or whether contaminated milk from a cow with a high viral load is transmitting the virus to other cattle."We are strongly encouraging producers to limit the movement of cattle, particularly lactating cattle, as much as possible," she says.Milk Is Likely the Source of Transmission"We haven't seen anything that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe," says Donald Prater, DVM, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).In the federal and state milk safety system, he explained, nearly 99% of the commercial milk supply comes from farms that participate in the Grade A program and follow the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, which outlines pasteurization requirements.Because detection of the virus in dairy cattle is new, there are many questions to be answered in research, he reported. Among them:What level of virus might be leaving the farms from shedding by apparently healthy cows?Does any live virus survive the pasteurization process?Do different methods of pasteurization and dairy production have different effects on the viability of H5N1?Are effects different in various forms of dairy products, such as cheese and cream?A critical question regarding the potential risk to humans is how much milk would have to be consumed for the virus to become an established infection. That information is essential to determine "what type of pasteurization criteria" are needed to provide "acceptable public health outcomes," Prater said.The CDC is currently using the flu surveillance system to monitor for H5N1 activity in people. The systems show no current indicators of unusual influenza activity in people. 0CreditLead image: Science Photo Library / Getty ImagesMedscape Medical News © 2024 WebMD, LLCSend comments and news tips to news@medscape.net.

In the handful of human cases seen so far it has been extremely deadly.The tips of Lineke Begeman's fingers are still numb from a gruelling mission. In March, the veterinary pathologist was part of an international expedition to Antarctica's Northern Weddell Sea, studying the spread of High Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), the virus that has now encircled the globe, causing the disease known as bird flu. Cutting into the frozen bodies of wild birds that the team collected, Begeman was able to help establish whether they had died from the disease. The conditions were harsh and the location remote, far from her usual base at the Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands. But systematic monitoring like this could provide a vital warning for the rest of the world."If we don't study the extent of its spread now, then we can't let people know what the consequences are of having let it slip through our fingers when it began," Begeman tells BBC Future Planet. "I imagine the virus as an explorer going through the world, to new places and bird species, and we're following it along."Relatively few people have caught the virus so far, but the H5N1 subtype has had a high mortality rate in those that do: more than 50% of people known to become infected have died. In March 2024, the US discovered its second case in humans, which was also the first instance of mammal-to-human transmission. By May 2024, the first death from a rare H5N2 subtype of the virus was reported in Mexico. Then in August, the US saw its first hospitalisation for H5 avian influenza with no known exposure to a sick animal.Antonio AlcamíAn expedition to the Antarctic's Northern Weddell Sea has systematically studied bird flu's spread in this remote, wildlife-rich region (Credit: Antonio Alcamí)Moreover, the impact on animals has already been devastating. Since it was first identified, the H5 strain of avian influenza and its variants have led to the slaughter of over half a billion farmed birds. Wild-bird deaths are estimated in the millions, with around 600,000 in South America since 2023 alone – and both numbers potentially far higher due to the difficulties of monitoring.At least 26 species of mammals have also been infected. In Denmark, millions of mink were culled after bird flu spread through fur farms. In France, a captive bear was found to be infected, as have free-ranging bears in Canada. Among wild mammals, scavengers and marine mammals have been particularly badly hit. The virus has killed ten of thousands of seals and sea lions from Quebec down to Chile, Argentina and Peru - with concerns rising that it may be adapting to spread more easily between mammals and then back to birds. In Antarctica's Northern Weddell Sea, Begeman and her colleagues sampled around 120 carcasses from different species, including several Antarctic fur seals. The virus was detected at four of the 10 sites they visited.It was not the first time bird flu had been detected on this remote continent. That first case was a month prior, in February 2024. But theirs was the first confirmation from this particular region, and the first time, Begeman believes, that a multidisciplinary team had set out to systematically determine its Antarctic spread.Matteo LervolinoMillions of wild birds are estimated to have died from the spread of high pathogenic avian influenza (Credit: Matteo Lervolino)"The moment we found the first evidence of that destructive serial killer virus amidst such a bird-rich, pristine area, we realised what disaster is about to happen and it became sickening indeed," says Begeman.Already the worst bird flu outbreak in wildlife on record, scientists like Begeman are now racing to track its journey – and so better understand how its further spread among humans might be stopped.Where does bird flu come from? China's southern Guangdong region is a mosaic of lakes, rivers and wetlands. These watery habitats are well suited to aquatic birds, who are natural hosts for low pathogenic avian flu. And it was here, in 1996, that a farmed goose became the world's first bird to be diagnosed with a new, highly pathogenic strain of the virus, known as H5N1. The categorisation of bird flu as low or high pathogenic was established in relation only to chickens, not to other bird (or mammal) species. But whereas low-path avian influenza is non-fatal in wild birds and only causes mild disease in chickens, in poultry, low path strains can mutate into fatal high-path ones, causing severe illness and often death. People are the real problem – Thijs KuikenIt should be no surprise that the highly pathogenic virus's first case was detected on a poultry farm, says Thijs Kuiken, a comparative pathologist at Erasmus University Medical Centre in the Netherlands. "High pathogenic avian influenza is typically a poultry disease, which doesn't occur in the wild. What's unusual now, is this particular type has spilled into wild birds and this has allowed it to spread worldwide."Although wild birds have now helped the virus reach far beyond China, "people are the real problem", Kuiken warns. And in particular, humanity's ever-rising demand for farmed meat.When this outbreak started in 1996, there were around 14.7 billion poultry birds in the world, mostly chickens. Now there's double that number. "Biomass-wise, poultry currently forms over 70% of all avian biomass worldwide," Kuiken notes.Ben WallisAn on-board laboratory allowed a scientific expedition to Antarctica to test and confirm bird flu's presence in situ (Credit: Ben Wallis)If the current poultry farming trends don't change, then "other highly infectious pathogens will continue to spread into the few wild birds remaining," Kuiken says. House finches, for instance, are proving particularly susceptible to a bacterial poultry disease, Mycoplasma gallisepticum. Virulent strains of Newcastle disease are also crossing over into multiple species, including parrots and macaws. "HPAI [high-pathogenic bird flu] is only one threat."How did bird flu spread around the world? By 2005-06 the virus had spilled over into wild birds and was travelling as far as Europe, Africa and the Middle East, but it was disappearing in these populations after only a few months – likely a combination of not spreading well enough in wild birds, not surviving well enough in water, and some birds developing immunity, says Kuiken. This helped to limit the extent of its impact and its ability to further mutate.H5N1 timeline1996: detected in poultry in Guangdong, China1997: first human deaths in Hong Kong2005: Spilled over into wild birds in a major way. New strains emerge.2020: A strain emerges that can sustain in wild bird populations year-round2020-22: Becomes endemic in wild bird populations2021: Arrives in North America 2022: Detected in South America 2024: Confirmed in AntarcticaThat relative containment changed in 2020, however, when a new strain of H5N1 emerged. Though it's not known exactly why, the strain could maintain itself in wild bird populations year-round. Now able to spread during springtime when birds gather in high densities to breed, the virus rapidly became endemic in wild bird populations.In late 2021, the virus arrived in the New World via Canada's eastern Newfoundland province. A black-backed gull, found sick in a pond, was taken to a wildlife rehabilitation centre where it died the following day. It was later found to be positive for H5N1. Days after its death, a poultry farm started reporting increased mortality rates and autopsies also confirmed presence of the virus. The fact there was no evidence this farm had imported poultry from Europe helped to confirm scientists' theories that wild birds' migration routes are the key long-distance carrier, explains Kuiken. There have been some exceptions, however, such as the transport of infected turkeys from the UK to Europe.It's like avoiding getting into a packed metro when you're already sick – Gregorio TorresBy 2022, birds in colonies from the UK to Israel were dying in their thousands. In October 2022, the virus was detected in wild birds on the west coast of Peru and Chile. After travelling down the coast, it then returned up the east, spreading to the Falkland Islands and South Georgia – the stepping stones to the Antarctic.Along this route, the virus has diverged to infect a wide variety of mammals – including 21 species in the US alone. And with such cross-over, the opportunity for both human contact and mammal-to-mammal spread has increased. By 16 April 2024, HPAI was confirmed in dairy cows on 26 farms in the US, from Texas to Michigan. Some of these may have been infected through wild birds, but other cases have been connected to cows' long-distance transport. So far, only one case of cow-to-human infection is thought to have occurred, and the virus may require several more mutations beforeit can spread easily between people. Getty ImagesFarms are being urged to deploy biosecurity measures in the wake of bird flu's spread (Credit: Getty Images)But farms can create conditions that allow disease to spread more easily, offering new pathways for adaptation. "Wild birds can transmit the virus, but domestic farms can amplify it," says Gregorio Torres, head of the science department at the intergovernmental body the World Organisation for Animal Health, of the need for farmers to be especially cautious. "It's like avoiding getting into a packed metro when you're already sick."One bright spot is that birds in New Zealand and Australia have so far been spared. The countries are part of the East Asian-Australian migration route, but their visiting birds are mostly shorebirds or waders, rather than more-susceptible waterfowl like ducks or geese, Kuiken notes.How does bird flu spread to humans?The current outbreak of H5N1 bird flu has also hopped species numerous times to infect various mammals, including humans. So far, however, the virus is not thought to have evolved or mutated sufficiently to jump easily between the mammals it infects – though September 2024 the US confirmed its first case with no known exposure to animals.The very first human cases were reported in Hong Kong in 1997, and the global spread of the virus was relatively slow: during its first 13 years only 800 people were reported infected, with poultry and slaughterhouse workers at greatest risk.Contact with sick birds – or with their droppings, saliva or feathers – was found to be the biggest risk factor for contracting the virus, though the exact mechanism by which the virus jumps species is not yet known.Is bird flu the next pandemic?In March 2024, a new, rare form of the virus was detected in cattle. By April, a farm worker in Texas became the second human in the US to ever contract H5N1 – in what it thought to be the first instance of mammal-to-human transmission. Cow-to-cow transfer has since been confirmed, with "anything that comes in contact with unpasteurised milk" potentially spreading the disease, according to the US Department of Agriculture.Every time there's a jump between species, it's a signal of potential increased risk - Gregorio TorresScientists cannot yet predict if bird flu will become the next global human pandemic, says Torres. Yet what is clear is that the disease is here to stay – and we need to be prepared. "Every time there's a jump between species, it's a signal of potential increased risk," says Torres. "That's why we're quickly acting to try to understand and anticipate its evolution."Torres adds: "The worst case is it adapts to mammals, with a greater risk of human-to-human transmission."Diana Bell, a conservation biologist at the University of East Anglia in the UK, says when people ask her what the next pandemic in humans will be, bird flu immediately comes to mind. "I say we already have a pandemic in animals and birds [a panzootic]."Can we prevent bird flu in humans? So can bird flu be stopped? Not in wildlife, experts say; transmission is too hard to prevent. But there are still things we can do to limit the harm to both wild and farmed mammals – as well as humans. Dead wild birds should be left untouched and reported to authorities, experts encourage. Meanwhile, farms are also being urged to deploy biosecurity measures, from covering waste to reporting illnesses. And the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) is pressing to ensure compensation schemes are in place for all farms that undergo mandatory culling.Getty ImagesFarms are being urged to deploy biosecurity measures in the wake of bird flu's spread (Credit: Getty Images)More controversial is the question of vaccinating poultry. Preventative vaccination in the most high-risk species and areas has been shown to minimise outbreaks, and WOAH advises this. Some nations, like China, already vaccinate routinely, but others have been more reluctant. Not least due to trade barriers which restrict the import of poultry and eggs from vaccinated flocks."When you vaccinate poultry, it's harder to demonstrate absence of disease and early-detect its presence. So it's posing a challenge for international trade, as everyone wants trade to be safe," says Torres. But better surveillance can offset this risk, he adds.Future outbreaks of HPAI could also be controlled and even prevented via reforms to global meat production, Kuiken says. A more sweeping approach could include a cap on the global poultry population size and more equitable consumption – Europe currently eats twice as much meat as global health authorities advise, Kuiken notes. (Read BBC Future's article on sustainable sources of protein.)How badly is wildlife affected by bird flu? HPAI is already a pandemic in global wildlife. "With this virus, the conservation impact is already unprecedented," says Marcela Uhart, a veterinarian at UC Davis. "It's on a scale we've never seen: in terms of the number of species and regions affected, we've never seen anything like it."Of particular concern in Uhart's home nation of Argentina, has been the virus's spread in wild mammals. Her study into its adaptation to such mammals showed the same virus was nearly identical in fur seals and sea lions, and that many of the adaptations they detected were also present in a human case in Chile. "For all we know it could already be further adapting to spread between mammals – and we need to detect that as quickly as possible."Getty imagesSea lions are among the mammals badly hit by avian influenza (Credit: Getty images)And while this is worrying in terms of the future impact on humans, it is also already proving devastating to other mammals: more than 17,000 elephant seals are thought to have died from the virus during the 2023 breeding season, including 70% of all the season's pups. Since no one knows how many adults went on to die at sea from the virus, Uhart and her colleagues are now waiting apprehensively for the creatures return from the ocean this spring. If enough pregnant females come back, there will be capacity for recovery, Urhart says. If not, or if the virus hits again this year, "the impact could be major"."We're all feeling very anxious about this," Urhart says. There is pressure to keep monitoring the population-level impact on wildlife, though she says there is inadequate funding. "Everything we're doing now is on a shoestring," she says.But the need to keep monitoring is key. "The removal of these species from the food chain could disrupt the whole ecosystem," Urhart says. "A lot of what's coming into the future is just so uncertain."How can we help wildlife cope with H5N1?Reducing other pressures on wildlife could aid their survival as H5N1 becomes a new pressure on bird and mammal species. Climate change, habitat loss, bycatch in fisheries, overfishing, invasive species and pollution – via everything from plastics to pesticides – are all reducing global biodiversity. Easing those human pressures could help give populations infected by HPAI more scope to recover, says Richard Phillips, a seabird ecologist at the British Antarctic Survey.Phillips' work on albatrosses has shown that fishing vessels that use mitigation methods (such as not discarding fish at the same time as trawling, and using bird-scaring lines) can reduce the amount of seabird bycatch. With bird flu already hitting the vulnerable wandering albatross, Phillips fears the species' outlook is "bleak" unless the threat from fisheries is addressed.In the meantime, scientists will continue to track HPAI's spread in wild populations, and find new ways to do so.Ben WallisMonitoring bird flu's spread across wildlife populations is key to understanding this human-derived disaster (Credit: Ben Wallis)Begeman's expedition, for the first time, set up an entire testing laboratory on an Antarctic-bound ship. Wildlife biologists would scout sampling areas on foot for dead birds, while others would sample apparently healthy animals, she explains. Her role was to cut into the carcasses to investigate, shoo-ing away curious sheathbills as they went. "We were really like detectives, able to get to sites where people had never visited."The hope is that by collecting this information from the most far-flung places on the planet, scientists can inform the choices we make closer to home. For Kuiken, policy changes to reduce risk in the poultry industry are high on his list. Meanwhile, vaccination, preventative measures and conservation could all be crucial to help birds and mammals through this outbreak.--If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.HealthWildlifeAnimalConservationDiseaseFuture PlanetEarthAnimal MigrationFeaturesWatchEarth tides: Why our planet's crust has tides tooHow do they differ from the ocean?

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved NEWS Health News ANALYSIS Flu By the Numbers: April 26, 2024 By Team Verywell Health Updated on April 26, 2024 Fact checked by Angela Underwood Print Natalie_ / Getty Images Close The CDC has started reporting influenza activity in the United States. In any flu season, the data that gets reported each week is preliminary and can change as new information becomes available. As of April 26, the CDC is reporting that influenza-like illness activity throughout the United States is decreasing nationwide. Some cases may not be the flu. There are also respiratory illnesses going around, including COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Flu Testing For the week ending April 20, 2024, clinical laboratories in the U.S. tested 56,206 specimens for flu viruses, of which 2,720 (4.8%) were positive. Among the positive results, influenza A accounted for 56.3% of positive flu cases, and influenza B accounted for 43.7%. Public health laboratories in the U.S. also reported data about specimen testing to the CDC. Of the 900 samples tested, 185 were positive for the flu. Influenza A accounted for 62.7% of the positive flu cases, and influenza B accounted for 37.3%. The Different Strains of The Flu Influenza patterns vary according to the specific flu virus strains that are circulating in a given year, as well as human behavior. For example, some of the changes that the pandemic brought about—such as mask-wearing and social distancing—slowed down the flu spread last year. Another factor that affects flu patterns is vaccination. Annual flu vaccines are a safe and effective way to help curb the spread of the flu and to prevent hospitalizations and deaths. Hospitalizations and Deaths So far this flu season, the CDC estimates that there have been at least:34 million illnesses380,000 hospitalizations24,000 deaths (including 148 children) How Many People Have Had Flu Shots? The CDC also tracks how many flu vaccines have been given each year. It uses national surveys to estimate how many adults have gotten a flu shot as well as how many caregivers have vaccinated their children. While flu season is still ongoing, the numbers can change a lot. Flu Shots 2023-2024 So far this year, over 157 million flu vaccine doses have been distributed in the U.S. As of the end of February 2024, coverage estimates for flu shots show that: About 48% of adults aged 18 and older have been vaccinated About 52% of children aged 6 months to 17 years old have been vaccinated About 38% of pregnant people have been vaccinated To get a sense of how many people in the U.S. are getting flu shots, the CDC compares the current rates (as percentages) to those from previous years. Here's what flu vaccine coverage looked like this time last year: 53% of children46% of adults39% of pregnant people Can I Get a Flu Shot and COVID Booster at the Same Time? The CDC is recommending both annual flu shots and updated COVID booster shots. It is safe and effective to get both shots at the same time (coadministration) or you can get them on separate days.If you get your flu shot and a COVID vaccine on the same day, the CDC says it is OK to get them in the same arm—the injections just need to be given about 1 inch apart. However, since some flu shots can make your arm sore, your provider may recommend you get the shots in different arms to help reduce soreness. What Information Do States Report? The CDC tracks LIL activity levels in each state and presents a weekly flu surveillance report. LIL activity levels are defined as the following: Minimal (levels 1-3)Low (levels 4-5)Moderate (levels 6-7)High (levels 8-10)Very High (levels 11-13) State health departments track flu data provided by hospitals, clinics, clinical laboratories, and healthcare organizations. These reports can include information like the number of flu tests conducted, positivity rates, and the number of flu-like illnesses that providers saw in the patients they treated. COVID-19, RSV, and the Flu What Can The Data Tell Me About Flu Activities In My State? Data on ILI activity can give you a sense of how many people have respiratory symptoms in your state. If the ILI activity level where you live is high, it can be a sign that the flu is "going around" in your community. Having this information, you can take preventive steps, such as washing your hands frequently and getting a flu shot, to help reduce your risk of getting sick. If you have flu-like symptoms, call your provider to see if you should have a test. They might want you to take antiviral medications such as Tamiflu to help reduce your symptoms. While you are sick, wear a mask and stay at home to help keep other people from catching the flu from you. How Long Is the Flu Contagious? How Is Flu Data Different From COVID-19 Data? The flu and COVID-19 are different illnesses, caused by different viruses, that may need different treatments. That said, the flu and COVID can have similar symptoms and can be hard to tell apart without a test. Some specimens tested for the flu can be tested for COVID at the same time. If a flu test is negative, a person might need to have a COVID test. It's also possible for someone to have both COVID and the flu at the same time. Testing people who are sick helps providers care for them, but it also helps us get a sense of how the viruses are circulating in our communities and how effective the vaccines for the viruses are.

Close Menu Facebook X (Twitter) Instagram Facebook Instagram Threads Subscribe Featured News Funding Directory Jobs Events Advertisement Pathogens Does the Detection of Influenza D Antibodies in Dogs Pose a Risk to Humans?First identified in 2011 in swine in Oklahoma and most commonly known to infect cattle, Influenza D virus is considered a potential threat as an emerging pathogen in cattle-workers.By Global Biodefense StaffApril 26, 2024 Photo by Mihail Macri / Unsplash Share Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Email Dogs are known to be susceptible to influenza A viruses, but information on influenza D virus in canines is limited. Influenza D viruses historically primarily affect cattle with spillover to other animals, but are not known to cause illness in humans. A new study published in Emerging Infectious Diseases finds that household dogs are exposed to influenza D virus, potentially acting as a source of infection for humans. The study investigated the seroprevalence of influenza D in 426 dogs in the Apulia region of Italy during 2016 and 2023. A total of 14 samples were positive for Influenza D antibodies, suggesting exposure to Influenza D virus in dogs. Influenza D virus was first identified from swine exhibiting influenza-like symptoms in 2011 in the United States. Related RNA or antibodies have been detected worldwide in several animal hosts, including cattle, swine, small ruminants, camelids, and wild ungulates, although cattle are the main reservoir. The study authors conclude that the possibility that some influenza D strains may acquire the ability to evolve and adapt in the human host should not be discounted. This potential risk could be higher in settings where there is more viral pressure, such as in groups with occupational exposure. RELATED READING Serologic evidence of exposure to influenza D virus among persons with occupational contact with cattle Influenza D virus poses a zoonotic risk to cattle-exposed workers, based on detection of high seroprevalence. Whereas it is still unknown whether IDV causes disease in humans, these studies indicate that the virus may be an emerging pathogen among cattle-workers. (Science Direct) Influenza D virus infection in feral swine populations, United States During 2012–2013, study evaluated feral swine populations in 4 US states; of 256 swine tested, 57 (19.1%) were IDV seropositive. Among 96 archived influenza A virus–seropositive feral swine samples collected from 16 US states during 2010–2013, 41 (42.7%) were IDV seropositive. Infection studies demonstrated that IDV-inoculated feral swine shed virus 3–5 days postinoculation and seroconverted at 21 days postinoculation; 50% of in-contact naive feral swine shed virus, seroconverted, or both. (Emerging Infectious Diseases) Influenza D in domestic and wild animals Animals associated with humans and susceptible to IDV infection include camels, pigs, small ruminants, and horses. Notably, high seroprevalence towards IDV, apart from cattle, is also observed in camels, potentially constituting a reservoir of the virus. Among wild and captive animals, IDV infections have been confirmed in feral pigs, wild boars, deer, hedgehogs, giraffes, wildebeests, kangaroos, wallabies, and llamas. The transmission potential and host range of IDV may contribute to future viral differentiation. It has been confirmed that influenza D may pose a threat to humans as a zoonosis, with seroprevalence noted in people with professional contact with cattle.

The results come in the wake of earlier findings this week from more limited FDA sampling, along with similar findings from a smaller set of samples tested by a lab that's part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response (CEIRR) Network.At today's ASTHO briefing, state health officials heard the latest investigation and research updates from federal health officials and had the opportunity to ask their own questions, everything from virus shedding in cow manure to pandemic preparedness.FDA's long list of research questionsPrater reiterated that the FDA hasn't changed its assessment that the nation's milk supply remains safe. So far, early work on milk samples that were positive for H5N1 fragments haven't found any viable (potentially infectious) virus.He said, however, that the FDA still has a long list of data gaps to fill, including identifying the risk of infection to humans via oral consumption and validating that existing pasteurization methods can inactivate H5N1. Other data gaps include how long the virus survives in raw milk and the infectious dose of viruses. Though a major concern is retail milk, Prater also said the FDA needs to see if contamination is occurring in other products, such as cheese made from raw milk. USDA continues to probe farm transmission patternsRosemary Sifford, DVM, deputy administrator for veterinary services and chief veterinarian with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the agency has now shared 260 genetic sequences with public databases, up from 239 earlier this week. Of those, only 1 had a mutation linked to mammalian adaptation.She also said the B3.13 genome circulating in cattle was first seen in poultry in the middle of March in a Texas flock at a time when the virus was cropping up in some of the state's dairy farms. Sifford said investigators continue to look at how the virus is moving on farms and how it transmits among cattle.Scientists are looking for the virus in other species, including feral pigs, and regular influenza surveillance is monitoring the situation in commercial pigs. Sifford said efforts are under way to gauge how long infected cows shed the virus and if shedding patterns are any different in asymptomatic animals.When asked about on-farm transmission, she said scientists haven't observed significant shedding in cow feces. Meanwhile, sampling from the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) found the highest concentrations in milk and mammary tissue.CDC notes cat infections, weighs risksCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials shared more details from their epidemiologic investigations, including virus findings in other animals on affected dairy farms. Sonja Olsen, PhD, associate director for preparedness and response with the CDC's Influenza Division, said there were 6 H5N1 positive tests in cats from three states: 3 in Texas, 2 in New Mexico, and 1 in Ohio.Also, there were 5 H5N1 detections in wild birds on the farms.She said CDC a key question is the infection risk from exposure to milk and whether certain conditions, such as aerosolization, pose a higher risk.Vivien Duggan, PhD, who heads the CDC's Influenza Division, said the interagency Flu Risk Management group, which formed 15 years ago, is meeting now to discuss prepandemic vaccines and diagnostics.On the research front, the CDC is looking for any changes in the virus that would hamper the ability to use countermeasures, such as antiviral drugs and vaccines.A key tool that the CDC uses to evaluate and prioritize resources is the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT), in which its experts grade the virus using 10 data criteria. Duggan said the CDC is still gathering some data and that it will take some time to evaluate the virus and come up with a risk score. In its last assessment in July 2023, the agency scored the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus from a Spanish mink farm outbreak as slightly higher for some elements than a 2022 virus from the same clade from wild birds.Latest on vaccines, other countermeasuresSo far, research results have been promising for antiviral susceptibility. And for the two candidate vaccine viruses against the H5N1 2.3.4.4b clade, experiments using ferret antisera show good cross-reaction against the outbreak strain, she said.When state officials asked what would trigger ramped up H5N1 vaccine production, Duggan said officials are watching for certain cues, such as change in mammalian transmission, better adaptation to human-to-human spread, and clusters of cases. "There's no formula, but we're all on the watch."Health officials also heard from government countermeasure experts, who said they don't foresee any issues with the antiviral supply chain.State health officials had several questions about where things stand with a candidate vaccine. David Boucher, PhD, director of infectious disease preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Strategic Preparedness, said there is a limited quantity of prefilled syringes and vials that are used for clinical trials, for example. He added that health officials are already looking at regulatory pathways to use the vaccine more widely, if needed.He said the first wave of production, if needed, could provide several hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses, and the second tranche could amount to 10 million doses. "Any pivot from that would require additional resources," Boucher said. "If we need to pull any of those levers, we're willing to do so."Partnering with established seasonal flu vaccine producers has the benefit of a licensed platform in place that can be easily adapted to include an H5N1 vaccine virus, but he acknowledged that a downside would be a potential disruption in seasonal flu vaccine production. "There are a lot of variables that go into making that decision." Two safety and immunogenicity studies are already under way on candidate H5N1 vaccines, Boucher told the group.

Infectious DiseasesApril 25, 2024 1 in 5 milk samples from grocery stores test positive for bird flu. Why the FDA says it’s still safe to drinkBy Lisa Howard Experts explain the limits of qPCR testing and how to protect yourself from the H5N1 virus (SACRAMENTO) The Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday that samples of pasteurized milk taken from grocery store shelves had tested positive for bird flu, also known as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) or H5N1. On Thursday, the agency announced that one in five milk samples nationwide showed genetic traces of the virus. Milk samples from areas with infected herds were more likely to test positive. The FDA used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing to check the milk. Although the findings are concerning, it doesn’t necessarily mean the milk contains a live virus that could cause an infection, explained Nam Tran, a professor and senior director of clinical pathology at UC Davis Health. “With qPCR tests, the genetic material, not necessarily the whole active or infectious virus, is what is detected. In the case of food, the genetic material, the RNA found in the grocery store milk samples, may not be the infectious H5N1 virus, but fragments from it,” Tran said. Beate Crossley, a professor of clinical diagnostic virology at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, agreed. “The PCR tests target the genetic material of a virus. The finding of genetic material does not give any information about the viability status of the virus,” Crossley said. “Or put another way, PCR can detect dead and live viruses.” We have been working closely with the Division of Infectious Diseases on H5N1 preparations since before the COVID-19 pandemic. If there are any suspected cases of bird flu in humans, UC Davis Health has the tests ready."—Nam Tran, senior director of clinical pathology Pasteurization kills pathogens Based on currently available information, the FDA says commercial milk is safe. Commercially available milk is pasteurized, a process that kills harmful bacteria and viruses by heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time. The FDA noted the viral particles detected by highly sensitive qPCR tests were likely to have been remnants of viruses killed during the pasteurization process. “To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,” the agency said. To determine if any active, infectious virus remain in the milk samples, the FDA will perform egg inoculation tests, considered the gold standard for determining viability. “With these tests, they inject the sample into the egg to see if the virus replicates or not,” Tran said. While this provides the most sensitive results, it takes longer to complete than other methods. “Virus isolation propagates viruses, and needs a live virus particle to start with,” Crossley said. “A virus isolation positive result of a sample would indicate a live, infectious virus is present in the sample.” The FDA said the results from multiple studies will be available in the next few days to weeks. Spread to dairy cattle detected in March Bird flu is very contagious and often fatal in bird populations. It was first detected in dairy cattle in the U.S. in March. To date, 33 outbreaks of bird flu have been confirmed in dairy cattle in eight states. Since the outbreak, the FDA has been evaluating milk from affected animals, the processing system and grocery store shelves. On Wednesday, the USDA ordered mandatory bird flu testing for any cattle transferred between states. No bird flu has been detected in California’s estimated 1.7 million dairy cows. Two human cases of H5N1 have been confirmed in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers the risk to the general public to be low. Dean Blumberg is the chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Health. “Bird flu rarely spreads person-to-person. It is more commonly spread from animal to human,” Blumberg said. “There has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human spread, although there is always a chance the virus may evolve to transmit among humans more easily.” Some groups of people with job-related or recreational exposures to birds or other infected animals are at greater risk of infection. They should take appropriate precautions to protect against bird flu. Regarding the safety of milk, Blumberg notes the primary risk would be from raw milk. “Pasteurization results in a greater than 99.9999% reduction in infectious virus in contaminated milk, likely eliminating transmission, but there may be a risk of transmission if unpasteurized milk from an infected animal is ingested.” According to the CDC, symptoms of bird flu in humans range from mild, such as conjunctivitis (pink eye), and flu-like upper respiratory symptoms, to severe, such as high fever and pneumonia requiring hospitalization. A full list of bird flu symptoms in humans is available here. Humans infected with bird flu can be effectively treated with the antiviral oseltamivir (Tamiflu) according to Blumberg. Although the jump into cattle is recent, bird flu has been on Tran’s radar for years. The first human cases were reported in China in 2020. “We have been working closely with the Division of Infectious Diseases on H5N1 preparations since before the COVID-19 pandemic,” Tran said. “If there are any suspected cases of bird flu in humans, UC Davis Health has the tests ready.” Updates on Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (FDA) Current U.S. Bird Flu Situation in Humans (CDC) Prevention and Antiviral Treatment of Bird Flu Viruses in People Avian influenza (bird flu) How bird flu virus fragments get into milk sold in stores, and what the spread of H5N1 in cows means for the dairy industry and milk drinkers Explore related topics General Health NewsInfectious Diseases Media ContactSee our media contacts page Related Articles Got fever, sore throat and cough?

The United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) issued a Federal Order, along with answers to frequently asked questions and additional guidance documents, mandating testing for the interstate movement of dairy cattle and reporting of positive detections. Producers and veterinarians are encouraged to visit the USDA APHIS website for the latest information. No cases have been detected in New York livestock to date. According to USDA and the FDA, pasteurized milk and dairy products remain safe to consume as pasteurization kills harmful microbes and pathogens in milk and there is also no concern regarding the consumption of properly cooked meat products.State Agriculture Commissioner Richard A. Ball said, “We’re working hard with our partners at USDA APHIS and across the state to make sure that we are responding quickly and decisively to these cases of HPAI in livestock in other states. While we have no cases to date in livestock in New York, this is certainly a concern for our farmers, and we encourage them to stay up-to-date, follow the Federal Order issued by USDA as well as our state order, and stay in close contact with their veterinarian and practice good biosecurity on site.”State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said, “There are no known cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in humans in New York State and the Department of Health has been actively engaged with state and federal partners regarding this issue. We will continue to work with our partners at the Department of Agriculture and Markets and federal agencies to monitor the situation and prepare for any potential risks to public health and safety.”The Federal Order requires the following measures, effective Monday, April 29, 2024.Mandatory Testing for Interstate Movement of Dairy CattlePrior to interstate movement, dairy cattle are required to receive a negative test for Influenza A virus at an approved National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) laboratory.Owners of herds in which dairy cattle test positive for interstate movement will be required to provide epidemiological information, including animal movement tracing.Dairy cattle moving interstate must adhere to conditions specified by APHIS.As will be described in forthcoming guidance, these steps will be immediately required for lactating dairy cattle, while these requirements for other classes of dairy cattle will be based on scientific factors concerning the virus and its evolving risk profile.Mandatory ReportingLaboratories and state veterinarians must report positive Influenza A nucleic acid detection diagnostic results (e.g., PCR or genetic sequencing) in livestock to USDA APHIS.Laboratories and state veterinarians must report positive Influenza A serology diagnostic results in livestock to USDA APHIS.Learn more at aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/livestock.This week, the State issued new temporary import requirements for dairy cattle coming into New York. These requirements remain in place until further notice and should be followed in addition to the federal order. The temporary import requirements for dairy cattle into New York State are:importation of dairy cattle from a premises with a confirmed case of HPAI or a premises under investigation as a suspect premises is prohibited;dairy cattle imported from affected states must be accompanied by a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI) issued within 10 days prior to entry into the state; andCVIs issued for dairy cattle from affected states must include the statement: “All animals identified on the Certificate of Veterinary (CVI) have been examined and do not originate from a premises with a confirmed detection of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or that is currently under investigation as a suspect premises.”HPAI was confirmed in dairy cattle in Texas in late March, and has since spread to Kansas, New Mexico, Michigan, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina, and South Dakota, and was also diagnosed in young goats in Minnesota on a premises with HPAI-infected poultry. A map of states that have detected HPAI in livestock can be found at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/livestock.While there have been no detections of HPAI in dairy cattle or goats in New York, the Department issued a statewide alert to veterinarians urging them to contact the Department if they see any signs or symptoms of illness in farm animals.Based on the confirmed cases so far, symptoms that veterinarians and farm owners should be on the lookout for include:Clinical signs seen in affected cattle:decreased milk production;acute sudden drop in production with some severely impacted cows experiencing thicker, concentrated milk;decrease in feed consumption; abnormal feces; and low-grade fever.Clinical signs seen in affected newborn goats:Unusual deathsIf any of these symptoms are noted, veterinarians are urged to call the Department at (518) 457-3502 for sampling guidance.In addition to monitoring for animal health, the Department is urging farm owners and farm workers to practice good biosecurity measures, which include the following:Restrict on-farm access to employees and essential personnel;Provide farm-dedicated work boots for all workers that are not worn anywhere else;Prevent cattle from drinking from sources that may be contaminated by waterfowl;Prevent wild birds from accessing feed sources and make sure all feed spills are cleaned up; andContact your veterinarian if you suspect your cattle are showing signs of HPAI.Additional biosecurity recommendations can be found here and information regarding HPAI and milk safety can be found here.

Health What consumers should know about the milk testing positive for bird flu April 24, 20247:03 PM ET By Joe Hernandez Enlarge this image Cows are seen on a dairy farm in Virginia on October 5, 2022. Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images Cows are seen on a dairy farm in Virginia on October 5, 2022. Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images Federal officials say the risk to the public remains low after the Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that tests of commercially available milk detected traces of bird flu. The announcement comes amid a national outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) among dairy cows that was first confirmed late last month. The disease, which is very contagious and often fatal in avian populations, has spread to herds in at least eight states. At least one person who was in contact with presumably sick animals also caught the virus. Sponsor Message National Remnants of the bird flu virus have been found in pasteurized milk, the FDA says But government officials and scientific experts say so far there is no evidence of infectious virus in pasteurized milk. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Jeanne Marrazzo said Wednesday in a call with reporters that tests conducted on retail milk showed that there was genetic material from the virus. Efforts to grow the virus from those samples indicated that the virus was not infectious or "alive," Marrazzo said, adding that testing was only conducted on a small set of samples. "To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe," the FDA said in a statement. If pasteurization inactivates the virus, why is it showing up in milk? Pasteurization has been used in the U.S. for decades to kill harmful bacteria and viruses in milk, but pasteurization may not erase all traces of a virus. Some genetic material may be left behind after the pasteurization process, such as DNA or RNA, the "instructions" that tell the virus what to do, according to Cornell University food science professor Samuel Alcaine. "A car gets in an accident. It's no longer functioning. You can't drive it. It doesn't do anything that a car does. But you sift through the rubble and you could still find the instruction manual that tells it how to work," he said. Sponsor Message Alcaine said that's likely what's happening with bird flu in milk: Tests show the virus used to be there, but it's no longer able to cause an infection. Shots - Health News More states are finding bird flu in cattle. This is what scientists are watching for The FDA said there haven't been any studies specifically on whether pasteurization inactivates bird flu in cow's milk because bovine infections are so new. However, it added that previous studies have shown that pasteurization is "very likely to effectively inactivate heat-sensitive viruses, like H5N1" and that pasteurization has inactivated bird flu in eggs, a process that occurs at a lower temperature than for milk. The FDA said it detected bird flu in milk using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests, which "do not represent actual virus that may be a risk to consumers." Further evaluation of milk samples will be done using egg inoculation tests, the FDA said, which it called the "gold-standard for determining viable virus." The agency said it would release the results from multiple studies within days or weeks. Is it still safe to drink milk? "There are no safety concerns," Alcaine said of milk with traces of bird flu. "I'm still buying my milk from my local grocery store." Federal officials emphasize that any milk from infected cows is supposed to be discarded or destroyed and not enter the human food supply. On top of that, any milk sold via interstate commerce in the U.S. is required to be pasteurized. The FDA has encouraged consumers not to drink raw, unpasteurized milk. Interview highlights What the CDC is doing to monitor and protect against bird flu But Alcaine said influenza is generally not transmitted through food, and the more pressing concern is protecting people like farm workers, who could come into close physical contact with infected animals. In an attempt to further contain the outbreak, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service announced an order Wednesday that requires dairy cows to test negative for bird flu before they can be moved across state lines, among other measures.

Background In Cambodia, zoonotic diseases such as avian influenza and rabies underscore the importance of having a multisectoral corps of professionals trained in field epidemiology and outbreak response. Challenge CAVET graduate collected samples from ducks in Takeo live bird market – August 2016 Avian influenza was first detected in Cambodia in January 2004. Since then, avian influenza has caused 61 poultry outbreaks. The first human cases of avian influenza occurred in 2005, following interaction with infected birds. This human outbreak resulted in 56 cases and 37 deaths. Avian influenza can cause a large number of deaths among infected domestic poultry and wild birds, and animal health experts are often required to cull flocks of infected birds. These deaths can result in food insecurities and potential economic losses. As shown from 2005 outbreaks, avian influenza can also be fatal to people. Although data on human rabies deaths are not regularly reported in Cambodia, most rabies deaths in people are caused by bites from suspected rabid dogs. The best approach to control rabies is to ensure that at least 70% of all dogs are vaccinated against rabies. However, mass vaccination campaigns for dogs compete with other health priorities, and dog owners do not always understand the dangers of rabies. The One Health approach To address these many challenges, the Cambodian Applied Veterinary Epidemiology Training (CAVET) program was established in 2012. This innovative and collaborative program, funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency – Biological Threat Reduction Program (DTRA BTRP), is run by the Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), Cambodian General Directorate of Animal Health and Production (GDAHP), CDC and DTRA BTRP. Spotlight‎ The CAVET program aims to strengthen the One Health approach involving human, animal, and environmental health sectors to combat zoonotic diseases such as avian influenza and rabies. Impact CAVET Provides Classroom and Field-based Training Experience Since 2012, 165 participants across seven cohorts have completed the training program. Participants included veterinarians, final-year veterinary students, physicians, human and animal laboratory technicians, and wildlife officers. Most CAVET participants have completed at least an undergraduate degree in Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine. CAVET combines classroom instruction with field-based practice and research projects. A CAVET instructor showing CAVET trainees how to connect to the Global Alliance for Rabies Control (GARC)’s Rabies Educator Certificate (REC) – June 2018 Classroom instruction allows participants to develop knowledge and skills in epidemiology with an emphasis on measuring disease occurrence, evaluating disease surveillance systems, and conducting outbreak investigation and response activities. Classroom instruction typically includes presentations from national and international human, animal, and environmental health experts. The field-based training component involves one week of hands-on practice in primary animal diseases occurring in Cambodia (e.g., zoonotic and transboundary animal diseases). Hands on-experience includes animal sample collection, packaging, transportation, and participating in laboratory-based animal necropsy. Following the five-week course, 10 participants from each cohort are selected to develop and complete a six-month research project. Projects focus on priority animal diseases identified in the participants' home city or province. To graduate from CAVET, participants are required to complete the five-week course and the 6-month research project. All CAVET participants are members of the CAVET network and attend alumni meetings and refresher trainings. CAVET Graduates Focus on Avian Influenza and Rabies CAVET participants and graduates are actively involved in surveillance and outbreak investigations to prevent and control avian influenza and dog rabies transmission. In March 2021, animal health experts detected an avian influenza A (H5N1) virus outbreak in free-ranging wild birds. CAVET graduates investigated the outbreak in close collaboration with national and international animal, human, and environmental health agencies. The outbreak involved more than 2,255 wild birds from six different species, including 2,248 Asian Openbill Storks. CAVET graduates used their outbreak investigation training to identify that the likely source of the outbreak was migratory birds. Graduates also applied prevention and control measures, including properly disposing of deceased birds, culling wild birds in infected flocks, and restricting the movement of humans, animals, and animal products in and out of the outbreak area. CAVET graduates collected domestic poultry and wild bird samples for confirming the presence or absence of avian influenza viruses, before declaring a free zone. Rabies is a fatal but preventable zoonotic disease. Dog slaughterhouses are for-profit businesses where free-roaming dogs are slaughtered and sold as food. In Cambodia, dog bites are a frequent cause of human rabies. CAVET graduates regularly communicate with local authorities and dog slaughterhouse' owners about rabies and the steps to follow to identify dogs with suspected rabies (i.e., suspicious clinical signs of rabies). CAVET graduates also support rabies surveillance efforts by collecting and transporting deceased dogs to the National Animal Health and Production Research Institute (NAHPRI) or Institute Pasteur du Cambodge for rabies virus diagnostics. CAVET graduates also contribute rabies surveillance efforts by collecting and transporting deceased dogs to the National Animal Health and Production Research Institute (NAHPRI) or Institute Pasteur du Cambodge for rabies virus diagnostic testing. CAVET graduates are supporting in an Integrated Bite Case Management (IBCM) project in Phnom Penh, which includes organizing mass dog rabies vaccination campaigns and educating school children and community members on rabies prevention. Education campaigns focus on the vaccination of dogs for rabies and preventative actions to reduce dog bites. Strengthening the Training Program using a One Health Approach The CAVET program provides important training for veterinarians and other public health officers on field veterinary epidemiology to prevent and control zoonotic diseases in Cambodia. These diseases, such as avian influenza and rabies, can spill over and spread to the human population. Gaps in coordination, communication, and collaboration across the animal, human, and the environmental health sectors still exist. To address these gaps in the future, CAVET program managers will increase opportunities to increase participation from the other health sectors, establish a One Health Technical Working Group, and organize One Health events such as the National Epidemiology Conference, and promote multisectoral engagement in zoonotic disease surveillance and outbreak response activities.

We’d also like to share a reminder to be on the lookout for motorcycles when you are driving as we head into better weather. Also, helmets are always a good idea.”Dr. Tiffney Widner -- Pediatrician, Children’s Hospital of Michigan“We’ve seen cases of scarlet fever recently, flu, upper respiratory infections, and gastroenteritis. Allergies are also prevalent with the changing of seasons.”Oakland County – Viral illnesses, stomach viruses, influenza, seasonal allergies, asthma flare-upsDr. Jim Getsinger -- Emergency Center physician, William Beaumont University Hospital in Royal Oak“Flu season is almost over. We have a few lingering cases still coming in. Personally, I’ve seen a little bump in viral gastrointestinal infections of late. Wash your hands carefully!”Sarah Rauner, RN -- Chief pediatric nurse practitioner, Corewell Health’s Beaumont Hospital Troy“It’s that time of year when our winter and spring illnesses collide. We’re still seeing some upper respiratory infections causing coughs, fevers, and other associated symptoms. Influenza remains one of the many viruses in that category, although it is, hopefully, on the decline for this season. Gastroenteritis, which causes vomiting, diarrhea, and/or a fever, is increasing, so it’s important to wash your hands. Asthma exacerbations and allergy issues are also on the rise. Please continue to stay home when sick, get lots of rest, and get outside for some sunshine and fresh air as spring is near.”Dr. Rena Daiza -- Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Bloomfield Twp.“I am still seeing an uptick of viral illnesses in the community. It is important to distinguish between allergies and viral illnesses this time of year. If the usual allergic remedy is not working, patients should consider being tested for COVID-19, influenza, or consider another viral infection. They should take standard precautions when ill with a virus to be sure not to spread it. "Emergency Department, Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital“We are seeing a high number of chest pains, abdominal pains, and respiratory issues.”Washtenaw County – Seasonal allergies, breathing problems, influenza, stomach viruses, COVID, upper respiratory infectionsDr. Brad Uren -- Clinical Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, Michigan Medicine“This week, seasonal allergies continue to cause trouble for COPD or asthma patients. Less flu, COVID, and URIs this week. Less GI as well, but still low amounts of all of the above in circulation.”Washtenaw County Health Department“Influenza cases in Washtenaw County residents are currently at high levels but appear to be decreasing. Most Influenza cases being reported in Washtenaw County are Influenza A, types A(H1N1) and A(H3). Sporadic cases of Influenza B are being reported. Influenza-related deaths in Washtenaw County adults have been reported this flu season. All individuals were older adults with confirmed Influenza A infection. Flu-related hospitalizations of Washtenaw residents are currently at high levels but appear to be decreasing.”Monroe County – Influenza, seasonal allergies, respiratory virusesProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital – Emergency Center“We are seeing a lot of patients with chest pain, hypokalemia, and influenza A. Patients are also coming in with fall injuries.”Macomb County – Seasonal allergies, sinus problems, stomach viruses, influenza, pneumoniaDr. Anthony Joslin -- Emergency physician at McLaren Macomb“Patients are still presenting with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, though the number of cases continues to taper off. The upturn in weather has led to more patients suffering from their spring allergies, with severe reactions causing breathing complications. Though late in the traditional season, cases of pneumonia and flu continue to be diagnosed in low volumes.”Dr. Maria Samuel -- Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Sterling Heights“Seasonal allergies and runny nose, congestion, and sinus problems have predominated this week. We are seeing less viral respiratory infections.”Livingston County -- Stomach viruses, respiratory viruses, seasonal allergiesCopyright 2024 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved.About the AuthorsSarah Mayberry, M.P.H. headshotSarah Mayberry, M.P.H.emailFrank McGeorge, MD headshotFrank McGeorge, MDDr. McGeorge can be seen on Local 4 News helping Metro Detroiters with health concerns when he isn't helping save lives in the emergency room at Henry Ford Hospital.emailClick here to take a moment and familiarize yourself with our Community Guidelines.Loading...Recommended VideosTV ListingsEmail NewslettersRSS FeedsContests and RulesContact UsCareers at WDIVClosed Captioning / Audio DescriptionPublic FileTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My InfoFCC ApplicationsCookie PreferencesFollow UsVisit our YouTube page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Facebook page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Instagram page (opens in a new tab)Visit our X page (opens in a new tab)Visit our RSS Feed page (opens in a new tab)Get Results With OmneIf you need help with the Public File, call (313) 222-0556.At WDIV, we are committed to informing and delighting our audience.

The specific strain is called H5N1 and is a type A influenza virus. It is also referred to as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). This H5N1 strain is commonly carried in wild birds, especially waterfowl such as ducks and geese. Chicken and domestic duck flocks have been infected by wild birds. HPAI is a very dangerous disease for birds; most that are infected die. HPAI is also highly transmissible among birds. It’s common for an infected bird to pass the virus to other birds. How did this happen? The initial HPAI infections in cattle were detected on several dairies with sick cows in the south-central United States. This is what is termed a “spillover event,” in which a disease that is common in one group of animals infects a different group. Virus shed from wild birds – probably waterfowl, most likely in their feces – somehow infected cows. The exact route of this transmission isn’t yet known. There have been occasional documented cases of HPAI spillover events into wild mammals, such as skunks and raccoons. An influenza virus incubation period – how long it takes between exposure to an infected individual and development of disease – can be up to two weeks. Some unknown-to-be-infected cows from infected herds were transported to other states, taking HPAI with them. “Home” cows on some of those dairies in other states got sick and tested positive for HPAI, suggesting that there is some transmission between cows. Because of this evidence, the term “bovine influenza A virus” is also in use. The first reported cases of HPAI in domestic ruminants – cattle, sheep and goats – were detected in very young goats in Minnesota shortly before the identification of HPAI in dairy cattle. In that case, the goats were born on a farm that had recently had HPAI in the farm’s poultry flock. The poultry and goats had access to the same space with a shared water source. What about cow health? Not all exposed or infected cows get sick. It seems to be a pretty small percentage – 10% or less – that develop clinical cases of this influenza. Clinical symptoms may include: Reduced feed intake Reduced milk production Thick and off-color (yellowish) milk or no milk in severely affected cows Reduced activity Fever Abnormal consistency of feces that could be diarrhea but more often is drier than normal. Cows with clinical cases generally recover within several weeks. There are not yet enough data to say whether or not there are effects on reproduction or future milk production. Fortunately, unlike birds, this disease is not lethal in cows. Cows with HPAI infection seem to shed a lot of virus in the milk. The H5N1 viral strain seems to be capable of replicating in the mammary gland. So far, tests of other secretions have turned up low or undetectable virus levels. What about food safety? On dairy farms, milk from sick cows is discarded. It does not leave the farm. The FDA has recently confirmed that pasteurization is effective at destroying influenza viruses along with other pathogens. Consumption of raw milk, however, does carry risk. Raw milk can be pasteurized at home. Here are instructions for home pasteurization. Who is at risk? Older dairy cows that are later in lactation seems to be most susceptible to HPAI. Younger cows seem to be less susceptible and dry (non-milking) cows, heifers and calves even less susceptible. Young stock on farms with infected cows have not shown symptoms. There have been no documented cases in beef cattle. There is no reason to assume beef cattle can’t be infected with HPAI, but they may be more resistant and infected animals might be less easily detected. There has been one documented case of cow-derived HPAI in a person, and that person worked very closely with infected cows. In that human case, the person experienced conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye. People who work directly with HPAI-infected cows should wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling them or working with the raw milk. People consuming pasteurized milk or other dairy products bear no additional risk. Cats on farms with infected cows have died of HPAI infection. It is likely that those cats consumed raw milk from infected cows. It is also possible that they consumed infected wild birds, which has been a route of infection for cats in the past. I have cattle or other mammalian livestock. What should I do? Be mindful about biosecurity. Quarantine animals coming from another location. Only let essential farm visitors or vehicles in animal areas. Discourage wild birds – especially waterfowl – from spending time on your farm. Avoid unprotected exposure to sick or dead animals, wild or domestic. Be attentive. If one or more cows show symptoms of HPAI infection, contact your veterinarian. Isolate sick animals from the rest of the herd. Milk sick cows last. Offer supportive therapy, such as fluids, to sick animals. Consult your veterinarian. What about restrictions on moving cows across state lines? The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued a federal order on April 24, 2024 requiring testing for and reporting of HPAI in livestock. One of the provisions is the testing of lactating cattle if they will be crossing a state line. Milk samples must be collected and sent to an accredited lab within seven days of the intended interstate movement. A positive test will make any lactating cattle from that herd ineligible for interstate travel for at least 30 days. Nonclinical lactating cattle moving interstate directly to slaughter are not required to be tested. Cows that travel intrastate to an auction or marketplace and then travel directly to an out-of-state slaughter facility do not need to be tested. These animals will still require a certificate of veterinary inspection. Nonlactating animals (calves, heifers, dry cows, males) do not require testing at this time. APHIS has provided additional guidance on testing and movement. Where can I learn more?

As a result, human infections with avian H9N2 viruses have been increasingly reported. In 2017, an H9N2 virus was isolated for the first time from Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that bat H9N2 is descended from a common ancestor dating back centuries ago. However, the H9 and N2 sequences appear to be genetically similar to current avian IAVs, suggesting recent reassortment events. These observations raise the question of the zoonotic potential of the mammal-adapted bat H9N2. Here, we investigate the infection and transmission potential of bat H9N2 in vitro and in vivo, the ability to overcome the antiviral activity of the human MxA protein, and the presence of N2-specific cross-reactive antibodies in human sera. We show that bat H9N2 has high replication and transmission potential in ferrets, efficiently infects human lung explant cultures, and is able to evade antiviral inhibition by MxA in transgenic B6 mice. Together with its low antigenic similarity to the N2 of seasonal human strains, bat H9N2 fulfils key criteria for pre-pandemic IAVs.

Although bats have long been known to be reservoirs for a variety of viruses2, they were only recently found to also harbor IAVs3,4. While H17N10 and H18N11 strains were first identified in Central and South American bat species3,4, the H9N2 virus A/bat/Egypt/381OP/2017, designated as bat H9N2, was recently isolated from Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) in the Nile Delta region5. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that this Old World bat H9N2 virus is distinct from the New World bat IAVs H17N10 and H18N11, and emerged as a reassortant from an ancestral bat backbone and avian IAV H9 and N2 segments6. Avian H9N2 viruses were first isolated from turkeys in North American poultry farms in 19667 and subsequently became endemic in poultry farms in many countries in the Middle East and Asia8,9. Since then, avian H9N2 viruses have become widespread and have undergone extensive reassortment with other circulating avian IAVs, resulting in at least 74 different lineages10. Over the past two decades, avian H9N2 infections have been recorded in swine populations and mink farms11,12. Furthermore, since 1998, the WHO has reported 82 human spill-over infections with avian IAVs in China or Cambodia, resulting in mild to severe disease13. Interestingly, sero-epidemiological data from Ghanaian straw-colored fruit bats showed a high prevalence of H9-specific antibodies (30%)14, and bat H9N2 was also detected in Egyptian fruit bats from South Africa15, suggesting widespread circulation of bat H9N2 in African bat populations. Similar to avian H9N2, bat H9N2 initiates infection by utilizing avian IAV-like α2,3 sialic acid receptors, and replicates in mice, but not in adult chickens5. Here, we investigated whether bat H9N2 is of zoonotic concern. We show that the bat H9N2 IAV isolated from Egyptian fruit bats exhibits robust replication and transmission in ferrets, effectively infects human lung cells, evades MxA antiviral activity, and has low antigenic similarity to seasonal human strains, indicating its potential as a pre-pandemic influenza strain.Results and discussionAs H9N2 viruses were originally isolated from turkeys7, we first determined the replication properties of bat H9N2 in 1-day-old turkeys. Following oro-nasal inoculation, bat H9N2 replicated efficiently to 105–107 copies mL−1 at 1 day post infection (dpi; Supplementary Fig. 1a). Thereafter, viral loads rapidly decreased but again reached titers of 5 × 105 copies mL−1 between 5 and 8 dpi. Infectious virus was isolated from oral swabs collected at 5 dpi (Supplementary Fig. 1a). At 11 dpi, all but one oral swab was negative for viral RNA (Supplementary Fig. 1a) and no viral RNA was detected in cloacal swabs at any time point measured. All turkey hatchlings seroconverted with antibodies targeting the viral nucleoprotein (NP) at 21 dpi (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c), demonstrating that bat H9N2 maintained its ability to replicate in turkeys. In contrast, and in agreement with previous reports5, bat H9N2 failed to replicate efficiently in 1-day-old chicken and did not elicit an antibody response (Supplementary Fig. 1d, e). In the future, the molecular species differences that allow the bat H9N2 to replicate efficiently in turkeys but not chickens need to be investigated in more detail.In order to assess the zoonotic potential and transmissibility of bat H9N2 in the model most relevant to humans, we infected 15 donor ferrets and co-housed three naïve contact animals from 1 to 12 dpi (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1f). Quantification of viral RNA obtained from nasal lavages revealed substantial viral replication (106–108 copies mL−1) within the first 2 days after infection and continuous shedding of viral genomes and infectious virus up to 8 dpi (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1g). Strikingly, all contact animals acquired a viral infection from donor ferrets after co-housing with peak titers (107 copies mL−1) at 4 days post exposure (dpe) (Fig. 1a). To determine whether bat H9N2 replication is limited to the upper respiratory tract, we next measured viral titers in the organs of six donor ferrets euthanized at 6 dpi (Fig. 1b). While all ferrets had substantial viral genome copies in the nasal conchae and five of six animals had moderate levels in the trachea, one of six ferrets had moderate viral genome levels in the cranial lung lobe, two in the medial and caudal lung lobes, and one ferret even had low viral copies in the colon (Fig. 1b). We did not observe severe body weight loss in most donor and any contact ferrets, although two donor animals exhibited ~15% weight loss at 6 and 12 dpi (Fig. 1c), which was most likely unrelated to infection. Elevated body temperatures were observed at 2 dpi in 14 of 15 donor ferrets (Fig. 1d) and all contact animals had elevated body temperatures at 1 dpe (Fig. 1d). Seroconversion with NP-specific antibodies was detected as early as 6 dpi in donor ferrets, and all donor and contact ferrets examined at 21 dpi exhibited a robust NP-specific antibody response (Fig. 1e). Furthermore, at 21 dpi we determined antibodies with a strong neutralizing capacity against bat H9N2 and some degree of cross-neutralization against the avian H9N2 A/layer chicken/Bangladesh/VP02-plaque/2016 isolate (Fig. 1f). Histopathological examination revealed severe purulent to necrotizing rhinitis with viral antigen in the epithelia of the respiratory and olfactory tract in all infected ferrets at 6 dpi (Fig. 1g). We observed mild infection-induced changes characterized by focal to oligofocal epithelial necrosis and mild infiltration of the lamina propria in the trachea of four animals. In accordance with the low viral genome copies detected in the ferret lungs, no influenza-associated lung pathology was detected, which is in contrast to lung pathology of ferrets after infection with e.g. reassorted H9N2- or highly pathogenic avian influenza strains16,17,18,19.Fig. 1: Ferrets are highly susceptible to bat H9N2.a Ferrets (n = 15) were inoculated with 104.8 TCID50 of bat H9N2 IAV per animal. At 1 dpi, direct contact animals (n = 3) were co-housed. Donor ferrets euthanized at 6 dpi are indicated. Viral shedding was measured by nasal lavage. Dashed line indicates detection limit. b Organs collected from euthanized ferrets (n = 6) at 6 dpi with bat H9N2 were tested by RT-qPCR to determine viral genome copies.

Data are mean ± SD. c Changes in body weight relative to 0 dpi of bat H9N2-infected (n = 15) and contact (n = 3) ferrets were monitored throughout the course of the experiment. d Changes from the baseline body temperatures of donor and naïve contact ferrets were monitored from 0 to 14 dpi. e Ferret serum antibody titers in an IAV NP-specific ELISA at the indicated time points (0 dpi n = 18, 6 dpi n = 6, 21 dpi n = 12). Dashed lines indicates threshold between 45% and 50% inhibition. Mean antibody titers are indicated. Note that one ferret showed weak reactivity in the pre-experimental NP-ELISA, but was included in the study because of its low seropositivity, which could be due to a previously unrecognized IAV infection or an unspecific ELISA reactivity. There was no indication of H9N2 serology prior to inoculation. f Ferret neutralizing antibody titers (n = 18) against bat H9N2 and chicken H9N2. g Histopathologic findings with detection of viral antigen in the nasal mucosa of bat H9N2-infected ferrets (n = 6, panels 1–3) at 6 dpi or mock-infected ferret (n = 1, panels 4 and 5).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageBecause severe courses of influenza in humans almost always affect the lower respiratory tract20, we next infected human ex vivo lung cultures with bat H9N2, a prototypic human seasonal H3N2 isolate (A/Panama/2007/1999) or chicken H9N2 and determined viral growth properties. Intriguingly, bat H9N2 replicated to comparable or even higher viral titers than human H3N2, reaching peak titers of 3 × 104 plaque-forming units (PFU) mL−1 at 48 h post infection (hpi; Fig. 2a). In contrast, chicken H9N2 showed minimal viral replication in human lung tissue. Immunostaining of lung explants at 24 hpi revealed that all viruses infected alveolar type II cells (Fig. 2b), which is the primary cellular tropism of IAV in the lung21.Fig. 2: Bat H9N2 replicates in human lung explants and suppresses induction of MxA in MxA-transgenic mice.a Human lung tissue explants (n = 4) were infected with human H3N2, chicken H9N2 or bat H9N2 with 1 × 106 PFU, and viral titers were determined at the indicated time points. Error bars indicate standard deviation and statistical analysis was performed using non-paired, non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test (*p = 0.0324). Data are mean ± SD of n = 4 independent experiments. Dashed line indicates detection limit (b) At 24 hpi, human lung explants were stained for alveolar type I (AT1) (cyan) and type II (AT2) cells (yellow), CD68 indicating alveolar macrophages (green) and IAV antigens (red). Note, in chicken H9N2 and bat H9N2 infected cells, AT2 labeling was omitted for better visualization. White arrows indicate infected cells. Scale bar, 10 µm. c MDCK cells overexpressing MxA or inactive MxAT103A were infected with human-adapted pdmH1N1, avian KAN-1 (H5N1) or bat H9N2 at an MOI of 0.001, and viral titers were determined at the indicated time points. Data are mean ± SD of n = 3 independent experiments; statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed t-tests; **P = 0.01; ****P = 0.0001. Dashed line indicates detection limit. d hMxAtgg (n = 8) or wild-type B6 mice (n = 8) were infected with 1 × 104 PFU. Lung viral titers were determined 3 dpi. e hMxAtgg (n = 6) or wild-type B6 mice (n = 7) were pretreated with IFN-α 18 h prior to infection with 1 × 104 PFU. Lung viral titers were determined 3 dpi. Data are mean ± SD; statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed t-tests; ****P = 0.0001. f MxA, NP and actin protein levels in homogenized lungs from IFN-α pretreated or infected mice from (d,e) were detected by Western blot. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageNext, we studied whether bat H9N2 is able to escape human MxA, a crucial innate antiviral factor which restricts IAVs by inhibiting their polymerase activity22. Human-adapted IAVs, such as the pandemic H1N1 virus A/Hamburg/4/2009 (pdmH1N1), acquire characteristic clusters of adaptive mutations in NP that enable escape from MxA22,23, whereas such clusters are virtually absent in IAVs of avian origin including the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004 (KAN-1). Bat H9N2 NP also lacks the residues described as conferring MxA resistance (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Thus, as expected, bat H9N2 exhibited a high degree of MxA-sensitivity as demonstrated by infecting MDCK cells stably overexpressing either wild-type MxA (MDCK-MxA) or the antivirally inactive MxAT103A variant (MDCK-MxAT103A)24. While pdmH1N1, KAN-1 and bat H9N2 replicated efficiently in MDCK-MxAT103A cells to titers between 1.3 × 107 and 7 × 108 PFU mL-1 at 48 hpi (Fig. 2c), KAN-1 was nearly completely inhibited in MDCK-MxA cells whereas peak titers of pdmH1N1 decreased only 5-fold. Replication of bat H9N2 was potently restricted in the presence of MxA as illustrated by residual viral titers ≤ 102 PFU mL−1 between 24–48 hpi (Fig. 2c).To assess the importance of MxA in controlling bat H9N2 in vivo, we intranasally infected wild type C57BL/6 (B6), which lack a functional Mx protein, and human MxA-transgenic (hMxAtgg) mice with bat H9N2. Surprisingly, lung viral titers were similar in both B6 and MxA-transgenic mice25 at 3 dpi (5 × 105 PFU mL-1; Fig. 2d), as confirmed by comparable NP levels in lung homogenates detected by Western blotting (Fig. 2f). Interestingly, MxA expression was not observed in the lungs of infected hMxAtgg mice, but could be potently induced by IFN-α pretreatment 18 h prior to challenge infection with bat H9N2. Under these conditions, we observed induction of MxA (Fig. 2f) and 10-fold lower lung viral lung titers in hMxAtgg compared to B6 mice (Fig. 2e), suggesting that MxA, when induced, reduces bat H9N2 replication.Finally, because there is little serological evidence for H9-specific antibodies in the human population26,27, we wondered whether the antibody responses to circulating seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 strains as well as vaccination would be cross-reactive for bat N2. Serum collected from 15 healthy adults before and after seasonal influenza vaccination in 2022/23 revealed no reactivity to bat N2 (Supplementary Fig. 2b,e), but robust reactivity to N2 from the seasonal A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2) isolate (Supplementary Fig. 2d).Our study shows that the Old World bat H9N2 virus meets key characteristics of a pre-pandemic IAV, including replication in and efficient transmission between ferrets, the ability to replicate efficiently in human lung explants and evasion from MxA-mediated restriction. Intriguingly, bat H9N2 exhibits an immediate (at 1 dpe) and highly efficient transmission potential (100%) not previously observed in any avian-derived H9N2 isolate with an α2,3 sialic acid receptor specificty28,29,30,31. As the bat H9N2 HA specifically binds to avian IAV-like α2,3 sialic acid receptors for cell entry and fails to recognize mammalian-like α2,6 sialic acid receptors5, we suggest that infection of ferrets and mice occurs by binding to α2,3 sialic acid receptors, which are also present in low numbers in the upper respiratory tract32,33. Thus, the ability of bat H9N2 to replicate in and transmit among ferrets may also allow for spread among and further adaptation to humans. Our data also suggests that bat H9N2 can suppress the expression of MxA, thereby overcoming this important restriction factor for zoonotic spill-over34. This is in strong contrast to zoonotic H5N1 and H7N9 viruses of avian origin, which also lack MxA resistance in NP but induce MxA in hMxAtgg mice and thus are potently inhibited25. Given the ability of bat H9N2 to infect turkey hatchlings, introduction of bat H9N2 into poultry farms and reassortment with avian IAV cannot be ruled out, necessitating increased attention and close monitoring of possible human spill-over infections in Africa.A further prerequisite of pre-pandemic viruses is their antigenic novelty to the human immune system. Since the human population is presently exposed only to the currently-circulating H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, a lack of humoral immunity to bat H9N2 is very likely. Indeed, our serological data demonstrates that seasonal influenza vaccines containing H1N1 and H3N2 do not elicit cross-reactive antibodies to the bat N2 protein, substantiating the general pre-pandemic features of bat H9N2.MethodsVirusThe bat-derived H9N2 A/bat/Egypt/381OP/2017 isolate (GenBank accession numbers: MH376902 to MH376909), was propagated in embryonated SPF-chicken eggs for 5 days at 37 °C. Subsequently, the allantoic fluid was harvested and used as virus stock. The chicken H9N2 isolate A/layer chicken/Bangladesh/VP02-plaque/2016 was obtained from the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) virus repository35. Virus stocks of the human seasonal A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) isolate were generated by propagation on MDCKII cells. Recombinant A/Hamburg/4/2009 (pdmH1N1) and A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004 (H5N1) were generated utilizing the eight-plasmid pHW2000-based rescue system36. All recombinant viruses were plaque purified and then used for stock generation. Stock titers were determined by a plaque assay on MDCKII cells.CellsMadin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) type II cells (Collection of Cell Lines in Veterinary Medicine CCLV RIE1061) were used. Cells were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere using a mixture of equal volumes of Eagle Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) (Hank’s balanced salts solution) and Eagle MEM (Earle’s balanced salts solution), 2 mM L-Gln, nonessential amino acids, adjusted to 850 mg L−1 NaHCO3, 120 mg L-1 sodium pyruvate, pH 7.2 with 10% FCS (Bio & Sell GmbH) or without FCS in the presence of tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma) after virus addition. MDCK-MxA and MDCK-MxAT103A cells were obtained by Jesse D. Bloom (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, United States)24 and were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U penicillin and 100 µg streptomycin mL−1 at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Virus infectionsMDCK-MxA and MDCK-MxAT103A cells were seeded and grown in 6-well plates. Prior to infection cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then infected with the indicated virus at an MOI of 0.001 in infection medium (DMEM, containing 0.2% BSA and 100 U penicillin and 100 µg streptomycin µL-1). For bat H9N2 and pdmH1N1 1 µg mL-1 TPCK-treated trypsin was added into the infection medium. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay.Infection of human lung explantsFresh lung explants were obtained from patients suffering from lung carcinoma and undergoing lung resection at local thoracic surgeries. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and the study was approved by the ethics committee at the Charité clinic (project EA2/079/13). Tumor-free peripheral lung tissue was cut into small pieces and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium. The next day, lung tissue was infected with 1 × 106 PFU of either human seasonal H3N2, chicken H9N2 or bat H9N2 for 1.5 h under shaking conditions and excess virus was removed by three washing steps with PBS. Infected lung tissues were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for up to 72 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and 0.3% BA. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay.Western blotMouse lung samples were incubated at 95 °C in Laemmli buffer and subsequently separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE). Separated protein samples were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were detected using specific antibodies against the highly conserved G domain in MxA (M143)23, NP (Gene Tex, GTX125989, 1:1,000), or actin (Sigma-Aldrich, A3853; 1:1,000), respectively. Primary antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:5,000).Animal experiment ethics declarationsAll ferret and hatchling experiments were evaluated by the responsible ethics committee of the State Office of Agriculture, Food Safety, and Fishery in Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania (LALLF M-V) and gained governmental approval under the registration numbers LVL MV TSD/7221.3-1-029/22 and 7221.3-1-003/22. All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the German animal protection law and were approved by the state of Baden-Württemberg (Regierungspräsidium Freiburg; reference number: 35-9185.81/G-19/05).AnimalsOne-day-old chickens, 1-day-old turkeys, ferrets as well as C57BL/6 (B6) mice and human MxA transgenic (hMxAtgg) mice were used for this study. Chicks were bread at the FLI from SPF-chicken eggs (VALOBioMedia, Germany) and 1-day-old turkeys were ordered and shipped on hatching day from a local breeding facility (Bösel) to the FLI. The ferrets were obtained from the in-house breeding program at the FLI. B6 mice were obtained from Janvier and hMxAtgg mice were bred in-house at the Institute of Virology, Freiburg. All mice were housed in individually ventilated cages (Green Line, Tecniplast) with stable bedding (2HK: TAPVEI® BEDDING), at a temperature of 20.2 ± 1.1 °C, a humidity of 55% ± 7.1% and a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle. The mice were fed ad libitum with food made from natural ingredients (Germany, altromin 1314). All animal work was performed in BSL3 containment facilities.One-day-old chicken and turkey studiesAt the day of hatching, 1-day-old turkeys were inoculated with 105 TCID50 per animal and 1-day-old chicks were inoculated with 103,9 TCID50 per animal, calculated by back-titration of the original inoculum. All hatchlings were sampled daily via cloacal and oro-pharyngeal swabs until 21 dpi or until the animal samples tested negative in a bat H9N2-specific RT-qPCR. Oro-pharyngeal and cloacal swabs were taken using plain swab sterile paper applicator cotton tips 164 C (Copan, Brescia, Italy). The swabs were immediately transferred into 1 mL of cell culture medium containing 1% Baytril (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany), 0.5% lincomycin (WDT, Garbsen, Germany) and 0.2% amphotericin/gentamycin (Fisher Scientific Waltham, MA, USA). After euthanasia, nasal conchae and colon organ samples were taken for investigation of viral genome loads via RT-qPCR analysis in the respective organs. Clinical status of the animals was checked daily.Ferret study18 adult ferrets (Mustela putorius furo, 10 females and 8 males, aged > 0,5 years) were housed in multi-connected cage units. Before inoculation, blood samples and nasal washings were collected to confirm naivety to IAV of all animals via serological analysis (ELISA) and RT-qPCR. Only one ferret showed some weak reactivity in the pre-experimental NP-ELISA, but was included in the study because of its low seropositivity, which could be due to a previously unrecognized IAV infection or an unspecific ELISA reactivity. However, there was no indication of any H9N2 serology before inoculation. Body weight, body temperature as well as physical condition of all animals was monitored regularly throughout the animal trial. Nasal washing samples were taken under a short-term isoflurane inhalation anesthesia by applying 750 µl of PBS into each nostril and collecting the efflux. Rectal swabs were taken using plain swab sterile paper applicator cotton tips 164 C (Copan). The swabs were immediately transferred into 1 mL of cell culture medium containing 1% Baytril (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany), 0.5% lincomycin (WDT, Garbsen, Germany) and 0.2% amphotericin/gentamycin (Fisher Scientific Waltham, MA, USA). After 1 week of acclimatization to their new environment (0 dpi), 15 ferrets were intranasally inoculated with 104.8 TCID50 per animal in a 200 µL volume (calculated by back-titration of the original material). The inoculum was evenly distributed into each nostril (~100 µl per nostril). At 1 dpi, three naïve contact animals were co-housed in the multi-connected cage units of the donor ferrets to determine direct virus transmission. All animals were sampled via nasal washings and rectal swabs daily until 10 dpi and afterwards every second day until 21 dpi or until the samples tested negative via bat H9N2 specific RT-qPCR analysis. Clinical signs of disease (nasal discharge, reduced activity, fever, neurological symptoms and dyspnea), rectal body temperature and body weight were monitored daily. At 6 dpi, in the acute phase of the infection, six donor ferrets were euthanized and subject to necropsy for pathomorphological investigation and analysis of viral genome loads in the upper and lower respiratory organs, as well as in the intestinal tract. The residual animals were kept until the end of the study at 21 dpi to allow for seroconversion. Nasal conchae organ samples from animals euthanized at 21 dpi were analyzed with a bat H9N2-specific RT-qPCR.Mouse studyFor infection experiments, 15 B6 mice (7 females and 8 males, aged 6–10 weeks) and 14 hMxAtgg mice (7 females and 7 males, aged 6–10 weeks) were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg per g body weight) and xylazine (5 mg per g body weight) administered intraperitoneally and were subsequently inoculated intranasally with 40 µL of the indicated virus dose diluted in Opti-MEM containing 0.3% BSA. For interferon pretreatment 2 μg per 100 μL IFN-α was administered subcutaneously 18 h prior to challenge with the indicated virus. Throughout the experiment, mice were monitored daily for changes in body weight and other signs of disease. At 3 dpi mice were sacrificed and the lung was dissected. Organs were homogenized in 1 mL PBS by three subsequent rounds of mechanical treatment for 25 s each at 6.5 ms−1. Tissue debris was removed by centrifuging homogenates for 5 min at 2.400 × g at 4 °C and samples were stored at -80 °C until further processing. Viral organ titers were determined by plaque assay.Propagation of bat H9N2 virus isolates from turkey samplesFor isolation of bat H9N2 from turkey hatchlings, swab material was used for inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs. Briefly, 200 µl of selected animal samples were transferred into the allantoic cavity of embryonated SPF-chicken eggs (three eggs per sample), followed by incubation for 5 days at 37 °C. Viral genome material was extracted from the allantoic fluid and detected by RT-qPCR analysis.Pathomorphology and immunohistochemistryFor the ferret histopathology, nasal conchae, trachea, right cranial, medial and caudal lung lobes as well as the colon were sampled. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin wax and cut at 3 µm sections. To assess tissue architecture and cell morphology sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin following standard procedures. For viral antigen detection immunohistochemistry was performed using an in house derived rabbit polyclonal primary antibody directed against the influenza nucleoprotein (NP, 1:750)37. Lesions and cellular vial antigen localization were determined and evaluated by a board-certified pathologist (DiplACVP).To analyze the cellular tropism of IAV infection in human lung tissue samples, tissues were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 48 h, embedded in paraffin and processed for immunohistochemistry. Lung tissue was then blocked with 5% adequate serum and incubated with primary antibodies directed to CD68 (abcam, Cambridge, UK, 1:50), HT2-280 (terrace biotech, 1:200) and EMP2 (atlas antibodies, 1:50). Viral antigens were stained with polyclonal antibodies to IAV (Serotec, Puchheim, Germany, 1:50) conjugated to a fluorophore (DyLight 488, Thermo Fisher). Primary antibodies were detected using a corresponding secondary labeling kits (OPAL Polaris, Akoyabio) and nuclear counterstaining was performed using DAPI (Sigma, Hamburg, Germany). Finally tissue sections were mounted in Mowiol, and analyzed using a LSM 780 spectral confocal microscope (objectives 63x Plan-Apochromat/oil, NA 1.4, Zeiss, Germany).Experimental sample work-up and analysisAnimal organ samples of about 0.1 cm3 size were first homogenized in a 2 mL Eppendorf-tube containing 1 mL of Hank’s balanced salts MEM and Earle’s balanced salts MEM (2 mM L-glutamine, 850 mg L−1 NaHCO3, 120 mg L−1 sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin) at 300 Hz using a Tissuelyser II (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). From each homogenized organ, swab or nasal wash sample, 100 µl was extracted via the NucleoMag Vet kit (Macherey&Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions on a Biosprint 96 platform (Qiagen). Viral RNA was detected by RT-qPCR using bat H9N2-specific primers and probes38. Absolute quantification was done using a standard of known concentrations, corresponding to the RNA of the original virus used for inoculation. Quantification was established by the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System in combination with the 1-Step RT-ddPCR Advanced Kit for Probes (BioRad, Hercules, CA, US). Viral titers of ferret nasal washing samples were determined by TCID50 endpoint dilution assay on MDCKII cells.Human sera collected before and after seasonal influenza vaccinationThe observational study protocol IRB−16-00772 was reviewed and approved by the Mount Sinai Hospital Institutional Review Board. All study participants provided written informed consent before biospecimens, and data were collected. Permissions to store and share biospecimen were also obtained from all participants. All specimens were coded before processing and analysis. Whole blood was collected through venipuncture into serum separator tubes and sera were stored at −80 °C until analysis.SerologySerological analysis of blood samples from all animals at respective blood collection time points was performed by using a commercial IAV-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detecting NP-specific antibodies (ID-Vet, Montpellier, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The antibody titers were expressed as “% inhibition”, which was calculated as ((OD450 negative control – OD450 sample) / OD450 negative control) × 100.Neutralizing antibody titers were determined in a virus neutralization test (VNT). Briefly, MDCK cells seeded and grown in 96-well plates 24 h before infection. Serum samples were serially diluted in DMEM containing 1 µg mL−1 TPCK-treated trypsin and then mixed with 100 TCID50 mL-1 of either bat or chicken H9N2. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the serum-virus mixture was transferred onto MDCK cells and incubated for 72 h. Neutralization was evaluated by light microscopy for the absence of specific cytopathic effect (CPE), and the corresponding VNT titer was determined from the last serum dilution in which no CPE was observed.ELISAs with human sera against a recombinant version of the N2 NA of H9N2 virus A/bat/Egypt/381OP/2017 were performed as described in detail before39. Recombinant NA from human seasonal H3N2 strain A/Kansas/14/2017 was used to show positive reactivity, recombinant NA from the Wuhan spiny eel influenza virus40 (to which humans are naïve) was used as contrast to show negative reactivity. Recombinant proteins were expressed as described previously41. Sera collected from 15 study participants before and after receiving the 2022/23 seasonal influenza vaccination were used to determine reactivity to N2 from H9N2, N2 from seasonal H3N2 or to the Wuhan spiny eel influenza virus NA. Monoclonal antibody 1G0142 was used as positive control in all cases.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

No cases have been detected in New York livestock to date. Pasteurized milk and dairy products remain safe to consume as pasteurization kills harmful microbes and pathogens in milk, including the influenza virus, and there is also no concern regarding the consumption of properly cooked meat products.New York State Agriculture Commissioner Richard A. Ball said, “While we have not seen any cases of HPAI in livestock here in New York State, we’re monitoring the situation closely and are in communication with our farmers, veterinarians, and partners at USDA and in other states. The temporary import requirements we’ve put into place will help us to ensure that animals coming into New York are healthy and are not from affected premises, so that our animals here in New York can continue to remain safe. We encourage our farmers to continue practicing good biosecurity and to stay in touch with us and their veterinarians as the situation evolves.”New York State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said, “Preparing ahead of a potential health risk such as the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) is how the Department of Health protects, improves and promotes the health, productivity and wellbeing of all New Yorkers. While pasteurized milk and dairy products remain safe to consume because of stringent oversight protocols, the Department supports the temporary import requirements for dairy cattle brought into the State, to safeguard the health and safety of all New Yorkers.”The temporary import requirements for dairy cattle into New York State are:importation of dairy cattle from a premises with a confirmed case of HPAI or a premises under investigation as a suspect premises is prohibited;dairy cattle imported from affected states must be accompanied by a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI) issued within 10 days prior to entry into the state; andCVIs issued for dairy cattle from affected states must include the statement: “All animals identified on the Certificate of Veterinary (CVI) have been examined and do not originate from a premises with a confirmed detection of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or that is currently under investigation as a suspect premises.”These requirements will remain in place until further notice.HPAI was confirmed in dairy cattle in Texas in late March, and has since spread to Kansas, New Mexico, Michigan, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina, and South Dakota, and was also diagnosed in young goats in Minnesota on a premises with HPAI-infected poultry. A map of states that have detected HPAI in livestock can be found at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/livestock.While there have been no detections of HPAI in dairy cattle or goats in New York, the Department issued a statewide alert to veterinarians urging them to contact the Department if they see any signs or symptoms of illness in farm animals. Based on the confirmed cases so far, symptoms that veterinarians and farm owners should be on the lookout for include:Clinical signs seen in affected cattle:decreased milk production;acute sudden drop in production with some severely impacted cows experiencing thicker, concentrated milk;decrease in feed consumption; abnormal feces; and low-grade fever.Clinical signs seen in affected newborn goats:Unusual deathsIf any of these symptoms are noted, veterinarians are urged to call the Department at (518) 457-3502 for sampling guidance.In addition to monitoring for animal health, the Department is urging farm owners and farm workers to practice good biosecurity measures, which include the following:Restrict on-farm access to employees and essential personnel;Provide farm-dedicated work boots for all workers that are not worn anywhere else;Prevent cattle from drinking from sources that may be contaminated by waterfowl;Prevent wild birds from accessing feed sources and make sure all feed spills are cleaned up; andContact your veterinarian if you suspect your cattle are showing signs of HPAI.Additional biosecurity recommendations can be found here.

They said evolving developments with the virus, including a novel reassortant detected in three Asian countries and a spillover from wild birds to dairy cows in the United States, requires real-time monitoring.34 US herds now affectedThe H5N1 detection in Colorado raises the number of herds known to be affected to 34. So far, there are no details on where the Colorado herd is located and how it may have been exposed to the virus.Recent detections of H5N1 remnants in retail milk suggest that the virus in dairy cows may be more widespread than suggested by current animal testing.Global concerns about virus evolutionThe three global agencies raised concerns about genetic diversification of the H5N1 2.3.4.4b clade spreading in multiple world regions, as well as its ability to infect a broader range of species, with some species experiencing significant death rates, such as in sea mammals in South America.As the virus infects more species, including a goat and dairy cows in the United States, the virus has more opportunities to generate new genotypes, which could cause different clinical pictures.For example, the global experts said a novel H5N1 reassortant seen in poultry in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam over the past 2 years has now been detected in humans, one from Cambodia and the other from Vietnam. The virus contains surface proteins from an older H5N1 clade (2.3.2.1c) and internal genes from the more recent 2.3.4.4b H5N1 clade.The WHO, WOAH, and FAO said the overall risk to humans remains low, and for people who have exposure to infected animals or their environments, the risk is low to moderate.More Michigan poultry affected; new USDA updatesIn other H5N1 developments:Michigan reported another H5N1 outbreak in commercial poultry, this time at a turkey facility on Ottawa County that houses 104,000 birds, according to an update from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Ottawa County is among the Michigan countries in which H5N1 was detected in a dairy herd.USDA APHIS today announced a rule that would require electronic identification for certain cattle and bison moving between states. The agency said the move is designed to limit the impacts of animal disease outbreaks to certain regions and readily provide disease-free status in nonaffected regions. The rule, which requires visually and electronically readable ear tags, applies to all sexually intact cattle and bison 18 months of age or older, all dairy cattle, cattle and bison of any age used for rodeo or recreation events, and cattle or bison of any age used for shows or exhibitions.Though H5N1 hasn't been detected in US beef cattle, Colombia announced restrictions on the import of US beef and beef products, the first country to do so, Reuters reported yesterday.USDA APHIS posted new resources related to the H5N1 response, including a testing guide for labs conducting surveillance for influenza A in livestock and a document detailing requirements for H5N1 in livestock targeted to state animal health officials, veterinarians, and producers.

By Smriti Mallapaty Smriti Mallapaty View author publications You can also search for this author in PubMed Google Scholar Twitter Facebook Email Access through your institution Buy or subscribe A strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza has silently been spreading among US cattle for months, according to preliminary analysis of genomic data. The outbreak probably began when the virus jumped from an infected bird to a cow, around late last December or early January. This implies a protracted, undetected spread of the virus — suggesting that more cattle than currently reported, across the United States and even in neighbouring regions, could have been infected with avian influenza.

ElrickNeal RubinObserver & EccentricUSA TODAY Avian flu has spread to cows, milk — and experts worry human outbreak could be nextKristen Jordan Shamus Detroit Free PressShow Caption Hide Caption What we know about human bird flu cases and our foodCan I catch bird flu? How safe is it to eat eggs? What we know now about bird flu after it spreads to a second person in America.Avian influenza has raged through Michigan's bird population for two years, forcing commercial farmers and people with backyard coops to kill nearly 6.8 million infected chickens and turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese, and guinea fowl in about two dozen counties across the state — all with the hope of slowing the spread of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus.But so far, culling infected flocks hasn't been enough to curtail the assault from the virus, which was identified Wednesday in another Michigan commercial poultry facility, according to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. This time, it's in Gratiot County. An MDARD spokesperson told the Free Press that a state law, Public Act 466, prohibits the agency from releasing any details that would identify the commercial poultry facility where the outbreak occurred.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture all have said the risk to most Americans is low — even though the FDA reported Thursday that 1 in 5 samples of pasteurized milk sold in U.S. grocery stores contain what are believed to be neutralized H5N1 viral particles.What's most concerning to public health experts is that it isn't only birds that have been infected by the H5N1 virus. It's spreading in cows — eight U.S. states, including Michigan, have known bovine cases — and the virus has been detected in other mammals, too, such as seals and foxes, raccoons and skunks. In two cases in other states, people have gotten sick."To date, this strain of avian influenza has not been associated with significant disease in humans," said Dr. Kim Dodd, director of the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.The virus doesn't appear to spread easily from animals to people. That's because the strain circulating now in the U.S. does not bind easily enough to the receptors in the human upper respiratory tract to cause widespread infections in people, the CDC said in a report updated Friday."However, because of the potential for influenza viruses to rapidly evolve and the wide global prevalence of (highly pathogenic avian influenza A) H5N1 viruses in wild birds and poultry outbreaks and following the identification and spread among dairy cattle in the United States, additional sporadic human infections are anticipated."Continued comprehensive surveillance of these viruses in wild birds, poultry, mammals, and people worldwide, and frequent reassessments are critical to determine the public health risk, along with ongoing preparedness efforts."Both known human cases in the U.S., which occurred in Colorado in 2022 and in Texas earlier this year, were among farm workers who handled sick animals, said Dodd, whose lab is part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which she described as "the first line of defense in the case of an incursion of a high consequence, the animal disease or avian disease like H5N1 avian influenza."But still, she said, "identifying highly pathogenic avian influenza in cattle populations was unexpected. We are learning a lot as we go forward."The CDC said people who are exposed to birds, cows or any other animal infected with H5N1 virus are at higher risk of infection than the general public.Avian flu sparks new pandemic concernsWith the coronavirus pandemic so fresh in public consciousness, there's fear that this avian influenza virus could mutate in a way that would allow it to more readily spill over from animals to people, and then potentially from person to person — triggering another deadly viral scourge."When you start to see it in multiple birds, that's a concern. When it gets to multiple mammals, that's getting pretty worrisome. And now that it's in our broad-scale commercial system with milk, we've got increasing touchpoints with the human-animal interface and opportunities for zoonotic spillover," said Timothy Cernak, an assistant professor of chemistry and medicinal chemistry at the University of Michigan."I really want to stress that if avian flu breaks out in humans, it could be a lot worse than COVID. The fatality rates are much, much higher."Cernak pointed to the high bird flu mortality rate in people from Cambodia who were infected with a different subtype of the H5N1 virus than what's currently circulating in the U.S. Of 64 people who contracted the virus from 2003-23 in Cambodia, 41 died, according to the World Health Organization."That's not the strain that's here," Cernak said, but "you can imagine that is not something we want to deal with."Cernak's work centers on using artificial intelligence to develop a new antiviral drug that could be added to the arsenal of current antivirals to help stop a potential avian flu outbreak."The good news is, we know a lot about antivirals. We know a lot about how to make drugs and AI is really an awesome tool to accelerate that," he said.It's unclear exactly how big the outbreak among dairy cattle actually is — or whether there have been more human cases that have gone undetected, said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and consultant for several health organizations, including the CDC, in a post on her substack, "Your Local Epidemiologist," which she co-wrote with Dr. Kristen Panthagani."Symptomatic testing of animals and humans is voluntary, and asymptomatic testing is not happening (likely due to industry pressure), which means we are flying blind," she and Panthagani wrote. "It’s been reported that more workers have symptoms — such as fever, cough, and lethargy — but are unwilling to test. We could have more human cases. Among the tests conducted, it’s unclear how many have been done, how many were positive, and how many humans have been exposed."And with 1 in 5 samples of commercial milk testing positive for DNA fragments of the H5N1 virus, Jetelina and Panthagani say it's likely that the virus is far more widespread among cows than previously believed.How sick does the current strain of bird flu make people?The H5N1 strain that jumped from birds to cows and then to people is the subtype 2.3.4.4b, according to the CDC.Scientists refer to it as being "highly pathogenic." What that means, Dodd said, is that this particular variation of bird flu is especially deadly for chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks and other poultry raised for the production of meat or eggs for the food supply.It does not, however, mean the virus causes severe illness or death in other animals or humans.The two people with known cases of H5N1 bird flu in the U.S. had very mild illnesses, the CDC reported:A Texas farm worker who was exposed to sick cows in March had only one symptom: eye redness consistent with conjunctivitis, or pinkeye. The person was treated with an antiviral flu drug, was asked to isolate to prevent potentially spreading the virus, and recovered.In April 2022, a Colorado farm worker who culled poultry suspected of being infected with the H5N1 flu virus reported feeling fatigue for several days. The person tested positive for the virus and was isolated and also treated with a flu antiviral drug.“To date, this strain of avian influenza has not been associated with significant disease in humans," Dodd said.“In the case of the dairy cows, we know that there was one individual working closely with infected cattle who did develop a little bit of conjunctivitis. There's a lot of work ongoing to perform surveillance on individuals who work closely with some of the infected animals."And, to date, we don't have any indication that this is causing disease in people. It’s a really important thing to keep in mind: This is low risk for the human population."The bird flu's leap to mammalsIn May 2022, H5N1 was first detected in red foxes in Michigan, Minnesota, Iowa, New York, Alaska and Wisconsin. It's possible they ate the carcasses of birds that had died from avian influenza, Dodd said, and got infected.Bobcats in Wisconsin, opossums in Iowa and bottle-nosed dolphins in Florida also were sickened by bird flu in 2022, according to the USDA.Then came raccoons in Washington and skunks in Idaho. Harbor seals and gray seals in Maine got sick, as did grizzly and Kodiak bears, polar bears and black bears in Alaska.It killed elephant seals in Argentina, and infected Antarctic penguins.But it wasn't until late 2023 when the H5N1 virus was likely transmitted for the first time from a bird to a cow, according to Dr. Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, who worked with others this month to analyze the genetic sequences of the H5N1 virus.He wrote on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that there is a "strong possibility that this has been circulating in cattle for months under our noses, even before the first inkling there might be something new in February. This reveals massive gaps in our pathogen surveillance and detection systems."Though Worobey's work suggests bird flu was spreading in cows in late 2023, the first known dairy cattle H5N1 infections weren't reported by the USDA until March 25, when the agency said it had identified cases in Texas and Kansas.A few days later, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development announced that asymptomatic cows from Texas had brought the bird flu to a Montcalm County farm."Further testing and investigation by state and federal officials have revealed the source of infection," MDARD said in a news release at the time. "The farm recently received cattle from an affected premises in Texas before that herd showed any sign of disease. When the cattle were moved from Texas to Michigan, the cattle were not symptomatic and did not appear ill."The cows that were sick had decreased lactation and low appetite. Farmers were instructed to isolate the cows, minimize their exposure to visitors and to prevent them from contact with other animals and wildlife.But despite the precautions, the virus continued to spread. MDARD reported that H5N1 now has infected dairy cattle from Ionia, Isabella, and Ottawa counties, too, along with seven other states."This virus does not stop at county or state lines, which is why we must all be on high alert," said MDARD Director Tim Boring, in a statement. "This news is unfortunate and upsetting for our poultry and dairy farming families and communities."And, Dodd said, some barn cats that drank raw milk from sick cows also were infected with bird flu.Where in Michigan has the bird flu been found in poultry?The H5N1 virus was first identified in Michigan in February 2022 in Kalamazoo County, according to the CDC.Even though federal law requires the culling of the entire flock if even one bird is identified as having avian influenza, by the end of 2022, the virus had spread to domestic birds in more than a dozen Michigan counties: Eaton, Lapeer, Macomb, Muskegon, Oakland, Branch, Wexford, Saginaw, Menominee, Livingston, Genesee, Tuscola, Ingham and Sanilac.Since then, outbreaks of the H5N1 virus also have been identified in poultry farms, turkey meat farms and commercial table egg laying facilities across Michigan, including in Bay, Cass, Gratiot, Ionia, Montmorency, Livingston, Newaygo, Ottawa, and Washtenaw counties.Is H5N1 flu in the U.S. milk supply?Yes, but it's not likely to make you sick if you drink pasteurized milk, the FDA says.Roughly 99% of the nation's milk comes from farms that adhere to the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, according to the FDA. That ordinance includes safety measures that require milk from sick cows to either be diverted or destroyed; it isn't used in the commercial milk supply. Additionally, milk must undergo pasteurization, which uses heat to deactivate viruses and harmful bacteria.Still, the FDA announced earlier this week that it detected fragments of the H5N1 virus in the commercial pasteurized milk supply, and pledged to continue investigating.Authorities used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing, which can detect viral DNA particles, but does not identify whether those bits of DNA are capable of replicating or causing disease."Because qPCR findings do not represent actual virus that may be a risk to consumers, the FDA is further assessing any positive findings," the agency said in a statement issued Tuesday. "To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe."Based on available information, pasteurization is likely to inactivate the virus, however the process is not expected to remove the presence of viral particles. Therefore, some of the samples collected have indicated the presence of (highly pathogenic avian influenza) HPAI."Dr. Lea Monday, an infectious diseases physician at the Detroit Medical Center, said she and her children continue to drink pasteurized milk and and eat cheese products made with pasteurized milk."The virus remnants that were found in the pasteurized milk are just pieces of H5N1 DNA," Monday said. "It's broken-down virus remnants, but not actual live virus. ... People don't have to worry about getting bird flu through cow's milk if they're drinking it, and it's pasteurized."Health officials warn: Don't drink raw milk"It's really important for people to realize that although there's no documented evidence of someone getting sick with H5N1 from drinking raw milk, if it hasn't been pasteurized, it could have viral particles that could potentially be infectious," Monday said."And there are other things that could be passed to you through raw milk like listeria and brucella that cause very dangerous infections that have extremely high rates of mortality. Listeria causes stillbirth and miscarriage and death. So that's another reason we should not be consuming raw, unpasteurized dairy products."Is it safe to eat beef, eggs and poultry?The USDA says the nation's meat and supply is safe. Animals are inspected prior to slaughter to ensure sick livestock do not enter the food supply. The FDA says eggs sold in the retail market also are likely to be safe to eat: "The likelihood that eggs from infected poultry are found in the retail market is low and proper storage and preparation further reduce the risk."Dodd now more than ever, it's important to thoroughly cook eggs, poultry and beef to kill off any bacteria or viruses in chicken, duck, goose, turkey or beef."At this point, there is no indication of detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza in muscle or meat," she said. "And again, I say that is to this point. I don't have reason to expect that is going to change."How worried should I be about H5N1 becoming more infectious?"I think the average American should not be overly concerned about their personal risk at this moment," said Aubree Gordon, a professor or epidemiology and global public health at the University of Michigan. She also is director of the Michigan Center for Infectious Disease Threats and Pandemic Preparedness.However, she said, there ought to be scrutiny about whether U.S. public health agencies are doing enough to identify the true scope of avian influenza's spread."There were a lot of lessons that we certainly should have learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and some of the prior pandemics," Gordon said, "especially in making sure there's enough surveillance going on."The dairy industry has a lot of power. It has a lot of money. I do think it's really critical at this moment that the situation is extremely carefully monitored and that there's a lot of surveillance so that we know what's happening."Among her biggest concerns is that the H5N1 virus will soon begin to infect pigs."Pigs can be a bit of a mixing vessel for flu," Gordon said. "They have some of the same receptors that humans have and a virus that transmits well amongst pigs may transmit well amongst humans."She suggested the USDA should carefully monitor swine for avian influenza infections and public health authorities ought to consider PCR testing of people who have flu-like symptoms."There’s been a shift toward rapid testing for flu, and I’m concerned about that with H5N1 emerging," Gordon said. Rapid tests can't differentiate which strain of the flu a person might be carrying, whereas a PCR test sample could be used to identify bird flu."A little more testing — testing with a PCR — might be merited, particularly in areas where there are a lot of cows."What is being done to stop the spread of avian influenza?The USDA announced tighter restrictions Wednesday on dairy cattle to prevent the spread of H5N1.Among the new rules, which take effect Monday, cows must first test negative for influenza A viruses and meet USDA conditions for interstate travel before they can be transported over state lines. If cows test positive for the virus, farmers must provide information to help authorities trace their movement from state to state.In addition, labs and veterinarians will be required to report positive influenza A tests in livestock. The USDA also has a list of biosecurity recommendations for livestock and poultry.To report sick or dead domestic birds, call the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development at 800-292-3939.Contact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

DOUGLAS MAGNO/AFP via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption DOUGLAS MAGNO/AFP via Getty Images Bird flu is spreading through U.S. dairy cattle. Scientists say the risk to people is minimal, but open questions remain, including how widespread the outbreak is and how the virus is spreading. DOUGLAS MAGNO/AFP via Getty Images On Friday, Colorado became the latest state to detect the bird flu virus spreading in dairy cattle. It follows revelations earlier in the week that viral fragments are turning up in retail milk. Still, scientists don't view this as an immediate threat to human health. Genetic material is not the same as infectious virus and pasteurization is expected to inactivate the virus in milk, but the findings speak to the broader uncertainty about the extent of the spread. "There's so many critical things that we still need to know to get a better perspective on how bad this is, or maybe it's not so bad," says Dr. Rick Bright, a virologist and the former head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Sponsor Message Federal health agencies started sharing more details publicly this week, but Bright says there's still not enough transparency. "It's the void that just leaves everyone nervous," he says Other scientists say the reality is that there are still many unresolved questions about this outbreak, given how novel it is. "There's a couple big unknowns at this point," says Louise Moncla, a virologist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. Here's what scientists who are tracking the virus still want to know: How widespread is the virus in dairy cattle? That's still far from clear. While the official tally shows it's been detected in nine states and just over 30 herds, the actual number could be much larger. First of all, there hasn't been widespread testing in cattle. The fact that viral material is now being found in retail milk suggests "this virus is probably spread around quite a bit," says Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Tennessee. On Thursday, the FDA said that preliminary results from nationwide samples of retail milk indicate about one in five samples are positive for viral traces. A survey of retail milk in the Midwest found 58 out of 150 samples were positive, according to Andrew Bowman at the Ohio State University. Sponsor Message Webby discovered this himself when he went to the store to grab a carton of milk, which he intended to use as a negative control in his work on H5N1. To his surprise, even that ended up being positive (unfazed, he kept the milk). Currently the virus has only been detected in a tiny fraction of dairy herds in the U.S., but it's hard to know the significance of that finding when you don't also have details on the overall number of cattle tested, says Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Centers for Health Security. "Those are kind of basic questions that would really help get us more ground truth quickly," he says. The USDA has just taken some new steps that could offer a better picture of the outbreak. There will be mandatory reporting of positive tests in cattle and a requirement that dairy cattle test negative for the virus before they move across state lines. Potentially complicating the picture: Some unknown number of cattle could be shedding the virus without showing obvious symptoms. Federal health officials have confirmed this. "We don't know how many animals have this," says Alexis Thompson, a veterinarian at Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory. "There has been very little sampling done. We don't know how many [sick] animals we have. We don't know how many asymptomatic animals we have. That testing has not been done." Because milk from sick cows is supposed to be discarded, this could help explain how remnants of the virus entered the milk supply. If it turns out there are lots of animals shedding the virus and not symptomatic, the outbreak could be "substantially larger" than we realize, says Inglesby. "To get to the bottom of that, we would need to do surveillance testing in places that don't already have clear outbreaks." Sponsor Message Does the milk testing positive on retail shelves contain infectious virus? So far, it doesn't appear that way, but scientists who are studying this possibility acknowledge it's too soon to say that with absolute certainty. The PCR testing that has found evidence of viral fragments in the milk on grocery store shelves doesn't actually tell you whether or not it's "live" virus, meaning whether it's capable of replicating. This form of testing is extraordinarily sensitive and detects small pieces of genetic material, says Lee-Ann Jaykus, a food microbiologist at North Carolina State University. "There's evidence that that milk at one point in time may have had virus associated with it, but there is no evidence that that virus would be infectious, at least with the information we currently have," she says. Pasteurizing milk can knock out bacteria and viruses; however, it doesn't erase every trace of those germs. Federal health officials have stressed that avian influenza doesn't stand up well to the high temperatures and past research on pasteurization indicates "it's very likely to effectively inactivate heat-sensitive viruses like H5N1 in milk from cows." "We've seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe," said Don Prater from the Food and Drug Administration. Research on pasteurization in eggs, which happens at a lower temperature than milk, shows that the process inactivates the bird flu virus. Jaykus and other scientists agree that finding viral material doesn't necessarily suggest an immediate threat to human health. "It's really important to sort of not get out of control about fear of consuming milk," says Jaykus. There is an important caveat though: There has been no direct research on how pasteurizing cow milk affects bird flu virus. Those studies are taking place right now. Early experiments on a small number of samples suggest there is no viable virus in these positive samples, said Jeanne Marrazzo, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Sponsor Message Webby, who looked at samples of milk sent by Bowman, says they tried to grow the virus in cultured cells and embryonated chicken eggs — two places where flu loves to grow — and found that it did not reproduce. "It's pretty good evidence," he says, "We could never say there's none, but we could say if it's there, it's at a very, very, very low level." Jaykus says even if the milk did happen to have a small amount of infectious virus, "there just isn't evidence that that is a transmission route for flu." Rick Bright, on the other hand, has more concerns about the milk. "It's a small inconvenience for me not to drink milk until we have more data," he says, "It doesn't mean that I think everyone should stop drinking milk. It's a personal risk assessment." He says the key question is how much virus is in the milk, and whether that changes if more cows get sick and more virus enters the milk supply. "The higher the viral load in the milk, the more difficult it is for pasteurization to work completely," he says. "If they show at this point there's no viable virus in the milk, that's a point in time. And what's going to be really critical is that the FDA continues to monitor this." How exactly is the virus spreading? For weeks, the leading theory has been that the primary route of spread is through the milk. This is where high concentrations of the virus are being found. This general idea was affirmed again this week by Mike Watson with the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, who said the evidence still points to some form of "mechanical transmission." Virus could be spread on "milking equipment," by "individuals moving from facility to facility," and via rodents that come in contact with milk and then move around, he said. Sponsor Message Federal health officials and scientists believe the virus has moved with lactating cattle from one herd to another. But how it's getting from one cow to another on a given farm "is a key missing piece of knowledge," says Webby. Genetic sequencing indicates that there was likely a single introduction from birds into cattle, which then resulted in further spread among cattle, says Moncla, who has been analyzing the genomic data. "A lot of these cattle sequences are quite similar to each other, suggesting that there's almost certainly some degree of cattle-to-cattle transmission going on," she says. Moncla says it's hard to say exactly how long the virus has been spreading through dairy cattle, although some scientists have suggested it may have been circulating for many months, even earlier than February. The USDA has also noted another concerning development — that there have been some instances of the virus moving from domesticated poultry to cattle. "The degree of transmission, combined with the fact that we're likely missing cases in cattle, leads to a bit of concern," says Moncla. What is the risk to humans as the virus keeps spreading? First the reassuring news: Even with all these cows being infected, there has only been one documented human infection during the current outbreak in dairy cattle. That person, a dairy worker in Texas, had conjunctivitis. This week, federal health officials reiterated that the overall risk to the general public remains low, in part because "we have not observed changes to the virus's genetic makeup that would suggest an enhanced ability to spread to humans or among humans," said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the CDC. So far, states have tested 23 people for avian flu and have monitored 44 people who were considered exposed and at risk for infection, he said. Generally, cases of bird flu are rare in humans and it takes a big dose of virus — for example through direct contact while slaughtering poultry — to get infected. Since 2022, there have been 26 human cases of H5N1 virus infection reported worldwide. Sponsor Message Webby says it is possible that cows don't put that much "pressure on the virus to change," which could be one reason scientists haven't seen alarming mutations in the samples collected. "I don't think the needle has moved at all" in terms of human risk, he says. Of course, the perennial fear is that the virus could mutate while in cows, or an intermediary animal, and then find its way into humans. Scientists have documented some mutations in bird flu when it has spread in other mammals. But previous research has shown there needs to be a host of changes — most of all, the virus would have to evolve a way to bind to receptors in the upper airway of humans — to become a pandemic threat. When it comes to cattle, the CDC's Sonja Olsen says they still aren't sure if it's the exposure to raw milk on the farms that's the primary risk to humans. "We don't know if it's [surface] transmission. We don't know if there's aerosolization of the milk." Dr. Bright says the CDC should be conducting antibody studies on dairy workers to see if human cases have escaped detection, rather than waiting for cases to show up in the emergency room. "I am going to keep my radar up," he says. "If this were to get out of hand, we have to be prepared to respond really quickly. And I'm not quite sure we're fully ready to respond if we needed to." cattle dairy cows influenza bird flu milk avian flu Facebook Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Instagram Press Public Editor Corrections Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity NPR Network Accessibility Ethics Finances Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsorFears growing over avian influenza H5N1 jumping to humans | WATTPoultry.comMarket InformationTop Poultry CompaniesExpert InsightsBlogsRegionsMagazinesSign InPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureTopicsPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureRegionsMarket InformationTop Poultry CompaniesTop Feed CompaniesAgriculture ProductsDirectory of SuppliersEvent CalendarExpert InsightsWebinarsBrand InsightsPodcastsWhite PapersWATT Poultry ChatTop Companies Data DownloadsMagazinesMoreSign InSubscribeAdvertiseAbout UsContact UsFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconSign InFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureMarket InformationTop Poultry CompaniesExpert InsightsBlogsRegionsMagazinesSubscribeAdvertiseBlogsPoultry Around the WorldFears growing over avian influenza H5N1 jumping to humansWHO has voiced its concerns over the ability of H5N1 to infect more species as scientists forecast that the next pandemic will be caused by an influenza virus.Mark ClementsApril 22, 2024felipecaparros | BigstockDid COVID-19 come from bats or from a laboratory spillover? I cannot remember if a definitive conclusion was ever reached, but I certainly do remember the ever-rising death tolls during the pandemic, the disruption, and changes to everyday behavior. I am also very aware of how quickly we forget, and how lessons learned are so very quicky unlearned. I also remember, early on in the pandemic, of being accused of being overly pessimistic as friends dismissed the pandemic after only a few weeks as being over and headed out to enjoy mingling in public places. Little did they realize that the COVID restrictions were only just starting or the problems that lay ahead.The refusal to believe what experts say makes the latest warnings from the World Health Organization (WHO) all the more worrying. Concern has grown sufficiently around avian influenza (AI) H5N1 that WHO has made its concerns public and warned that we are not prepared for the challenges that may lay ahead. WHO Chief Scientific Officer Jeremy Farrar has said that the scientific community’s great concern is that given that H5N1 is increasingly infecting mammals it is evolving and developing the ability to infect humans. To date, there has been no human-to human transmission, but where H5N1 has infected humans, the mortality rate has been extremely high.Growing list of mammals infectedAt the start of April, there were official reports of a person in the U.S. having contracted the virus after exposure to dairy cattle. While reports of marine mammals washing up on South American beaches may be distressing, humans tend to have very little contact with these animals. The situation with dairy cattle is very different, and while it was known that pigs could be infected by the virus, and obviously poultry, it had not previously been detected in cattle. We should all know by now that the more species that a virus infects, the greater the chances that it will be able to infect humans. When it infects farm animals, as opposed to wild animals, human and animal interaction is, obviously, greater.Little surprise, perhaps, that Farrar, with regard to virus emerging in dairy cows, has urged further close monitoring and investigation by U.S. public health officials, warning that the virus could evolve to transmitting in different ways.He raised the questions of whether milking structures create aerosols, and the role of the environment in which cows are kept. He also questioned whether the transport of is spreading the virus. He added that the appearance H5N1 was of huge concern and that should human-to-human transmission occur, the world must be in a position to immediately respond with equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Influenza will cause the next pandemicSeparate to the WHO warning, a yet-to-be-published international survey will reveal that 57% of senior disease experts believe a strain of the influenza virus will be the cause of the next pandemic.The author of the report detailing the survey’s findings points out that influenza appears each winter and that the outbreaks could be described as little pandemics. They are, more or less, controlled due to the various strains not being virulent enough to result in a large-scale pandemic – but this may not necessarily last forever.Forewarned should be forearmedWhile we have all been forgetting about wearing face masks in public or using alcohol gel, WHO has been updating the language it uses to describe airborne pathogens in a bid to increase international cooperation in the event of a new pandemic. Farrar has warned that given the potential H5N1 public health risk, vaccine development is not where it needs to be. Even if it were, wards of dying patients, lockdowns and logistical nightmares simply don’t bear thinking about.RecommendedHatchersGiordano HatchCargoSystem ProLifeLatest NewsNational Turkey Federation offering 'Thanksgiving 101' tips and recipesRelated StoriesPoultry Around the WorldWell-preserved Roman egg found in U.K., but what's inside?Poultry Around the WorldTurning bacteria on themselves - more poultry gut controlPoultry Around the WorldWill consumers respond to more poultry meat, egg labels?Poultry Around the WorldNot stewarding nature?

"To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe," the FDA said in a statement. The announcement comes nearly a month after an avian influenza virus that has sickened millions of wild and commercial birds in recent years was detected in dairy cows in at least eight states. The Agriculture Department says 33 herds have been affected to date. Sponsor Message Shots - Health News More states are finding bird flu in cattle. This is what scientists are watching for FDA officials didn't indicate how many samples they tested or where they were obtained. The agency has been evaluating milk during processing and from grocery stores, officials said. Results of additional tests are expected in "the next few days to weeks." The PCR lab test the FDA used would have detected viral genetic material even after live virus was killed by pasteurization, or heat treatment, said Lee-Ann Jaykus, an emeritus food microbiologist and virologist at North Carolina State University. "There is no evidence to date that this is infectious virus and the FDA is following up on that," Jaykus said. Shots - Health News What to know about the risks of the bird flu outbreak Officials with the FDA and the USDA had previously said milk from affected cattle did not enter the commercial supply. Milk from sick animals is supposed to be diverted and destroyed. Federal regulations require milk that enters interstate commerce to be pasteurized. Because the detection of the bird flu virus known as Type A H5N1 in dairy cattle is new and the situation is evolving, no studies on the effects of pasteurization on the virus have been completed, FDA officials said. But past research shows that pasteurization is "very likely" to inactivate heat-sensitive viruses like H5N1, the agency added. Sponsor Message Matt Herrick, a spokesman for the International Dairy Foods Association, said that time and temperature regulations for pasteurization ensure that the commercial U.S. milk supply is safe. Remnants of the virus "have zero impact on human health," he wrote in an email. National A bird flu outbreak at the largest U.S. chicken egg producer could affect egg prices Scientists confirmed the H5N1 virus in dairy cows in March after weeks of reports that cows in Texas were suffering from a mysterious malady. The cows were lethargic and saw a dramatic reduction in milk production. Although the H5N1 virus is lethal to commercial poultry, most infected cattle seem to recover within two weeks, experts said. To date, two people in U.S. have been infected with bird flu. A Texas dairy worker who was in close contact with an infected cow recently developed a mild eye infection and has recovered. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program caught it while killing infected birds at a Colorado poultry farm. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered.

(Photo by Zoe Askew on Unsplash)OTTAWA — The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is encouraging veterinarians to keep an eye out for signs of avian influenza in dairy cattle following recent discoveries of cases of the disease in U.S. cow herds. Avian influenza has not been discovered in dairy cattle or other livestock in Canada. But since March, U.S. officials have confirmed cases of the illness in dairy cow herds in nine states. Officials suspect that wild birds may have spread the virus to the cattle, though it appears cattle experience a milder form of the illness than birds. No cows have died from the virus, and affected cattle typically recover with a couple of weeks. Avian influenza has not had any impact on the trade of cattle or the products. The virus does not pose a food safety concern and the CFIA says the risk of transmission to humans remains low. The CFIA is asking veterinarians and cattle producers to watch for signs of illness, such as a sudden decrease in milk production or changes in milk thickness.

Innovators & Disruptors Economy 4.0 MoneyWatch Managing Your Money Your Taxes Retirement Watch CBS News MoneyWatch Bird flu outbreak is driving up egg prices — again By Khristopher J. Brooks Edited By Alain Sherter April 24, 2024 / 4:29 PM EDT / CBS News Bird flu impact on consumers How bird flu outbreaks impacts consumers 01:50 A multi-state outbreak of avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is leading to a jump in the price of eggs around the U.S. — an unhappy reminder for consumers that a range of unforeseen developments can trigger inflation. As of April 24, a dozen large grade A eggs cost an average of $2.99, up nearly 16% from $2.52 in January, according to federal labor data. The price increase comes as nearly 9 million chickens across Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Texas have been discovered to be infected with bird flu in recent weeks, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That is crimping egg supplies, leading to higher prices. Eggs are a staple grocery item in U.S. households, used for making everything from omelettes at breakfast to fresh pasta and binding a meatloaf for dinner. Egg consumption also has risen in part because more families are eating them as their main protein substitute, said David Anderson, a food economist at Texas A&M University. Rising prices affect millions of consumers, even those who opt for liquid egg yolks in the carton as opposed to solid shells. During a bird flu outbreak, farmers report the incident to the USDA and officials from the agency visit the farm to slaughter the entire flock, Andrew Stevens, an agricultural economist at the University of Wisconsin, told CBS MoneyWatch. For the chicken farmer, that means "hundreds of thousands of them that were laying multiple eggs are now not," Stevens said. "You're taking out all the baseline egg production for up to three months at a time," Stevens said. "You're paying for that lag time it takes to shore up and build back up production." Maryland limits dairy cattle movement amid bird flu outbreak 01:53 Egg costs also soared after the country in 2022 saw the deadliest outbreak of avian flu in U.S. history, driving up the average price for a dozen large grade A eggs to $4.25 and leading to shortages in some regions. The current strain of bird flu, which scientists are calling highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), originated in Michigan in 2022. The strain led the nation's largest producer of fresh eggs, Cal-Maine Foods, to slaughter 1.6 million hens after finding cases at its plant in Texas. In 2014-15, the company was forced to kill more than 50 million chickens and turkeys because of a bird flu outbreak, leading to an estimated $3.3 billion in economic losses, according to the USDA. "Hopefully this year is not as bad as 2022 and 2015, but we have lost some birds," Anderson said. "But the egg-laying chickens we have in production are producing more eggs."Cases of HPAI are arising just as farmers across the U.S. work to more hens to keep up with Americans' growing demand for eggs, Anderson said. Typically, there are two major spikes in egg demand every year — once just before Easter and again during the year-end holidays, when everyone is baking for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The nation had 313 million egg-laying hens as of April, down from 316 million during the same period last year, Anderson noted.It will take time to boost egg supplies as farmers hatch and raise new hens, so production is unlikely to return to normal for at least three months, Stevens said. Doctor on bird flu: "So far, no real risk to the human population" 03:32 Bird flu is carried by free-flying waterfowl, such as ducks, geese and shorebirds, and infects chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese and guinea fowl. Fortunately, the public health risk related to bird flu remains low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Still, cooking all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 ˚F is advised as a general food safety rule.Bird flu is also infecting livestock. A young goat in western Minnesota tested positive for the disease in March, marking the first case of its kind in the U.S. Milk from dairy cows in Texas and Kansas also have recently tested positive for bird flu.

Smith Collection/Gado/Getty ImagesPublic health officials are continuing to monitor as an outbreak of avian flu, also known as bird flu, continues to spread across the country.The strain, known as H5N1, has sickened several mammals this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).Several dairy cows have been infected, resulting in milk samples showing inactive remnants of the virus, and one human case has been confirmed.MORE: Bird flu outbreak poses no risk to safety of America’s food supply, say expertsHealth officials say the food supply is safe and the risk to the general public is currently low.Here's the latest to know on the outbreak.What is bird flu?Avian influenza, or bird flu, is an infectious viral disease that primarily spreads among birds and is caused by infection with Influenza A viruses.These viruses typically spread among wild aquatic birds but can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species, according to the CDC.Although bird flu viruses normally don't infect humans, there have been rare cases of infection. To confirm infection, laboratory testing is required.A colorized transmission electron micrograph depicts Avian influenza A H5N1 viruses (seen in gold) grown in MDCK cells (seen in green).Smith Collection/Gado/Getty ImagesSigns and symptoms of infection in humans often include sore throat, cough, fever, runny or stuffy nose, headache, muscle or body aches, fatigue and shortness of breath. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and seizures.Infections can range from no symptoms or mild illness, such as flu-like symptoms, to more severe illness, such as pneumonia that could require hospitalizations, the CDC says.How did the outbreak begin?In early March, the USDA announced a bird flu strain that had sickened millions of birds across the U.S was identified in several mammals this year.At the time, three states had reported cases of bird flu in mammals in 2024, including striped skunks found in Washington state, a mountain lion in Montana and a raccoon in Kentucky.MORE: CDC closely monitoring cases of bird flu, taking animal to human case seriously: CDC directorA few weeks later, federal and state public health officials said they were investigating an illness among primarily older dairy cows in Kansas, New Mexico and Texas and causing symptoms including decreased lactation and low appetite.The USDA said in a statement at the time that "there is no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health."First human case of bird fluEarlier this month, the CDC said a human case of bird flu was identified in Texas and linked to cattle. The infected individual worked directly with sick cattle and reported eye redness as their only symptom.This is the second human case of H5N1 ever reported in the U.S. but the first linked to cattle.However, there have been no reports and no evidence to indicate there is person-to-person transmission, a CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen told ABC News at the time.The CDC said it considers the health risk assessment to the general public to be low.Inactive fragments found in milk samplesEarlier this week, reports emerged of bird flu fragments found in samples of pasteurized milk. However, the fragments are inactive remnants of the virus and cannot cause infection as the commercial milk supply undergoes pasteurization.Federal agencies maintain the U.S. commercial milk supply remains safe because milk is pasteurized and dairy farmers are required to dispose of any milk from sick cows, so it does not enter the supply.In this undated stock photo, cows are seen feeding on hay inside a farm.STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images"To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe," the FDA said in an update.The FDA said in its update that fragments of the virus are likely inactivated by the pasteurization process."The discovery of bird flu virus fragments in commercial milk is significant, not because it poses a direct threat to public health, but because it indicates a broader exposure among dairy cattle than we previously understood," said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor. "This calls for an expanded surveillance of both the virus's presence and its potential impact on food safety."He added, "It's crucial to continue rigorous testing to determine if any live virus can survive the process. Understanding the dynamics of this virus in dairy products will help us refine our risk assessments and ensure public health safety."The FDA said it is collaborating closely with the CDC's food safety group surveillance team to monitor emergency department data and flu testing data for any unusual trends in flu-like illness, flu or conjunctivitis. There is currently no data showing any unusual trends or activity.ABC News Sony Salzman contributed to this report.Related TopicsBird FluPopular ReadsTrump's plan for education in his second termNov 11, 4:56 PMSotomayor has no plans to resign: SourcesNov 10, 4:27 PMArrest in fatal shooting at Tuskegee UniversityNov 10, 6:35 PMMissing American tourist in Hungary killed: PoliceNov 9, 1:36 PM538's final forecasts for the 2024 electionNov 5, 7:49 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC NewsInfluenza is considered the biggest pandemic threat - Earth.comSubscribenewsvideosimagesearthpediatake actionearthsnapshopSubscribe04-23-2024Influenza is considered the biggest pandemic threatByRodielon PutolEarth.com staff writerInfluenza is viewed by infectious disease specialists as the pathogen with the highest pandemic potential, according to findings unveiled at a major global congress in Barcelona.A survey conducted by the VACCELERATE Consortium revealed that 57% of the experts ranked influenza at the top of the list of pandemic threats. This highlights the persistent threat of influenza to global health.Exploring the top pandemic threatsThe survey reached out to a broad spectrum of experts from 57 countries, garnering 187 responses that provide a snapshot of the global perspective on infectious threats. Influenza emerged as the primary pandemic concern due to its ability to mutate and spread widely each season. Disease X – an undefined pathogen representing emerging diseases – and SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the recent COVID-19 pandemic, followed closely.In their study, the experts evaluated a variety of pathogens, including those listed in the World Health Organization’s R&D Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics. The blueprint serves as a proactive measure to identify and prioritize research on diseases that pose significant public health risks due to their infectivity, transmissibility, and potential for severe impact.Prioritizing pathogens with pandemic potentialBesides influenza, the survey highlighted other critical threats. Disease X, a placeholder for potential future pathogens, was ranked highest by 21% of respondents, underscoring the constant vigilance needed against unknown viruses.Respondents also noted the significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its predecessor, SARS-CoV, which caused the 2002-03 outbreak.A smaller fraction of experts recognized lesser-known but equally concerning pathogens like the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and the Ebola virus, noting their deadly outbreaks.Conversely, experts ranked viruses such as Hantavirus, Lassa virus, Nipah virus, henipavirus, and Rift Valley fever virus lower in terms of immediate pandemic potential, suggesting they pose a lesser immediate threat, yet emphasizing the ongoing need for monitoring and research.Influenza’s pandemic threatDr. Jon Salmanton-García commented on the findings: “Each winter we have an influenza season. One could say that this means that every winter there are little pandemics. They are more or less controlled because the different strains are not virulent enough.” “Yet, every season the strains involved change, that is the reason why we can get influenza several times in life and vaccines change year to year. In case a new strain becomes more virulent, this control could be lost.”Insights from the COVID-19 pandemicThe recent experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly shifted the landscape of pandemic preparedness.Dr. Salmanton-García explained that the global response to COVID-19 has enhanced our approach to managing respiratory viruses, improving practices in social distancing, hand hygiene, mask usage, and vaccination strategies.“In the COVID-19 pandemic, we have learned many things on how to approach a respiratory virus pandemic. This includes social distancing, hand cleaning, face masks, a renewed focus on vaccination, and trust in healthcare institutions. In parallel, institutions have also learned a lot. Preparedness and surveillance are now, vitally, better-funded,” said Dr. Salmanton-García.Understanding pandemic threatsThe study paints a clear picture of the infectious disease landscape, identifying influenza, Disease X, and coronaviruses among the top concerns for global health security. The findings emphasize the need for continued vigilance, research, and preparation to mitigate the impact of potential future pandemics.More about pandemic threatsPandemic threats are often caused by novel viruses or bacteria to which the general population has little to no immunity. The severity and spread of these diseases can be influenced by various factors, including the pathogen’s transmissibility, virulence, and the availability of effective treatments or vaccines.Modern global connectivity through travel and trade, along with urbanization and environmental changes, can exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases, making pandemics more likely. The impact of a pandemic can be profound, not only causing widespread health crises but also affecting economies, social structures, and daily life. Governments and international organizations work to monitor and manage these risks through surveillance, preparedness plans, and public health interventions aimed at controlling the spread of diseases and minimizing their impact on society. Effective response strategies often include measures such as vaccination campaigns, travel restrictions, quarantine, and public education about hygiene practices.The research will be presented at the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases‘ (ESCMID) Global Congress in Barcelona later this month.—–Like what you read?

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The discovery of fragments of avian flu virus in milk sold in U.S. stores, including in about 20% of samples in initial testing across the country, suggests that the H5N1 virus may be more widespread in dairy cattle than previously realized. The Food and Drug Administration, which announced the early results from its nationally representative sampling on April 25, 2024, was quick to stress that it believes the commercial milk supply is safe. The FDA said initial tests did not detect any live, infectious virus. However, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus can make cows sick, and the flu virus’s presence in herds in several states and new federal restrictions on the movement of dairy cows between states are putting economic pressure on farmers. Five experts in infectious diseases in cattle from the University of California, Davis – Noelia Silva del Rio, Terry Lehenbauer, Richard Pereira, Robert Moeller and Todd Cornish – explain what the test results mean, how bird flu can spread to cattle and the impact on the industry. What are viral fragments of avian flu, and can they pose risks to people? It’s crucial to understand that the presence of viral fragments of H5N1 doesn’t indicate the presence of intact virus particles that could cause disease. The commercial milk supply maintains safety through two critical measures: First, milk sourced from sick animals is promptly diverted or disposed of, ensuring it does not enter the food chain. Second, all milk at grocery stores is heat treated to reduce pathogen load to safe levels, mainly by pasteurization. Pasteurization has been shown to effectively inactivate H5N1 in eggs, and that process occurs at a lower temperature than is used for milk. The viral fragments were detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing, which is known for its exceptional sensitivity in detecting even trace amounts of viral genetic material. These fragments are only evidence that the virus was present in the milk. They aren’t evidence that the virus is biologically active. To evaluate whether the presence of the viral fragments corresponds to a virus with the capacity to replicate and cause disease, a different testing approach is necessary. Tests such as embryonated egg viability studies allow scientists to assess the virus’s ability to replicate by injecting a sample into an embryonated chicken egg. That type of testing is underway. On April 24, 2024, the FDA said it had found no reason to change its assessment that the U.S. milk supply is safe. The agency does strongly advise against consuming raw milk and products derived from it because of its inherent risks of contamination with harmful pathogens, including avian flu viruses. How does an avian flu virus get into cow’s milk? Currently, cows confirmed to have H5N1 have different symptoms than the typical flu-like symptoms observed in birds. Abnormal milk and mastitis, an inflammatory response to infection, are common. While there is speculation that other bodily secretions, such as saliva, respiratory fluids, urine or feces, may also harbor the virus, that has yet to be confirmed. Milking equipment can help viruses spread. Loic Venance/AFP via Getty Images How waterfowl or other birds transmitted H5N1 to cattle is still under investigation. In 2015, an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in commercial poultry farms reached its peak in April and May, the same time birds migrated north. Birds can shed the virus through their oral, nasal, urine and fecal secretions. So the virus could potentially be transmitted through direct contact, ingesting contaminated feed or water, or inhaling the virus. Infected dairy cows can shed the virus in milk, and they likely can transmit it to other cows, but that still needs to be proven. Contagious pathogens that cause mastitis can be transmitted through milking equipment or contaminated milker’s gloves. Ongoing research will help determine whether this is also a potential transmission route for H5N1, and if so, what makes the virus thrive on mammary tissue. If H5N1 is found to be widespread in milk, what risks can that pose for the dairy industry? For the dairy industry, infection of cattle with H5N1 avian influenza virus creates challenges at two levels. The overriding concern is always for the safety and healthfulness of milk and dairy products. Existing state and federal regulations and industry practices require sick cows or cows with abnormal milk to be segregated so that their milk does not enter the food supply. Proper pasteurization should kill the virus so that it cannot cause infection. The American Association of Bovine Practitioners has also developed biosecurity guidelines for H5N1, focusing on key practices. These include minimizing wild birds’ contact with cattle and their environment, managing the movement of cattle between farms, isolating affected animals, avoiding feeding unpasteurized (raw) colostrum or milk to calves and other mammals, and ensuring the use of protective personal equipment for animal caretakers. The other major concern is for the health of the dairy herd and the people who take care of the dairy cattle. A farm worker who handled dairy cows contracted H5N1 in Texas in March 2024, but such cases are rare. No vaccines or specific therapies are available for avian influenza infections in dairy cattle. But following good sanitation and biosecurity practices for both people and cows will help to reduce risk of exposure and spread of the avian influenza virus among dairy cattle. For cows that get the virus, providing supportive care, including fluids and fever reducers as needed, can help them get through the illness, which can also cause loss of appetite and affect their milk production. Dairy farms facing an outbreak will have economic losses from caring for sick animals and the temporary reduction in milk sales. Approximately 5% to 20% of the animals in the affected herds have become ill, according to early estimates. Affected animals typically recover within 10 to 20 days. At least 22 states have restricted importing dairy cattle to prevent the virus’s spread, and the federal government announced it will require that lactating dairy cattle be tested before they can be moved between states starting April 29, 2024. While the overall impact on U.S. milk production is projected to be minor on an annual basis, it could lead to short-lived supply disruptions. How worried should people be about avian flu? The federal government’s monitoring and food safety measures, along with pasteurization, provide important safeguards to protect the public from potential exposure to avian influenza virus through the food chain. Drinking raw milk, however, does represent a risk for exposure to multiple diseases, including H5N1. This is why the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strongly recommend drinking only pasteurized milk and dairy products.

Dr. Rajesh Gulati at UC Riverside answers some common questions about the virus and its spread Author: Iqbal Pittalwala April 25, 2024 Share This: The World Health Organization has raised concerns about the spread of H5N1 bird flu, the disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. Currently, H5N1 bird flu is causing outbreaks in U.S. poultry and dairy cows. Dr. Rajesh Gulati. Dr. Rajesh Gulati, interim chair of internal medicine at the University of California, Riverside School of Medicine, answers some questions about H5N1 bird flu. Gulati is the associate dean of graduate medical education at UCR and a practicing hospitalist at Riverside Community Hospital. Q: How is this new virus strain behaving differently than strains in earlier outbreaks? This new strain of avian influenza (H5N1) is different from earlier strains because it has adapted and changed. It has used new genetic material from wild bird genes and infected more wild bird species than previous strains have. It has also been affecting mammals — wild ones, such as bears and foxes, but also domesticated ones, like dairy cattle and cats. We can see this new virus strain is also sticking around longer than previous outbreaks. Q: How does the virus spread? How might it spread to humans? The virus initially caused outbreaks in North American poultry species but has now been detected in many types of mammals as well as a few humans. It is spread through droplets or dust from infected animals, which a human can inhale or transfer from hands to the eyesose/mouth. We are not sure about the spread from person to person, but viruses are able to adapt and mutate rapidly. It is important to refer to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention for their research and recommendations. Q: What precautions should people take? Many precautions need to be taken by those in the dairy industry in direct contact with possibly infected animals, or those who often interact with wild birds. These individuals should be using PPE (such as respirators), creating isolated areas, and monitoring exposures. The virus is affecting dairy cattle; we want to make sure we are not consuming raw milk products, which contain many more dangerous microbes than possibly just H5N1 and are only drinking pasteurized milk. In addition, for those of us with pet cats or dogs, it’s important to limit their interactions with wild birds to avoid any spread of the virus to our homes. We should also try to limit our interactions with wild birds, including their feathers, feces, or nests. In general, one of the best ways to protect against viruses is frequent hand washing with soap and water and to avoid touching your hands to your face/mouthose/eyes if they are contaminated in any way. Q: How can the spread be contained? The current methods of control for H5N1 will likely be quarantining and culling (selective slaughter) of infected animals. If infection is suspected, it’s important to trace it back to the source and see the interactions along the way. If there is a need for a vaccine, COVID has shown us that our research centers can get them made (relatively) quickly and administered to prevent an outbreak from becoming catastrophic. For now, the virus appears to be contained to some domesticated mammals and the individuals who were interacting with them on a frequent basis. Q: The virus has jumped to livestock and wild animals. How might this pose a danger to humans? The lives of humans and the animals we consume and acquire products from are tightly linked. We interact frequently with domestic animals for farming, trade, and food production, which increases the opportunity for zoonotic transmission — infections that are spread between people and animals. It has the possibility of seriously disrupting our food supply and leading to significant economic losses. Due to the rapid mutation, this virus can spread across species. It can lead to strains that are more virulent, that is, extremely severe or harmful, or even adapt itself to person-to-person transmission. This could lead to widespread outbreaks or even a global pandemic. Header image credit: wildpixel/iStock/Getty Images Plus.

Dairy cattle moving between states must be tested for the bird flu virus, U.S. agriculture officials said Wednesday, April 24, 2024, as they try to track and control the growing outbreak. (Kobbi R. Blair/Statesman-Journal via AP, File) By JONEL ALECCIA and LAURA UNGAR Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print U.S. health and agriculture officials are ramping up testing and tracking of bird flu in dairy cows in an urgent effort to understand — and stop — the growing outbreak. So far, the risk to humans remains low, officials said, but scientists are wary that the virus could change to spread more easily among people. The virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in nearly three dozen dairy herds in eight states. Inactive viral remnants have been found in grocery store milk. Tests also show the virus is spreading between cows, including those that don’t show symptoms, and between cows and birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Starting Monday, hundreds of thousands of lactating dairy cows in the U.S. will have to be tested — with negative results — before they can be moved between states, under terms of a new federal order. Here’s what you need to know about the ongoing bird flu investigation: WHY IS THIS OUTBREAK SO UNUSUAL?This strain of what’s known as highly pathogenic avian influenza has been circulating in wild birds for decades. In recent years, it has been detected in scores of mammals around the world. Most have been wild animals, such as foxes and bears, that ate sick or dying birds. But it’s also appeared in farmed minks. It’s shown up in aquatic mammals, such as harbor seals and porpoises, too. The virus was even found in a polar bear in northern Alaska. The virus was discovered in ruminants — goats and then dairy cows — in the U.S. this spring, surprising many scientists who have studied it for years. “When we think of influenza A, cows are not typically in that conversation,” said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.Flu viruses are notorious for adapting to spread among new species, so detection in dairy cows raises concerns it could spread to people, Webby said. HOW LONG HAS BIRD FLU BEEN SPREADING IN COWS? Scientists confirmed the virus in cows in March after weeks of reports from dairy farms that the animals were falling ill. Symptoms included lethargy, sharply reduced milk supply and changes to the milk, which became thick and yellow. Finding remnants of the virus in milk on the market “suggests that this has been going on longer, and is more widespread, than we have previously recognized,” said Matthew Aliota, a veterinary medicine researcher at the University of Minnesota.Under pressure from scientists, USDA officials released new genetic data about the outbreak this week. The data omitted some information about when and where samples were collected, but showed that the virus likely was spread by birds to cattle late last year, said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist with the University of Arizona. Since then, it has spread among cattle and among farms, likely through contact with physical objects such as workers’ shoes, trucks or milking machines, Worobey said. And then the cows spread the virus back to birds, he said. “The genetic evidence is as clear as could be,” Worobey said. “Birds that are sampled on these farms have viruses with clear mammalian adaptations.” WHAT DO SCIENTISTS SAY ABOUT EFFORTS TO TRACK THE OUTBREAK? Several experts said the USDA’s plans to require testing in cows are a good start.“We need to be able to do greater surveillance so that we know what’s going on,” said Thomas Friedrich, a virology professor at the University of Wisconsin’s veterinary school.Worobey said the ideal would be to screen every herd. Besides looking for active infections, agriculture officials also should be looking at whether cows have antibodies to the virus, indicating past infections, he said.“That is a really accessible and quick way to find out how widespread this is,” he said.More testing of workers exposed to infected animals is also crucial, experts said. Some farm owners and some individual workers have been reluctant to work with public health officials during the outbreak, experts have said. “Increased surveillance is essentially an early warning system,” Aliota said. “It helps to characterize the scope of the problem, but also to head off potentially adverse consequences.” HOW BIG A RISK DOES BIRD FLU POSE FOR PEOPLE?Scientists are working to analyze more samples of retail milk to confirm that pasteurization, or heat-treating, kills the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA’s food safety center. Those results are expected soon. While the general public doesn’t need to worry about drinking pasteurized milk, experts said they should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk. Also, dairy farm workers should consider extra precautions, such as masking, hand washing and changing work clothes, Aliota said.So far, 23 people have been tested for the virus during the outbreak in dairy cows, with one person testing positive for a mild eye infection, CDC officials said. At least 44 people who were exposed to infected animals in the current outbreak are being monitored for symptoms. WHAT ARE SCIENTISTS’ CONCERNS FOR THE FUTURE? David O’Connor, a virology expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, likened recent bird flu developments to a tornado watch versus a warning.“There are some of the ingredients that would be necessary for there to be a threat, but we’re not there,” he said. As with a tornado watch, “you wouldn’t change anything about how you live your daily life, but you would maybe just have a bit of increased awareness that something is happening.”Worobey said this is the kind of outbreak “that we were hoping, after COVID, would not go unnoticed. But it has.” He said ambitious screening is needed “to detect things like this very quickly, and potentially nip them in the bud.”___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Back to Healio Key takeaways: Traces of “bird flu” virus have been identified in pasteurized cow milk. Eight states have reported infected herds: Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas. The FDA announced this week that testing has identified genetic traces of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in pasteurized cow milk samples collected in the United States. Noting that the pasteurization process is expected to inactivate viruses, the FDA said there is currently no indication that the presence of influenza A(H5N1) viral particles in milk samples is a threat to human health. Testing has identified genetic traces of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in pasteurized cow milk. Image: Adobe Stock. The particles were identified through quantitative PCR (qPCR) testing, which is able to detect only the presence of a pathogen’s genetic material — not whether it remains intact or infectious. For that, the FDA is conducting additional testing to determine if milk samples contain viable virus that remains infectious — the first time that scientists have studied the effect of pasteurization on highly pathogenic influenza viruses like H5N1, which is also referred to as “H5N1 bird flu.” “To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,” the FDA said. Still, the finding raised questions about the tracking of pathogens in the nation’s milk supply and how widespread the outbreak of H5N1 is in dairy cows. As of Monday, eight states had reported infected herds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA): Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas. One human case has also been reported, in Texas. The CDC has advised states to prepare response plans for avian influenza, although it says the risk to human health remains low. On Wednesday, the USDA announced several steps to limit the spread of H5N1 among cattle, including a requirement that dairy cattle receive a negative test for influenza A before crossing state lines. Owners of herds that include infected cows will have to provide information on the herd’s movements, and labs and veterinarians will be required to report positive influenza A tests to the USDA. To gain a better understanding of the public health implications of the H5N1 outbreak in cows, we checked in with Andrew S. Pekosz, PhD, professor of molecular microbiology and immunology and vice chair of the department of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Richard Webby, PhD, a faculty member in the department of infectious diseases at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. [Editor’s note: An earlier version of this Q&A was updated to include responses from Webby.] Healio: In simple terms, what does finding particles of highly pathogenic avian influenza in pasteurized milk mean? Pekosz: For the general public, concern should still be low because the tests are most likely picking up “dead” viruses in the milk. Webby: The finding of H5 RNA in store milk simply means that some milk — which is where most of the H5 virus is found in cows — from infected cows is getting through and into milk destined for consumption. Healio: Is it unexpected? Webby: No, not really. There is a high level of virus in infected cow milk, and with many infectious diseases, there is often asymptomatic or mildly affected animals. Therefore, even when milk from obviously impacted cows is diverted, it is absolutely expected that some will get through. Healio: Is there anything about it that alarms you? Pekosz: What concerns me is that this result means that milk from H5N1 infected cows did make it into the milk supply. Early reports about the milk from an infected cow being discolored and very thick [shows it can be] easily identified and taken out of the supply chain. Finding virus in the milk may mean that it is present in milk that looks otherwise normal and therefore wasn’t caught by this visual inspection. Webby: In itself, no. I am not at all concerned about consuming pasteurized milk. Perhaps the most informative part of this study was the finding of how many milk samples were positive. It does suggest the virus is in more herds than officially reported. Healio: Does finding genetic particles of H5N1 in milk signal danger to the American public? Pekosz: No. Webby: Absolutely not. We have been unable to detect any viable viruses in supermarket milk. The presence of RNA in the sample does not mean there is any virus still there. In this instance, we are sure it’s simply a footprint that says the virus was there once. Healio: Is there any reason for people to stop drinking milk? Pekosz: No. Webby: With the exception of unpasteurized milk, which should not be consumed right now, everything we have says pasteurized milk is safe. Healio: The remnants were found in pasteurized milk. There are a lot of reasons not to drink raw milk, which the CDC says is among the riskiest foods to consume. Would you expect there to be live H5N1 virus in raw milk? Would that pose a risk to someone drinking it? Pekosz: The safety of pasteurized milk compared with raw milk is clear, and in many ways, that validates how effective pasteurization is at killing lots of different microbes, many of which are more “hearty” or difficult to kill than an influenza virus. I would expect there to be live virus in the raw milk, given what we have heard about very strong signals for virus in the milk of cows that show severe symptoms of avian flu infection. It’s important to re-emphasize that there are a lot of other things in raw milk that can make people sick, so pasteurized milk is the safe way to consume milk. It would be nice to have data showing how well pasteurization works against this specific H5N1 virus — and that data should be coming soon. Webby: Yes, we know there is lots of H5 virus in an infected cow’s milk. While the most severely affected milk is clearly “off” and unlikely to make it any further toward human consumption, the presence of H5 RNA in supermarket milk does show not all infected milk is being diverted. So, there is definitely a risk from drinking raw milk and raw milk products. Healio: What does finding H5N1 genetic material in milk mean in terms of how widespread infections are in cattle in the United States? Pekosz: It will be important to do much more widespread testing of dairy cattle and milk produced on dairy farms to understand what the source of H5N1 in the milk is. It may be that the milk has virus in it before the cows show symptoms of infection like reduced milk production or thick, discolored milk. It wouldn’t surprise me if an infected cow had virus in its milk for a day or two before changes in the milk quality could be identified. Another theory is that cows that don’t show symptoms of infection may be shedding virus into their milk. Detecting this would take a lot of testing of apparently healthy cows and their milk. Determining if cows can be infected and shed virus in milk when they show no, or only very mild symptoms will be critical. Webby: As mentioned, this does suggest there are more infections than officially reported. The new directives from USDA requiring reporting of any positive tests will also be informative here. Healio: Do you believe that public health agencies in this country are acting appropriately to respond to the situation? Pekosz: FDA testing and communication around its testing has been quite good. CDC is ready to respond to any potential infections in humans, so I think these public health agencies are responding well. Webby: Currently, the public health agencies in this country are a bit hamstrung. They cannot currently mandate that everyone gets tested who is in contact with the infected herds. They have to wait until someone seeks medical care. So, the response to date isn’t ideal, but is not the fault of the agencies but rather what they can and can’t do. References: FDA.

(Scott Bauer/USDA Agricultural Research Service) Starting next week, certain dairy cattle must be tested for avian influenza before they can be transported to a different state, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday. The requirement is among several that will expand the testing, reporting and monitoring of the cattle to reduce the spread of bird flu among the animals. The new rules follow evidence that highly pathogenic avian influenza — which is commonly spread by migrating birds — has transmitted from cow to cow and from cattle to poultry, and that infected cows might not show symptoms of illness, the USDA said. Last week, an analysis of the virus from a Kansas cow showed that it had acquired “an adaptation to mammals.” On Tuesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said tests had revealed fragments of the virus in pasteurized milk, but that they don’t pose a risk to public health. “While we are taking this action today, it is important to remember that thus far, we have not found changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans and between people,” the USDA said Wednesday. It has been a month since the virus was first confirmed to have infected dairy cattle in Texas. The virus has now been detected in 33 dairy herds in eight states, the USDA said. Part of that spread has been attributed to the transportation of infected cows to new herds. The cows most often recover from infection after a week or so, but their tainted milk cannot be used for commercial human consumption. The virus is often deadly for poultry and can rapidly infect flocks. The rules set to take effect on Monday require lactating dairy cattle to test negative for influenza A before they are transported across state lines, and that requirement might be expanded to other types of dairy cattle in the future. Labs must also report their confirmed infections of livestock to the USDA, and certain herd owners must provide details about where their cattle have been transported. Further information about the new rules is forthcoming, and state agriculture officials declined for now to say what impact they will have on Iowa dairy farmers. “We are still awaiting specific guidance from USDA regarding this new interstate movement order,” said Don McDowell, a spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. John Maxwell, a dairy farmer near Davenport, predicted that the effects for most dairies in Iowa will be inconsequential and that it’s best to be cautious and increase testing until more is known about the disease. “We have to do tests anyway,” he said, in reference to dairy cattle he sells out-of-state. “So it would be one more test and whatever the cost it might be. One more is not the end of the world.” The USDA has said it will reimburse farmers for testing of sick and asymptomatic cattle. States with confirmed bird flu infections of dairy cattle include Kansas, Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas. A virus similar to what has infected cows has been found in poultry flocks in Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Texas, the USDA said.

A team led by Yale’s Akiko Iwasaki and former Yale researcher Charles Dela Cruz successfully tested the effectiveness of neomycin, a common antibiotic, to prevent or treat respiratory viral infections in animal models when given to the animals via the nose. The team then found that the same nasal approach — this time applying the over-the-counter ointment Neosporin — also triggers a swift immune response by interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the noses of healthy humans. The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “This is an exciting finding, that a cheap over-the-counter antibiotic ointment can stimulate the human body to activate an antiviral response,” said Iwasaki, the Sterling Professor of Immunobiology and professor of dermatology at Yale School of Medicine and co-senior author of the new study. “Our work supports both preventative and therapeutic actions of neomycin against viral diseases in animal models, and shows effective blocking of infection and transmission,” said Iwasaki, who is also professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology in Yale’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health, and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Respiratory viruses affect millions of people each year. The global COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has led to 774.5 million cases worldwide as of February 2024, with global mortality of 6.9 million people. Influenza viruses account for up to 5 million cases of severe illness and 500,000 deaths annually worldwide. Currently, most therapies used to fight respiratory viral infections — including antivirals, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma therapy — are delivered intravenously or orally. They focus on stopping the progression of existing infections. A nasal-centered therapy has a much better chance of stopping infections before they can spread to the lower respiratory tract and cause severe diseases, the researchers said. “This collaborative multi-disciplinary work combined important insights from animal pulmonary infection modeling experiments with human study evaluation of this intranasal approach to stimulate antiviral immunity,” said Dela Cruz, former associate professor of pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine, and of microbial pathogenesis at Yale School of Medicine and former director of the Center for Pulmonary Infection Research and Treatment. Dela Cruz is currently at the University of Pittsburgh. In their study, the researchers found that mice treated intranasally with neomycin showed a robust ISG line of defense against both SARS-CoV- 2 and a highly virulent strain of influenza A virus. The researchers also found that an intranasal treatment of neomycin strongly mitigated contact transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters. In healthy humans, intranasal application of Neosporin (containing neomycin) also initiated a strong expression of ISGs in a subset of volunteers, the researchers said. “Our findings suggest that we might be able to optimize this cheap and generic antibiotic to prevent viral diseases and their spread in human populations, especially in global communities with limited resources,” Iwasaki said. “This approach, because it is host-directed, should work no matter what the virus is.” The co-first authors of the new study, all from Yale, are Tianyang Mao, Jooyoung Kim, and Mario Peña-Hernández.

By Brian Buntz | April 24, 2024[James Thew/Adobe Stock]The recent emergence of H5N1 avian influenza in humans and many other animals has intensified global efforts to prepare for a potential pandemic. Public health agencies and international organizations are collaborating with pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to develop vaccines, treatments, and strategies to mitigate the impact of an outbreak. The CDC, for instance, has released interim guidelines for dealing with the highly pathogenic virus, including recommendations for antiviral treatment. While government agencies and international organizations are leading the charge on public health guidance, surveillance and research initiatives, private pharma firms are driving the development and manufacturing of H5N1 vaccines and antivirals, often in sync with academic institutions and with support from public funds. Global efforts ramp up H5N1 pandemic preparedness While the CDC has released interim guidance backing early antiviral treatment with oral oseltamivir (Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (Relenza), IV peramivir (Rapivab) or oral baloxavir (Xofluza), the effectiveness of these antiviral treatments for H5N1 specifically remains an open question. The agency acknowledges there are no clinical trial data from randomized clinical trials of antiviral treatment in patients with novel influenza A virus infection, but acknowledges positive outcomes from such trials in patients with seasonal influenza. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza): The mainstays, but questions linger regarding pandemic potential Questions regarding the potential of antivirals for pandemic influenza have persisted for years. In 2014, the charitable organization Cochrane reported modest symptom reduction from oseltamivir and zanamivir for seasonal influenza, but found no evidence of reduced complications, alongside an increased risk of adverse effects. As a result, some experts have questioned the rationale behind earlier stockpiling recommendations made by regulatory bodies in the 1990s and early 2000s. More recently, experts have highlighted the importance of early antiviral treatment, particularly for high-risk groups, in reducing symptom duration, complications, hospitalizations and mortality associated with influenza. A 2021 network meta-analysis found that zanamivir was associated with the shortest time to alleviation of influenza symptoms compared to other antivirals and placebo, while baloxavir was associated with a lower risk of influenza-related complications. These findings underscore the potential benefits of antiviral medications in managing influenza, especially when administered within 48 hours of symptom onset. Key players in H5N1 preparedness The table below provides a snapshot of some notable players involved in H5N1 preparedness, outlining their roles, technologies, notable collaborations and ongoing clinical trials. Entity Role in Pandemic Preparedness Product/Approach Technology Collaborations Testing/Guidance CDC, WHO Provide guidance on antiviral treatment for pandemic influenza, including novel avian influenza A viruses Antiviral treatment recommendations Neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir), cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor (baloxavir) – CDC interim guidance recommends early antiviral treatment with oral oseltamivir (Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (Relenza), IV peramivir (Rapivab) or oral baloxavir (Xofluza) for outpatients and hospitalized patients with suspected, probable or confirmed novel influenza A virus infections associated with severe disease.

Can we make enough? By Helen Branswell April 24, 2024 Reprints Illustration: Christine Kao/STAT; Photos: Getty The unsettling reality of H5N1 bird flu circulating in dairy cow herds in multiple parts of the United States is raising anxiety levels about whether this dangerous virus, which has haunted the sleep of people who worry about influenza pandemics for more than 20 years, could be on a path to acquiring the ability to easily infect people. To be clear, there is no evidence that this is currently the case — the sole confirmed human case reported in Texas three weeks ago was in a farm worker who had contact with cattle. There is no way to predict if the virus will acquire the capacity to spread between people, or when and under what conditions it would make that fateful leap if it does.advertisement But the first signs that H5N1 — or any new flu virus — was starting to spread from person to person would trigger a race to produce massive amounts of vaccine to try to mitigate the damage a flu pandemic might be expected to cause. While the 2009 H1N1 pandemic is estimated to have killed about a quarter-million people worldwide — severe flu seasons sometimes kill more — the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic is believed to have killed between 50 million and 100 million people, many times more than Covid-19. The good news: The world makes a lot of flu vaccine and has been doing it for decades. Regulatory agencies have well-oiled systems to allow manufacturers to update the viruses the vaccines target without having to seek new licenses. The United States even has some H5 vaccine in a stockpile that it believes would offer protection against the version of the H5N1 virus infecting dairy cattle, though there would not be nearly enough doses for the entire country. Related: H5N1 bird flu virus particles found in pasteurized milk but FDA says commercial milk supply appears safe The bad news: The current global production capacity isn’t close to adequate to vaccinate a large portion of the world’s population in the first year of a pandemic. And batches of flu vaccine, often (though not always) produced in hen’s eggs, take months to produce.advertisement The Covid pandemic saw vaccine manufacturers around the world pump out unprecedented amounts of vaccine in an extraordinarily short period of time. By February 2022, 14 months after vaccination efforts began, it was estimated that 11 billion doses of vaccine had been produced and delivered. Could that record be matched — broken? — if H5N1 starts a pandemic? Would the profound inequity of the Covid vaccine distribution, which had affluent countries awash with doses while low-income countries waited for supplies, be remedied or repeated? Experts STAT interviewed suggested that in some respects, the world is better positioned to produce pandemic flu vaccines, if the need arises. But a number warned that assuming the successes of Covid vaccine production would automatically influence the speed and scale of pandemic flu vaccine production would be unwise. “You just have a different [production] system for flu vaccines than we developed on the fly for Covid,” said Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, better known as CEPI, an international organization tasked with spurring development of medical countermeasures for diseases that can cause epidemics and pandemics. “And the … system that we developed for Covid can’t just be repurposed for flu.” Let’s explore some of the ways the world is perhaps better prepared than it was in the past, and some of the snarls that could slow efforts to protect against a dangerous pandemic. What the need would be To gain protection against seasonal flu, most people get vaccinated with one dose of vaccine. Young children who’ve never been vaccinated against flu are an exception; kids ages 6 months to 8 years must get two doses of vaccine, at least four weeks apart, the first time they are vaccinated. Why? Because they are considered to be “naive” to influenza, and their immune systems need to be primed (introduced to flu viruses) and then boosted. Anyone over age 8 is likely to have encountered flu before; they’ve already been primed. One dose is sufficient to acquaint immune systems to the evolved versions of previously encountered seasonal flu viruses. But with a brand-new flu virus — and H5N1 definitely falls into that category for humans — everyone will be naive. So the assumption of pandemic planners is that everyone would need two doses of vaccine in the first season of vaccinating against H5N1. (During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the new virus was distantly related to one that had circulated for much of the previous century, and one dose was adequate for protection. There’s no expectation that would be true with an H5 pandemic.) That math is daunting: The 8.1 billion people worldwide times two is 16.2 billion doses. Babies under the age of 6 months aren’t vaccinated against flu — their immune systems aren’t yet sufficiently developed for it to be effective — so that number would be a bit lower. But there’s always waste in vaccine delivery, so the 16 billion probably isn’t far off.

Speaking of kids, there’s a dynamic at play with H5N1 that wasn’t seen in the Covid pandemic, one that adds to the complexity of vaccinating the planet in a flu pandemic. The vast majority of Covid deaths were in older adults; there were relatively few deaths in children. But flu infections are hardest on older adults and little kids. In the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it is estimated that nearly 1,300 children under the age of 17 died in the United States, a high toll when compared to a typical flu season. And 2009 was mild, in pandemic terms. Furthermore, kids amplify the transmission of flu in communities, Hatchett said, noting the fall wave of the 2009 pandemic in the U.S. started in late summer, when southern states went back to school. A really bad pandemic could change public opinion rapidly, but at present it seems unlikely there would be much appetite for closing schools to slow spread of a new flu virus. School closures are one of the most reviled of the containment measures that were used in the Covid pandemic. “The disease is different. It behaves differently. It has different mortality patterns and different transmission patterns. And we would be in a setup because we’d be coming out of Covid with a Covid mindset and Covid biases that would jeopardize our ability to do the right thing if there were a flu pandemic,” Hatchett said. So while the United States waited into 2022 before starting to vaccinate children against Covid — and some countries didn’t vaccinate children at all — kids will be in the pool of people who need to be vaccinated when the next flu pandemic hits. What the current production capacity is An assessment of market capacity published by the World Health Organization in January estimated that the combined global supply was 1.2 billion trivalent doses of flu vaccine, which target three flu virus strains at a time. During a pandemic, the vaccine made would target a single virus, the new one. So, in theory, 1.2 billion vaccine doses could become 3.6 billion vaccine doses. More than 85% of those doses are made by seven producers, the WHO analysis said, and over 95% of seasonal vaccine doses are used in high- and upper-middle income countries, which will almost certainly have first dibs on pandemic vaccines. More on this later. Back to the math. How much vaccine would each person need? The 3.6 billion doses would be enough for 1.8 billion people. But that’s only if the same amount of vaccine used to protect against seasonal flu viruses would protect against H5N1. And there we run into another problem. Research done in the mid-2000s found that H5N1 is poorly immunogenic in people; it doesn’t trigger a strong immune response unless it’s administered in large amounts, or is given with a boosting compound known as an adjuvant that broadly stimulates the immune system. In a seasonal flu shot, each component contains 15 micrograms of antigen or vaccine. In that study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, it took two doses of 90 micrograms — 12 times the amount used to protect against a strain in the seasonal vaccine — to induce what’s thought to be a protective response in just over half of the volunteers. In a world where need will outstrip supply, that’s a wholly unworkable dosage. In the years since, multiple studies have been conducted to see whether adjuvants could lower the amount of antigen needed and stretch supplies. They do. Some studies have even suggested fractional doses, with an adjuvant, could be effective. For example, CSL Seqirus, which supplies flu vaccine to the U.S. market and has a licensed pandemic H5N1 vaccine in the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS), showed that 7.5 micrograms, with an adjuvant, would generate what’s thought to be a protective response in a portion of adults. The studies were small, so the range of the estimates is broad, but between 28% and 64% of volunteers ages 18 through 64 and 17% to 57% of volunteers ages 65 and older developed what is thought to be a protective level of antibodies from the 7.5 microgram shot. Related: Why a leading bird flu expert isn’t convinced that the risk H5N1 poses to people has declined But not all flu vaccine manufacturers use or have proprietary adjuvants. CSL Seqirus and GSK do; Sanofi, a major producer of flu vaccines, currently does not. And the global supply of adjuvants could be a bottleneck in any effort to vaccinate the world against H5N1, experts say. (About two weeks after publication of this story, Sanofi struck an agreement with embattled Covid vaccine manufacturer Novavax that, among other things, gives Sanofi a non-exclusive license for Novavax’s Matrix-M adjuvant.) “I would be very curious to know what the global production capacity for the relevant adjuvants that we have data for would be. And I suspect it would be vastly insufficient to what is needed,” Hatchett said. The U.S. has stores of adjuvants in the NPIVS, said David Boucher, director of infectious diseases preparedness and response for the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. How quickly could the U.S. respond? The United States has been doing active pandemic preparedness work for at least the past two decades. It understood that domestic production of flu vaccine would be critical in a pandemic, when borders might close to exports if a situation became dire. (Witness India’s refusal to export Covid vaccines in spring 2021 when it was hit with a huge wave of cases.) The government incentivized development of flu vaccine manufacturing and fill-and-finish operations in the U.S. The country, through ASPR, has worked with flu vaccine manufacturers to develop and test batches of H5N1 vaccines targeting different versions of the virus. H5N1 vaccine has already been tested in children, which will help speed availability for a group that is typically at the end of the testing list. (Manufacturers are reluctant to test vaccines in children until they have lots of adult safety data.) There are currently four types of H5N1 vaccine in the NPIVS, said Boucher. Analysis of the viruses they are based on and the viruses from the cattle outbreaks suggests that two of the stockpiled vaccines are sufficiently close, genetically, to be useful, should this version of the virus take off, the WHO and the CDC have stated. “We have right now two candidate vaccine viruses that are very well matched to the current virus from those we have,” Boucher said. About 10 million doses are being stored in bulk, and “hundreds of thousands” of doses have already been placed in vials. That’s a start. But with two doses needed per person, it would not go very far. Boucher said decisions on who the first doses would go to have yet to be made. Those vaccines haven’t been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but the agency has a fast-track process for updating flu vaccines, and a lot of recent experience with emergency authorization of pandemic vaccines. It can make this happen fast. “Some fraction” of the doses in the filled vials could be available within weeks, Boucher said, depending on how quickly the regulatory process went. And while the bulk antigen was being put into vials, large-scale manufacturing would kick into gear. He estimated that tens of millions of doses could be manufactured over a four- or five-month period. An ASPR spokesperson later put the figure at about 125 million doses. (Remember, 125 million doses would be enough to vaccinate 62.5 million people, about a fifth of the U.S. population.) Kathleen Neuzil, a longtime influenza vaccine researcher at the University of Maryland who takes over as director of the Fogarty International Center at the National Institutes of Health in early May, studied one of the two stockpiled vaccines that Boucher mentioned. It is based on an H5N8 virus and has the same key component as H5N1. (The major target of a flu vaccine is the hemagglutinin protein on the viruses’ surface, the H in a strain’s name.) Her group tested blood from people vaccinated with it against a virus related to the ones that have been seen in cows, which come from a subgroup of H5N1 known as 2.3.4.4b. Although the vaccine targets a 2.3.4.4c virus — a slightly different clade — the researchers saw good antibody responses in people who had received two 15-microgram doses of the vaccine, with adjuvant. “We had tested this H5N8 vaccine that’s in the stockpile to that strain, and it had pretty good cross reactivity — if you use an adjuvant,” Neuzil told STAT. Would the stockpiled vaccine protect us, if H5 triggers a pandemic? Two vaccine and pandemic preparedness experts who used to work for the FDA recently questioned how useful the stockpiled vaccine would be, in an opinion piece in STAT. “Let’s say that by a miracle that it really is a good match, that it’s protective and all that. It’s available in such limited numbers it’s just not meaningful for the response,” Luciana Borio, a former acting chief scientist at FDA and former member of the National Security Council, said in an interview. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said it would be prudent to remember the vaccine experience of the 2009 pandemic when making projections about how effective the stockpiled vaccine might be against a virus that evolves to be able to spread from person to person. A study of how well the vaccine worked then showed good protection for young people but no discernible protection for older adults. “You had the strain in the vaccine. And you still saw a relative lack of protection that you would expect to have with a closely matched virus,” he said. Then there’s the issue of how long it takes to produce additional doses, if they are needed. Making a new type of flu vaccine requires manufacturers to learn how to grow large volumes of the viruses. Some viruses grow better than others; sometimes it takes time to learn how to optimize growth. In 2009, manufacturers initially struggled to produce adequate supply of viruses, delaying rollout of the vaccines. In fact, though tens of millions of Americans were vaccinated against H1N1 in 2009, the fall wave of that pandemic — when the vast majority of U.S. cases occurred — had already largely subsided by the time vaccine doses were available in substantial numbers. (Source: The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, the University of Minnesota) Could mRNA vaccines be a wild card? During the Covid pandemic, messenger RNA vaccines — which are quicker to make because they don’t require growing supplies of virus — hit the market with incredible speed. But it’s not clear what role mRNA vaccines would play in a flu pandemic, if one were to occur soon. Both Pfizer and Moderna, the major mRNA players, are developing flu vaccines they hope to combine with Covid shots in a bid to boost flagging sales of the latter and grab a share of the pretty saturated seasonal flu vaccine market. Both have reported that for influenza A — H5N1 belongs to that large flu family — their vaccines appeared to induce immune responses similar to those seen generated by traditional flu vaccines. Moderna is currently testing an H5N1 vaccine, from the 2.3.4.4b subset of viruses, in people. That trial began last summer. But the trial’s listing in the Clinicaltrials.gov database is cagey about the dosages Moderna is testing, calling them simply dose number 1, 2 and 3. Christopher Ridley, Moderna’s vice president of communications, said the detail was obscured for “competitive reasons.” Given how likely it is for mRNA vaccines to induce unpleasant side effects, especially at higher doses, and given how poorly immunogenic H5N1 viruses are, finding a sweet spot — an mRNA H5 vaccine that would be both effective and tolerable to take — could take some work. Hatchett thinks that regulators will want more data before they embrace mRNA vaccines as a solution in a flu pandemic — though he and others have noted that in a true crisis, “all bets are off.” “My intuition would be that we are still in a vulnerable period when it’s not just an instant solution,” he said of the mRNA option. “I think if we make the proper investments, we could very soon get to the point where we know what the dose needs to be and have mRNA vaccines against avian strains as part of our arsenal and scale it quickly. I just don’t think we’ve worked that through yet.” Trending Now: What can Trump and RFK Jr. actually do on health care? Boucher said ASPR is looking to add mRNA H5N1 vaccine to the stockpile, having recently issued a request for proposals from manufacturers. It is still assessing the submissions it generated, he said. Seth Berkley, who stepped down last summer after 12 years as CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, raised other questions about mRNA as an option for a pandemic flu response, noting that with the Covid mRNA vaccines, the protection against any infection waned quickly and the vaccines needed to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures, which made them impractical for parts of the world. “But if you were to say, we want to make flu vaccines for the world, would that be mRNA technology? Or … wouldn’t you want a vaccine, probably adjuvanted, that would take a little longer to make, but might be inexpensive and easy to produce and give longer immunity?” Berkeley mused. “We don’t know, but those are the questions that will have to get asked, and they didn’t get asked in Covid because of the emergency we were in.” Will lower-income countries have to wait yet again? In 2009, the Obama administration announced it would donate 10% of the U.S. stocks of vaccine, as they rolled off the manufacturing line, starting after high-risk people in the country were vaccinated. Hatchett was one of the people tasked with running that program. Other countries were persuaded to join, and the WHO led an effort to redistribute vaccine to countries that could not buy their way into the vaccine purchasing lines. Eventually, Hatchett said, about 200 million doses were donated, but by the time they were available, the pandemic had subsided. When the program was wound down in October of 2010, about 80 million doses had been distributed. Fast forward to the Covid pandemic. Nearly 2 billion doses of Covid vaccine were distributed through COVAX, an entity set up by the WHO, Gavi, CEPI, and UNICEF (the United Nation’s Children’s Fund) to try to secure vaccine for countries boxed out of the market. And still, vaccine distribution was hugely inequitable. That fact was part of the inspiration for the ongoing efforts to come up with an international pandemic accord that would try to ensure vaccines, drugs, and other medical essentials are more fairly distributed in the next pandemic. Those efforts have struggled to reach a consensus acceptable to all parties. People who know the flu vaccine market think the dynamics may not be vastly different in the next pandemic than they were in the last two. “I would say even today, it’s true that the countries with the manufacturing capacity will be the countries with the early access to these vaccines,” Neuzil cautioned. An in-depth analysis of global seasonal and pandemic flu vaccine production capacity, led by the WHO and based on 2019 data, showed that low- and middle-income countries made up 38% of the world’s population, but produced 2% of seasonal influenza vaccine. There was no flu vaccine production in Africa, and a Moderna plan to build an mRNA vaccine production facility there was recently shelved, a move the company ascribed to the sharp drop in sales of its Covid vaccine. Hatchett said a problem that existed in 2009 was the fact that high-income countries that bought seasonal flu vaccine had provisions in their contracts that gave them first or early access to pandemic vaccine, if the need arose. When H1N1 emerged, “all of the vaccine that could be produced in Europe was absorbed,” he said. “And I suspect those contingent purchase contracts are probably still in place, and probably you would have the exact same phenomenon again.” This article has been updated to note that Sanofi has signed a deal to license an adjuvant for use in its vaccines.

And then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission,” Farrar told a media briefing in Geneva last week. At the WHO’s global media briefing on Wednesday, WHO epidemiologist Dr Maria Van Kerkhove that “we have not seen human-to-human transmission in the recent cases, and I think that’s really important because there’s a lot of news right now on influenza”. Spread in US dairy herds H5N1 has been detected in cattle in 33 dairy herds in eight US states, according to the latest US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report on 24 April. Remnants of the virus have also been detected in raw milk. US CDC described “this degree of spread outside of birds & poultry is unprecedented and concerning” and the US Department of Agriculture has restricted interstate cow transport to limit the spread of the disease. One human infection has been reported in a Texas, cattle farm worker in late March. Genomic sequencing from this patient found that each individual gene segment was “closely related to viruses detected in dairy cattle” in Texas, according to US CDC. “While minor changes were identified in the virus sequence from the patient specimen compared to the viral sequences from cattle, both cattle and human sequences maintain primarily avian genetic characteristics and, for the most part, lack changes that would make them better adapted to infect mammals,” it noted. “There are no markers known to be associated with influenza antiviral resistance found in the virus sequences from the patient’s specimen and the virus is very closely related to two existing candidate vaccine viruses that are already available to manufacturers, and which could be used to make vaccine if needed,” added. Overall, the genetic analysis “supports CDC’s conclusion that the human health risk currently remains low”. US public officials said that Tamiflu, an antiviral effective for treating influenza, is stockpiled for a potential emergency, NPR reported. Some candidate vaccines for H5N1 are also in development and there are some options for enhancing present supply. US states where H5N1 has been detected in cattle Historically, human cases of the H5N1 virus are so far very rare, with only 889 cases reported to the WHO since 2003, all involving people who came in contact with infected animals. But virus mortality reaches 52%, which is “extraordinary high”, said Farrar, who urged close monitoring and investigation of the outbreaks in US cattle by public health authorities “because it may evolve into transmitting in different ways”. “Do the milking structures of cows create aerosols? Is it the environment which they’re living in? Is it the transport system that is spreading this around the country?” he asked. “This is a huge concern and I think we have to … make sure that if H5N1 did come across to humans with human-to-human transmission that we were in a position to immediately respond with access equitably to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.” Different strains, different severity Though avian influenza viruses naturally occur in wild water birds, some variants are also known to develop the ability to infect other animals. The virus has multiple variants of differing severity and transmission possibilities. A case of human infection with the much milder strain of avian influenza virus (H9N2) was confirmed in Viet Nam on 9 April by the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point, as WHO reported. The same virus strain was also detected in three patients in China,according to the Centre for Health Protection of Hong Kong. H9N2 usually results in mild infections of the upper respiratory tract, mostly affecting children. It is a low pathogenic avian influenza, usually showing only mild disease in chickens and other poultry, according to the US CDC. Systems in place to respond Maria van Kerkhove “We are concerned about this particular virus because we know influenza has the potential to cause epidemics,” said Van Kerkhove. “That’s why we have a global system in place to monitor detect, to rapidly do risk assessments to look at viruses that could potentially be used in vaccines as we go forward.” However, she expressed confidence that risks of an outbreak in human populations remain low and that existing WHO surveillance systems competent to monitor any developments. ”We have a global influenza surveillance and response system that’s been in place for 70 years. And within this systems, there are strong surveillance components, made up of labs around the world, made up of many partner agencies,” she assured the media briefing. Dr Michael Ryan, WHO’s Executive Director of the Health Emergencies Programme, backed Van Kerkhove: “We have a system that can measure and we have countermeasures ready to go should anything happen and that’s all we can do in public health.” “We can’t stop living because viruses threaten us. What we can do is be ready to respond,” he said,. The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework “has been in place again for 20 years and has provided a framework for collaboration between WHO labs and industry for the sharing of material, for the sharing of vaccines”, added Ryan.

Opens in a new tab or window Share on X. Opens in a new tab or window Share on LinkedIn. Opens in a new tab or window email article With H5N1 avian influenza causing unprecedented outbreaks in mammals around the world -- including U.S. dairy cattle -- infectious disease experts are raising concerns that the U.S. isn't doing enough to get ahead of any potential problems. "We really need to be moving quickly to get our heads around what's happening in the animal population and also what's happening in the human population," James Lawler, MD, MPH, of the University of Nebraska Medical Center's Global Center for Health Security, told MedPage Today. "I don't think we've been testing adequately to be able to get a real picture of that." Lawler said we should be particularly cautious "when a virus starts doing things that we don't expect it to do, like circulating widely in a species where we normally haven't seen infections. We really need to respect the potential danger that exists." Federal officials have confirmed that 33 dairy cattle herds in eight U.S. states have tested positive for H5N1. However, the outbreak is likely much larger than that, and has probably been spreading undetected for much longer than thought, Lawler said. That's evidenced by the fact that FDA detected H5N1 in samples from the commercial milk supply, and by recently released viral sequences from animal infections supplied by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), from which virologists concluded the outbreak likely began in December 2023, with a single spillover incident from birds into cows. Federal officials have been trying to reassure the public, holding a press briefing with officials from a range of agencies -- including the HHS Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, USDA, FDA, CDC, and NIH -- on Wednesday, and providing detailed information at a public symposium led by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) on Thursday. The USDA recently required testing for influenza before cattle are moved between states, but mandated no other testing requirements for livestock, and symptomatic testing is voluntary. The agency did not return a request for comment from MedPage Today as of press time. Detecting Human Infections In an email to MedPage Today, a CDC spokesperson said that while the USDA is responsible for livestock testing, the agencies are "working together to characterize virus specimens and monitor for changes that might make these viruses more likely to transmit to or between humans." In the current outbreak, at least 44 people have been monitored for symptoms, the spokesperson said, and more are being passively monitored, where they monitor themselves and report if they develop symptoms. Overall, 23 people have been tested by states, with only one person -- a farm worker in Texas whose only symptom was conjunctivitis -- tested positive, the spokesperson said. Since this particular clade (2.3.4.4b) of H5N1 appeared in the U.S. in 2022, CDC has monitored more than 8,400 people in 52 jurisdictions, Sonja Olsen, PhD, associate director of preparedness and response at CDC's influenza division, said during the ASTHO symposium. About 200 people reported symptoms and were tested, which turned up just two positive cases in the U.S. -- the recent one in the Texas dairy cattle worker, and another in Colorado in 2022 who had contact with infected birds. Both cases were mild and the patients made full recoveries. However, since the illness caused by H5N1 can go on in cattle for several weeks, workers are at ongoing risk, so the period for monitoring will be longer than the 10 days outlined in 2014 joint guidance from USDA and CDC, Olsen said. The CDC spokesperson said the agency is "well positioned to detect this virus -- down to the individual case levels." In terms of human influenza, CDC hasn't seen "any unusual trends at the national, state, or local levels" nor has it identified "any out-of-the-ordinary influenza-related emergency department data." Nor has there been any concerning activity in terms of foodborne illness, the spokesperson added. Testing asymptomatic people "is not routinely recommended because most people who are infected with avian influenza A viruses have usually shown symptoms of illness," the spokesperson said. In addition, testing people who've potentially been exposed but don't have symptoms may "pick up small amounts of flu viruses ... that do not represent actual infections but are likely surface contamination of mucosal membranes. Those people are unlikely to transmit the virus to others or manifest symptoms themselves," the spokesperson added. Will Commercial Tests Be Available if Needed? Should the U.S. be in a position where testing is needed at scale, the CDC is poised to make that happen, Vivien Dugan, PhD, director of the agency's influenza division, said during the ASTHO briefing. Based on genetic sequencing from the Texas human case, there's no impact on current diagnostics, she said. The human virus sequence is "nearly identical" to samples from infected dairy cattle and birds in Texas, she said. It appears primarily to have avian viral genetic characteristics and lacks any changes that would make it better at infecting mammals, she added. It did contain one substitution that wasn't found in Texas cattle or birds, in the polymerase 2 protein at position E627K. This mutation has been identified in other human cases of H5N1 so it's "not surprising or uncommon" and may have been acquired during this person's infection, she said. Even so, this wouldn't impact CDC's real-time polymerase chain reaction diagnostic assays that are available at U.S. public health labs across the country, and which are in use year-round to test for influenza, she said. Commercial tests for influenza A, Dugan said, are widely available "and we expect they will detect H5 as an influenza A virus." "We are actively partnering with commercial diagnostic developers and testing companies in case we need to scale up to increase testing if needed," she said. "We are positioning ourselves to be ready to go should the situation change." 'Society-Ending Pandemic' Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) was first identified in domestic waterfowl in China in 1996 and the first human case occurred in 1997, Olsen said. Since then, a total of 909 cases from 23 countries have been reported -- with a mortality rate of 52%. "That's just a reminder of why this disease is such a public health concern," Olsen said. Lawler noted that the current case fatality rate is likely an overestimate. "There are probably a lot more undetected cases we haven't counted," he said. But even if mortality is 10-fold lower, "a flu virus with a case fatality rate of 5% is catastrophic. That's a society-ending pandemic." The 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic probably had a case fatality rate of 2%, he noted, "and that was bad enough." "We need to get out in front of this quickly, to make sure that ... we assess the true scope of this problem," he said. "The more opportunity we give this virus to circulate in more species of mammals, the more likely we will get mutations that adapt it more effectively to other mammals, including humans."

No Vote View Results Back The testing rule applies to lactating cows and could be expanded to other types of dairy cattle as USDA gathers more information.Testing must be done at a National Animal Health Laboratory Network lab. In Pennsylvania, these are the state veterinary lab, Penn State’s Animal Diagnostic Laboratory and the University of Pennsylvania’s New Bolton Center.Owners of herds where dairy cattle test positive will be required to provide epidemiological information, including animal movement tracing.Labs and state veterinarians must report positive tests to USDA.USDA will reimburse the cost of testing, but farmers may have to cover the labor cost of collecting the samples, as well as the cost of shipping the tests to the lab, said Alex Hamberg, Pennsylvania's state veterinarian, in an April 26 industry call.USDA said these measures are intended to limit the spread of influenza in dairy cows and to gather more information about the disease, which appears to have jumped from wild birds.Before this federal order, at least 22 states had instituted their own movement restrictions.As of April 24, USDA has confirmed influenza A on 33 dairy farms in eight states.USDA has identified spread between cows in the same herd, spread from cows to poultry, spread between dairies associated with cattle movements, and cows without clinical signs that have tested positive.On April 16, USDA identified a shift in an influenza sample from a cow in Kansas that could indicate that the virus has an adaptation to mammals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted further analysis of the specimen sequence, which did not change their overall risk assessment for the general public because the substitution has been seen in other mammal infections and does not affect viral transmission.The CDC believes the risk to the general public remains low, though farm workers with direct contact with infected animals face an elevated risk of infection. While avian influenza causes devastating losses in poultry farms, cows are recovering with little or no mortality.USDA and the Food and Drug Administration say the commercial milk supply remains safe because pasteurization inactivates viruses in milk and because milk from sick cows is banned from entering commerce.USDA found influenza in a lung tissue sample from an asymptomatic cull dairy cow that originated from an affected herd and did not enter the food supply.Below is USDA's frequently asked questions document about the testing rules.

(Emily Kenny photo / Spectrum News 1) New York adds new temporary requirements for dairy cattle imports over bird flu By Luke Parsnow New York State PUBLISHED 2:27 PM ET Apr. 22, 2024 PUBLISHED 2:27 PM EDT Apr. 22, 2024 SHARE There will be new temporary import requirements for dairy cattle coming to New York after detections of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, more commonly known as bird flu, in dairy cattle and goats in several other states, the state Department of Agriculture and Markets announced Monday. The regulations include: the ban of importation of dairy cattle from a premises with a confirmed case of HPAI or a premises under investigation as a suspect premises A Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI) issued within 10 days prior to entry into New York for any dairy cattle imported from affected states A statement in CVIs issued for dairy cattle from affected states that says "All animals identified on the Certificate of Veterinary (CVI) have been examined and do not originate from a premises with a confirmed detection of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or that is currently under investigation as a suspect premises." These requirements will remain in place until further notice. The state said no cases HPAI cases have been detected in New York livestock at this time, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture says that there is no threat to human health. Pasteurized milk and dairy products remain safe to consume as pasteurization kills harmful microbes and pathogens in milk, including the influenza virus, the state said, in addition to there being no concern regarding eating properly cooked meat products. - Spectrum News Contact About RSS Sitemap FAQ ADVERTISE WITH US CAREERS TERMS Your Privacy Rights California Consumer Privacy Rights California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising CERTIFICATIONS Â© 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.Avian Influenza vaccination campaign in France - aviNews, the global poultry magazine Mexico Brazil Arabic Global South Cone Andean Region Spain Indonesia Search Register Login Search TECHNICAL ARTICLES MONOGRAPHICS Species REPORTAGE INTERVIEWS SECTORIAL NEWS Authors BUSINESS DIRECTORY PRODUCT GUIDES REGISTRATION/LOGIN AVINEWS MAGAZINE PRINTED SUBSCRIPTION AGRIFM - PODCAST AGRI - CALENDAR AGRINEWS CAMPUS REGIONS Spain Mexico Brazil Arabic Global South Cone Andean Region Indonesia Magazine Feeding and nutrition of layers Themes Species Interviews Sectorial Authors Companies Product Events RECOMMENDED Alternative production Animal Nutrition AviNews aviNews Biosecurity Equipment Events Genetics 2024 PSA Annual Meeting 41st Saudi Agriculture 2024 Additives aditives alpacas Alphitobius diaperinus Amino acids aMPV Animal welfare Antibiotic-free poultry Artificial Intelligence Ascaridia galli READ SUMMARY SUBSCRIBE RECEIVE IN PAPER OTHER EDITIONS 26 Apr 2024 Avian Influenza vaccination campaign in France France has faced several major outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in recent years, leading to the culling of millions of poultry. To address this challenge, France has implemented a vaccination campaign aimed at protecting poultry sectors and limiting the spread of the virus. PDF FILE Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has been a recurring health crisis in France. The country has faced several major outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in recent years, leading to the culling of millions of poultry. To address this challenge, France has implemented a vaccination campaign aimed at protecting poultry sectors and limiting the spread of the virus. The need for vaccination Scale of the crisis France experienced a severe avian influenza outbreak in 2021-2022, resulting in the culling of over 21 million poultry. Endemicity (persistence of the virus throughout the year) is suspected in wild birds across the country. Biosecurity measures While biosecurity measures (such as confinement, bird transfer limitations, and disinfection protocols) are essential, vaccination can complement these efforts. Currently, only one vaccine for chickens (Gallus gallus species) has marketing authorization in France. Applications for additional poultry species vaccines are under assessment by the French Agency for Veterinary Medicinal Products (ANMV) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Proposed vaccination scenarios To establish an effective vaccination strategy, ANSES (Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l’alimentation, de l’environnement et du travail) proposes three preventive vaccination scenarios: Priority farms and species Determine the types of farms and species to be vaccinated as a priority based on available resources. Protect the gene pool of French poultry by targeting specific species. Limit the spread of HPAI by vaccinating the most exposed poultry. Anticipating outbreaks Implement a preventive vaccination strategy to anticipate epizootic outbreaks. Avoid massive virus spread from infected farms. Enable the poultry sector to restart production after an outbreak. Avoiding emergency vaccination Emergency vaccination is not scientifically appropriate due to the time lag between vaccination and immunity acquisition (approximately 3-4 weeks). Emergency vaccination could increase biosecurity risks on farms. Recent developments Mass vaccination of ducks France began Europe’s only mass-vaccination campaign against avian influenza. Approximately 64 million ducks across 2,700 farms will receive vaccinations over the next year. The goal is to end mass culls and protect the poultry industry. Strict surveillance system Vaccination should be accompanied by a strict surveillance system. The selected vaccines allow the implementation of a DIVA (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) strategy. Conclusion France’s Avian Influenza vaccination campaign aims to safeguard poultry sectors, preserve the gene pool, and prevent massive virus spread. By combining vaccination with existing biosecurity measures, France is taking proactive steps to mitigate the impact of avian influenza outbreaks.Continue after advertising. Remember, prevention is key, and vaccination plays a crucial role in protecting our birds and the poultry industry. Sources: Available upon request.

Image Credit: Hedgehog 94, Adobe StockThe article first appeared on our sister site dvm360. On Thursday, April 18, 2024, the United Nations (UN) announced that the transmission of avian flu to mammals, including humans, is a "significant public health concern," according to UN medics.1 In a public statement shared by the UN, Jeremy Farrar, PhD, chief scientist at the World Health Organization (WHO) also said the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus “has become a global zoonotic pandemic.”1H5N1 primarily infects wild birds and poultry but has also been detected in mammals including cattle, mink, foxes, bears, seals, cats, dogs, and goats.2 In Texas, an individual with avian influenza had contact with infected dairy cows that are believed to be the source of transmission to a human.2,3 Meanwhile, the CDC is continuing to encourage veterinarians, veterinary staff, and other individuals to minimize their risk of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection by taking precautionary steps when working with animals such as poultry and livestock or materials possibly or confirmed to be infected.4Globally, there were 887 cases of human H5N1 infection—from January 1, 2003, to February 26, 2024—of which 52% were fatal, according to WHO.5 The H5N1 case in Texas is the United States’ first reported human infection of 2024. It is also the second human case to ever be confirmed in the US, with the previous infection occurring in 2022, in Colorado.4According to Kay Russo, DVM, MAHM, DACPV, an industry veterinarian, who has worked as a private dairy practitioner, WHO’s documented mortality rate may be higher than the actual mortality rate in humans because of a bias related to the severity of illness in those who sought care. However, she noted, we still need to have a healthy respect for what this virus is capable of. “The human cases in this current dairy situation are underrepresented due to a lack of testing,” Russo said in an interview with dvm360.Thus far, no human-to-human transmission has been reported. However, the UN and WHO addressed the issue while announcing updated language for consistency with airborne pathogen descriptions. The goal of the language changes is to increase international cooperation in the event of a new global pandemic, according to the UN.1Personal protectionThe CDC recommends minimizing the risk of human infection by avoiding unprotected direct or close physical contact with birds, livestock and other animals that are sick, as well as animal carcasses, feces or litter, and raw milk. Water and surfaces that could be contaminated with animal excretions should also be avoided.4Additionally, the CDC recommends that veterinarians, veterinary professionals, and other individuals working with sick or dead animals, including backyard bird flocks, or materials that could contain H5N1 wear personal protective equipment (PPE). After washing hands with soap and water, the agency suggests putting on PPE in the following order: fluid-resistant coveralls, waterproof apron, NIOSH-approved respirator, fitted unvented or indirectly vented safety googles or face shield, head or hair cover, gloves, and boots. Care should also be taken while working in PPE to avoid touching eyes, mouth and nose; and while removing and disposing of PPE to avoid personal contamination and contaminating clean areas.4Potential human therapiesIn Texas, potential vaccines, antiviral drugs, and antibody therapies that may protect humans against avian influenza are being studied. The nonprofit Texas Biomedical Research Institute (Texas Biomed) in San Antonio, recently announced its work targeting strains of the HPAI virus including H5N1.2"Thankfully, the risk of the current H5N1 case becoming widespread among people remains low," Larry Schlesinger, MD, Texas Biomed president and CEO, said in a news release.3 "But viruses adapt and evolve–especially influenza viruses–which is why it is so critical to be studying them and developing vaccines and treatments well before they are needed."In 2023, investigators at Texas Biomed received approval from the USDA and the CDC to pursue work on avian influenza. According to the institute, work on this initiative began in March—after laboratory preparations—to evaluate whether existing vaccine, antivirals and antibodies are effective against H5N1 strains of avian influenza.2Texas Biomed investigators are applying advanced tools and techniques that they use to study viruses like seasonal influenza and COVID-19, according to the institute. Their work takes place in a higher biosafety level laboratory, following protocols approved by federal biomedical research regulators.2"The genetic sequencing analysis from the CDC indicates that the H5N1 strain found in the [human] patient does not have any mutations associated with resistance to current antiviral drugs," Luis Martinez-Sobrido, PhD, a professor at Texas Biomed who leads the laboratory researching potential avian influenza therapies, said in the release.2 "However, it is important to continue developing an array of countermeasures in case existing ones lose effectiveness."TakeawaysOver the past century, there have been numerous epizootic events with avian-origin influenza viruses, according to Russo. “Influenza viruses, particularly influenza type A viruses, are concerning because of their ability to mutate, pick up virulence, and adapt to different hosts like humans, cows, and cats…We’re seeing unprecedented mortalities in avian and mammalian species, even in the waterfowl, which is considered the natural reservoir for these influenzas,” Russo said.Rare in humans, H5N1 has been spreading worldwide over the past few years through transmission from migratory birds to terrestrial and domestic birds. "We still don't know a lot about this virus, for example, what are the genetic determinants that enable this virus to transmit from avian hosts to other mammals?" Ahmed Elsayed, PhD, a staff scientist with Texas Biomend, who has studied avian influenza for 16 years, said in the release.2 "We need to study this virus as a 'One-Health' approach to be able to face it."Russo emphasized that early detection and intervention in the form of antivirals are critical to avoid any severe health outcomes from this virus. “Should this virus develop the ability to spread from human to human, [other] individuals living in the household of the infected individual may be at risk. Testing and proper follow-up are strongly encouraged by the CDC. All testing is anonymous,” Russo said.ReferencesPandemic experts express concern over avian influenza spread to humans.

What's going on? Is dairy safe?Emily DeLetter , Jeanine Santucci USA TODAYShow Caption Hide Caption Bird Flu alert issued by CDC after outbreakThe CDC is issuing a new health alert after recent bird flu outbreaks among cattle. It comes as officials say the risk to the public remains low.Fox - 26 HoustonFragments of the virus that causes bird flu have been found in samples of pasteurized milk, the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday, but officials aren't concerned about danger to humans from drinking store-bought milk at this time.Officials told reporters on Wednesday that the milk tested positive for presence of the virus, but the results do not indicate that the virus is currently infectious, as the pasteurization process works to inactivate viruses.The initial positive samples came from a limited number of tests done by researchers on milk at grocery stores. Federal agencies are now doing their own, more robust tests. The FDA said it is conducting further analysis on the positive samples, and is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state partners to investigate."To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe," Donald Prater, the acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the FDA, told reporters.On Wednesday, officials announced a new federal order that will require all dairy cattle to be tested for bird flu before being transported across state lines. Any cows that test positive will have to wait 30 days and retest before being moved, said administrator for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Michael Watson.The avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has recently infected herds of dairy cows in several states, including Texas, Kansas and Michigan. Herds in New Mexico and Idaho are presumed infected, officials said.Both the FDA and the USDA said the current commercial milk supply is safe because of the pasteurization process and the "diversion or destruction of milk from sick cows."The agency pledged to take the situation seriously and release results from multiple studies in the coming days or weeks.Can cats get bird flu? How to protect them and what else to know amid the outbreakWhat is bird flu?Avian influenza, or bird flu, is a disease that's caused by an avian influenza Type A virus infection, according to the CDC.The disease primarily spreads through contact with infected birds, which can infect their respiratory tract and intestines, according to the CDC. Infected birds can shed viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions and feces. Bird flu is very contagious among birds, and some of the viruses can sicken or kill certain domesticated species, including chickens, ducks and turkeys.Is anyone at risk from drinking milk?Pasteurized milk — which makes up 99% of milk produced on dairy farms and sold in stores — is treated to make sure any viruses in the milk are dead. Experts say drinking this kind of milk is safe, even if fragments of bird flu have been found in some samples.However, raw milk does not receive this treatment.Is raw milk safe to drink?The FDA says people should not drink raw milk. The agency also says the dairy industry shouldn't manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products, including cheese made with raw milk, from any cows showing symptoms of illness or exposed to other cows that have bird flu.How did virus fragments get into milk?While the pasteurization process is designed to make milk safe by inactivating viruses, it doesn't destroy the virus fragments."It's important to understand that fragments, such as genetic material, of those pathogens can still be found in pasteurized milk," Prater said. Still, "pasteurization is very likely to effectively inactivate heat-sensitive viruses, like H5N1 in milk from cows and other species."Officials said Wednesday that current studies on how effectively pasteurization kills off bird flu virus are underway, but the process has proven effective in similarly acting viruses for decades, and thermal inactivation has been successful at inactivating bird flu in eggs, which occurs at a lower temperature than in milk.The FDA and its partners are testing samples of milk from store shelves and conducting further analysis on any that show they have bird flu virus to ensure that the virus fragments are inactive, Prater said. Those results will be available in the coming days, he said.What is pasteurization?Named after the scientist Louis Pasteur, pasteurization is a treatment process that applies heat to liquids for short amounts of time, according to the Virginia Department of Health. The process destroys pathogenic microorganisms in some foods and beverages that can cause spoilage and prolongs storage time.Pasteurization was adopted by the FDA as a public health measure to kill dangerous bacteria and viruses, and largely eliminates the risk of getting sick from milk. In 1987, the FDA prohibited the interstate sale of raw, or unpasteurized milk.Can humans get bird flu?There have been a few cases of humans being infected with various strains of bird flu, usually through close contact with sick or dead animals. But experts say the risk to humans is currently low because the disease has not mutated to spread person-to-person.There have been two human cases in the U.S. tied to this strain of bird flu. Among them: On April 1, Texas health officials said a person became infected with bird flu after close contact with infected cows. The CDC said the only symptom reported by the patient was pink eye, or conjunctivitis.Public health officials told reporters that 23 people have been tested for bird flu during the current outbreak among cattle and 44 people are being actively monitored after suspected exposure.Officials say risk to public health remains low. The CDC says most cases in humans have occurred after a person had unprotected exposure to sick or dead infected animals. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said "we have not observed changes to the virus' genetic makeup that would suggest an enhanced the ability to spread to humans or among humans.""This is definitely an evolving situation," Dr. Diego Diel, director of Cornell University's virology laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which worked to sequence the virus, previously told USA TODAY. "Right now, I think the viruses that have been detected in cattle and in other animals in these farms don't contain any mutations that would indicate increased transmissibility or pathogenesis to humans."Contributing: Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY.

A top priority is tracking the virus’s spread. So far, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed H5N1, a subtype of the bird flu virus, in dairy cows on 34 farms across nine states, and in six cats on farms in three of those states.Advertisement Read moreHow prepared is the world for a pandemic of bird flu in people? Genetic sequencing found that only one of the 260 samples from sick dairy cows so far has a mutation indicating H5N1 has adapted to infecting mammals, said Rosemary Sifford at the USDA during the meeting. However, this marker has been seen before in other sick mammals, and it didn’t impact the ability of the virus to transmit between mammals. Plus, the other 10 samples from the same herd where this one was collected didn’t have the same mutation. “It very much remains an avian virus with no significant changes… In other words, it is not becoming a [cow] virus,” said Sifford.

Sign up to newsletter The CDC has tested 23 people with close contact to the animals for the virus, according to data presented at the meeting. Only one of them was positive – a dairy worker in Texas whose only symptom was eye redness. To boost testing capabilities, the CDC recently increased funding to genetic sequencing centres in six states, said Dugan. Another key measure being taken is ensuring the safety of the milk supply in the US. Milk from infected cattle contains high amounts of the virus. While milk from sick animals shouldn’t be entering the milk supply, initial testing from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that 1 in 5 milk samples contain genetic traces of bird flu. “Importantly, that doesn’t mean the samples contain intact, infective virus,” said Donald Prater at the FDA. The testing method used detects any genetic material, including that of dead virus. The vast majority of milk sold in the US is pasteurised, a process that kills pathogens with high heat. No study has assessed pasteurisation’s effectiveness against H5N1, but studies of similar influenza viruses suggest it would be, said Prater. This is why people should avoid consuming or touching raw milk products.

Initial testing by the CDC indicates both are effective in lab tests against the current strain in cattle, said Dugan. As part of a pre-established protocol, the US Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) is stockpiling materials for a bird flu vaccine, said David Boucher at ASPR in the meeting. This includes manufacturing the part of the vaccine, called the antigen, that mounts an immune response to the virus. ASPR and its commercial partners have already filled hundreds of thousands of vaccines for H5N1 that, if needed, can be quickly dispensed for clinical testing or emergency use, he said. “Based on the CDC’s current risk of the situation, vaccination is not a tool needed at this time. We do want to be ready if that changes, though,” said Boucher. Enough material is stockpiled to churn out an additional 10 million doses, too. And ASPR has contracts with vaccine manufacturers to ramp up production even more so if necessary. “If we need to pull any of these levers, we are ready to do so,” said Boucher.

Photo: Eugene LeeDr Wong Hoi-kei, an epidemiologist at the centre, told a radio show on Friday morning that Hong Kong had recorded 20 severe cases of flu in children, including two deaths, since the start of the influenza season.AdvertisementScientists say USDA is sharing too little data too slowly on H5N1 flu | CNN CNN values your feedback 1.

Scientists say the United States is not sharing enough data from its investigation into H5N1 bird flu in cattle and other mammals. J. David Ake/Getty Images CNN — When the US Department of Agriculture announced late Sunday that it had publicly posted new data from its investigation into a bird flu outbreak in cattle, scientists eagerly searched a well-known platform used globally to share the genetic sequences of viruses. The sequences weren’t there. As of Tuesday morning, they still aren’t. Researchers looking to track the evolution and spread of H5N1 say the information that was posted — raw data on a US server — isn’t very useful and is anything but transparent. They also say the government’s release of information in the outbreak, which was confirmed in cattle almost a month ago, has been painfully slow. After Sunday’s announcement by the USDA, Dr. Rick Bright, an immunologist and vaccine researcher who led the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority from 2016 to 2020, said he immediately called his contacts at the database, called the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, or GISAID, to make sure he wasn’t missing something. “I said ‘Look, just tell me: Do you have data?’ and they said ‘No,’” Bright said. The World Health Organization's Chief Scientist said Thursday he was concerned about the bird flu spreading through cows in the United States and called on the world to watch the virus more closely Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images Related article WHO chief scientist calls for increased monitoring and preparation for highly pathogenic bird flu After checking even parts of the database where people can post rough drafts of sequences prior to full public release, Dr. Lucas Freitas, a Brazilian data scientist who is the GISAID curation lead, confirmed there are no new sequences posted by the USDA since its announcement. “We wouldn’t miss it,” said Peter Bogner, founder and president of GISAID. “H5 is the reason GISAID came about to begin with. It raises antennas.” The highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1 has decimated bird populations around the world, and in recent years, has moved into a growing variety of mammals, raising concern that it’s a step closer to becoming a virus that can spread efficiently in people. When the USDA confirmed that H5N1 had been detected in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas on March 25, the news put infectious disease experts on alert, and they were eager to get more information to see how the virus had changed to target a new host. The USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, says H5N1 has now been found in 32 herds in eight states. But weeks have gone by, and little data on the US outbreak has been shared with the global scientific community. In its notice posted Sunday, APHIS said it had shared 239 genetic sequences from the H5N1 outbreak “from cattle, cats, chickens, skunk, racoon, grackle, blackbird, and goose.” The agency said it “routinely publishes” on GISAID, but in the interest of public transparency and “ensuring the scientific community has access to this information as quickly as possible …” it was “also rapidly sharing” sequences to a US database maintained by the National Library of Medicine. The announcement suggested to many scientists that the information would be found in GISAID, which has been critical to tracking the evolution of the virus that causes Covid-19 as it moves around the world. Many countries, including the United States, use GISAID to quickly share genetic sequences — the exact order of four chemical building blocks that make up the blueprints of each virus. Instead, the USDA uploaded raw sequencing data, called FASTQ files, to the National Library of Medicine database, which is available to the public. These FASTQ files, however, lack the critical information necessary to help scientists track the evolution of the virus, such as the exact date the sample was collected and what state it came from.

Cynthia Goldsmith/CDC Related article CDC confirms second reported case of bird flu in a person in the US Scientists do use raw data when tracking the evolution of a virus, but they also typically use it in concert with the type of information that is typically posted to GISAID: consensus sequences, known as FASTA files, which have been refined and cleared of contamination and mistakes. Consensus sequences typically give more information about where the sample was collected and when, helping researchers better understand how a virus is changing over time. Researchers say it’s not clear how recently the samples that are the basis for the raw data were taken. The only dates posted say “2024,” and the locations are only listed as “USA.” There’s no information on how the samples were obtained — whether they come from swabs of an animal’s respiratory tract its skin, or somewhere else. In response to emailed questions from CNN, Shilo Weir, a public affairs specialist for USDA, said the agency had posted the raw data to the US server in the interest of speed and said the agency would work quickly to get curated sequences to GISAID. “APHIS typically posts curated sequence data on the GISAID platform. However, in order to make sequence data public as soon as possible, APHIS uploaded these unanalyzed sequence data files to NCBI,” Weir wrote in the emailed response. “These sequences will not be curated before posting, but this approach will allow us the most rapid path to posting sequence information. APHIS will continue to work as quickly as possible to publish to GISAID curated files that incorporate and analyze relevant epidemiologic information along with the sequence data,” Weir said. It’s also not clear whether the latest release represents all the genomes the agency has. Dr. Michael Worobey, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, said the USDA was making a mistake by not sharing all the information it has as quickly as possible. “There’s a whole community around the world of people like me and my colleagues, who have a lot of experience with this and often can see things or do analyses that might show something that others have missed,” Worobey said. “You don’t want essentially one group to be the only ones looking at the data. You want everyone, all the experts around the world to be able to do that,” Worobey added. Dr. Tom Inglesby, who directs the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, said USDA’s public release of the raw data was a step in the right direction, but it didn’t go far enough.

What precautions to take during the bird flu outbreak “The additional information would be quite useful for the public and for scientists and public health agencies, research organizations to understand all of the data that has been collected so far, what farms have been tested, when they were tested, what the sampling strategy is, overall, what kind of testing is going on now, around the country,” he said. “Now that we know that there are asymptomatic cows that have tested positive, what’s the strategy to understand the extent to which cows are infected that don’t have symptoms in other herds? Because I think the most important objective here is to get a full picture of the outbreak.” Influenza viruses change quickly and have caused some of the most devastating pandemics throughout history. “What we’re seeing right now is chapter one of the book that keeps people like me and many infectious disease epidemiologists up at night,” said Dr. Michael Mina, who is chief scientific officer of the telehealth company eMed and an expert in the epidemiology, immunology and spread of infectious disease. The Covid pandemic was bad, but Mina said a pandemic caused by this virus could be worse. “The genie is not out of the bottle yet, and that’s a good thing,” Mina said, but given the potential consequences of letting the virus spread unchecked, “It’s a little bit hard to suggest we could be doing too much right now.” Scientists have followed H5N1 for roughly two decades as it ripped through populations of wild and domestic birds and more recently marine mammals like sea lions, but human-to-human spread after contact with animals has been sporadic and not sustained, suggesting the virus has not mutated enough to become a fully human pathogen. There’s been no evidence of person-to-person spread in the current US outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Humans have been infected after contact with animals, however — a chilling reminder that the virus still has us in its sights and requires close monitoring. “It’s so critical that the US government is being as transparent as they can right now, overly transparent, and sharing all of these sequences and all of this data so the world can look at it and make their own risk assessments and start making their own vaccine if they need to in their own countries instead of waiting for the United States to say what’s good and what’s bad,” said Bright, who is CEO of Bright Global Health in Washington, DC. “What would we say if this particular virus did get out of control?” Bright said. “Would we look back on this last two or three months and say: ‘I wish we would have done something else; I wish we would have been more transparent; I wish we would have shared all these sequences so the world can get ready for this?’” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Health Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

Making the situation worse, once the disease is detected, there is no effective treatment to combat it. PDF FILE INTRODUCTION The global poultry industry faces one of its most formidable challenges to date: The omnipresent presence of Avian Influenza or bird flu. This disease, caused by a type A influenza virus, has left in its wake a trail of significant economic losses due to the massive culling of infected birds. Making the situation worse, once the disease is detected, there is no effective treatment to combat it. Zucami’s technical team is at the forefront of the fight against this avian pandemic. See ZUCAMI POULTRY EQUIPMENT INTERNATIONAL Aware of the devastating impact that avian influenza has on the industry, we are committed to providing tools and advice that enable our customers to identify and understand this disease and implement effective preventive measures. Avian influenza affects birds worldwide, caused by various subtypes of the influenza A virus. This virus is characterized by its genetic variability, presenting a wide range of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes. However, within this diversity, two classifications stand out for their relevance: High pathogenic avian influenza virus. Low pathogenic avian influenza virus. Continue after advertising. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are of concern because of their ability to cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds. These viruses can cause rapidly devastating outbreaks in poultry populations, resulting in significant economic losses to producers. On the other hand, low pathogenic avian influenza viruses generally cause milder disease or may even go unnoticed. Although their direct impact may be less severe than that of their highly pathogenic counterparts, these viruses still pose a threat to the poultry industry, as they can serve as containers for genes that can combine with other influenza viruses such as human or swine influenza, giving rise to potentially dangerous new strains. But how can we prevent or manage it? Well, the prevention of avian influenza is crucial to protect poultry populations and avoid significant economic losses in the industry. Therefore, Zucami would like to provide our readers with some key points to keep in mind: 1. Rigorous Biosecurity Implementing adequate biosecurity measures at all stages of poultry production is critical. This includes limiting access of unauthorized persons to the facilities, the use of exclusive equipment and tools for each area, and regular disinfection of facilities and equipment. 2. Control of Bird Movements Restricting bird movements and preventing the entry of birds from areas with known outbreaks of avian influenza can help prevent the introduction and spread of the virus into poultry populations. 3. Epidemiological Surveillance: Establishing epidemiological surveillance programs to detect the presence of the disease in early stages is essential. 4. Vaccination In some regions, selective vaccination programs against specific strains of avian influenza can be implemented, especially in high-risk areas. However, it is important to remember that vaccination is not a substitute for other prevention and control measures. 5. Education and Training Training personnel in proper handling and biosecurity practices, as well as in the recognition of clinical signs of disease, can help prevent the spread of avian influenza within poultry facilities. 6. Collaboration and Coordination Working closely with health authorities, industry organizations and other relevant stakeholders can facilitate the coordination of efforts to prevent and control avian influenza outbreaks. In conclusion, avian influenza represents a constant threat to the global poultry industry. Early detection, implementation of rigorous biosecurity measures, epidemiological surveillance, vaccination, continuous education and collaboration with the different agencies in each country are fundamental to mitigate the risks associated with this disease. At Zucami, we are committed to providing our customers with the tools and knowledge necessary to meet this global challenge and protect the health and sustainability of their poultry operations.

Traces of the bird flu virus were found in some samples of pasteurized milk in the U.S. on Tuesday, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as the agency advises that the milk is safe to drink until further testing is performed.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), avian influenza or bird flu is a disease "caused by infection with avian influenza Type A viruses." These viruses can also naturally spread among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species.On Tuesday, the FDA said traces of the virus were found while testing samples of pasteurized milk using a testing method called PCR testing, which looks for traces of genetic material. The testing samples found inactive remnants of the bird flu virus, killed during the pasteurization process.However, the agency advised that a positive result does not mean that a live, infectious virus has been found.

Holstein cows are pictured at a large California dairy in San Joaquin Valley, California. Traces of the bird flu virus were found in some samples of pasteurized milk in the U.S. on Tuesday, according to the Food and Drug Administration, as the agency advises that the milk is safe to drink until further testing. More Ed Young /Design Pics Editorial/Universal Images Group/Getty Images "Based on available information, pasteurization is likely to inactivate the virus, however the process is not expected to remove the presence of viral particles. To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe," the agency said in a statement.Newsweek reached out to the FDA via email for comment on Tuesday night.While the agency maintains that the milk is safe to drink, it said it is still waiting on the results of additional studies to confirm.The FDA is undergoing the testing of egg and milk production to ensure that the supplies remain safe from the virus. According to the agency, results from multiple ongoing safety studies will be released in the "next few days to weeks."This comes weeks after a positive human case of the avian flu was identified at a Texas dairy farm.According to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) this month, a human case of avian influenza virus in the state was identified in someone who had direct exposure to dairy cattle presumed to be infected."The patient, who experienced eye inflammation as their only symptom, is being treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir," DSHS said in a statement.While it was only the second human case of H5N1 ever recorded in the country, there is no current evidence to suggest the virus is being spread among humans.However, the case sparked concern regarding the milk supply among cows.

In addition to pasteurization killing viruses and bacteria, dairy farms are legally required to only supply milk from healthy animals.The agency also said it recommends that milk producers take precautions when discarding milk from sick cows to prevent it from becoming a source of spread.

Image: Getty/Ray Orton WHO’s chief scientist has called for increased monitoring and preparedness as he warns the bird flu virus that's now affecting US dairy cows could start spreading ‘in different ways’. The World Health Organization (WHO) chief scientist Dr. Jeremy Farrar urged US public health authorities to closely investigate how the virus spreads and be ready to respond if it starts to transmit ‘in different ways’.Speaking from Geneva during WHO’s announcement of new measures to tackle airborne diseases last week, Dr. Farrar said: “H5N1 is an influenza infection, predominantly started in poultry and ducks and has spread effectively over the course of the last one or two years to become a global zoonotic – animal pandemic.“The great concern, of course, is that in doing so and infecting ducks and chickens – but now increasingly mammals – that that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans. And then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission.”So far, one human case and 28 cases of dairy cows with the virus have been reported across 8 US states since March 2024, when the first case emerged in Texas. Prior to this, no ruminants had ever been affected by bird flu in the US. A(H5N1), the current strain of the virus, has been circulating in the US since at least 2022 and had spread to other mammals such as racoons, skunks and foxes.It now also affects older, mid-lactation dairy cows, causing them to produce thick, colostrum-like milk or dry off completely. Veterinarians have reported that affected farms had recorded around 20% milk loss, though the disease is not fatal and most cows recover with supportive care within several weeks. Cow-to-cow transmission has not been ruled out, and farmers have been told to isolate sick animals from the rest of the herd if they notice any symptoms.Public health officials thought the initial spread was likely a spillover event from a nearby poultry farm, but farmers have been urged to increase their biosecurity measures as the authorities continue to investigate what leads to the spread.Dairy farmers have been ordered to divert milk from sick cows but can sell milk from cows that don’t show symptoms. The virus is destroyed during pasteurization, making commercially-sold milk in the US safe for consumption.US officials have said the virus hasn’t adapted better to spread to humans but finding out how and why it spreads among dairy cows should be priority, Dr. Farrar said, ‘because it may evolve into transmitting in different ways’.“Do the milking structures of cows create aerosols? Is it the environment which they’re living in? Is it the transport system that is spreading this around the country?” he asked. “This is a huge concern and I think we have to…make sure that if H5N1 did come across to humans with human-to-human transmission that we were in a position to immediately respond with access equitably to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.”H5N1 vaccine not ‘where we need to be’The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that changes were identified in the sample collected from the infected dairy farm worker when compared to the virus that affects cattle - but those changes were ‘minor’ and not linked to increased transmission to mammals or a resistance to treatment, the federal agency said.“The genome for the human isolate had one change…that is known to be associated with viral adaptation to mammalian hosts, and which has been detected before in people and other mammals infected with HPAI A(H5N1) virus and other avian influenza subtypes…,but with no evidence of onward spread among people,” the CDC said.“Further, there are no markers known to be associated with influenza antiviral resistance found in the virus sequences from the patient’s specimen and the virus is very closely related to two existing HPAI A(H5N1) candidate vaccine viruses that are already available to manufacturers, and which could be used to make vaccine if needed.”CDC added that due to the wide geographic spread of the virus and the increased likelihood of exposure for people, there could be an increase in so-called sporadic human infections from mammals and birds – but such infections would not currently change the agency’s risk assessment, which remains low for the general public.But this could change if the virus starts spreading from person to person; increase its spread from animals to people, or evolves genetically to better spread to people.US veterinarians now refer to the virus that affects dairy cows as bovine influenza A, to differentiate it from the disease that is highly pathogenic in birds.Human-to-human transmission of H5N1 is yet to be recorded in the current outbreak in the US, but the WHO chief scientist is concerned because the H5N1 strain has had an ‘extremely high’ mortality rate among the several hundred people known to have ben infected with it to date, he said. From 2003 to 2024, 889 cases and 463 deaths caused by H5N1 have been reported worldwide from 23 countries, according to the WHO; this is a fatality rate of 52%.On the potential H5N1 public health risk, Dr. Farrar cautioned that vaccine development was not ‘where we need to be’. Neither was it the case that regional offices and country offices and public health authorities around the world have the capability to diagnose H5N1, he noted.Meanwhile, WHO announced several new terms to describe airborne pathogens in a bid to increase international cooperation in the event of a new pandemic. These include ‘infectious respiratory particles’, or IRPs, which should be used instead of ‘aerosols’ and ‘droplets’ to avoid confusion.“It's a hugely important first step,” he said. “But next, we need to keep the disciplines, the experts together.“We're using the same terminology, the same language and now we need to do the science that provides the evidence on tuberculosis, on COVID and other respiratory pathogens so that we know how to control those infections better than we have done in the past.” Copyright - Unless otherwise stated all contents of this web site are © 2024 - William Reed Ltd - All Rights Reserved - Full details for the use of materials on this site can be found in the Terms & Conditions Related topics Regulation & safety Related news Show more USDA lowers egg production forecast amid bird flu outbreaks; higher egg prices to seep into 2025 Can hot weather stop the spread of bird flu in US dairy cattle?

POLITICO walks you through the main questions. | Douglas Magno/AFP via Getty Images April 27, 2024 1:00 am CET By Rory O’Neill Bird flu has jumped across to cows and is rapidly spreading through herds in the United States — and scientists are worried. Only four years since the start of the Covid pandemic, the unprecedented spread of a new strain of H5N1, or bird flu, among dairy cows in the U.S. is a reminder of our vulnerability to novel viral threats. Jeremy Farrar, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) chief scientist, said last week the risk of spillover to humans from the new strain was an “enormous concern.” Bird flu rarely infects humans but is often fatal when it does. According to the WHO, the case fatality rate among humans since 2003 stands at 52 percent. Advertisement Advertisement So just how worried should we be about this new type of bird flu in cows? POLITICO walks you through the main questions. Why are scientists so worried? The fact that the virus has turned up in mammals such as cows suggests the virus has mutated and brings it one step closer to infecting humans. Avian flu has been seen as a pandemic risk for decades but, as the name suggests, it has mainly affected birds. At the moment, EU countries are watching developments closely. | Jamie McDonald/Getty Images “The news confirms the capacity of flu to surprise us,” Paul Digard, a professor of virology and influenza specialist at the University of Edinburgh, told POLITICO. “Historically, we saw cows as being very low-risk for flu A (a subset of flu that causes sickness in humans and includes the virus now spreading in cattle). It ups the threat assessment a notch,” Digard added. How widespread is the new strain? It's likely wider than previously reported. “I believe the spread of infection will be far greater than the number of farms that’s been reported,” said James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge. Advertisement Advertisement The detection of viral RNA in milk indicates the disease is more widespread than previously thought, Wood explained. As of Thursday in the U.S., around one in five retail milk samples tested positive for viral fragments. Is this milk safe to drink? Viral particles have been detected in commercial milk in the U.S. but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s unsafe to drink. Pasteurization is effective at killing influenza and U.S. authorities have said there is no evidence the RNA particles detected in milk are able to infect anyone. U.S. federal agencies (USDA, USFDA, CDC) have reiterated that “the commercial milk supply is safe.” How worried should we be about this new type of bird flu in cows? | Graeme Robertson/Getty Images They also add that pasteurization is “likely” to inactivate the avian flu virus in milk while acknowledging that “no studies on the effects of pasteurization on [highly pathogenic avian influenza] viruses (such as H5N1) in bovine milk have previously been completed.” The detection of viral RNA in U.S. milk probably isn’t of much concern for Europe. EU imports of milk from the U.S. are “very close to zero” and “statistically insignificant in terms of trade,” an EU official told POLITICO. Advertisement Advertisement What’s the risk of the new strain to humans? So far, the risk to people is limited, but there’s a lot we don’t know about the strain since it is so new. There has been at least one human case of the new strain but there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, a key pandemic threat marker. The danger is that the virus mutates further and eventually develops the ability to infect humans more easily. The more widespread the virus is among animals, the more opportunities it has to do exactly that. Has the new strain been detected in Europe? At the moment, EU countries are watching developments closely. “The infections of dairy cattle in the U.S. are with a strain of H5N1 that has not been detected in Europe. We are closely monitoring the situation and its possible evolution,” a spokesperson for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) told POLITICO. A spokesperson for the European Commission added that it was carefully tracking any genetic evolution of the virus but that the threat to human health remained low for the general public. Advertisement Advertisement Digard, meanwhile, says it would be wise to check dairy herds in the U.K. for the new strain even though there’s no evidence yet it has escaped North America. In the EU, EFSA has advised increased surveillance in mammals, especially in those near bird flu-affected poultry establishments. Do we have vaccines against bird flu? There are vaccines that could work against bird flu, but it’s still unclear how effective they would be versus a particular strain and how quickly companies could ramp up production. A GSK spokesperson told POLITICO the company has a contract with the EU’s Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority to produce 85 million doses of its pandemic preparedness vaccine, Adjupanrix, if needed. Adjupanrix is a "mock-up" flu vaccine that could be adapted to whatever influenza strain emerges as the cause of a pandemic. A spokesperson for the European Commission, meanwhile, confirmed it had a joint contract with GSK and CSL Seqirus for the companies to deliver adapted flu vaccines if needed in a pandemic. A spokesperson for CSL Seqirus, told POLITICO that the company's zoonotic flu vaccine would likely protect against the strain currently circulating in the U.S. The European Medicines Agency has also approved AstraZeneca’s pandemic flu vaccine, which was tested using a strain of H5N1.

Previous studies have used genome sequence data to suggest that transmission bottlenecks for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 involve few viral particles, but the general principles of virus transmission are not fully understood. Here we show that, across a broad range of circumstances, tight transmission bottlenecks are a simple consequence of the physical process of airborne viral transmission. We use mathematical modelling to describe the physical process of the emission and inhalation of infectious particles, deriving the result that that the great majority of transmission bottlenecks involve few viral particles. While exceptions to this rule exist, the circumstances needed to create these exceptions are likely very rare. We thus provide a physical explanation for previous inferences of bottleneck size, while predicting that tight transmission bottlenecks prevail more generally in respiratory virus transmission.

Early in the pandemic, the mechanism of viral transmission was a matter of controversy, with a claim that transmission occurred either via contact or by the short-range spread of emitted droplets omitting the potential for longer-range airborne transmission1. Subsequent work highlighted the importance of aerosolised particles in causing long-range airborne transmission2 while downplaying the importance of contact-driven events3.Studies of the risk of transmission examined the relationship between transmission and the environment, with for example higher rates of transmission being found in household compared to workplace environments4. Quantitative models were developed, assessing the risk of infection in a different scenarios5,6,7,8, modelling the relationship between risk and exposure time9, and explaining the role of masks in preventing viral spread10. CO2 monitoring was suggested as a means to evaluate the immediate risk of transmission11.While risk calculations consider whether a person might be infected, evolutionary biology poses a different question: If a person was infected, how many viruses initiate that infection? This number of viruses, denoted the transmission bottleneck12, has important consequences for virus evolution: The tighter the bottleneck, and the fewer particles get through, the less genetic diversity will be transmitted between individuals. The absence of initial diversity can limit the potential for within-host evolution, as variants need to be generated de novo before evolutionary changes can take effect13.Studies of genomic data have suggested that for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection, the transmission bottleneck generally involves few viral particles14,15,16,17, with potentially a single virus initiating infection. Different genomic approaches have been applied to this question. In animal models, barcoded viruses allow for a straightforward count of the number of viruses initiating infection18. Where barcoding is not possible, deep sequencing of a viral population has been used to assess the appearance or non-appearance of minor variants following the bottleneck19 or to evaluate changes in variant frequencies during the transmission process20,21,22,23. Genomic studies have some limitations. Collecting genomic data from individuals is time-consuming and expensive, while the results of such studies may reflect only the specific circumstances of the individuals involved. The estimation process itself requires some care: the false identification of variants has the potential to inflate the estimated bottleneck size24,25. Errors in identifying who infected who could also potentially distort results.We here take an alternative approach to estimating respiratory virus transmission bottleneck sizes. Rather than considering only specific circumstances or data, we outline a general solution, exploiting knowledge of the physical processes underlying viral transmission26,27 to build a physical model of virus transmission. Within this model, we exploit knowledge from an extensive past literature28. Coughing, speaking and sneezing have been shown to emit broad and distinct distributions of particle sizes29,30,31. Emitted particles are affected by evaporation, sedimentation and diffusion32. Ventilation reduces the mean concentration of particles in the air, while in the absence of immediately finding a new host, viruses in emitted particles begin to decay33. Combining insights from this literature, we assess the expected transmission bottleneck for infections that occur under a variety of scenarios. Our results provide a strong indication, independent of genome sequence data, that most cases of respiratory virus transmission will involve a tight population bottleneck.ResultsConstant levels of exposureA simple model, based upon a Wells-Riley model of exposure, suggested that transmission bottlenecks arising from exposure to a respiratory virus are likely to be tight (Fig. 1). We made the simplifying assumptions that all individuals in an environment receive the same level of viral exposure and that viruses cause infection independently of one another. Under these assumptions, bottleneck sizes are small unless a very large proportion of individuals present in an environment are infected. The Skagit choir superspreading event was an extreme case early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic whereby between 32 and 52 of 61 people present at a choir rehearsal were infected34. Even in this extreme case, our model predicted that between 33% and 75% of cases of infection were initiated by a single viral particle, with more than 99% of cases being initiated by fewer than 10 viruses.Fig. 1: Transmission bottleneck estimates under a Wells-Riley model of exposure.In this model, the level of exposure describes the rate parameter of a Poisson model, such that a person receiving an exposure of 1 would expect to be infected by one virus. a The probability of an individual being infected given the level of exposure. b The proportion of cases of infection in which a single virus initiates infection. c The proportion of cases of infection in which ten or fewer viruses initiate infection. The vertical grey bar provides an estimate of circumstances at the Skagit Choir superspreading event, characterised by the probability of infection. Even under these circumstances, the model suggests that transmission bottlenecks are likely to be small.Full size imageVariable levels of exposureMore complex models of exposure produced similar results, suggesting that the transmission bottlenecks produced by respiratory infection are generally tight. A straightforward approach to expanding our initial model is to incorporate overdispersion into the exposure levels; this did not substantially change the results obtained (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Note 1). To achieve a more realistic estimate of the extent to which exposures vary, we implemented a physical model of virus transmission. Our model describes the emission by an infected individual of virus-containing particles with a distribution of sizes, by default modelling a process of coughing. Emitted particles may contain more than one virus, according to their size. Particles are subject to evaporation and spread through the air by diffusion. They are lost from the air due to ventilation and sedimentation. Viruses within particles are inactivated over time (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2: Method for simulating transmission events.a A computational model described the emission and subsequent dynamics of virus-containing particles following a single cough. We modelled the diffusion of particles of different sizes through space and time, accounting for evaporation, sedimentation, ventilation, and the inactivation of viruses within infectious particles. Our model describes the time- and location-dependent concentration of infectious material within an environment. b Our model facilitates the calculation of the cumulative volume of infectious material that we would expect for different individuals in an environment. Specifying an effective viral load, or alternatively the parameter Renv, which describes the expected number of infections to occur within an environment, generates viral exposures, which describe the expected number of infectious viruses that initiate infection within each person: The outcome of exposure, whether infection or non-infection, is characterised by this viral exposure.Full size imageLevels of physical exposure were calculated based on estimated inhalation rates and then converted into viral exposures (Fig. 2b). Our model describes an effective viral load, defined as the number of viruses per ml of emitted material that initiate infection, having overcome the various barriers, whether physical or immunological, to achieve this. The effective viral load is by nature smaller than the absolute number of viruses contained within an emitted particle: One study has estimated the proportion of emitted SARS-CoV-2 viruses that are viable (measured experimentally via plaque- or focus-formation in cells facilitating infection) as roughly 1 in 300035. Plaque formation is likely a necessary requirement for a virus to cause infection but may not be sufficient: A virus that would form a plaque under laboratory conditions might not be able to cause infection in a host.Applied to four different environments and run under default parameters, our model suggested that respiratory viral infection arising following coughing is associated with a tight transmission bottleneck. Clear environmental impacts upon exposure were evident, with the highest exposure occurring at close proximity in the poorly ventilated lounge. In the bus, a very broad distribution of exposures was found, with the simulated absorption of particles by the sides of the bus leading to low exposures far from the infected person (Supplementary Fig. 2). Transmission bottlenecks were not universally tight: One of the multiple simulations we generated describing the nightclub environment included a case where 391 viruses initiated infection. However, in all the environments and under our default parameters, more than 98% of transmission events were predicted to involve ten or fewer viruses, with the majority of cases of infection being initiated by a single viral particle (Fig. 3).Fig. 3: Bottleneck size distributions calculated for different scenarios.Maps show the layouts of different environments. A red dot indicates the location of an infected person, with the red arrow showing the direction in which emissions occur. A white dot indicates the location of an uninfected person. In our model, individuals were assumed to remain stationary. Furniture did not affect the model and is shown for purely illustrative reasons. Data show the room dimensions. Ventilation levels are described by the number of air changes per hour (ACH). The value Renv describes the expected number of people infected in an environment during the modelled time of exposure. Bottleneck size distributions show empirical probabilities calculated from an ensemble of 106 simulations generated for each environment.Full size imageThe outputs from our model include a parameter, Renv, describing the expected number of cases of infection occurring in each environment. This parameter is akin to the common epidemiological parameter R0. Where R0 describes the expected total number of infections caused by an infected individual during the entire course of an infection in the absence of population immunity36, Renv describes the expected number of infections caused by an infected individual in a specific environment, given the number of uninfected individuals present, their relative positions, the length of time spent in that environment, and the prevailing environmental conditions. Under our default parameters, these numbers were generally small, ranging from 0.058 in the bus to 0.271 in the nightclub, reflecting the limited time modelled in each scenario. The value of 0.067 in the office environment is a feature of our default model, calculated from the R0 value of the original Wuhan strain SARS-CoV-2 virus (see Supplementary Methods 1). Keeping the level of physical exposure constant, an increase in the effective viral load leads to an increase in Renv.Large bottlenecks at very high effective viral loadUnder our default model, tight transmission bottlenecks were inferred to dominate in all but exceptionally high values of the effective viral load (Fig. 4a, b). Most transmission events involved 10 or fewer viral particles unless the effective viral load was greater than 109.2 per ml. This value is greatly in excess of an estimated upper bound for the number of plaque-forming units at peak viral load during SARS-CoV-2 infection35. At this concentration, high transmission bottlenecks occur following the inhalation of even a single emitted particle: A particle of radius 10 μm would be expected to contain more than 6 effective viruses.Fig. 4: Inferred statistics of transmission bottleneck sizes given changes in the effective viral load.Statistics were calculated from an ensemble of 106 simulations for each combination of environment and effective viral load. Lines connect points calculated at different viral loads. The dashed vertical black line shows the mean number of plaque-forming units at the peak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the grey shaded area shows a 95% confidence interval for this statistic35. The solid vertical black line shows the effective viral load as specified in the default parameters of our model. Statistics are shown describing (a). The proportion of transmissions with bottleneck size 1. b The proportion of transmissions with bottleneck size 10 or less. c The expected number of people infected in each environment, Renv. Horizontal dashed lines in this figure indicate limit values for each environment, as would occur given a theoretically infinite effective viral load.Full size imageIn most of the environments we simulated, one person coughing was not sufficient for everyone present to inhale a single emitted particle. As such, not everyone in the environment was infected, even at extremely high simulated effective viral loads (Fig. 4c). Alternative models described higher levels of particle emission. For example, a model of continuous, uninterrupted speech, while allowing for asymptomatic transmission, generated higher volumes of particles than did coughing. Increased volume excepted patterns of physical exposure from speaking were similar to those derived from coughing (Supplementary Fig. 3). The increased volume emitted led to an increase in the values of Renv in each environment. Compared to the coughing model, a decrease in the proportion of infections initiated by a single viral particle was inferred for the lounge environment, but otherwise, results were very similar (Supplementary Fig. 4). Most transmission events still involved 10 or fewer viral particles unless the effective viral load was greater than 108 per ml, again substantially above published estimates for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Supplementary Fig. 5).Large bottlenecks during extreme superspreadingModelling identified a second scenario in which larger bottlenecks could prevail. If a highly effective viral load is combined with a very large volume of infectious material is emitted, most infections are initiated by more than 10 viral particles. We generated variants of the coughing model in which the volume of particles emitted was arbitrarily increased. At exceptionally high volumes of emission, the need for individuals present to inhale an emitted particle is no longer a consideration; nearly everyone present receives some physical exposure. This implies that, above a threshold effective viral load, everyone is likely to be infected, while at some higher threshold effective viral load, everyone is likely to be infected by more than 10 viral particles. The exact values of thresholds were environment-dependent, being affected by the distribution of physical exposures.With a 1000-fold increase in emission volume, simulation data suggested that most infections in the office environment were likely to be initiated by more than 10 viral particles if the effective viral load was in excess of 107.5 per ml (Fig. 5). At this threshold Renv was close to the hypothetical maximum value of 8, such that everyone present was highly likely to be infected. For the nightclub, a threshold effective viral load implied a Renv value close to 100. Our lounge environment was designed to maximise physical exposure, with a single individual being in prolonged short-range proximity to an infected individual in an environment characterised by poor ventilation. At 1000-fold increased emission volume, most infections in the lounge were likely to be initiated by more than 10 viral particles at an effective viral load of close to 106, still high but within biological plausibility. In the bus the high level of variation in physical exposure levels meant that 1000-fold increased emissions were still not sufficient to infect everyone present.Fig. 5: Effect of increasing the volume of particles emitted upon the expected number of individuals infected and upon transmission bottleneck statistics.Data show outputs from a model of coughing with increased emission volume. Bottleneck sizes were calculated from an ensemble of 106 simulations for each combination of environment, volume emitted, and effective viral load. Where environments contained multiple uninfected people, increases in the volume of particles emitted led to substantial increases in the number of people infected. However, at all but the highest viral loads, most transmission bottlenecks still involved few viral particles.Full size imageThis high-emission, high-viral load scenario represents exposure to overwhelming numbers of viruses. The identification of superspreading events early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic37,38 suggests that such a scenario could be biologically plausible. Behaviours such as singing or shouting would generate higher volumes of emission than our model of speech39. However, basic epidemiology suggests that these events are rare: the single-figure values of R0 associated with most respiratory viruses are not compatible with a situation in which infected people transmit the disease to the majority of their contacts.ConclusionsConcluding our analysis, we note that individual cases of transmission involving multiple viral particles may arise under unspectacular circumstances: In our default model between 1 and 3% of transmissions involved more than 10 viruses. However, a scenario in which the majority of transmission events involve more than 10 viruses is unlikely, requiring a very high effective viral load, possibly combined with abnormally high levels of particle emission. Our model is parameterised in a way that is consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection but is not specific to that virus. Where a virus is spread by respiratory transmission, if R0 is not exceptionally high, the physical process of airborne transmission will lead to mostly tight transmission bottlenecks.Our model may be elaborated in a variety of ways, considering, for example, the movement of people within an environment, emissions via sneezing, changes in ventilation levels, or variable levels of infectivity. None of these changes produced substantial changes in our basic results. Details are given in Supplementary Note 2.DiscussionWe have here applied two distinct modelling approaches to consider the transmission bottleneck sizes generated by respiratory viral transmission. In a first, highly simplified approach, we showed that, in a case where all exposed individuals receive an equal level of exposure, the Poisson assumption underlying the Wells-Riley model implies that the great majority of transmission events involve a small number of viral particles, even in cases where a high proportion of individuals present are infected. We next considered a more complex, though still approximate method, in which different individuals received different exposures, calculated from a physical model describing particle emission and spread. In this latter model, we identified that the airborne transmission of viruses is dominated by tight transmission bottlenecks in all but two cases. Firstly, if the effective viral load is sufficiently high, the inhalation of a single emitted particle will result infection by several viruses so that transmission bottlenecks will be high irrespective of the level of exposure. Secondly, where the effective viral load and the volume of emitted particles are both very high, most cases of infection will again involve large numbers of viruses; this latter case is associated with a high proportion of individuals present being infected. We believe that each of these two cases represents rare circumstances. In the former case, the effective viral load needed is greatly in excess of a published estimate of the number of plaque-forming units of SARS-CoV-2 at peak infection. In the second case, the very large number of infections generated by transmission is so high as to imply either that these circumstances are very unusual or that the virus has an extremely high value of Renv and, therefore, of R0.The results of our model are consistent with previous studies of transmission bottlenecks that have used viral genome sequence data. For example, a study of influenza virus transmission suggested that between 28 and 31 (73–82%) of a set of 38 transmission events were likely to have been founded by a single virus15,40: Under default parameters, our model produced similar results.Our approach is distinct from previous work in that, not relying upon genomic data describing any particular virus or circumstance, our result is a general one. In this sense, our work is predictive: If there were to be an outbreak of a novel virus spreading by airborne transmission, our model suggests that the transmission of that virus would be characterised by tight transmission bottlenecks.While our model of particle spread captures the basic features of respiratory virus transmission, it still makes multiple simplifications. For example, our model neglects effects arising from convection currents caused by individuals in a room41. Effects such as these have the potential to generate non-monotonic levels of exposure with distance from an infected person, as particles are carried up and across the ceiling before falling to a height at which they can be breathed in. Our model also neglects the effects of local humidity on particle spread42, as well as any detailed description of ventilation, such as the placement of windows, ceiling vents, and air conditioning units. Such effects are likely to have a distorting effect on the patterns of exposure we identify, potentially enhancing disparities in exposure. The potential effects of a highly skewed exposure distribution are represented by our simulated bus environment where the long and thin shape of the bus leads to extreme disparities in exposure (Supplementary Fig. 2). These disparities place an effective ceiling on Renv (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 5), with some people out of reach of emitted particles. The transmission bottlenecks we inferred for the bus were not substantially distinct from those of other environments.The simplifications involved in our model limit direct comparison with real-world scenarios. A recent publication suggested an infection risk of slightly under 10% for individuals in the most risky scenarios after 8 h of exposure43, which compares to 18.7% or 74.9% in our default lounge models of coughing and continuous speech: As discussed in Supplementary Methods 1, our default parameters likely overestimate the effective viral load in a realistic situation. We note that a complete accounting for transmission would require an account of the precise distributions of emissions, viral load, and time-dependent proximity between individuals, alongside environmental parameters and a detailed description of human behaviour.One area of uncertainty relevant to our model is the relationship between the raw numbers of viral particles contained in emitted material, the number of plaque-forming units (PFU) this represents, and the true effective viral load. The raw number of viruses in emitted material, known as the viral load, follows a pattern of growth and then decay during the course of infection, which in SARS-CoV-2 infection reach a peak potentially of 1010 viruses per ml44. In our default model, we have used parameters from one study describing SARS-CoV-2 infection, which suggest a 3000-fold ratio between the raw number of viruses and the number of PFUs35, further assuming a 1:1 ratio between PFUs and the effective viral load. We note considerable variation in the literature on this ratio. Experimental work has suggested a strain-dependent ratio between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and focus-forming units, a measure in some ways similar to PFU, of between 104:1 and 106:145, while a challenge study of SARS-CoV-2 infection estimated close to a 105:1 ratio46. The relationship between PFU and the TCID50, the dose needed to initiate infection in 50% of individuals, is a topic of some controversy, with a review of the subject identifying estimates spanning several orders of magnitude, from 1.26 to 7 × 106.25 PFU47. Modelling studies have attempted to estimate directly the ratio between raw and effective viral loads, with a study of super spreading events concluding on the basis of a Wells-Riley model suggesting a ratio of between 2000:1 and 300:148. If we assume that the ability to form plaques under favourable experimental conditions is a necessary condition for a virus to cause infection in a host, and we allow for flexibility given the assumptions underlying modelling studies, our 3000:1 ratio is likely at the conservative end of the spectrum. Studies of viral load in other respiratory viruses show similar values to SARS-CoV-2. Data from infections with parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus show peak PFU levels around 106/ml49,50. Studies of influenza show mixed results, with peak PFU values often between 104 and 106/ml but with occasional cases potentially reaching 109 PFU/ml51. An interesting case is that of measles infection: The very high reported R0 for this virus52 makes this a potential case where transmission bottlenecks in unvaccinated individuals may be higher.Uncertainty in the literature also exists around the precise distributions of particle sizes emitted via coughing, speaking and sneezing. While our method exploits experimental results, studies of these processes have historically used different methods and are not in perfect agreement. While we would not be confident about building a combined model of particle emission, combining, for example, speaking and sneezing, the finding that our basic result holds across such distinct models supports the robustness of our conclusions.A final simplification in our model is the neglect of interactions between viruses, which could increase or decrease bottleneck sizes. Some interactions, such as those characterised by superinfection exclusion, are likely to reduce the number of cases of large transmission bottlenecks. In many cases of acute respiratory infection, a virus-founding infection leads to the rapid growth of viral particles53, such that after a given amount of time, any subsequent infection will involve the addition of a tiny fraction of the current within-host population. This, alongside the triggering of innate host immune responses54 and other cellular interactions55, limits the window of time available for new viruses to infect a host. Other interactions between viruses involving cooperation have the potential to increase the proportion of bottlenecks involving multiple virions56. Where single virions contain incomplete functional genomes, more than one may be required for a cell to produce a complete genome57,58. A consideration of viruses with incomplete genomes would require a more nuanced definition of what is meant by a transmission bottleneck.Despite its limitations, the generalisability of our model and the reproducibility of our result across a broad range of scenarios provide what we believe is a compelling explanation for past observations of tight transmission bottlenecks in respiratory virus transmission. Where the number of cases of infection in a scenario is limited, as represented by a moderate value of Renv, most people exposed to an infected person are not themselves infected, incurring an effective transmission bottleneck of zero. Where infectious particles spread through the air via diffusion, it is difficult to generate patterns of exposure that combine cases of non-infection with cases of infection that exclusively involve large bottlenecks. The mechanism of airborne respiratory virus transmission leads to tight transmission bottlenecks.MethodsWells-Riley modelThe Wells-Riley model adopts a Poisson assumption about infection. Suppose that a person receives a level of exposure E, by which we mean that the expected number of viruses causing an infection is equal to E. Then the probability of an individual being infected is given by$$P\left({{\mbox{infection}}}\right)=1-{{\rm {e}}}^{-E}$$ (1) While the derivation of E can be complex, involving multiple individual and environmental factors, we here simply considered a range of possible values for this statistic.We denote the population bottleneck at transmission by N. Given a Poisson model, the proportion of cases of infection initiated by a single viral particle is given by$$P\left(N=1\right)=\frac{E{{\rm {e}}}^{-E}}{1-{{\rm {e}}}^{-E}}$$ (2) Similarly, the proportion of cases of infection initiated by ten or fewer viral particles is$$P\left(N\le 10\right)=\frac{{\sum }_{k=1}^{10}\frac{{E}^{k}{{\rm {e}}}^{-E}}{k!}}{1-{{\rm {e}}}^{-E}}$$ (3) These formulas were used to estimate transmission bottlenecks under different levels of exposure.Transmission mediated by the airborne spread of infectious particlesIn order to estimate how exposures to a virus might vary in a given environment, we built a model of the airborne spread of viruses within a room. Considering the first instance SARS-CoV-2 infection, we modelled the behaviour of particles emitted by an infected individual with a cough, measuring the subsequent exposure of others in the room.Considering a single coughing event, we estimated for each environment the exposure E(x,r), describing the volume of emitted infectious material comprised of emitted particles of radius r to which an uninfected person at position x = {x,y} would be exposed over a period of time. This expression was calculated by a process of summation: We generated an expression for the time-dependent exposure EC(x,r,t), occurring t seconds after a single cough, and then summed over time and coughing events.Diffusion modelTo calculate EC(x,r,t), we estimated the concentration of infectious material contained in particles of radius r μm at x = {x,y} and time t following a single emission event. This concentration is altered by the emission of infectious particles into the environment, the spread of particles through space, the loss of particles via evacuation and sedimentation, and the inactivation of viruses contained within particles. We write$$\begin{array}{c}\frac{\partial {{{{\rm{c}}}}}}{\partial {{{{\rm{t}}}}}}=\overbrace{I(x,t)}^{{{{{{\rm{Particle}}}}}}\,{{{{{\rm{emission}}}}}}}+\underbrace{K(L,Y)\left(\frac{{{\partial }^{2}}{{{{{\rm{c}}}}}}}{\partial {{{{{{{\rm{x}}}}}}}^{2}}}+\frac{{{\partial }^{2}}{{{{{\rm{c}}}}}}}{\partial {{{{{{{\rm{y}}}}}}}^{2}}}\right)}_{{{{{{\rm{Turbulent}}}}}}\,{{{{{\rm{diffusion}}}}}}}-\overbrace{{B}({r},{{{{{\rm{c}}}}}},{{{{{\rm{\gamma }}}}}})}^{{{{{{\rm{Evacuation}}}}}}}-\underbrace{S(r,c)}_{{{{{{\rm{Sedimentation}}}}}}}-\overbrace{D(c)}^{{{{{{\rm{Inactivation}}}}}}}\end{array}$$ (4) We consider the parts of this equation in turn.Emission of infectious particlesCoughing leads to the emission of a distribution of particle sizes: This distribution has been studied via a range of experimental means29,59. Following this literature, we modelled particles emitted from a cough as following a lognormal distribution30. We simulated particles with radii r ∈ {1, 2, …, 500} μm, with particles being emitted in quantities proportional to the function$$f\left(r\right)=Q\left(2r,u,s\right)-Q\left(2\left(r-1\right),u,s\right)$$ (5) where Q is the cumulative distribution function of the lognormal distribution$$Q\left(d,\, u, \, s\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left[1+{{{{{\rm{erf}}}}}}\left(\frac{{{{{\mathrm{ln}}}}}\,d-u}{s\sqrt{2}}\right)\right]$$ (6) with the parameters u = 2.60269 and s = 0.69314760. We assumed that the infected person coughed 10 times per hour at regular intervals61.The velocity of particles following a cough falls rapidly, within a fraction of a second62. We, therefore, described a cough as instantaneously creating a cloud of particles at mean radial distance of 20 cm from the infected person (standard deviation 5 cm) and with a spread angle 45%63. By default, the volume of liquid emitted from a cough was set to equal 38 pl64. Altering the initial mean radial distance of the cloud of particles had only a small impact on exposure levels (Supplementary Fig. S6).We also investigated models of particle emission by coughing and sneezing. Descriptions of these models, and further details of the emission model, are provided in Supplementary Information.EvaporationEmitted particles evaporate over time, the removal of liquid leaving behind a smaller solid particle with a radius of approximately one-quarter of that which was emitted65,66,67. This process occurs relatively quickly, with, for example, a droplet of size 20 μm evaporating in under a second67 and a droplet of size 55 μm evaporating within an estimated 14.5 s68. Given the overall timescale of our model, we assumed that the process of evaporation is short, such that a particle of radius r0 was, upon emission, instantaneously reduced to the new size r = r0/4. In the following description, we refer to particles according to their radius at the time of emission.Turbulent diffusionOnce emitted, particles spread through the air via diffusion. Both Brownian motion and air turbulence potentially contribute to this, though at the size of particles we consider, it is likely that turbulent diffusion will dominate over Brownian motion69; our model therefore neglected the effects of Brownian motion.The extent of turbulent diffusion depends upon how well a room is ventilated, with more frequent replacement of the air in a room, or a larger room, each requiring a higher mean rate of particle movement. We adopted a model based on the experimental measurement of air in a domestic environment70. This approach defined a characteristic length scale for a room by$$L=\root 3 \of{{XYZ}}=\root 3 \of{V}$$ (7) where V is the volume of the room in m3. Our model then links K, the turbulent diffusion coefficient, to L, and γ, the number of changes of the air in a room per hour:$$\frac{K}{{L}^{2}}=0.52\gamma+0.31{h}^{-1}$$ (8) Within our model, this becomes$$K\left(L,\gamma \right)=\left(0.52\gamma+0.31\right){L}^{2}$$ (9) EvacuationWe interpret the air change rate γ using the cutoff radius theory presented by Bazant et al.6. Under this model, the evacuation rate is the same as the air replacement rate for droplets below a cutoff radius given by$${r}_{c}=\sqrt{\frac{9\gamma L{\mu }_{{\rm {a}}}}{2g\Delta \rho }}$$ (10) where μa is the dynamic viscosity of air, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and Δρ is the difference in densities between water and air. Above the cutoff radius, the evacuation rate scales with 12, with heavier particles being less subject to air movement. Where$${r}_{*}=\max \left\{r,{r}_{{\rm {c}}}\right\}$$ (11) we have$$B\left(r,c\right)=-\gamma {\left(\frac{{r}_{{\rm {c}}}}{{r}_{*}}\right)}^{2}c$$ (12) SedimentationEmitted particles will be affected by gravity, with heavier particles falling to the floor more quickly than lighter particles, according to Stokes’ Law. In our model we approximated this process by the simple removal of particles from the air over time. We followed a previous approach, which balanced diffusion and gravitational terms to approximate the time taken for a particle to fall to the ground68. We have$${t}_{{{\rm {sed}}}}=\phi \frac{{z}_{0}}{{r}^{2}}$$ (13) where z0 is the initial height of the particle, r is the particle radius, and ϕ is calculated as 0.85 ×10−8 ms. From this, we derived the sedimentation term$$S\left(r,c\right)=\frac{c}{{t}_{{{\rm {sed}}}}}$$ (14) The initial height of particles z0 was defined according to whether individuals in an environment were standing or seated. We made the assumption that the floor absorbs particles, with no rebound being possible.Virus inactivationViruses within emitted particles are intrinsically unstable, such that the number of infectious particles in each droplet decays over time. An experimental study has suggested a half-life for SARS-CoV-2 of around 1.1 h33. The viral titre in each droplet is therefore given by$$N\left(t\right)={N}_{0}{{\rm {e}}}^{-\lambda t}$$ (15) where N0 is the initial number of particles in the droplet and λ is the decay constant. To model a half-life of 1.1 h, we set λ = 0.6301 h−1. We then have$$D\left(c\right)=-\lambda c$$ (16) Solution of the diffusion equationBy default, we made the assumption that, upon hitting a wall, particles are absorbed, either impacting upon the wall due to electrostatic or inertial forces71 or being caught in downward convection currents leading to their deposition on the floor41. By means of a sensitivity analysis, we also considered the case in which walls perfectly reflected particles. Under each of these conditions, the solution of Eq. (4) can be expressed analytically. Notes on the solution of the diffusion equation are provided in Supplementary Information.Calculating individual exposuresWe generated values c(x,r,t) at time intervals of one second for a period of one hour following each emission event. The initial values c(x,r,0) were scaled so that the total volume, summed across particle sizes, was equal to the desired volume of the emission. In order to calculate the total exposure of person i at the location xi = {xi, yi}, we generated values c(x,r,t) at positions in the square grid centred on xi, with dimension 40 cm, and containing points at resolution 2 cm, finding the mean value of c in this grid. The volume of the space represented by this box is 0.16Z, where Z is the height of the room so that we can calculate the density of viral particles of radius r in the box. Given a parameter A, describing the rate of air inhalation by a person, we calculated the expected number of particles of radius r inhaled within a 1 second interval at time t. Summing these values over times t, we obtained an expected number of particles of radius r inhaled in a 1 hour period following a single emission event. Summing these values over multiple emission events, we obtained an expected number of particles of radius r inhaled over the entire model period. We denote this number as Pi (r).For each uninfected individual in our model, we generated a Poisson random variable$${n}_{i,r}={{\mbox{Poisson}}}\left({P}_{i}\left(r\right)\right)$$ (17) describing the number of particles of radius r inhaled by that person. This number was converted into a number of effective viruses: For each such particle, the expected number of effective viruses is given by$${V}_{{\rm {e}}}\left({k}_{{\rm {b}}},r\right)=\left(\frac{4}{3}\right){k}_{{\rm {b}}}\pi {r}^{3}$$ (18) where kb is the effective viral load of particles at the point of emission. To calculate the effective number of viruses inhaled via particles of radius r, we calculated a second Poisson random variable$${v}_{i,r}={{\mbox{Poisson}}}\left({{n}_{i,r}V}_{{\rm {e}}}\left({k}_{{\rm {b}}},r\right)\right)$$ (19) The transmission bottleneck related to the person i was finally calculated as the sum of these values:$${N}_{i}={\sum }_{r}{v}_{i,r}$$ (20) Person i was considered to have been infected if and only if Ni > 0. Statistics of bottlenecks were calculated across cases of infection.For each scenario considered, we calculated 106 independent simulations, generating Ni for each individual in each simulation. Statistics were collated across simulations.Calculation of k b By default the effective viral load was calculated using an epidemiological model. Details are given in the Supplementary Information. A broad range of values of kb were considered.InhalationOur model assumes that the process of being exposed does not change the local level of exposure i.e. breathing in viruses does not significantly remove viruses from the air. We explore this assumption further in Supplementary Information.EnvironmentsWe modelled transmission within different environments, including an office, a bus, a nightclub, and a lounge. For each environment, our model was parameterised with the dimensions of the room in metres, X, Y, and Z, the number of uninfected people present, ne, and their locations, the air replacement rate γ, the length of time for which we assumed people were in the environment T, the volume of air breathed in per minute by an individual, A, and the height at which particles were emitted, z0. Parameters for each environment are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Parameters defining each of the environments explored in our modelFull size tableIn Supplementary Information, we provide further notes on environmental parameters and a description of methods used to model variation in infectivity levels.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Image credit: Tim Boyle/Getty ImagesViral respiratory infections are common and generally result in a few days of illness from which most people recover without treatment.However, they can lead to severe disease, so most existing treatments aim to prevent existing infections from progressing.A new study suggests a way of stopping viral respiratory infections before they have a chance to become severe. The study found that a common antibiotic boosts the immune response to both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza in rodents, preventing severe disease and death.The researchers propose that the antibiotic, neomycin, could be a cheap, effective way to prevent and treat viral respiratory infections in people.The COVID-19 pandemic focused attention on viral respiratory infections and how they can be prevented and treated.With effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 — severe disease is less common than it was at the start of the pandemic, but there are still few effective treatments for this and other viral respiratory infections.Currently, doctors use antivirals to try and prevent progression of these infections, with monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma for combating severe disease. Now, a study led by researchers from Yale has found that a cheap, widely available antibiotic might reduce the risk of severe disease from viral respiratory infections.The study found that neomycin, applied inside the nose, caused a strong immune response in mice and hamsters which protected against infection with both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A.And a small group of healthy people treated with a common nasal ointment containing neomycin — Neosporin — showed a similar immune response.The study is published in PNAS.William Schaffner, MD, professor of preventive medicine in the Department of Health Policy, and professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, not involved in the study, commented on the findings for Medical News Today:“This is a very provocative study. Clearly, there is an urgent need for better ways both to prevent and to treat serious respiratory infections. This series of early studies suggests that non-specific immune stimulation by an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment could protect the mucus membranes of the nose from viral infection. This is a fascinating counter-intuitive concept that is worth pursuing further.”Antibiotic stimulates immune responseAntibiotics are drugs that kill bacteria and/or prevent them from multiplying. They are used to treat bacterial infections inside the body and also as topical treatments for infections of the skin.Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. People take it orally for infections in the digestive tract, or can use it as a topical ointment, neosporin.Neosporin ointment, which contains neomycin and two other antibiotics, is used to prevent infection in minor cuts and burns, for bacterial infections of the nose, and for management of nosebleeds.The researchers in this study investigated whether intranasal application of neomycin evoked antiviral protection against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A in the upper respiratory tract of mice and whether it prevented transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters. Jonathan Stoye, PhD, virologist and principal group leader at the Francis Crick Institute in London, United Kingdom, not involved in this research, explained to MNT:“The concept of preventing virus infection by stimulating natural antiviral immunity has enormous appeal.”First, the researchers treated mice with a single dose of 2 milligrams (mg) neomycin sulfate as 10 microliters (μL) of neomycin solution per nostril. They euthanized mice on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after neomycin treatment and collected nasal tissue for analysis. From day 1, the neomycin-treated mice had significantly increased levels of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression — an immune response that is effective against viruses — compared with controls.Neomycin improves resistance to flu and SARS-CoV-2 in miceThe researchers then infected neomycin-treated transgenic (genetically engineered) mice with different strains of SARS-CoV-2.The mice did not show the usual signs of infection, such as weight loss, and most survived the infection, whereas the control mice did not. Nasal cells from the neomycin-treated mice showed significantly lower levels of viral replication than those of control mice.Neomycin-treated mice had a similar increase in resistance to influenza A infection. The researchers treated Syrian hamsters with intranasal neomycin (5 mg) then housed them with hamsters that had been infected 24 hours earlier with SARS-CoV-2. One day later, only half of the neomycin-treated hamsters had any signs of infection.“This early-stage research in several rodent models identifies one compound, neomycin, that appears to have [antiviral] activity,” Stoye told MNT. However, Schaffner cautioned that findings in rodents might not be applicable to people. “It is a long jump from animal studies to use in humans. This study represents the first steps in a long journey,” he said.Does neomycin boost immune response in people?The researchers then conducted a small, double-blind pilot study in people. A group of 12 healthy volunteers was treated with Neosporin ointment, which contains neomycin sulfate, bacitracin, and polymyxin B as its active ingredients. They applied the ointment inside their nostrils using a cotton swab twice a day. Control volunteers applied petroleum jelly (Vaseline) in the same way.When their immune responses were tested on days 4, 8 and 12 of the trial, the Neosporin-treated group had a much higher ISG response rate than the controls.“Although an immune response in human volunteers was elicited by the intranasal application of Neosporin ointment, whether this would prevent or treat viral infections in people will have to be demonstrated in a prospective, double-blind trial in a large group of volunteers,” cautioned Schaffner.Early promise, but much work still to do“Early results always are exciting, but much more work is needed before we can consider this for clinical application,” Schaffner noted.Using antivirals to treat infections can drive the development of resistant strains as respiratory viruses mutate rapidly, so the researchers suggest that stimulating the innate immune response using antibiotics could be an effective alternative treatment.The researchers also point out that neomycin is cheap, readily available, and easy to administer intranasally. However, both Schaffner and Stoye had concerns about using neomycin in this way.Schaffner told us:“In order to prevent SARS-CoV-2 or any respiratory viral infection, patients likely would have to apply the Neosporin ointment to the nose for very long periods of time. Whether persons would be compliant with such a regimen would have to be determined. Also, the safety of such prolonged application of the ointment to the nasal mucus membranes would have to be established.”He also highlighted the risks of using any antibiotic for prolonged periods: “In addition, there is the concern that the widespread and prolonged use of the antibiotic ointment could provoke the development of antibiotic resistance of the usual bacterial population of the nose and throat. If so, this would be a notable limitation.”While welcoming the study, Stoye called for further research into the treatment. “Much more work will be required to determine how it works, whether it is protective in humans and whether it would be safe to use on the population level,” he noted.RespiratoryInfectious Diseases / Bacteria / VirusesDrugsCOVID-19Share this articleWritten by Katharine Lang on April 26, 2024 — Fact checked by Amanda WardLatest newsAdding 5 minutes of exercise daily may help lower blood pressureLow calcium, magnesium levels tied to poorer cognitive performanceExercise during 2 specific times may help further reduce colorectal cancer riskClassic and green Mediterranean diets may help slow brain agingRheumatoid arthritis linked to changes in the gut microbiome in new studyRelated CoverageCold and respiratory virus symptoms can also linger like long COVIDResearchers say the long-term symptoms from acute respiratory illnesses not related to COVID-19 may be getting ignored due to the attention on long…READ MOREUpper respiratory infection symptoms and treatmentAn upper respiratory infection affects the nose and throat and causes symptoms such as sneezing and coughing.

North Carolina and South Dakota have become the latest US states to detect the presence of bovine influenza A in dairy cattle.The virus, which is thought to have been transmitted to cows by sick birds, has been reported 24 times in 8 states so far: Texas (10), New Mexico (5), Kansas (3), Michigan (2), Ohio (1) and Idaho (1) and more recently, in North Carolina (1) and South Dakota (1). In addition, a farm worker who had been exposed to sick cattle tested positive for the virus last week, a rare human case and only the second in US history.North Carolina agriculture commissioner Steve Troxler said: “This is an evolving situation, and we are waiting for more diagnostics from NVSL and will work collaboratively with our federal partners and dairy farmers in North Carolina.“We have spent years developing methods to handle highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry, but this is new and we are working with our state and federal partners to develop protocols to handle this situation.”Before March 25, when the first detection was confirmed by USDA, HPAI had never been detected in ruminants. The virus is thought to have been first transmitted to a dairy cow in Texas where dairy and poultry operations were co-located. Domestic birds get the virus from infected wild birds and a detection can be devastating for poultry producers; eradicating it means culling of birds and thorough disinfection of the premises before operations can resume.Veterinarians initially thought that dairy cows would be dead-end hosts who wouldn’t be able to transmit the virus to cows or other species, but reports that cows in a Michigan herd contracted the virus after cattle from Texas were taken in has suggested that cow to cow transmission was possible.Despite the reported human case, the risk of transmission from cows to humans is thought to be very low. However, exposure is critical for transmission, and farmers have been asked to tighten their biosecurity protocols – including limiting visitors, fencing off cattle from standing water areas or birds, and wearing personal protective equipment such as gloves and face masks when working with sick animals or carcasses.The virus, now referred to as bovine influenza A by the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, affects older mid-lactation cows, causing them to dry up or produce thick, colostrum-like milk, with other symptoms including decrease feed consumption, fever and dry, tacky feces. Veterinarians reported that around 10-20% of drop in milk production is observed in affected herds for 14 to 21 days. Dry cows, fresh cows, calves and heifers have so far been unaffected.The virus isn’t deadly and cows recover in around 12 to 14 days with supportive care, but some take longer to return to production, if at all. Infected animals must be isolated from the rest of the herd and their milk destroyed, but farmers can continue collecting milk from cows that are asymptomatic.The virus doesn’t survive pasteurization, which makes commercially-sold milk in the US safe for consumption despite the outbreak.As for raw dairy, the US Food and Drug Administration has warned producers to not manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk cheese products made with milk from cows showing symptoms of the illness or cows that may have been exposed to sick cattle or birds.Import restrictions in 18 statesDespite USDA not forcing movement restrictions, 18 states have placed various restrictions on cattle imports, including new permit requirements and quarantine for newly-imported cows. These states include Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah and West Virginia.Producers should consult the relevant rules provided by state departments of agriculture ahead of importing animals.

Bannert/RKI News • Survey on pathogens of concern What will cause the next pandemic? Experts agree on a likely culprit New research presented at the ESCMID Global Congress (formerly ECCMID) in Barcelona, Spain (27-30 April) shows that in a VACCELERATE Consortium survey study in which infectious diseases experts were asked to rank pathogens in order of their pandemic potential, influenza was considered the pathogen of highest pandemic risk, with 57% ranking influenza as number one, and a further 17% ranking it second. The study is by Dr Jon Salmanton-García, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, Institute of Translational Research, Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Cologne, Germany, and colleagues from across Europe, and published in the journal Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease. Other highly ranked pathogens included Disease X (as yet unknown disease) with 21% ranking this number one and 14% second. Sars-CoV-2 was third in terms of number one responses on 8%, with 16% voting it number two, while the original Sars-CoV virus that circulated in 2002-03 was voted number one by 2% of respondents and second by 8%. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHF virus) and Ebola virus were joint fifth, with 1.6% respondents voting them first. Nipah virus, henipavirus, and Rift Valley fever virus were among the pathogens ranked lowest in terms of their perceived pandemic potential. Every winter there are little [influenza] pandemics. They are more or less controlled because the different strains are not virulent enough. [...] In case a new strain becomes more virulent, this control could be lostJon Salmanton-GarcíaThe World Health Organization (WHO) has outlined a comprehensive Research and Development (R&D) Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics, focusing on key infectious diseases that pose significant threats to public health. These diseases were selected after rigorous evaluation, taking into account factors like transmissibility, infectivity, severity, and their potential for evolution. In alignment with the WHO's R&D Blueprint, the VACCELERATE Site Network (a pan-European network of sites collaborating on Covid-19, other infectious diseases and general pandemic preparedness for infectious diseases) engaged infectious disease experts from around the world, both among and outside its members, to rank the diseases listed in terms of their perceived risk of instigating a pandemic. Participants were tasked with ranking various pathogens based on their perceived pandemic risk, encompassing diseases featured in the WHO R&D Blueprint and additional pathogens. Experts could rank up to 14 pathogens in the order of their perceived risk (the 13 pathogens listed plus Disease X -as yet unknown pathogen) in any order, and also suggest pathogens not listed to include in their maximum of 14. Each pathogen received a score based on its positions. A total of 187 responses were collected from infectious disease experts hailing from 57 different countries. Among the countries providing the highest number of responses, Germany accounted for 27 replies (14%), followed by Spain with 20 replies (11%), and Italy with 14 replies (8%). Influenza viruses emerged as the most concerning pathogen with other highly ranked pathogens including Disease X, Sars-CoV-2, Sars-CoV, and the Ebola virus. Conversely, Hantavirus, Lassa virus, Nipah virus, henipavirus and Rift Valley fever virus were among the pathogens ranked lowest in terms of their pandemic potential. Dr. Jon Salmanton-GarcíaImage source: University Hospital Cologne; photo: Christian Wittke The authors conclude: “The study revealed that influenza, disease X, Sars-CoV-2, Sars-CoV, and the Ebola virus are the most worrisome pathogens concerning their pandemic potential. These pathogens are characterised by their transmissibility through respiratory droplets and a history of previous epidemic or pandemic outbreaks.” Commenting on the top ranking of influenza, Dr Salmanton-García adds: “Each winter we have an influenza season. One could say that this means that every winter there are little pandemics. They are more or less controlled because the different strains are not virulent enough. Yet, every season the strains involved change, that is the reason why we can get influenza several times in life and vaccines change year to year. In case a new strain becomes more virulent, this control could be lost.” But he adds the world is now much more prepared due to the Covid-19 pandemic, whereas before a lot of the focus had been on a potential influenza pandemic. He says: “In Covid-19 pandemic, we have learned many things on how to approach a respiratory virus pandemic. This includes social distancing, hand cleaning, face masks, a renewed focus on vaccination, and trust in healthcare institutions. In parallel, institutions have also learnt a lot. Preparedness and surveillance are now, vitally, better-funded.” Source: European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases 23.04.2024 More on the subject:infections (706) research (3195) virus (302) Contact …Read all latest stories Related articles News • High-resolution cell scansAI spots cancer and viral infections at nanoscale precisionResearchers have developed an artificial intelligence which can differentiate cancer cells from normal cells, as well as detect the very early stages of viral infection inside cells.#AI#cancer#cells#infections#microscopy#nanotechnology#research#virusNews • Immunology“One and done”: promise for a universal influenza vaccineNew research reveals a promising approach to developing a universal influenza vaccine that confers lifetime immunity against an evolving virus considered most likely to trigger the next pandemic.#immune system#infections#prevention#research#virusNews • Public health researchClimate change brings new diseases to Europe – using AI to prepareDue to climate change, diseases such as West Nile fever reach European countries.

The actual extent of the spread in infected dairy herds in the USA probably exceeds these figures. The US authorities are now also reporting PCR evidence of H5N1 virus genome in pasteurised milk from supermarkets, i.e. contaminated milk has also entered the food chain. But no infectious milk has yet been found in the food chain. However, until further clarification in the USA, the consumption of unpasteurised milk (raw milk) and products made from it is strongly advised against.There is no evidence of similar infections outside the USA. Initial orientating tests of 1000 bovine serum samples from Germany by the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) did not reveal any evidence of H5N1 infections; these and other random tests also serve to establish and validate sensitive and specific diagnostics.A well-founded assessment of the situation in the USA is urgently required, but remains incomplete due to a lack of diagnostic and epidemiological data. The available information points to a possible single entry of H5N1 into a cattle farm in Texas, from which uncontrolled animal transport led to the further spread of the virus. How the virus spreads within affected farms remains unclear. As investigations have revealed high virus loads in the udder and therefore also in the milk, transmission through the use of milking equipment is particularly conceivable. Transmission from cow to cow, e.g. through droplet infection or direct contact, also does not appear to be ruled out. However, only low virus loads have apparently been detected in nasal swab samples to date.The udder of infected dairy cows appears to be at the centre of the infection event and appears to be particularly well suited to the spread of the virus. How the initial infection of dairy cows in the USA occurred is still unclear. The jump of an avian influenza virus from one species to another is usually associated with the transmission of large amounts of virus. Since the first appearance of the precursors of today's circulating H5N1 HPAIV 27 years ago, there has been no evidence of H5 HPAIV circulating in ruminants worldwide. FLI scientists also investigated the susceptibility of cattle to the then circulating H5N1 virus in the context of the 2006-2008 H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in Germany, but found only a very low risk of infection for the animals. However, no lactating cows were tested at that time. However, the cattle developed antibodies and the FLI recommended that the situation be monitored further. HPAIV H5N1 is an epizootic and potentially zoonotic agent. Strict precautionary measures would be taken immediately in the event of cases in dairy herds in Germany. These measures are designed to contain the potential spread of the disease as effectively as possible and to protect humans from infection. Possible measures range from transport restrictions (milk, animals) to herd closures and extensive sampling. In the current situation, it is particularly important to be vigilant and take targeted samples in the event of suspected cases or well-founded indications of possible exposure.

But the testing, done by polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, cannot distinguish between live virus or fragments of viruses that could have been killed by the pasteurization process. The agency said it has been trying to see if it could grow virus from milk found to contain evidence of H5N1, which is the gold standard test to see if there is viable virus in a product. The lengthy statement the agency released does not explicitly say FDA laboratories were unable to find live virus in the milk samples, but it does state that its belief that commercial, pasteurized milk is safe to consume has not been altered by these findings.advertisement “To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,” the statement said. The document was long on assurances but short on details of what has been undertaken or found. It does not specify how many commercial samples were taken or in how many markets, nor does it indicate what percentage of the samples were PCR-positive for H5N1. The statement did not indicate if the testing suggested the amounts of viral genetic material in the milk were low or high. Furthermore, the statement did not reveal if the milk products were purchased in parts of the country where outbreaks have occurred, or in areas where cows haven’t been seen to have been infected.advertisement The FDA did say it is testing milk from infected animals, in the processing system, and from store shelves with the goal of producing a “large representative national sample” of the milk supply. Beyond assessing the safety of the supply, such a sample could enable the agency to construct a more robust picture of H5N1’s spread among dairy cows nationally. The agency emphasized that testing of commercially available milk is ongoing, and this includes efforts to discern any potential differences between different dairy products, such as cream and whole milk. Related: Genetic analysis reveals H5N1 flu virus outbreak in cows likely started earlier than thought Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, called the findings “unsurprising,” saying that PCR testing of milk could turn up genetic evidence of an array of other pathogens that would have been killed by pasteurization, such as listeria or salmonella. “I still believe that the risk is very low for any live virus activity in milk,” Osterholm said, though he noted the FDA’s statement included too few details to show that. “It’s kind of an obtuse document.” The FDA, which has been dodging questions for some time about the work it is doing to assess the safety of the milk supply, said it did the commercial survey as part of its efforts to assess the federal-state milk safety system in the context of the current outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in dairy cows in at least eight states across the country. As of Monday, 33 outbreaks in herds have been confirmed. “Some of the samples collected have indicated the presence of [H5N1] using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing,” the FDA wrote in the statement.

Privacy Policy It reiterated that it believes the pasteurization process is “very likely” to inactivate H5N1. “Data from previous studies that serve as the underpinnings of the FDA’s current milk supply safety assessment show that pasteurization is very likely to effectively inactivate heat-sensitive viruses, like H5N1, in milk from cows and other species,” the FDA wrote, though the agency acknowledged that no studies have been published on the impact of pasteurization on H5N1 viruses in milk. Some academic centers have begun that work, however. John Lucey, director of the Center for Dairy Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told STAT in an email that preliminary testing of milk conducted at the university has indicated that pasteurization is effective in killing the virus. But he declined to share further details. The U.S. Department of Agriculture “is currently doing their own trials and I expect to hear from them shortly on their results on pasteurization which should be viewed as the official testing,” he wrote. The virus, which has been causing outbreaks around the world for more than a quarter century, had previously not been seen to infect cows. Pasteurization is a process of heating raw milk to kill problematic microbes. There are several ways it can be done; some involve pushing milk rapidly through a hot pressurized tube, while others heat milk over longer time periods in large vats. The extent of microorganism destruction depends on the combination of temperature and holding times in the pasteurizer as well as the specific properties of the pathogen and how many of them are present in the milk. Higher levels of bacteria or viruses will take more time to kill. Minimum temperature and time requirements that dairy processing plants use in the U.S. are based on studies showing what it takes to kill the most heat-resistant pathogen found in milk: Coxiella burnetii, the bacteria that causes Q fever. “It’s a very tough microbe,” said Terry Lehenbauer, a bovine disease epidemiologist and director of the Veterinary Medicine Teaching and Research Center at UC Davis. “As a result, if we know that pasteurization can effectively kill that indicator organism, we know that all the other pathogens that are less durable will also be eliminated.” Trending Now: What can Trump and RFK Jr. actually do on health care? The majority of milk in the U.S. is treated with a high-temperature, low-time technique, where the milk is heated to 162 degrees Fahrenheit for 16 seconds. Because it is a thermal process and doesn’t involve the physical removal of any bacteria or viruses, dead genetic material left behind could be detected by a method that picks up small fragments of DNA or RNA, such as qPCR. “It really doesn’t tell you anything about aliveness or the capacity of the virus to infect,” said Jennifer Cruickshank, a dairy extension specialist at Oregon State University who specializes in genomics. “It really only tells you that in the case of influenza virus, this particular fragment of RNA was present.” To date, there have not been any published studies about the effectiveness of pasteurization on the H5N1 virus in milk. But researchers who spoke to STAT said that inactivation of this virus is expected based on prior work that has shown it is relatively sensitive to heat. A review published in 2022 by researchers in Germany, found that at a temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit, influenza viruses, including H5N1 strains found in chicken meat, feces, and eggs could be reduced by four orders of magnitude within 30 minutes. But milk is a very different substance, a suspension of water, milk fats, and proteins, whose complex kinetics can sometimes complicate the pasteurization process. Studies conducted by the USDA in the ’70s and ’80s found that those milk fats could act like protective bubble wrap around the virus that causes foot and mouth disease — making it more difficult for the heat from pasteurization to penetrate and inactivate the virus. There’s no indication that is true with H5N1 viruses. And Lehenbauer pointed out that avian influenza is in a class of viruses encased in an envelope, which, counterintuitively, makes them much less hardy compared to non-enveloped viruses, like the one that causes foot and mouth disease. But as with any emerging pathogen, it’s worth knowing for sure. “Pasteurization kills much sturdier viruses than influenza, so we expect it to work,” said Andrew Pekosz, a molecular microbiologist who studies respiratory viruses at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “But it’d be great to have the data.” This story has been updated.

Photo: Shutterstock Hong Kong may be facing a prolonged flu season as a low vaccination rate might have led to weak herd immunity, letting a different strain of the virus dominate, medical experts have said after health authorities sounded a warning.The Centre for Health Protection drew attention to the possibility of a longer influenza season on Thursday evening after it revealed a six-year-old girl became the second child to die from the flu this year.The centre said that the city’s dominating flu virus strain had shifted from influenza A subtype H3 seen in the January to March period to subtype H1 recorded in the most recent cases.Low vaccination rates may make it easier for the dominating strain of the flu virus to shift, medical professors say. Photo: Shutterstock“The duration [of the flu season] would be prolonged when there is a transition of the dominating virus strain,” the centre said. “It is believed that the current influenza season will persist for a period of time and more outbreaks and severe cases might be recorded in the upcoming weeks.”While the city entered the current flu season in early January this year, the extension meant that it would last longer than the average flu period of eight to 12 weeks.Dr Mike Kwan Yat-wah, an honorary associate professor at the University of Hong Kong’s department of paediatrics and adolescent medicine, said a relatively low vaccination rate could give rise to alternating flu strains.Should Hong Kong require wearing masks during flu season?He said about 50 per cent of the city’s population had been inoculated with the latest seasonal flu vaccine.“If we need to build an immunity barrier to prevent infections of alternating viruses, an overall vaccination rate would need to reach 70 to 80 per cent to do so,” Kwan said.He added that as the city experienced a peak of H1 infections starting from March last year, the immunity against the virus subtype would decline roughly six months later, suggesting that people could also be more susceptible to the strain.The flu is coming; here’s what you should know to protect yourself“When the population’s immunity is low, the flu season could be longer … we could see a majority of people getting infected before the transmission stops,” he said.Kwan added there was no significant difference in terms of transmissibility or virulence between H1 and H3.Professor Ivan Hung Fan-ngai, an infectious disease expert from the same university, pointed out it was “quite common” to have two different flu virus strains in one season, especially when community immunity was low after Covid-19.Dr Mike Kwan Yat-wah, an honorary associate professor at the University of Hong Kong’s department of paediatrics and adolescent medicine. Photo: Jonathan WongHe said the low immunity was caused by a lack of thorough flu infections in the community during Covid-19 pandemic, together with the low flu vaccination rate.Health authorities said Hong Kong underwent a 16-week winter flu season in 2015-16 after the dominance of flu A virus was overtaken by flu B later.The six-year-old girl died this week after having contracted the H1 subtype virus and developing encephalopathy, also known as altered brain function.The flu is coming; here’s what you should know to protect yourselfThe girl had a history of good health and had received a flu vaccine for this season, authorities said.The news came just five days after the announcement of the death of an unvaccinated eight-year-old girl, who had also caught the H1 strain.Kwan explained that a person could still develop complications following a flu jab under certain conditions, such as undiagnosed congenital immunodeficiency or metabolic disorders, a severe flu infection or another bacterial infection.Professor Ivan Hung Fan-ngai, an infectious disease expert from the University of Hong Kong, believes it is “quite common” to have two different flu virus strains in one season. Photo: Elson LiHealth authorities said there had already been a “significant increase” in the number of flu-like outbreaks at schools and institutions in the week ending April 20 compared with the first week of the month, rising from 10 to 29.“The [centre] appealed again to members of the public to heighten their vigilance, and people belonging to high-risk priority groups should receive seasonal influenza vaccination as soon as possible for prevention of severe disease and death.”Sign up for the YP Teachers NewsletterGet updates for teachers sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy PolicyCommentSign up for YP WeeklyGet updates sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy PolicySign up for YP WeeklyGet updates sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy Policydiscovernewslifestyleentertainmentadviceyour voicevideoscmp.comLearnreportTEAM YPjournalism resourceslatest reportslearnlearning resourcescollege & uni lifecareer adviceeventssparkStoriesWorksheetstrending topicsHKDSE - Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary EducationHealth and fitnessEnvironmentalLivingRelationshipsStudent lifeCareersEnglish exercisesVideo gamesK-popMental healthCelebritiesMedia literacye-paperYP is a unit of South China Morning Post.SCMPVisit scmp.comAbout UsContact UsWrite for UsPrivacy PolicyTerms & Conditions© 2024 South China Morning Post Publisher Ltd.

Grace Cary/Getty ImagesThe FDA has discovered the presence of the avian flu virus in dairy milk.Commercially available milk products are still believed to be safe for consumers because they have undergone pasteurization.Raw milk products may carry the avian flu virus, in addition to other risks.Avian influenza, or bird flu, has been detected in dairy milk in the United States, but the FDA has indicated that the disease has a low likelihood of causing illness in humans.In an advisory issued this week, the Food and Drug Administration announced that they — along with the CDC and the USDA — are investigating the presence of H5N1 avian influenza in dairy cows and their milk.The disease, known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), is very contagious and often deadly in poultry, but, despite its name, is not readily transmissible to humans, though some infections have occurred. The FDA has stated that despite identifying bird flu in raw milk, as well as traces of the H5N1 virus in milk sold at grocery stores, commercial dairy products are still safe to consume because almost all of them (99%) have undergone pasteurization. However, the virus may be present in raw milk products, which the organization has continuously warned consumers about.William Schaffner, MD, a Professor of Infectious Diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, concurred with the FDAs assessment that transmission of the disease is unlikely, especially from milk.“This is a virus that does not have the genetic capacity to be transmitted from person to person. And this virus has been around in the world, in bird populations for a decade, and it still has not acquired this capacity,” he told Healthline.“I have in my hand a cup of coffee with milk in it. I put milk into my oatmeal. I had no concern about it,” he added.How did bird flu get into the milk supply?According to the latest information, the FDA has confirmed the detection of HPAI in dairy cow herds in several states, including Idaho, Kansas, New Mexico, Texas, and more. In an announcement yesterday, regulators issued a federal order requiring testing for and reporting of HPAI in livestock.Despite being found in dairy cows, to date, regulators and public health entities are only aware of two cases of HPAI transmission to humans. At the beginning of April, the CDC announced that an individual in Texas was confirmed to carry the disease. The patient had been exposed to dairy cattle, but the report wasn’t more specific. The exposure resulted in symptoms of conjunctivitis (“pink eye”), and the individual was subsequently treated with antiviral medication for flu.A previous case of transmission occurred in Colorado in 2022 when an individual known to be working around HPAI-infected poultry tested positive for the disease. The individual reported symptoms of fatigue and was again treated with an antiviral.Diseases transmitted between animals and humans, known as zoonotic diseases, are very common. According to the CDC, more than 60% of infectious diseases in humans can be spread from animals, and 75% of emerging diseases in people come from animals. Transmission can also occur between different species of animals, such as birds and cows.“When wild birds set down to drink water and feed along their migratory path, they can actually excrete the virus out of their saliva and their urine and their poop, and put it into the environment in such a way that it can occasionally get into mammals,” said Schaffner.From there, it can easily spread across feedlots and, in this case, the milk supply.“Not surprisingly, in a herd that’s jammed close together, where there’s a lot of cow saliva and urine and poop, it can be transmitted among the cows,” he said.Why commercial dairy products are still considered safe for peopleThough virus particles of HPAI have been detected in pasteurized milk, the risk of transmission of HPAI is extremely unlikely, but it may be possible in raw milk.“The FDA does not have any concerns that our milk supply is contaminated and see no health threat or concerns for consumers at this time,” Joseph Lambson, PharmD, Director of the New Mexico Poison and Drug Information Center, and an Assistant Professor at the University of New Mexico College of Pharmacy, told Healthline.“They still highly urge against using raw milk or products that utilize raw milk for the same concerns that they’ve been saying for years and years, which is you’re just at increased risk of infection. And so you can definitely include this highly virulent form of avian flu to that list,” said Lambson.The FDA warns that raw milk can carry dangerous pathogens, including salmonella, listeria, and campylobacter.Commercially available milk undergoes pasteurization, which is a process in which milk is heated and then cooled in order to destroy pathogens. The process has been used on milk for public health purposes for over one hundred years in the United States. “Pasteurization is required by the FDA if you’re moving milk products from one state to another. They have to follow a specific temperature and time. That should kill the virus. So the inactive virus may be in the milk, but it’s not going to be able to replicate, so you can drink it safely,” said Sylvia Ley, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.Viral fragments may remain in milk after pasteurization but are not considered to pose a risk to consumer health. Additionally, the FDA and USDA have stated that milk from sick cows is actively being diverted from the food supply.Lambson encourages anyone concerned that they have consumed a contaminated product to contact their poison control center, where they can get medical advice about symptoms to look for and whether or not they should seek medical treatment.“Additionally, it also helps from a surveillance purpose to see if we’re having an increase of exposures,” he said.The bottom lineThe FDA has discovered the presence of avian influenza in dairy milk.Regulators have cautioned that there is little to no risk of infection in commercial milk due to pasteurization. However, the virus may be present in raw milk.Only two known cases of transmission of the virus are known to have occurred recently in humans.How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by Gigen Mammoser on April 25, 2024 — Fact checked by Jennifer Chesak, MSJRead this nextWhy Chick-fil-A Is Allowing Antibiotics in Chicken and How It May Affect YouChick-fil-A announced it will now allow some antibiotics in its chicken.

The USDA said on Monday the virus has been confirmed in 33 dairy herds in eight states since it was first identified on March 25.” “‘This week CDC completed susceptibility testing for influenza antiviral medications that are used for seasonal influenza,’ said the agency in an update of its activities,” according to Abbott’s reporting. “’Testing confirmed that the A(H5N1) virus was susceptible to all commercially available FDA-approved and recommended neuraminidase inhibitor antivirals,’ such as oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. Tests of a different antiviral, baloxavir marboxil, were under way.” Current State of the Outbreak The Associated Press’ JoNel Aleccia reported late last week that “a bird flu outbreak in U.S. dairy cows has grown to affect more than two dozen herds in eight states, just weeks after the nation’s largest egg producer found the virus in its chickens.” Confirmed Cases of HPAI in Domestic Livestock, as of April 23. Courtesy of USDA. “As of (last) Friday, the strain of bird flu that has killed millions of wild birds in recent years has been found in at least 26 dairy herds in eight U.S. states: Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and South Dakota,” Aleccia reported. That has led “agriculture officials in at least 17 states” to restrict “imports of dairy cattle from states where the virus has been detected, but, so far, government agencies say it’s had little effect on commercial milk production,” Aleccia reported. Reuters’ Tom Polansek also reported last week that “the U.S. Department of Agriculture said this week that cow-to-cow transmission is a factor in the spread of bird flu in dairy herds, but it still does not know exactly how the virus is being moved around.” “Officials reported last month that bird flu primarily affected older cows, though additional data now indicates younger cattle have been affected, the USDA said,” Polansek reported. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that “in late March 2024, a human case of influenza A(H5N1) virus infection was identified after exposure to dairy cattle presumably infected with bird flu,” though no further human cases have been reported. Most recently, Reuters’ Manas Mishra and Jasper Ward reported Tuesday that “the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday that it had found bird flu virus particles in some samples of pasteurized milk, but said commercial milk supply remains safe. The FDA said that because the milk is pasteurized, it remains safe for human consumption as the process kills harmful bacteria and viruses by heating milk to a specific temperature.” “The agency said it has seen nothing that would change its assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe, adding that results from multiple studies will be made available in the next few days to weeks,” Mishra and Ward reported. USDA Working on Vaccine While the CDC said that common antiviral medication would be effective in treating cattle infected by H5N1 bird flu, Abbott reported in a different article last week that “the Agriculture Department said its research agency ‘has begun to assess the potential to develop an effective vaccine’ against the H5N1 bird flu virus in cattle, although it warned that it is too early to say how long the process would take.” “Vaccine manufacturers have expressed interest in developing vaccines for H5N1 in poultry and cattle, said APHIS,” according to Abbott. “’We will continue to engage with those developers to better understand their vaccine development, the efficacy of potential vaccines, as well as the cost of development and production.’” “For some time, the USDA has explored an HPAI vaccine for poultry,” Abbott reported. “However, using a vaccine would imperil egg and poultry meat exports because it is currently impossible to identify products from infected animals. Vaccinating flocks would be time consuming and expensive, since there are tens of millions of chickens and turkeys. By contrast, there were 8.9 million dairy cows at latest count.” While the United States is still exploring a vaccine, the French government launched “a campaign (last) October to vaccinate all ducks against bird flu, braving trade barriers from countries that fear the virus could spread without being noticed,” Reuters’ Sybille De La Hamaide reported at the end of March. “…France has seen a sharp fall in bird flu outbreaks this season. Scientists say this is due both to vaccination and a lower number of outbreaks in Europe.” Ryan Hanrahan Ryan Hanrahan is the Farm Policy News editor and social media director for the farmdoc project.

REUTERS/Jim Vondruska by Rachel Nuwer April 25, 2024 Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Copy link When U.S. officials first announced in late March 2024 that the H5N1 avian influenza had been detected in Texas dairy herds, Beth Thompson knew it was only a matter of time before the virus reached cows in South Dakota, where she serves as the state veterinarian. Her prediction came true days later on April 8, when she received an email reporting likely cases of H5N1 in approximately 50 cows at a dairy in an unidentified part of the state. Thompson says that her immediate reaction was to contact the farm owner and manager to see how she and her colleagues could assist and to ensure that they could work together to gather valuable data along the way. She knew, though, that she would have to navigate the challenges with more questions than answers. "This is not a previously reported disease in dairy cows, so there isn't nearly enough data available on how [it] is affecting animals," Thompson says. "How is it moving through dairies? How quickly do animals recover? What does it look like when they do recover? All these questions and more need to be answered." Many of those questions remain unaddressed a month after the initial federal announcement, even as more herds come down with the virus. As of April 24, H5N1 has been confirmed in 33 dairy herds across eight states. Veterinarians who spoke to Think Global Health say they recognize that it takes time to implement new protocols, but without basic information such as how cows contract the virus and how long they shed it once infected, it's difficult to issue precise instructions for things like quarantine. The efforts to gather the data to fill in these unknowns have also been piecemeal and slow, says Keith Poulsen, a clinical associate professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison School of Veterinary Medicine, and the director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. He says each state is acting differently rather than following a unified approach. Another problem, he continues, is that reporting of sick cows is voluntary, and many farmers are averse to opening their operations up to government involvement. Still others are in denial about the seriousness of the threat the virus poses to the cattle industry. This creates a problem with data collection and responses to the virus. Dairy farmer Brent Pollard's cows eat feed in their pen at a cattle farm, in Rockford, Illinois, on April 9, 2024. REUTERS/Jim Vondruska "It is considered common knowledge that on the front lines of the outbreak there are more farms with affected cows" that have not reported them, Poulsen says. "It is very likely that there are more states involved, too." As these issues continue, some public health watchers argue that the situation echoes some of the early setbacks seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that lessons have not been learned. A few signs of improvement are evident, though. Last week, for example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced that it will begin paying for testing for the virus in cattle. This is a positive step, but more is still needed, Poulsen says. On April 24, the USDA also released new mandatory reporting standards for positive cases and testing requirements for dairy cows moving across state borders. "We really need some strong national leadership, and clearer guidance for how we move forward." Unusual Signs H5N1 is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), a virus that has caused the deaths of hundreds of millions of birds over the decades, including at poultry farms in the United States. Starting in 2022, several regions began experiencing a string of unprecedented outbreaks of H5N1 in wild and domestic birds. Yet the "highly pathogenic" label, at least for now, does not apply to what's spreading in U.S. cattle. Sickened cows typically lose their appetite, become dehydrated, and take on a lackluster demeanor with fever—but so far they haven't succumbed to the virus. Their milk productivity drops and, in severe cases, the milk they do produce begins looking "kind of yellow and more viscous," Poulsen says. Strangely, for now the disease seems to most seriously affect milking cows in mid- to late lactation. Younger heifers can also shed the virus in their milk, but without clinical signs. Within an affected herd, about 10% of animals come down with overt clinical signs. Sickened cows typically lose their appetite, become dehydrated, and take on a lackluster demeanor with fever—but so far they haven't succumbed The USDA confirmed in a frequently-asked-questions document posted on April 16 that the virus is being transmitted directly from cow to cow via an unknown route. "We know that it's circulating in cows, so it's no longer avian—it's bovine," says Joe Armstrong, a veterinarian at the University of Minnesota. For this reason, and because the virus is not deadly for cows, most industry experts are referring to it as H5N1 in cows, rather than as HPAI. The latest genetic sequencing of the virus suggests that the cows in Texas were infected by wild birds via a single spillover event in late 2023, possibly from contaminated food or water sources. "Birds really love what we feed to cows, and they're almost impossible to eliminate," says Fred Gingrich, a veterinarian and the executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, a nonprofit cattle veterinary professional association. Fortunately, for now the impact on public health is minimal. Only one case of cattle-related H5N1 transmission to a human has been reported, in a dairy worker in Texas who recovered. U.S. officials also say there is no current threat to the food supply. Experts emphasize that dairy products and meat should be safe for consumption because influenza viral particles are destroyed by pasteurization and cooking based on past research on milk from humans and studies on eggs—the latter are processed at lower temperatures than retail milk from cows. On April 23, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it had detected the genetic fragments of H5N1 in retail milk, but further tests are needed to determine whether the positive test was due to inactive remnants of the pathogen or to a viable virus. The agency says that results from those studies—and others assessing all stages of milk production—will be made available in the next few days to weeks. The FDA reaffirmed that pasteurization is effective. "None of the preliminary work shared in working groups suggests that pasteurization is not 100% effective," Poulsen says. Cases of H5N1 have also been confirmed in 48 mammal species across 26 countries, from bobcats and bears to seals and bottlenose dolphins. Spillover into humans, such as the case of the Texas dairy farmer, has been rare, but the potential concern is that those incidents tend to be lethal. Since 2003, the World Health Organization has recorded 889 human cases of H5N1 and 463 deaths—a disturbing case fatality rate of 52%. "Influenza viruses change and jump species," Poulsen says. "That's why we need to make sure H5N1 in dairy cattle doesn't become a public health problem or cause interruptions to our food supply chain." Need for Unity So far infected cows have not died, but they have required veterinary care. This need puts significant strain on dairy farmers, who often lack the facilities to quarantine and provide care for hundreds of sick animals. Farmers lose about $100 per cow on a herd basis, Gingrich adds, "so a 1,000-cow dairy could see economic losses of $100,000." Experts from industry, academia, professional organizations, and government are meeting regularly to discuss H5N1 in cattle and have put together initial recommended guidelines. The USDA is also "encouraging producers and veterinarians to minimize dairy cattle movement," a USDA spokesperson wrote in an email. "We expect that minimizing movement, upholding good biosecurity practices and testing animals before necessary movements will limit disease spread sufficiently to avoid the need for regulatory restrictions or quarantines." Trying to prevent the virus from reaching new herds is easier said than done, however. For example, although the USDA recommends that all dairy cows be tested for the virus before they are moved to a new facility, "I don’t know of anyone who is doing that," Armstrong says. Alfred Brandt milks his Holstein cows on his dairy farm, in Linn, Missouri, on April 28, 2020. REUTERS/Whitney Curtis One disincentive for testing is that no protocol currently exists defining how farmers whose herds do test positive "get out of the box," as Armstrong puts it—or the series of steps needed to resume business as usual after a test comes back positive and triggers USDA involvement. Poulsen suspects that this is probably why fewer new herds and positive tests have been reported in the Southwest states over the past few weeks: farmers want to avoid liability, risk, and government intervention. Rather than testing, farmers who have the capacity are now quarantining arriving cattle to observe them for symptoms before introducing them to resident animals. But many, Poulsen adds, don't have the facilities or resources to do this. According to Gingrich and others, simply stopping the transport of cattle is also not an option. The industry constantly moves animals within and between states to different specialized facilities that are designed to care for and process cows at different stages of their life. Some dairy farms, for example, do not have the facilities or space needed to raise calves. "I just don't know what we would do with those calves if they couldn't leave," Gingrich says. "It would be a terrible health and welfare issue." Farms are not required to report affected cows, so many farms are not reporting because they have no financial or liability support Keith Poulsen, clinical associate professor Starting in late April, USDA began paying for pre-movement testing of H5N1 in cows. But significant funding gaps remain at the state and federal level, Thompson says. For example, the USDA compensates poultry farmers whose flocks are depopulated—an approach that both supports farmers and incentivizes them to promptly report outbreaks—but no equivalent program currently exists for milk production losses. "Farms are not required to report affected cows, so many farms are not reporting because they have no financial or liability support, [which] poultry farms do," Poulsen says. Denial and lack of communication and collaboration among dairy farmers, politicians, industry representatives, and veterinarians is another major problem, Armstrong says—one that exacerbates issues with data collection and resources. "Some people are more than happy to bury their head in the sand on this one because they don't want to admit it's a problem," he says. "One thing I hear all the time is, 'Oh, this will just burn itself out.' The other one is, 'It's not here, so it's not my problem.'" But for those who are "in the trenches" treating H5N1 outbreaks in their animals, he continues, the lack of resources and "denial attitude" can strain not only farm operations, but also the mental health of all involved. "I've got veterinarians who have cried over this because they're dealing with it and people are telling them it's not real," he says. As the country—hopefully—comes together to contain the issue, Armstrong urges policymakers to also ensure that resources are set aside to support the personal well-being of those affected. "It's a huge problem for farming and agricultural communities that we don't talk about enough in situations like this."

No cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have shown up in Canadian cattle yet, but she's concerned watching outbreaks in the U.S. (Submitted by Raquel Kolof)Social SharingThe Dose19:04What's going on with H5N1 bird flu?H5N1 is in the news again, and this time it has spread to cattle in several U.S. states. It has even infected a dairy worker in Texas. Global health epidemiologist Raywat Deonandan explains how avian flu is spreading, how transmissible it is, what vaccines are available, and why we shouldn't be too worried just yet.Beef cattle farmer Raquel Kolof of Gibsons, B.C., says she's extremely concerned about recent outbreaks of a dangerous form of bird flu — also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) — in dairy farms across at least eight U.S. states.Though she says protections are in place to prevent similar outbreaks from taking place north of the U.S. border, and there have been no confirmed cases of bird flu in Canadian cattle to date, she says she's still worried "that it's coming up here.""Cattle do move around … and 85 per cent of our beef market is handled in south Alberta, through massive, massive factories," said Kolof, the owner and founder of Hough Heritage Farms. "They all conglomerate, they spread to each other and then it spreads from there."Despite that unease, experts say there's no cause for alarm right now thanks to national food safety standards and steps being taken by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) to ensure that food producers adhere to necessary biosecurity measures.What is bird flu? HPAI is a strain of influenza that causes "severe disease and high mortality in infected poultry," according to the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).HPAI typically spreads between birds and has a high mortality rate for avian species, according to Genevieve Toupin, the national veterinary program manager with the CFIA, whose team is responsible for the agency's ruminant and swine programs. Genevieve Toupin is the national veterinary program manager with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Her team is responsible for the agency’s ruminant and swine programs. (Submitted by Genevieve Toupin)She says the virus currently infecting U.S. cattle is the same that's been circulated by migratory birds flying along the Pacific-Central Flyway for approximately the past two years.Thirty-two herds across eight U.S. states so far have been affected by HPAI infections since government agencies made the announcement almost four weeks ago. It's still not clear how the virus is spreading to and between dairy cattle.While the virus's name implies it only affects birds, other animals — including mammals — can catch H5N1. "In fact, we've detected H5N1 in polar bears, sea lions, penguins, foxes, and the presumption there is they're getting it from eating dead birds," said University of Ottawa global health epidemiologist Raywat Deonandan, speaking with Dr. Brian Goldman, host of The Dose.Symptoms among infected cattle include a sudden decrease in milk production, thicker milk, decreases in appetite and dry manure or constipation, according to the CFIA.Can humans catch bird flu? Humans are susceptible to HPAI, though cases are rare and there has been no confirmed human-to-human transmission. Since 2003, nearly 900 people worldwide have been infected with H5N1, according to the World Health Organization. Canada has seen only one confirmed case, in 2013.Infection occurs if the virus gets into a person's eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled, according to the CDC. Symptoms in humans resemble influenza, including cough, shortness of breath, fever and body aches. In serious cases, people can experience severe respiratory illness, including difficulty breathing and pneumonia, as well as neurological changes, and multi-organ failure. An estimated 52 per cent of known human cases result in death. "It's not the typical seasonal flu that we're all used to," said Deonandan."However, it's important to keep in mind that there are likely instances of people getting it and not even knowing it, because their symptoms were so poor, in which case the actual fatality rate will drop considerably."Raywat Deonandan is a global health epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of Ottawa. (Submitted by Raywat Deonandan)Some estimates suggest the true fatality rate for humans infected with bird flu is "probably around 14 per cent to 30 per cent," he said.In comparison, during the height of the SARS outbreak in 2003, the disease had a case fatality rate of roughly 11 per cent. A Texas dairy worker in early April reportedly caught a case of bird flu from an infected mammal — likely a cow."The person in Texas … reported eye redness, or conjunctivitis, as their only symptom and is recovering," according to the CDC.WATCH | Bird flu is spreading in cows. Are humans at risk? | About That: Bird flu is spreading in cows. Are humans at risk? | About That7 months agoDuration 8:54For the first time ever, avian influenza, or H5N1 bird flu, was detected in roughly a dozen dairy cow herds across the U.S. About That producer Lauren Bird explores why scientists and public health officials are concerned about the cross-species transmission and whether humans are now at higher risk.This was only the second-ever recorded case of a human infected with bird flu in the U.S. The first was a Colorado inmate who caught the virus while working on a poultry farm as part of a pre-release employment program. So far, nearly all human cases have been from direct contact with infected poultry, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada, with no evidence of any sustained transmission between people.Deonandan says he's especially worried about bird flu mutating, infecting a pig, and subsequently infecting a human in a form that would let it spread."What we're concerned about is [bird flu] will share DNA with a flu that is adapted to live in humans and learn how to live in humans, in which case it will move from person to person, with presumably the same alacrity with which the seasonal flu moves from human to human," he said. How are food producers monitoring their livestock? For her part, Kolof says she and other livestock producers already adhere to stringent safety standards to prevent the spread of infection and disease. "One of the beauties of being a small-scale farmer is that I interact with my herd multiple times a day," she said. "I know and can see a change instantly."Hough Heritage Farms owner Raquel Kolof primarily raises beef cattle, but she also raises goats, sheep and pigs. (Submitted by Raquel Kolof)Toupin with the CFIA says working with stakeholders across the farming industry to coordinate the national response.Cattle farms are being advised not to introduce any new animals into a herd, and to quarantine new animals for 21 days just in case the animal is incubating disease.

Pasteurization, a specialized heating process, also kills any harmful pathogens if they were to show up in milk or milk products.Deonandan says he's drawing attention to bird flu to contextualize the threat it poses to humans. "COVID-19 has shown us that there is a deep distrust of the so-called experts, deep distrust of authority," he said. "By getting ahead of the narrative, by laying out the facts as we know them, maybe we can buy some more trust."

Since then, federal data shows more than 6 million chickens have been depopulated in Ionia County. (Photo by Rose White | MLive)Rose White | MLiveBy Rose White | rwhite@mlive.comFor two years, Michigan largely dodged a deadly bird flu.By the end of last year, the highly pathogenic avian influenza had infected a couple dozen backyard flocks and was detected three times at turkey farms. But in the past month, the death toll of Michigan birds has skyrocketed, and dairy cows are starting to get sick.A recent infection in Ionia County dealt the biggest blow: nearly 6.5 million dead chickens.“Obviously when you get an outbreak of a disease like this, it raises a lot of questions and we’re taking it very, very seriously,” said Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Director Tim Boring.This strain of the avian flu, H5N1, started spreading in the United States after it was first detected in two South Carolina wild ducks in January 2022. Since then, it’s become the deadliest bird flu in history, affecting more than 90 million birds.It’s so contagious that farms with even one infected bird are required by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to depopulate, or kill, their entire flock. But many commercial farms, including in Michigan, have been relying on what critics call an inhumane method to kill their flocks that prolongs animal suffering.Avian flu tears through egg farmsHerbruck’s Poultry Ranch faced its worst-case scenario at the end of March.A farmworker at Herbruck’s, the biggest egg producer in the state that supplies eggs to every McDonald’s restaurant east of the Mississippi, noticed sick birds at the farm’s Ionia County organic facility. Testing confirmed their fears.“Herbruck’s is heartbroken by the loss of any hen, and we were devastated to learn that some of the hens at our Green Meadow Organics facility are infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza,” CEO Greg Herbruck said in a statement earlier this month.The fourth-generation family farm, which has 10 million egg-laying hens across three states, did not confirm how many birds were impacted. But federal data shows almost 6.5 million chickens at Ionia County egg farms were depopulated between April 3 and April 16 – making it one of the biggest cullings in the country.Related: Avian flu strikes Michigan’s largest egg producerMichigan now ranks fifth for avian flu-related deaths behind Iowa, Ohio, California and Nebraska.“Over the course of the last two years, as we’ve seen this outbreak spread across the country, nearly every state has been affected. And many states have had some of the large commercial detections like we’ve had most recently,” said Kim Dodd, director of Michigan State University’s Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, which does avian flu testing.It’s hit egg producers particularly hard.Egg farms have depopulated 63 million birds with the 39 largest mass killings in the country, federal data shows. That includes two producers in Iowa that each killed 5 million birds in spring 2022. And Cal-Maine Foods, the largest egg producer, idled a Texas facility earlier this month after depopulating 1.6 million birds, about 3.6% of its total flock.Outbreaks like these drove egg prices to record highs last year, hitting an average of nearly $5 a dozen.Herbruck says his egg farm has been working “around the clock” to follow federal protocols and disinfect facilities before production can start again. The company plans to lean on its unaffected farms and a supplier network to keep distributing eggs.To compensate losses, the USDA pays farms for birds and eggs that need to be destroyed because of the flu. As of January, more than $1 billion had reportedly been spent on these indemnity payments.“You’re looking at a commercial operation that is forced with depopulating the entire flock, and it’s a significant economic hit,” Boring said.Health officials emphasize no eggs from infected animals will enter the food supply and the flu carries a low risk for humans – only two people who had contact with farm animals have gotten sick.How are birds depopulated?Depopulation is the main tool used to contain an infection.Affected farms need to act quickly because the flu is particularly vicious for chickens and turkeys. It can rapidly multiply and infect every bird in a single day. Sickened birds will then struggle to breathe, gasping for air, suffering from extreme diarrhea and likely dying within two days.“I think it’s important to remember that our domestic poultry get very sick with this infection,” Dodd said. “So, in this case, we are not stamping out the infection just to eliminate the virus. It’s also a welfare issue.”Related: A chicken started gasping for air. Three days later, more than 60 birds were dead.After the last outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in 2015, the USDA determined “one of the most critical problems” was how long it took to kill an infected flock. Methods like water-based foam or carbon dioxide gassing can require outside contractors and supplies.This gave the virus, which spreads easily though farm equipment, clothing and even dust particles, more opportunity to circulate. With speed a priority, the USDA set a goal of depopulating birds within 24 to 48 hours by allowing farms to use a method called “ventilation shutdown plus.” Research shows this process takes around 2 hours.“A depopulation delay creates a serious biosecurity challenge for responders, who must consider sick birds, their feces, and everything in contact with those materials as infectious,” the federal agency says in its ventilation shutdown plus policy.This method involves sealing vents, pumping heat into barns and raising the temperature to between 104 and 110 degrees until the animals have died from hyperthermia. In some cases, carbon dioxide is also used.The American Veterinary Medical Association, which developed the depopulation guidelines, advises this should only be used in “constrained circumstances” when other methods are not available or the virus “poses a significant threat” of further spread.But analysis from the Animal Welfare Institute, an advocacy organization, found that over 81% of avian flu depopulations used ventilation shutdown plus through December 2023. It was also used to kill pigs when slaughterhouses were shuttered during the COVID-19 pandemic.“Unfortunately, it’s really become entrenched and a standard method,” said Gwendolen Reyes-Illg, a veterinary medicine consultant for the Animal Welfare Institute’s farm animal program.Related: Bird flu spreads to 3 more Michigan commercial dairy farmsMore than 2,000 veterinarians have signed a letter urging companies to use “less cruel” methods. And the Animal Welfare Institute has petitioned the USDA to make indemnity payments contingent on farms having “a plan for humanely depopulating animals.”In Michigan, though, commercial farms have leaned on ventilation shutdown plus.The three infected Muskegon County turkey farms used it, according to records obtained from Our Honor, an animal advocacy organization. And the USDA confirmed the millions of chickens depopulated in Ionia County died from ventilation shutdown plus.The USDA understands the concerns from animal rights advocates, spokesperson Shilo Wier said in an email, but ventilation shutdown can be “more effective and humane” than a process that takes longer because birds will also endure agonizing flu symptoms.“Ultimately, the producer may make the difficult decision to shut off the ventilation fans and heat the buildings in the operation to depopulate the birds quickly and end their suffering from the disease,” Weir said.Avian influenza still spreadingAfter two years and millions of dead birds, avian flu is not slowing down.At the end of March, the flu was detected for the first time in a herd of Texas dairy cattle – a surprise to scientists. Thousands of dead sea elephants lined an Argentinian beach after a large outbreak last fall. And it’s continued to sicken wild birds and mammals.“We see that the high path avian influenza strain kind of goes away when we hit winter,” Dodd said. “But we’ve had fairly mild winters and so we’ve continued to see it circulating across the country.”This worries Reyes-Illg.“I think that if we really were serious about wanting to rein in avian influenza, we would be looking at some of these big picture issues: vaccination, farm size, farm density and the conditions on the farm that make animals more at risk of infection and of infection spreading rapidly,” she said.To address the ongoing threat, the USDA started vaccine trials for several flu strains last year.But significant challenges remain in developing, approving and deploying a vaccine for domestic birds. For one, vaccinated birds might not get as sick, but they could still spread the virus. There are also trade restrictions on vaccinated poultry being imported or exported between countries.Related: A deadly bird flu raised egg prices. Michigan farms vigilantly protect flocks.For now, biosecurity remains king: keeping flocks away from wild birds, limiting visitors and disinfecting clothes, shoes, vehicles and farm equipment. The USDA calls it an “every day, every time” approach.“Our priority is really trying to ensure that we minimize interaction between wild birds and our domestic poultry flocks, including our backyard flocks as well,” Dodd said.Michigan poultry farms have been on high alert for over two years, deploying strict biosecurity measures like requiring workers to wear protective Tyvek suits, replacing dirt with concrete and fogging trucks with disinfectant. Boring says this hypervigilance is why Michigan had not seen a major outbreak until recent weeks.“This is a cautionary tale of ensuring that all those biosecurity practices remain in place and at the highest level,” he said.Read more statewide coverage from MLive7 things to know about Michigan’s extra 26,662 votes that had been unreportedKent County a ‘bluish shade of purple’ as voters split tickets in 2024 election Michigan readers react to results of the 2024 presidential race10 road closures to watch for this week in MichiganMichigan sets voter turnout record — but turnout shrank in 8 of 9 Democratic countiesIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Cynthia Goldsmith/CDC The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has been under pressure from scientists both at home and abroad to share more data on the H5N1 bird flu outbreaks in dairy cows, uploaded a large number of genetic sequences of the pathogen late Sunday. The excitement that news generated in the scientific community quickly gave way to frustration, though, when researchers who tried to start analyzing the sequences realized the files did not include any information about when the samples that generated the data were collected, or where. advertisement The expectation that the sequence data could help determine if the H5N1 virus has been changing as it transmitted from cow to cow and herd to herd gave way to a realization that it would do nothing of the sort. “The sequences — they just all look like the [original] Texas sequences,” said Tom Peacock, a flu virologist at Imperial College, London. “For all we know, they are all the [original] Texas sequences.” “The only date information is 2024. And that’s it.”advertisement Newsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy While the uploaded files included the type of animal from which the sample was collected, they didn’t include what part of the animal had been swabbed — a cow’s udder, for instance, or its nasal passages. In trying to assess whether cows are spreading the virus to one another the way human flu spreads, through viruses emitted from the nasal passages, that is critical information. The USDA announced it was uploading 239 genetic sequences taken from cattle, cats, chickens, a skunk, a raccoon, a grackle, a blackbird, and a goose. Some of the sequences in the new upload have actually been in international databases for several weeks, Peacock said, but most are newly shared. “Looking through them at the moment, there’s some interesting things going on there, but it makes it very, very hard to interpret what’s going on,” he said. The hope was that by sharing the viral sequences scientists who do not work for the USDA could help assess whether the dangerous virus has acquired mutations that might make it easier for it to spread to and among mammals. Peacock said the frustration he and others feel is amplified by reading or hearing claims from the USDA that suggest their assessment of the sequence data is that nothing concerning is happening to the virus, which has now been detected in 33 dairy herds in eight states. Related: What we know about H5N1 bird flu in cows — and the risk to humans “Epidemiology is show, don’t tell,” he said. “Show your work, please.” Rick Bright, a pandemic planning consultant who has been vocally critical of the USDA for being slow to share sequence data, noted the disclosure had “taken a long time.” On Sunday evening, he expressed gratitude for the government’s move. By Monday, he was expressing dismay about the limitations of the shared data. “It’s as if the USDA is intentionally trying to hide data from the world,” Bright, a former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and the former head of the Rockefeller Foundation’s now-defunct Pandemic Prevention Institute, wrote to STAT. The USDA announced on March 25 that it had confirmed H5N1 in dairy cows in Texas, a finding that has unsettled scientists who have followed this virus’ progression across the globe and into species after species of mammals. Until now, cows have not been among the animals seen to be infected by the virus. The department initially shared a number of sequences, all of which appeared to be from the original outbreak in Texas. While H5N1 is deadly to poultry and to a number of types of mammals, in cows it does not appear to cause severe illness. But milk production declines in infected cows and the milk produced is thick, off-color, and teeming with H5N1 viruses. Farmers have been told to destroy milk from infected cows. While the USDA believes the virus is spreading from cow to cow, it is as yet uncertain how it is transmitting. The agency said in an update last week to a frequently-asked-questions document posted on its website that it had not found “significant concentration of virus in respiratory related samples, which indicates to us that respiratory transmission is not a primary means of transmission.” It has suggested that transmission may be occurring through the milking process, perhaps through the sequential use of milking equipment or the movement of humans among farms.

By Ed Cara Published April 26, 2024 | Comments (12) | ð Copied! A pod of bottlenose dolphins. Image: Anita Kainrath (Shutterstock) Bird flu isnât just lurking inside cows, new research shows. Florida scientists have reported the first known case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in a common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). Though the case dates back to 2022, itâs the latest indication that these flu strains can potentially infect a wide variety of mammals. The report was published Friday in the Nature journal Communications Biology. According to the paper, the flu-infected dolphin was first identified on March 29, 2022. Researchers with the University of Floridaâs Marine Animal Rescue Program were notified of a dolphin that appeared to be in clear distress around the waters of Horseshoe Beach in North Florida. By the time they arrived, however, the dolphin had already died. It was subsequently packed in ice and taken to the university for an autopsy the following day. The post-mortem examination found signs of poor health and inflammation in the dolphinâs brain and meninges (the membrane layers that protect the brain and spinal cord). The dolphin tested negative for other common infectious causes of brain inflammation, which prompted the researchers to expand their search. They knew that wild birds can develop neuroinflammation from highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza, that several bird die-offs tied to the flu had occurred in the area recently, and that recent outbreaks had occurred among other populations of marine mammals elsewhere, so they decided to screen for it. Testing then revealed the presence of H5N1 within the dolphinâs lungs and brain. There have been sightingsof highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in other marine mammals lately, such as harbor seals and other species of dolphins. But this is the first reported case documented in a common bottlenose dolphin and the first report in any cetacean (dolphins and whales) within the waters of North America. Strains of bird flu are classified as highly pathogenic when they cause severe illness and deaths in wild birds, so itâs not necessarily a given that they will be as dangerous to other animals they infect. The current outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in cows, for instance, have caused generally mild illness to date. But strains belonging to this particular lineage of H5N1 (2.3.4.4b) have been deadly to marine mammals. The strain in this case did not appear to develop known genetic changes that would make it easier to infect and transmit between mammals, the authors found. But flu viruses mutate very quickly, leaving open the possibility that some strains will adapt and pick up the right changes that can make them a much bigger threat to mammals both on land and in the sea. âHuman health risk aside, the consequences of A(H5N1) viruses adapting for enhanced replication in and transmission between dolphins and other cetacea could be catastrophic for these populations,â the authors wrote. The researchers are continuing to investigate the case, hoping to pinpoint the origins of the dolphinâs infection and to better understand the potential for bird flu strains to successfully jump the species barrier to these marine mammals.

Sounding the alarm for a potential future crisis, scientists warn that the next pandemic might be caused by Disease X. Influenza, a familiar foe associated with seasonal illness, has emerged as a possible threat for this unpredictable and potentially devastating role. An international survey, to be published next weekend, will reveal that 57% of senior disease experts now believe a strain of influenza virus is the most likely cause of the next global outbreak of “deadly infectious illness.” Alappuzha: Ducks being killed en masse by the Animal Husbandry Department, following detection of avian influenza (bird�flu�H5N8) among�ducks�at four places, in Alappuzha district of Kerala, Friday, April 19,�2024. PTI Photo) (PTI04_19_2024_000485B)(PTI) Influenza can trigger the next pandemicThe World Health Organization (WHO) warns that seasonal flu isn't just a winter nuisance. Every year, flu affects an estimated 1 billion people worldwide, with millions more suffering from severe complications. Even worse, it claims hundreds of thousands of lives annually. The WHO emphasises the dangers of new flu strains, for which people have no immunity, urging us to take influenza seriously. Also read: ‘Haunting’ last words of the man who self-immolated during Trump's NYC trial: ‘Rotten truth of post-truth America’ Cologne University's Jon Salmanton-García's research backs up this concern. His research indicates that influenza is the biggest threat to the upcoming worldwide pandemic because of its continual evolution and mutation properties. “Each winter influenza appears, you could describe these outbreaks as little pandemics. They are more or less controlled because the different strains that cause them are not virulent enough – but that will not necessarily be the case forever.” He said as cited by the Guardian. Scientists warn of Disease XThe survey results will be announced at the ESCMID congress next weekend. The unidentified “DiseaseX” virus is seen as the next most likely pandemic-causing virus, after influenza, according to experts. Experts believe a new strain of this virus could emerge ‘out of the blue’ just like Covid-19, which claimed the lives of millions across the globe and still remains a threat. Also read: ‘100 times worse than Covid pandemic’: Experts on risk of H5N1 bird flu outbreak These concerning details come on the heels of the World Health Organization raising concerns about the alarming spread of the H5N1 strain of influenza spreading rapidly in parts of the US. The organisation has warned of an “unprecedented surge” in the number of cases. “This appears to be 100 times worse than Covid, or it could be if it mutates and maintains its high case fatality rate. Once it’s mutated to infect humans, we can only hope that the [fatality rate] drops.” John Fulton a pharmaceutical company consultant, said in a statement earlier. According to WHO records, the data highlights that since 2003, 52 out of every 100 patients infected with the H5N1 virus have died, resulting in a fatality rate exceeding 50 percent. This rate is comparatively much higher than the current COVID-19 fatality rate, which stands at 0.1 percent. Read breaking news, latest...

By Ed Cara Published April 24, 2024 | Comments (9) | ð Copied! A dairy cow. Photo: Alberto Menendez Cervero (Shutterstock) Food and Drug Administration officials reported this week that lab tests have found genetic material from strains of H5N1 avian influenza in samples of store-bought pasteurized milk. Officials say these samples do not appear to contain live virus and that the commercial milk supply should still be safe. But the results suggest that the virus has spread further across dairy farms than previously indicated. Researchers discovered H5N1 in store-bought milk using highly sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing, which looks for traces of genetic material belonging to a target germ. Importantly, these tests cannot be used to confirm the presence of live, infectious virus. The FDAâs early assessment is that these tests have only identified inert remnants of H5N1 in the milk. But the agency is now preparing to perform additional âgold standardâ tests to know for sure. At the same time, health officials continue to believe that commercial milk is unlikely to help spread H5N1 to humans. âThe FDA and USDA have indicated that based on the information currently available, our commercial milk supply is safe because of these two reasons: 1) the pasteurization process and 2) the diversion or destruction of milk from sick cows,â the agency said Tuesday in its latest update on the situation. To date, cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 in cows have been found in at least 30 farms across eight states. These strains are called highly pathogenic due to the massive illness and deaths that they can cause among wild and domestic birds. So far, infected cows have generally avoided severe illness, but many have experienced symptoms such as reduced or discolored milk production and low appetite. There have also been cases of H5N1 found in cats tied to these farm outbreaks, along with at least one human case. Genetic evidence released to the outside science community on Sunday suggests that the initial spillover event from birds to cows may have occurred as early as December 2023, months before the first known cases were reported by local officials. And, coupled with the discovery of H5N1 in store-bought milk, itâs now looking likely that outbreaks are much more widespread than currently tallied. âThe dissemination to cows is far greater than we have been led to believe,â Eric Topol, founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told CNN on Tuesday. The major worry with avian influenza strains such as H5N1 is that they could someday develop the right assortment of mutations that would allow the virus to spread easily between humans while also causing severe illness in many. So, the longer itâs able to remain in cows, the greater the likelihood that some strains will adapt and become better at transmitting between mammals, humans included. While our milk supply may be safe and the overall risk to humans remains low for now, these latest developments indicate that stopping H5N1 in its tracks before things can grow worse is not going to be easy.

Read on to know what warnings the global health body has issued. H5N1 Bird Flu Found in Raw Milk: Is Your Milk Safe? Written by Ankit Kumar |Updated : April 22, 2024 1:02 PM IST In a significant announcement on Saturday, the World Health Organisation (WHO) disclosed the discovery of the H5N1 bird flu virus strain in substantial quantities in raw milk obtained from infected animals. While the duration of the virus's survival in milk remains undetermined, this finding sheds light on the evolving nature of Avian influenza outbreaks. However, Health officials have emphasized that pasteurized milk, readily available in supermarkets, remains safe for consumption as it undergoes a process that eliminates harmful bacteria. H5N1 initially surfaced in 1996 and has since escalated dramatically. The surge in bird flu outbreaks since 2020 has resulted in the deaths of millions of wild birds and poultry worldwide. Alarmingly, the virus has begun infecting various mammals, including humans, cats, bears, foxes, mink, and even penguins. However, flu in cow milk are closely monitored and subject to further research.Bird Flu Outbreak In US: Should India Worry Too?This flu strain is also causing worry in India, notably in Kerala's Alappuzha district, where it's been identified in ducks. Authorities are on alert for the future spread of this deadly disease. The findings challenge what we knew about its spread. Wenqing Zhang, a member of the World Health Organization shared this during a press briefing in Geneva and said, "The case in Texas is the first case of a human infected by avian influenza by a cow,".The Animal Husbandry Department in Kerala is taking essential steps to control the spread of bird flu. They're upgrading labs, setting up diagnostic facilities, and using rapid tests in the field. It's advised to drink pasteurised milk from stores to avoid harmful bacteria. Bird flu, which affects birds, humans, and other animals, can be dangerous and spread quickly.

Understanding the Risks of Raw Milk During OutbreaksH5N1 flu, also known as avian influenza A (H5N1), is a virus that mostly affects birds but can also infect humans and other animals. It causes serious respiratory illness and can be fatal for humans. Now the question is if the virus can infect a person who is consuming an infected animal's milk. As per experts, - Yes! The virus spreads through close contact with infected birds or animals or their droppings like excretion, saliva or snot. If any of those gets into the milk supply, there's a risk of transmission. But pasteurisation of milk, where milk is boiled to high temperatures, kills viruses like H5N1. So, properly pasteurised milk is safe to drink, even if there are worries about the virus in the milk supply chain. You may like to read What are the symptoms of H5N1 flu?H5N1 flu symptoms are like regular flu, cough, diarrhoea, breathing issues, fever, headache, body pain, tiredness, runny nose, and throat pain. You can find it from touching infected bird poop, snot, or saliva. H5N1 started in birds but can also infect people, first found in Hong Kong in 1997. It spreads from wild birds to farm birds, but eating well-cooked poultry or eggs is safe. Health experts advise drinking pasteurised milk to stay safe from bird flu. TRENDING NOW Is It Safe To Drink Milk Right Now?The FDA and USDA say our milk supply is safe because of pasteurisation and measures to remove milk from sick cows. They heavily rely on a system and process that has worked well for years against various threats. Studies suggest pasteurisation kills viruses in milk, including the one causing concern at the moment. They're also studying milk production closely to confirm safety. The government is prorating these studies to keep milk safe and will share findings soon. bird flu news Bird flu symptoms cow milk H5N1 Virus Don’t Miss Out on the Latest Updates.

What experts say ByParmita Uniyal, New Delhi Apr 22, 2024 01:37 PM IST Read this news in brief form Share Via Copy Link With recent bird flu outbreaks, many wonder if everyday food items like milk and eggs pose a transmission risk. Here's what experts say. Amid bird flu outbreak in the US and UN body World Health Organization (WHO) confirming the presence of H5N1 bird flu strain in raw milk, concerns have been rising around consuming milk, chicken and eggs. As it has not been long since the world left behind the fears of coronavirus, the world dreads the emergence of avian influenza affecting humans. Bird flu spreads through direct contact with infected birds or their droppings; so far there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. A person in Texas recently tested positive for avian influenza making it a second case of H5N1 bird flu in the United States, the first one being a poultry worker in Colorado in 2022. This is also the case of first human being infected by H5N1 bird flu via a cow. (Also read | Bird flu outbreak in Kerala's Alappuzha: Should you be concerned? Symptoms, prevention tips of H5N1 flu) Bird flu primarily spreads among birds through their saliva, faeces, and respiratory secretions(Freepik) While the virus has been around since 1996, recent years since 2020 have seen a massive surge among birds and mammals, killing tens of millions of poultry, infections in wild birds and also land and marine mammals. However, in the recent outbreak, cows and goats have also been affected. "The case in texas is the first human infected by avian influenza by a cow," said Wenqing Zhang, head of the global influenza programme at the World Health Organization. Amid spread of H5N1 influenza virus is cows and poultry, is it safe to have eggs and milk? Here's what experts say. "Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected birds or their droppings. The virus is not typically transmitted through consumption of properly cooked eggs or pasteurized milk. When poultry products are cooked thoroughly, the heat kills the virus, making them safe to eat. However, it's important to practice good hygiene and ensure proper cooking and handling of poultry products to reduce any potential risk of infection. This includes washing hands thoroughly after handling raw poultry and avoiding cross-contamination with other foods," says Dr Rahul Agarwal Consultant Internal Medicine CARE Hospitals Hitech City Hyderabad. "With recent bird flu outbreaks, many wonder if everyday food items like milk and eggs pose a transmission risk. The good news is, contracting bird flu, also known as avian influenza, through these common breakfast staples is highly unlikely. Bird flu primarily spreads among birds through their saliva, faeces, and respiratory secretions," says Dr Neha Rastogi Panda, Consultant-Infectious Diseases, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram. Can people get infection from eggs and milk?While some rare human infections have occurred, these typically involve close contact with infected birds. So, can eggs or milk harbour the virus and reach you? "Eggs go through strict regulations and hygiene protocols during production and packaging. This significantly reduces the chance of contamination. The bigger factor is how you handle them at home. Thorough cooking is key – avoid runny yolks or dishes with undercooked eggs. Always wash your hands after handling them," says Dr Panda. "Milk safety hinges on pasteurization, a heat treatment that destroys viruses, including bird flu. Virtually all commercially available milk undergoes this process, making it safe for consumption. Raw milk, however, is a different story. While there's limited data on bird flu transmission through raw milk, it's generally discouraged due to the risk of other foodborne illnesses," adds the expert. If you're concerned about bird flu and your food, focus on safe handling practices. Cook eggs thoroughly and stick to pasteurized dairy products. It's also wise to stay updated on the outbreak from reputable sources like the CDC or national health agencies. "Remember, the risk of getting bird flu from eggs and milk is extremely low. By following basic hygiene and food safety measures, you can continue to enjoy these breakfast favourites without worry," concludes Dr Panda. Catch every big hit,...

How can we prepare? | SBS NewsSBSSBSNewsAudioLanguagesWhat's OnGuideFoodIndigenousSportMoreLogin/Sign upHelp CentreSearchNavigate to SBS on demandSBS NewsAustraliaExplainerH5N1 bird flu has now spread to every continent except Australia. How can we prepare?Is it only a matter of time before the H5N1 strain of bird flu reaches Australia, and what damage could it cause when it arrives?A new strain of H5N1, emerged in 2020 and has been causing record numbers of deaths among wild birds and domestic poultry in recent months. Source: Getty / Peter Garrard BeckKey PointsThe H5N1 strain of bird flu is spreading rapidly to new territories and species.It's yet to reach Australia, which is surprising, according to one expert.The strain is rarely seen in humans though the mortality rate is high.The H5N1 bird flu strain is in flight. It's infected more and more animal species, has now passed from a cow to a human, and has been detected in raw cow's milk. It's also reached new territories for the very first time, including South America and Antarctica. Associate Professor Kirsty Short, a virologist at the University of Queensland, said H5N1 is a particularly worrying strain."We're concerned at the rapidity at which H5N1 has spread and the fact that it's spread to places where previously avian flu was not present," she told SBS News. "It's a major ecological problem."So which animals are most at risk and how can we protect them? How dangerous is H5N1 for humans? And when is it expected to arrive in Australia?READ MOREWhy there's 'enormous concern' over the risk of bird flu spreading to humansWhich animals has H5N1 impacted?Avian influenza A (H5N1) first emerged in 1996 but since 2020, the number of outbreaks in birds has grown exponentially, alongside an increase in the number of infected mammals.The strain has led to the deaths of tens of millions of poultry, with wild birds and land and marine mammals such as seals and sea lions also infected.Cows and goats joined the list last month – a surprising development for experts because they were not thought to be susceptible to this type of influenza.The H5N1 bird flu strain has now been found in marine animals, cows and goats. Source: AAP / Charlie Litchfield/AP"Bird-to-cow, cow-to-cow and cow-to-bird transmission have also been registered during these current outbreaks, which suggest that the virus may have found other routes of transition than we previously understood," Wenqing Zhang, head of the global influenza program at the World Health Organization, told a media briefing in Geneva."Now we see multiple herds of cows affected in an increasing number of US states, which shows a further step of the virus spillover to mammals."Short explains that every new species the virus infects is an opportunity for it to adapt."The more mammalian species that we see infected, the more likely we are to see mammalian adaptations."Is H5N1 in Australia and what damage could it do?H5N1 is not yet here, which is "incredible" given it's carried in wild migrating birds, Short said"I'm perplexed as to why it's not here at the moment, and I'm hoping that that's a really positive sign, but I don't think we can bank on that. All it takes is a few wayward birds."The H5N1 strain of bird flu is spreading rapidly, appearing in new territories and new animal species.If it did arrive on our shores, H5N1 could cause significant disease among our wild birds and marine life, she added."We want to protect our poultry industry, but think about all the unique bird populations we have in Australia, and we know some of them are inherently susceptible to avian flu."Black swans, which breed mainly in southwest and southeast parts of the country, are one example."We did a study a couple of years back showing that black swans are really, really susceptible and it would be devastating if we lost them as a species."READ MOREAn 11-year-old girl has died from bird flu in Cambodia. Here's why the WHO is 'worried'How much are humans at risk from H5N1?While it's rare to see H5N1 in humans, the mortality rate when it appears is high.From 2003 to 1 April this year, the WHO said it had recorded 463 deaths from 889 human cases across 23 countries, putting the case fatality rate at 52 per cent.Though the human cases recorded in Europe and the United States in the past few years – since the virus surged – have been mild cases, Zhang notes.Infection is passed to humans through handling live infected birds, through contact with bird faeces or through slaughter, de-feathering or butchering infected birds, according to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.Earlier this month on a dairy farm in Texas, a cow passed avian flu to a human for the first time, according to the WHO.It was only the second case of a human testing positive for bird flu in the United States, and came after the virus sickened herds that were apparently exposed to wild birds.The virus may have found other routes of transition than we previously understood.Wenqing Zhang, head of the global influenza programme at the World Health OrganizationSo far, there is no evidence that H5N1 is spreading between humans.Short said the risk to humans at this point is "relatively low but still there".It's possible that H5N1 could one day be able to transmit efficiently between humans. Source: AAP"This virus has been around since the late nineties and it's never been able to transmit efficiently from human to human. "Whether or not that will change in the future, I don't know."Is there a bird flu vaccine?Zhang said there are close to 20 influenza vaccines licensed for pandemic use and they could be tailored to work against the specific virus strain in circulation.There are also antivirals that could be used to treat human infections, with new vaccines also in development."We are working on new vaccine strategies that can be rapidly rolled out specifically for this virus," Short explained. "There's a lot of really active research going on about this specific strain so that if something does happen, we are prepared. "What about H5N1 in milk?The virus has also been detected in raw milk from infected animals in "very high virus concentrations", Zhang said, but experts were still investigating exactly how long the virus is able to survive in milk.Bird flu strain H5N1 has been found in raw milk taken from infected animals. Source: Getty / Getty ImagesThe Texas health department has said the cattle infections do not present a concern for the commercial milk supply, as dairies are required to destroy milk from sick cows. Pasteurisation also kills the virus."It is important for people to ensure safe food practices, including consuming only pasteurised milk and milk products," Zhang said.What can Australians do?Mitigating the risks is about constant surveillance and vigilance, Short said."We're looking at what an outbreak here would that look like, how we would protect our poultry populations, how we would protect our wild bird populations and how we would protect people working in the sector. "It's about having those preparedness plans worked out now when we have the luxury of time."Short advised the public, and chicken farmers in particular, to be aware but not alarmed."The message to get out to the public is if you do see a dead bird report it, it's probably nothing. But we just need the community to act as part of the surveillance so we know it is coming into the country."And if farmers do have sick chickens or experience a drop in egg production, take note of it. "This virus isn't in Australia at the moment. So there's nothing other than being vigilant that we can really do."- With Agence France-PresseShare6 min readPublished 22 April 2024 5:34amBy Caroline RichesSource: SBS NewsAvailable in other languagesTagsHealthHealth and WellbeingBird fluAustraliaWorld Health OrganizationShare this with family and friendsCopy linkShareRecommended for youQueensland election: David Crisafulli claims victory for LNP, ending Labor's nine-year reignqueensland state election'Embarrassing and disrespectful': Lidia Thorpe faces backlash over King Charles protestindigenous peoplesThis bright comet is still visible in Australia, but not for long.

The United Nations health agency said the avian influenza A, or H5N1 bird flu virus strain, has also been detected in very high concentrations in raw milk from infected animals, though it is not known how long the virus can survive in milk. The H5N1 strain was first detected in birds in 1996 and has primarily been a threat to farmed and wild fowl. Since 2020, however, the number of outbreaks in birds has grown exponentially, alongside an increase in the number of infected mammals. This contact with mammalian populations has led WHO’s chief scientist Jeremy Farrar to sound alarm bells. Nevertheless, while humans have been infected with this flu strain – usually through contact with infected birds and livestock – there is currently no evidence to show that it can be spread from human to human. TODAY looks at the global bird flu outbreak, how Singapore has remained bird flu-free, what might happen if the country faces infections and what precautions ought to be taken to prevent this. HOW WORRYING IS THE CURRENT BIRD FLU SITUATION? While there is currently no evidence of human-to-human spread of the virus, in cases where humans have been infected through contact with animals, the mortality rate has been “extraordinarily high”, Dr Farrar has said. Between the start of 2023 and April 1 this year, the WHO recorded 463 deaths from 889 human cases across 23 countries. This puts the case fatality rate at 52 per cent. Furthermore, Dr Farrar said that the virus’ contact with the mammalian population means it’s “getting closer to humans” and warned that the virus is “just looking for new, novel hosts”. He expressed “great concern” that it may also critically evolve towards human-to-human transmission. “We have to watch – more than watch – we have to make sure that if H5N1 did come across to humans with human-to-human transmission, that we were in a position to immediately respond with access equitably to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics,” said Dr Farrar. In Singapore, there are currently no known cases of the H5N1 bird flu. Dr Paul Tambyah, president of the International Society for Infectious Diseases, told TODAY: “In terms of natural spillover, I am not very concerned about the current strain as this has occurred many times in the past with previous strains which were far more fatal in humans.” He also pointed out that the disease has remained endemic, with relatively low numbers of cases in humans, in this region. HOW HAS SINGAPORE REMAINED BIRD FLU-FREE? Dr Tambyah said that Singapore has remained free from highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza mainly due to its strict biosecurity measures and surveillance. The country also benefits from comprehensive animal vaccination programmes in other countries in the region – which have kept the number of infections down in domestic birds – and biosecurity programmes which have managed to keep infected wild birds from contaminating domestic flocks. “To be honest, however, I think that both (Singapore and Malaysia) have been fortunate in that H5N1 does not appear to be that rapidly transmissible outside of the cramped conditions of ‘factory farms’, which are relatively easy to control,” said Dr Tambyah. However, he cautions that this might change if scientists decide to modify the virus to become more transmissible, with the aim of developing rapid vaccines and treatments for the novel strain. In 2019, Science Magazine, an academic journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, reported about controversial lab studies that modify bird flu viruses in ways that could make them more risky to humans. Advocates of such studies say that the research can help public health experts better understand how viruses might spread, so they can plan for pandemics. “But by enabling the bird virus to more easily spread among mammals, the experiments also raised fears that the pathogen could jump to humans,” the report said. “And critics of the work worried that such a souped-up virus could spark a pandemic if it escaped from a lab or was intentionally released by a bioterrorist.” Nevertheless, Dr Tambyah said he believes such a scenario is unlikely, as there are renewed efforts to ensure good lab safety. In the case of an unfortunate accident, there are also protocols in place to monitor lab scientists and to ensure that any exposure is screened and protected, he added. WHAT PRECAUTIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN LOCALLY? On how an outbreak might impact Singapore, Dr Tambyah said that the Republic’s diversification of its food supply means that it will be less vulnerable to a shutdown in beef or chicken supplies from one or two major countries. According to the Singapore Food Agency’s (SFA) Singapore Food Statistics 2022 report, Singapore can import poultry from 30 countries, processed eggs from 26 countries and shell eggs from 17 countries. Beyond diversifying import sources, Dr Tambyah pointed out that Singapore also has good links with its neighbouring countries. This allows them to share resources that can protect their people from a range of infectious diseases, including but not limited to bird flu. Still, precautions ought to be taken to guard against infections. On a national level, the authorities will need to continue supporting the ongoing biosurveillance work of different agencies, such as the SFA, the National Environment Agency, and the Animal & Veterinary Service, said Dr Tambyah. In December last year, for example, Singapore suspended its import of raw poultry and poultry products from several regions in countries affected by an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza. The Mandai Wildlife Group – which operates Bird Paradise, Night Safari, River Wonders and Singapore Zoo – said on its website that it also works closely with the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority to take precautionary measures against bird flu. This includes the implementation of “stringent bio-security measures” at its parks, such as vaccinating all birds that are free ranged and exposed to the public, and giving flu injections to its staff. The parks also conduct periodic bird flu drills for its staff and train them to monitor the birds daily for symptoms of illness, said Mandai Wildlife Group. To date, there have been no known cases of bird flu in any of the parks or in the country, it added. At an individual level, Dr Tambyah said that Singaporeans should be sensible in avoiding contact with sick birds or animals. They should also practise good hand hygiene when handling animals at petting zoos, farmstays or other similar places. Should one fall sick, he or she should also seek medical attention promptly, he added.
