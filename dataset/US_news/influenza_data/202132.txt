HPAI H7N9 viruses bearing NA I222L or E119V substitution and two mutations of I222L-E119V as well as their NAIs-sensitive counterpart were generated by reverse genetics for NA inhibition test and replication capability evaluation in vitro. The attenuated H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses were developed to study the pathogenicity and drug resistance brought by the above substitutions to mice. The IC50 fold change of oseltamivir to HPAI H7N9 with NA222L-119V is 306.34 times than that of its susceptible strain, and 3.5 times than the E119V mutant virus. HPAI H7N9 bearing NA222L-119V had good replication ability with peak value of more than 6log10 TCID50/ml in MDCK cells. H7N9/PR8 virus bearing NA222L-119V substitutions leaded to diffuse pneumonia, significant weight loss and fatality in mice. NA E119V made H7N9/PR8 virus resistant to oseltamivir, and I222L-E119V had synergistic resistance to oseltamivir in mice. Due to the good fitness of drug resistant strains of HPAI H7N9 virus, it is necessary to strengthen drug resistance surveillance and new drug research.

As the mutant of H7N9, HPAI H7N9 virus is characterized by the insertion of polybasic amino acids at the cleavage of its hemagglutinin (HA) protein4,5. Although the mortality of HPAI H7N9 virus in laboratory confirmed human cases is not significantly higher to that of its low pathogenic (to birds) counterpart, the former seems to have a shorter course of disease and more severe clinical symptoms6.Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are the only way to treat influenza infection in most countries in the world currently7. The approved NAIs in China, included oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir, and most H7N9 patients received oseltamivir1,8,9,10. Laninamivir, as well as the polymerase inhibitor baloxavir marboxil, which were recently approved by some countries/areas, are possible antiviral options against influenza infection11,12,13. Due to the poor error correction ability of the single stranded RNA virus14, influenza virus is prone to adaptive mutation for survival15. Early use of appropriate NAIs can prevent mice infected with lethal dose of H7N9 virus from severe weight loss and death16. However, amino acid mutation at the key site of neuraminidase (NA) may lead to reduced susceptibility of influenza virus to NAIs and thus weaken the therapeutic effect17. There are 19 highly conserved residues in the NA active site of all influenza A and B viruses. These include eight catalytic residues (R118, D151, R152, R224, E276, R292, R371, and Y406) that directly contact the sialic acid (SA) and 11 framework residues (E119, R156, W178, S179, D198, I222, E227, H274, E277, N294, and E425) that support the enzymatic binding pocket18,19. When the conserved amino acids in the NA active site of influenza virus mutated, the susceptibility to NAIs may be reduced. NA R292K substitution could lead to resistance among multiple NA subtypes of influenza virus, but other resistance mutation sites may be subtype-specific20,21. Recombinant N9 proteins bearing substitutions showed that R292K, H274Y conferred high increase in oseltamivir half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), and E119D conferred high zanamivir IC50. Additionally, R152Kof A (H7N9) virus conferred reduced inhibition by laninamivir22.Our previous research found that the rate of strains isolated from human with reduced susceptibility to NAIs in HPAI H7N9 virus was high23. HPAI H7N9 viruses with reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors (NA R292K, E119V or H274Y) showed good replication capacity in mammalian cells24. Interestingly, NA 119V or D substitutions in HPAI H7N9 showed reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir and zanamivir respectively24. Like E119 amino acids, I222 amino acids are also located in the frame region of NA, and it has been reported that I222 substitutions combined with other frame region resistance sites have been detected in seasonal influenza cases25,26. In this study, we want to test if the two framework mutations (E119V and I222L) of NA could coexist in HPAI H7N9 virus, and study its effect on viral fitness and drug resistance effect in mammalian cells and mice. ResultsGeneration of recombinant virusesIn this study, A/Guangdong/17SF006/2017 (H7N9) was used as a backbone. The NAIs-sensitive HPAI H7N9 virus constructed by reverse genetics containing NA 119E, 222I, was called rg006NA. The HPAI H7N9 reassortment viruses bearing substitutions were called rg006NA119V, rg006NA222L and rg006NA222L-119V according to their mutations.The H7N9/PR8 reassortment virus and its NA mutants were called rg006NA/PR8, rg006NA119V/PR8, rg006NA222L/PR8 and rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 respectively. The sequencing of H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses showed that 339–342KRTA polybasic amino acids in HA had been knocked out correctly, and all the six internal genes were from PR8. The four recombinant H7N9/PR8 viruses of rg006NA/PR8, rg006NA119V/PR8, rg006NA222L/PR8 and rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 were cultured at 35 °C for 48 h at a dilution of 10–1–10–6, and none were lethal to 9–11 day embryonated chicken eggs. The results of trypsin dependence test showed that all the four H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses could not replicate without TPCK-trypsin, suggesting that the virus was dependent on TPCK-trypsin. The results showed that the recombinant H7N9/PR8 virus was attenuated successfully.The recombinant viruses used in this study were confirmed by sequencing and listed in Supplementary Table S1.Assessment of susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitorsThe susceptibility of HPAI H7N9 reassortment viruses to NAIs was assessed (Table 1). The substitution of E119V in the NA protein induced a mean 88.03-fold and 6.12-fold increase in the IC50 of oseltamivir (mean IC50 (nM) ± SD, 141.73 ± 10.52) and zanamivir (mean IC50 (nM) ± SD, 11.81 ± 0.32) respectively. The IC50 fold change of oseltamivir or zanamivir to rg006NA222L were 4.50 and 2.46 times respectively, which did not meet the phenotype resistance standard. However, when I222L and E119V substitutions coexist in the NA protein of HPAI H7N9 virus, the IC50 fold change of oseltamivir to rg006NA222L-119V is 306.34 (mean IC50 (nM) ± SD, 493.20 ± 29.10) times than that of its susceptible strain, and 3.5 times than that of the E119V single point mutant virus. The result showed that NA I222L-E119V substitutions had synergistic resistance effect to oseltamivir for HPAI H7N9 virus. On the other hand, rg006NA222L-119V induced a mean 7.53-fold increase in the IC50 of zanamivir, which is similar to the value of E119V single point mutant virus. Besides, the fold change of IC50 value of all the three mutant viruses to peramivir and laninamivir was less than 10, suggesting normal inhibition.Table 1 Susceptibility of mutant recombinant highly pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza virus to neuraminidase inhibitors.Full size tableGrowth characteristics of mutant viruses in MDCK cellsTo test the effect of the NAIs resistance mutations on the growth characteristics of the HPAI H7N9 virus, we determined infectious titers in MDCK cells. MDCK cells were infected with rg006NA, rg006NA119V, rg006NA222L and rg006NA222L-119V virus by 0.001 MOI. At time points 0, 18, 24, 48, 72 and 96hpi, viral titers were determined on MDCK cells. Rg006NA and rg006NA119V virus showed similar replication level in MDCK cells at different time points (P > 0.05) (Fig. 1). The replication level of rg006NA222L was lower than that of rg006NA in 18 and 24hpi (#P < 0.05), but they showed similar replication level after 48hpi in MDCK cells. Replication peak value of rg006NA222L-119V reached more than 6log10 TCID50/ml in 48 h although its replication level was lower than that of rg006NA(*P < 0.05). The results showed that rg006NA222L-119V, the two sites mutant virus with synergistic drug resistance effect to NAIs, had good replication ability in mammalian cells though lower than that of the sensitive strain.Figure 1Replication kinetics of mutant recombinant highly pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza viruses in MDCK cells. Cells were inoculated with the recombinant viruses at 37 °C, and culture supernatants were harvested at 0, 18, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post-inoculation (hpi). Virus titers were determined on MDCK cells. Growth curve of rg006NA in MDCK cells was in blue, round; rg006NA119V virus was in red, square; rg006NA222L virus was in orange, triangle; rg006NA222L-119V virus was in black, triangle. Each data point represents the mean log10 ± SD TCID50/ml from at least two independent tests. #P < 0.05. *P < 0.05.Full size imagePathogenicity in miceThe body weight curve and survival condition of 8-week-old female C57 mice infected with 101–106 TCID50 recombinant H7N9/PR8 viruses are shown in Fig. 2.When infection at a lower dose (≤ 104 TCID50), all mice infected with these four strains survived except one mouse in the 104 TCID50 rg006NA222L/PR8 group (Fig. 2A–D). Rg006NA119V-222L/PR8 viruses showed no obvious weight loss at lower dose (≤ 104 TCID50) (Fig. 2A–D). However, When the infection dose reached105–106 TCID50, all the four viruses could lead to significant weight loss and fatality in mice (Fig. 2E,F). There was no significant difference in the survival day of mice among the four viruses from 101 TCID50–106 TCID50 (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference of hazard ratio between the mutant virus (rg006-NA119Vg006NA222L/PR8g006NA119V-222L/PR8) and rg006NA/PR8 (P > 0.05).The survival ratio of rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 virus at 105–106 TCID50 was 0% (the same as rg006NA222L/PR8), which was even lower than that of rg006NA (105 TCID50: 40%; 106 TCID50: 20%) and rg006NA119V (105 TCID50: 20%; 106 TCID50: 20%) (Table 2).Figure 2Body weight curve and survival condition of mice infected with different doses of H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses.

ANOVA test was used to analyze the difference of viral load of the 4 strains in different tissues (lung and trachea) at different time points (1, 3, 5, 7, 14 dpi) and the result showed that there was no significant difference among the 4 viruses (P > 0.05) except that in lung tissue 1dpi (#P < 0.05) of the 105 TCID50 group (Fig. 3B). When administered with 104 TCID50 of the 4 viruses, the viral load in trachea of the mice infected with rg006NA/PR8 and rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 was higher at 3dpi than that at 1dpi (*P < 0.05), which indicated viral replication, and on 5dpi, no viral load was detected in trachea. When administered with 105 TCID50, the viral load in trachea of the mice decreased from 1 to 3 dpi, and on 5dpi it could only be detected in one mouse in the rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 and the rg006NA222L/PR8 group respectively. And on 7 dpi, no viral load was detected in trachea of all the mice. When administered with 104 TCID50 or 105 TCID50 of the 4 viruses, the viral load in lungs of mice was high at 1 dpi and 3 dpi, and then decreased from 5 dpi. On 7 dpi, viral load in lung could only been detected in one mouse infected with rg006NA/PR8, rg006NA222L/PR8 or rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 virus in the 105 TCID50 dose group respectively. On 14 dpi, no virus load was detected in lungs of all the mice. In general, the viral load in the respiratory tract of mice infected with rg006NA/PR8, rg006NA119V/PR8, rg006NA222L/PR8 and rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 virus bore out similar trend.Figure 3Replication of H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses in the respiratory tract of mice. C57BL/6 mice (n = 3ime-point) were inoculated intranasal with 104 TCID50 (A) or 105 TCID50 (B) of the H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses. Mice were euthanized at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 dpi. Viral titers in the lung (lu) or tracts (tr) were determined on MDCK cells. *P < 0.05. #P < 0.05.Full size imageThrough the detection of HA antibody in mouse serum (serum antibody titer shown in Supplementary Table S2), we calculated that the mouse infective dose of 50% animals (MID50) of rg006NA/PR8, rg006NA119V/PR8, rg006NA222L/PR8 and rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 was 0.83 TCID50, 1 TCID50, 0.83 TCID50 and 1.38 TCID50 respectively. The results showed that the infectivity of the four viruses to mice was similar and all of them can infect mice at a low dose.Lungs of mice infected with 104 and 105 TCID50 viruses on 3dpi were studied for pathology. In Fig. 4A, the lung tissue of PBS control group of mice showed normal shape without obvious change. The lung tissues infected with the 4 viruses showed inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar injury and other pathological changes. At 104 TCID50, there were some inflammatory cells in lung tissues of mice infected with the four viruses. At 105 TCID50, all the lung tissues infected with the 4 viruses exhibited much inflammatory infiltration and extensive pneumonia. Immunohistochemistry results shown in Fig. 4B, there is no NP antigen distribution in the lung tissue of PBS control group mice. After 104 TCID50 doses of infection, the lung tissues infected with the 4 viruses were stained with scattered NP antigens. A large number of NP antigens were found in lung tissues infected with the 4 viruses when infected with 105 TCID50, which were widely distributed.Figure 4Pathological changes of lung tissue in mice infected with H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses. The lung tissues of mice infected with 104–105 TCID50H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses were stained by hematoxylin and eosin ((A) HE × 20) and NP antigen ((B) IHC × 20) 3 days after infection. Control group: PBS.Full size imageIn conclusion, rg006NA/PR8, rg006NA119V/PR8, rg006NA222L/PR8 and rg006NA222L-119 V/PR8 viruses had similar pathogenicity to mice.Synergistic resistance to oseltamivir in miceWe infected mice with 2MLD50 of the 4 viruses. As shown in Fig. 5, administrated with oseltamivir 20 mg/kg/day by gavage could prevent rg006NA/PR8 or rg006NA222L/PR8 infected mice from much body weight loss and fatality (Fig. 5A,B,E,F). The survival day of rg006NA/PR8 and rg006NA222L/PR8 infected mice given oseltamivir treatment was longer than their non-treatment counterparts (*P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the survival day of rg006NA119V/PR8 and rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 infected mice in oseltamivir or non-treatment group (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference of hazard ratio between the oseltamivir-treated and non-treated group of all the four viruses (P > 0.05) (Table3). The rg006NA119V/PR8 infected mice by oseltamivir administration had a slight alleviation of body weight loss and fatality compared with the non-medication group (Fig. 5C,D). However, the rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 infected mice got the resemble body weight loss no matter whether or not to give oseltamivir treatment (Fig. 5G). The mortality rate of rg006NA222L-119 V/PR8 mice with or without drug administration was 60% and 80% respectively (Fig. 5H). The results showed that oseltamivir had poor therapeutic effect on rg006NA119V/PR8 and even poorer therapeutic effect on rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 virus, which could not effectively protect mice from weight loss and death.Figure 5Body weight curve and survival condition of mice infected with H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses treated with oseltamivir phosphate. The C57 mice were infected with 2MLD50 rg006NA/PR8, rg006NA119V/PR8, rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 and rg006NA222L/PR8 (n = 5/group). The mice in the drug treatment group were given 20 mg/kg/day oseltamivir phosphate by gavage from 0 to 4 dpi, and the mice in the non-drug group were given PBS by gavage from 0 to 4 dpi. On the day of infection, the mice in the control group were given PBS, and then the mice were given 20 mg/kg/day oseltamivir phosphate by gavage.

The rg006NA/PR8 infected mice had significantly lower viral load in lung by oseltamivir administrated than the non-medication group (2, 4 and 6 dpi, P < 0.05, Fig. 6A). There is no difference of viral load in lung between the treated and the non-treated mice which infected with rg006NA119V/PR8 or rg006NA222L/PR8 until 6 dpi (P < 0.05, Fig. 6B, C). Mice infected with rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 virus had similar viral load in lung at 2, 4 and 6 dpi no matter whether given oseltamivir or not (Fig. 6D). At 2 and 4 days of oseltamivir administration, the viral load of rg006NA119V/PR8 infected mice was higher than the rg006NA/PR8 group (P < 0.05, Fig. 6E). At 6 days of oseltamivir administration, the viral load of rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 infected mice was higher than the rg006NA/PR8, rg006NA119V/PR8 or rg006NA222L/PR8 group (P < 0.05, Fig. 6E). Figure 6Viral load of lung tissue of mice infected with H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses treated with oseltamivir phosphate. The lung tissues of C57 mice infected with 2MLD50 H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses were titrated 2, 4 and 6 dpi (n = 3ime-point). Mice in the drug treatment group: 20 mg/kg/day oseltamivir phosphate by gavage from 0 to 4dpi; Mice in the non-drug group: PBS by gavage from 0 to 4 dpi. (A–D) Comparison of mice infected with H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses in the drug treatment group or non-drug group. (E) Comparison of mice infected with rg006NA/PR8 (NA), rg006NA119V/PR8 (119V) and rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 (222L-119 V) virus after oseltamivir administration. *P < 0.05. #P < 0.05. ##P < 0.05. ###P < 0.05.Full size imageFour days after infection, lungs of rg006NA/PR8, rg006NA119V/PR8, rg006NA222L/PR8 and rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 infected mice with oseltamivir administration were taken for pathological observation. By HE staining (Fig. 7A), without medication, mice infected with the four viruses all developed diffuse pneumonia with a large number of inflammatory cell infiltration. Under the condition of oseltamivir, only a small number of inflammatory cells were found in the lung of rg006NA/PR8 infected mice which was obviously milder inflammatory than the non-drug group. As to rg006NA222L/PR8 virus, after drug treatment, the pathological changes of lung in mice were significantly alleviated. However, there was no significant difference in lung pathological damage between the oseltamivir-treated and non-treated mice which infected with rg006NA119V/PR8 and rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 virus. As a PBS control group, oseltamivir by gavage made no obvious pathological changes in the lung tissue of mice.Figure 7Pathological changes of lung tissue of mice infected with H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses treated with oseltamivir phosphate. The lung tissues of mice infected with H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses were stained by hematoxylin and eosin ((A) HE × 20) and NP antigen ((B) IHC × 20) 4 days after infection. Ose (oseltamivir treatment group): 2MLD50 rg006NA/PR8, 20 mg/kg/day, rg006NA119V/PR8, rg006NA222L/PR8 or rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 infection, oseltamivir phosphate by gavage from 0 to 4 dpi; PBS(control group): 2MLD50 rg006NA/PR8, 20 mg/kg/day, rg006NA119V/PR8, rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 or rg006NA222L/PR8 infection, PBS by gavage from 0 to 4 dpi. Control group, PBS, 20 mg/kg/day oseltamivir phosphate by gavage from 0 to 4dpi.Full size imageThe distribution of NP antigen was consistent with the above result, that the use of oseltamivir reduced the lung antigens in mice infected with rg006NA/PR8 and rg006NA222L/PR8 (Fig. 7B), but did not significantly reduce the antigens in mice infected with rg006NA119V/PR8 and rg006NA222L-119V/PR8. As a PBS control group, there is no antigen in the lung tissue of mice.In all, E119V substitution in NA made the H7N9/PR8 reassortment virus resistant to oseltamivir in mice. What’s more, NA substitutions of I222L and E119V had synergistic resistance effect on the H7N9/PR8 reassortment virus to oseltamivir in mice.DiscussionGenerally, when influenza viruses possess drug resistant mutations, their replication level in cells or their pathogenicity to animals may be reduced to varying degrees, especially when mutations occur in catalytic residues that directly contact the sialic acid (SA)19,27. After a single site mutation of R292K, the enzyme activity of HPAI H7N9 virus decreased significantly and its replication ability decreased to some extent19. According to the substitution with reduced susceptibility to NAIs detected in HPAI H7N9 cases24, we used reverse genetic technology to develop double sites mutant HPAI H7N9 viruses carrying I222L-119V, H274Y-R292K and E119V-R292K, but only the enzyme activity of rg006NA222L-119V virus was enough to perform the NA inhibition test.Seasonal influenza viruses bearing two mutations in the frame region of NA had been report before. A H3N2 virus possessing the mutations E119V-I222V, isolated from human cases and induced a synergistic effect on oseltamivir resistance test in vitro26. Besides, prophylactic treatment with oseltamivir had failed in two H1N1 with H274Y-I222M mutations infected patients25. These results show that the two site mutations in the framework region can coexist in influenza viruses, and some of them have synergistic drug resistance effect. However, these studies are limited to clinical discovery or cell level studies of seasonal influenza viruses, and there are few studies of influenza virus with double resistance sites in a mouse model. The E119 residue is conserved among all influenza A viruses and forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group on the C-4 of sialic acid28 and with the amino group on C-4 of oseltamivir29. E119A/D/G/I/V substitutions have been examined conferring resistance to NAIs in influenza viruses of various subtypes22,24,30,31,32,33,34. And in this study, E119V substitution in HPAI H7N9 virus induced a mean 88.03-fold increase in the IC50 of oseltamivir. The I222 residue is a conserved residue in NA of influenza viruses and I222V/M/L/R/T substitutions had been reported with the N1, N2, and B backgrounds conferring moderate resistance to oseltamivir31,33,34,35,36. However, NA I222L substitution of HPAI H7N9 did not lead to drug resistance to oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir and laninamivir according to WHO-AVWG criteria. In this study, the two mutations of E119V-I222L were chosen to study the synergistic drug resistance of HPAI H7N9 virus in mice. The IC50 fold change of oseltamivir to rg006NA222L-119V is 306.34 times than that of its susceptible strain, and 3.5 times than that of the E119V single point mutant virus, which showed synergistic resistance effect. A crystal structure model of the NA monomer of the A/Anhui/1/2013 H7N9 virus (PDB ID: 4MWJ) was used to display and label the two mutations (E119V and I222L) in H7N9 virus (seen in Supplementary Fig. S1). Both 119V and 222L which located around the catalytic sites of NA were framework sites that interact with catalytic residues to stabilize the active site.NAIs development is structure-based drug design37. As a surface glycoprotein with enzyme activity, NA is an ideal target for the design of competitive inhibitors38. NAIs bind to the NA active site with a higher affinity than the natural SA and prevent the release of new virions from infected cells39. Oseltamivir (oseltamivir phosphate) is taken orally and then converted to its active form (oseltamivir carboxylate) to disseminate systemically. The recommended oral dose for adolescents and adults is 75 mg oseltamivir twice daily for 5 days40. Excessive concentration of oseltamivir is not conducive to antiviral treatment16,41,42,43. The concentration of oseltamivir selected in this study is 20 mg/kg/day, which is feasible and effective in this study. Consistent with the result of NA inhibition test in vitro, E119V-I222L in N9 from HPAI H7N9 virus have synergistic drug resistance effect to oseltamivir in mice (Figs. 5, 6). When infected at 104 TCID50, the pathogenicity of the rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 virus to mice is slightly lower (less weight loss) compared with rg006NA119V/PR8, rg006NA222L/PR8 and their sensitive strain (Fig. 2D), which is basically the same as that on MDCK cells (Fig. 1). Significantly, when the infection dose reached105–106 TCID50, rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 (and rg006NA222L/PR8) virus even lead to more weight loss and fatality rate than that of rg006NA/PR8 and rg006NA119V/PR8 in mice (Fig. 2E,F). It had been reported that NA-I222K/R substitution of A (H7N9) made the virus more virulent (weight loss and survival rate) in mice but not in MDCK cells44, which was consistent with our study. It was suggested that NA I222L substitution made rg006NA222L-119V/PR8 virus more virulent in mice. Generally speaking, there was no significant difference in the survival day (101 TCID50–106 TCID50), lungrachea virus load and lung pathological changes among the four virus infection mice groups. The N9 E119V-I222L virus which had synergistic drug resistance effect did not seriously damage of its fitness in mice.In terms of bio-safety and practical conditions, the recombinant viruses used in the mouse experiment were attenuated. Compared with their corresponding HPAI H7N9 viruses, the replication ability on MDCK cells of the attenuated H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses decreased to some extent (data not shown). The pathogenicity of the H7N9/PR8 viruses was weaker than their corresponding HPAI H7N9 viruses in mice. This is one of the limitations of this study. However, the H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses developed in this study could replicate in respiratory tract of C57 mice and lead to pneumonia, weight loss and even death, indicating the C57 mice infected with H7N9/PR8 recombinant viruses with reduced susceptibility to NAIs were feasible model for the study on the mechanism of HPAI H7N9 NAIs resistance and the preliminary selection of alternative drugs.In summary, although NA I222L did not lead HPAI H7N9 virus to drug resistance itself, it could increase the resistance of HPAI H7N9 virus with NA E119V without severely impaired fitness in vitro. Consistent with results in vitro, substitutions of I222L and E119V in neuraminidase from HPAI H7N9 influenza virus exhibited a synergistic resistance effect to oseltamivir without significantly reduced pathogenicity in mice. Due to the good fitness of drug resistant strains of HPAI H7N9 virus, it is necessary to strengthen drug resistance surveillance, as well as research and application of new drugs.Materials and methodsAll experiments including any relevant details were approved by designated institution and/or licensing committee, and all experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines.Generation of recombinant virusesThe generation of HPAI H7N9 recombinant viruses was described in Tang et al.24. In short, HPAI H7N9 A/Guangdong/17SF006/2017 (abbreviated as 006) isolated from a human case was used as backbone virus. All eight gene segments of 006 strain were artificially synthesized (Sangon Biotech) and cloned into the pHW2000 vector. The NAIs sensitive HPAI H7N9 reassortant virus encoded 222I and 119E in the NA protein. A single-point mutation was introduced to convert 119E to 119V or 222I to 222L in NA. Then, in the 119V background, single-point mutations I222L in the NA gene were carried out. E119V or I222L substitutions were generated with the following primers: NA E119V Forward, gtcgcatgaaacatagggtactcttgtgactaaaacatc, NA E119V Reverse, gatgttttagtcacaagagtaccctatgtttcatgcgac, NA I222L Forward, acacatgggcccgaaacttactaagaacacaggaa, NA I222L Reverse, ttcctgtgttcttagtaagtttcgggcccatgtgt. Mutations were introduced into the NA plasmid using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). HPAI H7N9 reassortment viruses were used to examine the effect of NA amino acid substitutions on NAIs susceptibility and viral replication efficiency in vitro.Considering the bio-safety and actual conditions, attenuated H7N9 reassortment viruses were prepared to evaluate the pathogenicity and drug resistance in mice. The internal six genes of the attenuated virus were from A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). The HA gene was from 006strain after deletion of its highly pathogenic molecular markers (KRTA in 339–342 residue). The recombinant H7N9/PR8 attenuated virus was prepared by transfection of the above seven plasmids and 006 NA plasmids. HA 339–342KRTA deletion was generated with the following primers: HAdel Forward, caaataggcctcttctctttggaacctcaggaacattc, HAdel Reverse, gaatgttcctgaggttccaaagagaagaggcctatttg. The recombinant virus was generated by reverse genetics. In general, the eight plasmids were co-transfected into 293T/MDCK co-cultured monolayer for 72 h45,46. Supernatants in culture flask were inoculated in embryonated eggs at 35 °C. Hemagglutination test was used for detection of positive viruses. Virus stocks were sequenced for verification, and virus titrations were determined with MDCK cells. The log10 TCID50/ml was calculated by Reed and Muench method.The recombinant H7N9/PR8 virus was evaluated as follows: (1) Virus sequencing: confirm whether each gene is correct and knock out of polybasic amino acids on HA. (2) Lethal dose of H7N9/PR8 recombinant virus on chicken embryo. (3) Trypsin dependent test: confirmed that the replication of recombinant H7N9/PR8 virus depends on TPCK trypsin. Cells and compoundsThe grown and maintainance of MDCK cells and 293 T cells were described before24. In short, cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), HEPES (10 mM, Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml, Invitrogen). The NA inhibitors used in vitro experiment were oseltamivir carboxylate (Hoffman-La Roche), zanamivir (GlaxoSmithKline), Peramivir (MCE company) and Laninamivir (MCE company). The pro-drug oseltamivir phosphate (oseltamivir) used in mice was purchased from MCE company. The NA inhibitors were prepared in sterile distilled water and stored in aliquots at − 20 °C.NA inhibition testInhibition of NA enzyme activity of the 4 NA inhibitors was assessed in the fluorescence-based NA inhibition assay, using the NA-Fluor Influenza Neuraminidase Assay kit (Applied Biosystems, ThermoFisher) as previously described47. IC50 values, defined as the concentration of drug required to reduce enzyme activity by 50%, were calculated using GraphPad prism5 software. Interpretation of IC50 was performed using the WHO Antiviral Working Group (WHO-AVWG) criteria47,48,49: the testing virus was compared with the drug-sensitive reference virus, for influenza A viruses, a < tenfold increase in IC50 represents normal inhibition, and a ten to 100-fold increase represents reduced inhibition, while a > 100-fold increase is highly reduced inhibition.Growth kinetics in MDCK cellsThe method of growth kinetics of HPAI H7N9 viruses in MDCK cells was described before24. Briefly speaking, MDCK cells were infected with the recombinant virus at an MOI of 0.001 at 37 °C 5% CO2. Cells were washed twice with PBS after 1 h of incubation, and infection medium containing TPCK-trypsin was added. At time points 0, 18, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post-infection (hpi), supernatants were collected, and 3 biological repeats were set up for each sample. Viral titers were determined on MDCK cells.Pathogenicity in miceAll mouse experiments were conducted after the approval of the Ethics Committee of the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC (20191106039). For pathogenic study, specific-pathogen-free (SPF), female 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were intranasal inoculated with 50 μl of 101–106 TCID50 recombinant H7N9/PR8 virus under isoflurane anaesthesia50. The weight change from 1 to 14 days post-infection (dpi) was calculated as a percentage of weight on 0 dpi (n = 5/group). Mice that showed severe disease and lost ≥ 20% of initial weight were euthanized. On 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 dpi after inoculation, the lungs and trachea were removed from 3 mice of each group infected with 104–105 TCID50 virus, rinsed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), homogenized, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. The suspensions were cleared by centrifugation at 3000×g for 20 min, and virus yield was determined by TCID50 in MDCK cells. On 3dpi, Lungs of mice infected with 104–105 TCID50 virus (n = 3/group), were fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde and then for pathological study.Oseltamivir efficacy in miceSPF, female 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were intranasal inoculated with 50 μl of two 50% mouse lethal doses (MLD50) of recombinant H7N9/PR8 viruses under isoflurane anaesthesia. Starting 0 dpi, mice in the drug treatment group were orally administered 100 μl oseltamivir at the dosage of 20 mg/kg/day BID (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days16. Untreated mice orally received 100 μl PBS twice daily for 5 days. Body weights and survival of infected mice were monitored for 14 days daily (n = 5/group). Mice that lost more than 20% of their initial weight were euthanized. The body weight change of mice was calculated and shown as a percentage of its initial weight. On 2, 4 and 6 dpi, the lungs were removed from 3 mice per group for viral load titration and pathological study.Lung histopathology and immunohistochemistryPathological research methods were described in previous studies49. In short, the lung tissue of mice fixed with formalin was cut into sections and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The distribution of antigens (influenza A nucleoprotein) was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC).Serologic testsHemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay test was done to calculate the mouse infective dose of 50% animals (MID50)49. In short, at 14 dpi, serum samples were obtained from mice that survived from the pathogenic study. Sera were collected by retro-orbital bleed, treated with receptor-destroying enzyme for 18 h, and then heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 1 h, and tested by HI assay with 1% turkey red blood cells. HA titer ≥ 40 is positive; HA titer < 40 is negative.Crystal structure display of NA substitutionsThe existing NA protein crystal structure of A/Anhui/1/2013 H7N9 virus (PDB ID: 4MWJ)37 in Protein Data Bank (PDB) was used, based on which a crystal structure model of the NA monomer was obtained. DeepViewv4.1.0 software was used to display and label drug resistance mutations.Statistical analysisNAIs susceptibility and viral replication were analysis by the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. Student’s t test was used to evaluate differences between two groups. ANOVA test and Kruskal–Wallis H test were used to evaluate differences among four groups. Cox regression was used to analyze hazard ratio by SPSS software. A P value of < 0.05 was considered significant.BiosafetyAll experiments involving HPAI H7N9 viruses were operated by qualified person in BSL-3 laboratory of National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese center for disease control and prevention.Statement of the ARRIVE guidelinesWe confirmed the study was carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines.

These viruses can spread between birds, and sometimes even humans, and evolve rapidly. H5N6, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, has been on scientists’ radar since 2014. There are several “clades,” or genetically distinct strains, of H5N6. Clade 2.3.4.4 is currently circulating in East Asia and has caused outbreaks in Europe, Africa, North America, and other parts of Asia. Assistant professor of pathobiology in the College of Agriculture, Health and Natural Resources, Dong-Hun Lee recently published a paper in Viruses demonstrating the transmissibility of clade 2.3.4.4 in domestic pigeons and mandarin ducks. This paper is the first to study this clade in these two birds. Wild waterfowl like Mandarin ducks are natural hosts for avian influenza viruses. Terrestrial birds like pigeons often interact with waterfowl, making them an important bridge species that could pass a virus onto poultry. Since the H5 virus lineage was first identified in 1996, it has caused severe economic losses for the global poultry industry and poses a severe public health threat. In 2015, an H5 outbreak caused $3.3 billion in losses to the U.S. poultry industry. Since 2003, 862 people have been infected with this virus in 17 countries, with a 53% fatality rate. These infections come from direct, unprotected contact with infected birds. There is no evidence this virus can be passed between humans. “It’s a very dangerous virus in birds and in people, too,” Lee says. Lee and his collaborators focused on two of the six novel genotypes in clade 2.3.4.4: C1 and C4. C1 was the first genotype to emerge in wild birds in Korea, while C4 became the most prevalent during epidemics in Korea where the study took place. The researchers studied the infectivity, pathogenicity, and transmissibility of both genotypes. After testing the birds to ensure none of them already had antibodies or antigens for the virus, Lee’s team infected a portion of the Mandarin ducks with C1 and C4 and a portion of the pigeons with C1. The researchers were interested in determining if the C1 and C4 genotypes differed in wild waterfowl, since those birds are a natural reservoir species for the virus. They tested the transmissibility of viruses by placing uninfected birds in the same cage with infected birds. They also placed infected birds in one cage with natural air flow and into another cage filled with uninfected birds to test for indirect contact. They did not find significant differences between C1 and C4. Both successfully replicated in the birds and were found to be transmissible through direct and indirect exposure. They found that there was a higher level of viral shedding from mandarin ducks than pigeons. “As we expected, we found more replication and higher titers of virus shedding in mandarin ducks than in domestic pigeons without any clinical signs, because they’re a natural reservoir species,” Lee says. This finding suggests that the virus can transfer between different bird species, adapt, and successfully replicate itself in its new host. “When a virus jumps from one host to another, it needs to adapt to that new host,” Lee says. None of the birds in the study exhibited clinical symptoms of the disease meaning, they were asymptomatic carriers of the virus. Infected birds often die within a week of contracting the illness. Given these findings and the danger clade 2.3.4.4 poses to the poultry industry and human health, Lee recommends enhancing surveillance of migratory and terrestrial wild birds to closely monitor the evolution and spread of this virus. “Considering the possibility of potential dispersal and maintenance of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses through these wild bird species, enhanced active surveillance in both migratory and terrestrial wild birds should be implemented,” Lee says.

News What’s Going Around: Hand, foot and mouth, bronchiolitis, COVID-19 and influenza by: Ali Lanyon Posted: Aug 12, 2021 / 04:30 AM EDT Updated: Aug 12, 2021 / 07:33 AM EDT by: Ali Lanyon Posted: Aug 12, 2021 / 04:30 AM EDT Updated: Aug 12, 2021 / 07:33 AM EDT SHARE UPMC Children’s Community Pediatrics in York and Spring Grove reports hand, foot and mouth and RSV bronchiolitis. What’s Going Around: COVID-19, vomiting and diarrhea, swimmer’s ear The Coxsackie virus, also known as hand, foot and mouth, can start with a fever, sometimes a high fever up to 105, for three to five days. Then tiny blisters start to show up , typically around the mouth, on the hands and feet, and often in the diaper area. Blisters also develop on the back of the mouth or throat and sometimes on the tongue. This causes a sore throat. Many children drool and refuse to drink or eat. Hand foot and mouth virus is very contagious. If you see a rash like this on your child or if they are not drinking well or saying they have a sore throat, call your medical provider. There is no treatment for hand foot and mouth. It will resolve on its own after about seven days. However, your child should not go to school while they have the fever or rash. It is important to make sure your child is drinking enough fluids to stay hydrated. If you feel they are not, call your doctor’s office for guidance on pain control and signs of dehydration.

Sign up for the abc27 newsletters here Bronchiolitis starts as a typical cold the first few days with a lot of nasal congestion and nasal discharge and sometimes a fever. Then, after a few days to a week, the cough becomes deeper and wheezing begins. Wheezing can present as fast, shallow breathing, a whistling sound with breathing, and coughing spells. If your child is showing any of these signs, call your medical provider. Treatment for bronchiolitis is supportive; there is not a medicine that will make it resolve faster. However, younger children and babies can worsen before they improve, sometimes to the point of respiratory distress. So if you think your child is wheezing, be sure to call their provider immediately. Mommy Minute: Unknowns of upcoming school year causing anxiety in some kids Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health Physicians Roseville Pediatrics also reports a sharp increase in hand, foot and mouth and continued high rates of bronchiolitis. COVID-19 cases on the slow rise. Strep throat cases are rising quickly. They are also treating viral illnesses that are not diagnosed as COVID. Mommy Minute: Tips to establish a good back-to-school sleep schedule Rashes, including poison ivy and impetigo, are continuing in moderate numbers. Dr. Joan Thode offered the following advice about hand, foot and mouth: “It’s a misnomer as the lesions of this virus can and do occur anywhere from head to toe, not just on hands, feet and mouth. Mommy Minute: Tips for treating top summertime ailments It tends to concentrate in areas of increased friction, which often include the hands, feet, lips, and buttocks. Lesions often start as small red bumps and then can progress into bubble-appearing lesions. In kids, the lesions do not typically hurt unless they occur in the mouth or throat. Then it causes a severe sore throat that can make the child less likely to want to eat. In this situation, it’s most important to maintain the child’s hydration Healthy Living: Q&A on moms and COVID-19 vaccine The skin lesions on the hands and feet of teens and adults is acutely painful Kids are contagious a few days prior to the lesions developing and until they are fever-free for 24 hours. The lesions that are bubbled also contain virus within the fluid and can be spread. It’s a virus that causes this condition, so it typically lasts three to seven days. Healthy Living: Muscle soreness As with any virus, it’s important to maintain hydration, offer comfort measures, and call the doctor for evaluation if the fever lasts 5 consecutive days.” WellSpan Pediatric Medicine Physicians across the Midstate are seeing COVID-19 cases in patients who are mild to moderately ill, rashes, a few positive influenza cases, lots of sports physicals for the school year, and some children with RSV.

(Yonhap) SEJONG -- South Korea's agricultural ministry said Tuesday local chicken farms have gradually normalized their operations from avian influenza, a move that could stabilize the market price of eggs.The number of chickens supplied to the disease-hit egg farms came to around 18 million as of end of June, more than the 16 million chickens culled as a preventive measure, according to data compiled by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.South Korea has been normalizing the operations of local farms as no additional cases of the H5N8 strain of bird flu have been reported among wild birds and poultry farms since April.A total of 109 cases at farms had been reported here since late last year.The outbreak of avian influenza across the country led to supply shortages of eggs, resulting in higher market prices.According to Statistics Korea, the consumer price of eggs soared 57 percent on-year as of July, maintaining double-digit growth since January.The overall consumer price of agricultural products edged up 9.7 percent over the period, the data showed.

A new study sheds light. Patients were more likely to develop respiratory infections such as influenza after being exposed during a primary case visit—findings that may be applicable to the coronavirus as physicians open back up for in-person visits, according to a new study in Health Affairs. 4 truths that will make or break telehealth in 2021 Study details Using EHR and insurance claims data from athenahealth, researchers at athenahealth, Harvard University, and the University of Minnesota School of Public Health analyzed 105,462,600 primary care encounters that took place between 2016 and 2017 at 6,709 office-based primary care practices to identify visits where a person was exposed to a patient with an influenza-like illness. Should you mandate a Covid-19 vaccine for your staff? Ask these 5 questions first. Specifically, researchers classified visits as "unexposed" if they occurred at least 90 minutes before the first visit of the day from a patient presenting with an influenza-like illness. In contrast, visits were classified as "exposed" if they were scheduled to start at the same time or after the office's first visit of the day from a patient with an influenza-like illness. Researchers then compared unexposed and exposed visits to determine which patients were more likely to revisit the initial primary care practice with the flu within two weeks. Findings Within the study sample, 10,737,587 visits occurred on the same date as a visit from a patient with influenza-like illness at the same practice. Of those visits, 68.4% were categorized as "exposed" to a patient with an influenza-like illness. Among all patients in the study, 2.7 per 1,000 patients returned to their initial practice within two weeks presenting with influenza. The researchers found that patients exposed to an influenza-like illness during their initial visit were 31.8% more likely to revisit with influenza within two weeks than patients who were not exposed—an increase that led to an additional 0.7 return visits per 1,000 visits, or approximately 5,140 additional influenza visits due to exposure. In contrast, the researchers did not find similar patterns for urinary tract infections or back pain, both of which are noncontagious conditions. How Covid-19 transformed virtual care preferences, according to our 7,000-patient survey However, the authors also noted several limitations to the study. For example, they could track revisits only to the initial primary care practice and not urgent care centers or EDs, where patients may have otherwise sought care for their influenza symptoms. This likely led to an undercounting of actual influenza cases. The researchers also could not determine whether influenza transmission occurred in practices' waiting rooms or exam rooms. The importance of infection control practices and telemedicine "It's a widely accepted fact that patients can acquire infections in hospital settings, but we show that infection transmission can happen when you visit your doctor's office too," Hannah Neprash, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health and the study's lead author, said. She also noted that the study is the first to document a relationship between influenza transmission and the timing of primary care visits among a national sample of adults. According to Neprash and the other study authors, while the study findings may not be generalizable to coronavirus, they suggest that it could be transmitted to patients in primary care settings in a similar manner. "In-person outpatient care for influenza may promote nontrivial transmission of these viruses. This may be true for other endemic respiratory illnesses too, including Covid-19, but more research is needed," Neprash said. Neprash said the study's findings "highlight the important of infection control practices and continued access to telemedicine services, as health care begins to return to pre-pandemic patterns." In the study, the authors encourage clinics to implement "strict infection control practices" whenever a patient with influenza or a similar illness needs to be seen in person. Some suggested practices include mask wearing, hand washing, and separating sick patients into their own exam rooms. The authors also suggest that telemedicine may be an important tool for infection control among patients with respiratory viruses, arguing that it should remain a financially viable option for providers as lawmakers debate how telemedicine will be reimbursed in the future. (Neprash et al., Health Affairs, 8/2021; University of Minnesota news release, 8/3) Advisory Board's take 3 keys to make telehealth work for patients By John League, Managing Director These findings align with what we are beginning to hear anecdotally from clinicians. They don’t only want to be able to use telehealth for maintenance and management visits. They want telehealth to work for sick visits. For that to happen at a large scale—like this study of influenza exposure in outpatient clinics suggests is necessary—there are three things that need to happen. 1. Providers and health plans can’t simply offer telehealth visits—they must recommend them when appropriate. It is much more important to use digital interactions for the right types of visits and the right types of patients than it is to get any specific overall percentage of visits to be completed virtually. Providers and plans also have to help set the right expectations for virtual visits. That includes not only what are becoming standard technology prep-and-check procedures to make sure patients can connect to a virtual visit, but also conveying to patients and members that a virtual visit is an actual health care encounter. Some patients equate a video visit that can be completed on their smartphone with a Facetime chat with a friend: we’ve heard stories of patients trying to conduct their end of a virtual visit from the drive-in at McDonald’s or during a long bike ride. At the same time, patients should understand the limitations of telehealth. Virtual visits are not appropriate for every indication. In a recent survey conducted by Optum, nearly three out of every five urgent care clinicians reported that patients have unrealistic expectations for what can and can’t be accomplished in a virtual visit. 2. Adoption of quality home exam technology must increase. If patients and clinicians are going to make broader use of telehealth, they must have reliable, quality tools to share diagnostic information. These tools have to be easy for patients to use, and they have to be of sufficient quality for clinicians to trust them. Some of this technology already exists, and efforts to make the smartphone a diagnostic tool continue apace. Tytocare has partnered with several large health systems (and even one homebuilder) to provide home exam kits that include tools for examination of ears, lungs, throat, heart, skin, and abdomen. Google’s Pixel smartphone can use its camera to assess heart and respiratory rate. These kinds of digital tools can greatly expand the use cases that can be addressed virtually. That said, the awareness and availability of this technology is as much an equity issue as it is an epidemiological or patient experience one. 3. Health care should keep digital inequity top of mind while investing in technology. Our industry-wide emphasis on digital tools is both essential and overdue, but it also demands a second look at how these investments could help or worsen existing digital inequities among disconnected populations. Left unaddressed, digital inequity will embed a two-tiered system of care based on technological access. Affluent patients will have a full-spectrum of care options, while disadvantaged individuals will be forced to rely on in-person visits—even at the risk of exposure to infection, as seen in this study in Health Affairs—or substandard workarounds.

A new preprint study from Mayo Clinic and the health research company nference suggests mRNA vaccines' efficacy against coronavirus infection—particularly the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine—has dropped significantly since the delta variant became widespread, although the vaccines' protection against hospitalization and death remain strong. Daily Briefing More hospitals want to mandate Covid-19 vaccines. (But some states won't let them.) Nearly 25% of U.S. hospitals now require employees to be vaccinated against Covid-19, but seven states have enacted laws prohibiting either vaccine mandates or so-called vaccine passports—measures that health care leaders worry could exacerbate local Covid-19 surges and contribute to staffing shortages. Daily Briefing Still unvaccinated? That could cost you $50 a month. Despite numerous incentives from states, insurers, and employers, many people still haven't been vaccinated against Covid-19, leading some employers to start imposing financial penalties in the form of increased health insurance premiums—and industry stakeholders say insurers themselves could raise premiums next.

Scientists have developed a nasal spray vaccine that they say could protect against all strains of the influenza virus. Even more promising: it might even be adapted to fight other pathogens, such as COVID.  6508  0  Printable  PDF The nasal spray offers broad protection, allowing for hope of a front-line defense against potentially lethal forms of the flu virus. Recurring seasonal epidemics and potential pandemics are among the most severe threats to public health, the team from Georgie State University says.The spray contains a protein called recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) that “lives” on the surface of the influenza viruses. It is essential to the virus’ ability to cause infection.The flu virus is difficult to fight because it can evolve and “learn” to protect itself against drugs quickly. The new spray could solve this problem. “Our research opens a new path for the development of needle-free and logistically simplified intranasal flu vaccines for cross-protection,” says senior study author Dr. Baozhong Wang, in a statement.The spray administers nanoparticles through the nose to boost the immune system. Current vaccines don’t work against mismatched flu strains. More effective alternatives are urgently needed. Nasal sprays are a particularly promising strategy.Respiratory tracts are the portal of virus entry. Nasal sprays prevent infection at the key spot, doctors say. They can also stimulate systemic immune responses throughout the body. Vaccines injected into a muscle don’t induce mucosal immune responses in respiratory tracts. This new potential solution combines HA with the chemical graphene oxide.“Conventional flu vaccines predominantly induce antibody responses. However, recent research demonstrates that lung resident memory T-cell responses are indispensable for optimal cross-protection against pulmonary influenza infection,” says Wang. “The development of lung resident T-cell responses requires vaccination by a respiratory route or influenza virus infection. Our research opens a new path for the development of needle-free and logistically simplified intranasal flu vaccines for cross-protection.”In tests on mice and human cells cultured in the lab, the vaccine produced antibodies. “In our study, we reported for the first time that two-dimensional graphene oxide nanomaterials had a potent adjuvant effect in boosting the immune responses of intranasal hemagglutinin vaccines,” says lead author Dr. Chunhong Dong.The nanoparticles significantly enhanced immune responses in mucous and throughout the rodents’ bodies. The robust reaction also conferred protection against different virus strains.“This study gives new insights into developing high-performance intranasal vaccine systems with two-dimensional sheet-like nanoparticles. The graphene oxide nanoparticles have extraordinary attributes for drug delivery or vaccine development, such as the ultra-large surface area for high-density antigen loading, and the vaccine showed superior immunoenhancing properties in vitro and in vivo. The nano-platform could be easily adapted for constructing mucosal vaccines for different respiratory pathogens,” Dr. Dong said.Needle-free flu sprays possess superior logistical advantages over a jab, added the researchers. They include easy administration with high acceptance rates and the avoidance of biohazardous waste.The study is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Published: August 13, 2021 5:06 PM IST By India.com Lifestyle Staff | Edited by Anjali Thakur Follow Us Corona vaccine for children Mumbai: Flu is an epidemic and if the children fail to take the flu shot then they might end up being hospitalized. The flu shot is a preventive measure against viral infection and reduces the risk of developing respiratory problems like pneumonia, which aggravates one’s risk of COVID-19. Don’t forget to take a shot as recommended by the doctor. Keeping in mind the seasonal changes and other factors, parents are aware that cold and flu also bring in several respiratory issues among children. “The flu can raise the chances of children suffering from pneumonia, hospitalizations, and even mortality. Every year influenza virus mutations changed, and the body’s immunity to influenza either through natural infection or vaccination goes down over time. Thus, it is the need of the hour to get the flu shot every year. Vaccines are given through a shot, which means with the help of a needle that injects the vaccine into the child’s body, through the arm. Flu vaccines can help one develop antibodies in the body about two weeks after taking the vaccine,” said Dr. Suresh Birajdar, Consultant, Paediatrics & Neonatology, Motherhood Hospital, Kharghar. Dr Suresh added, “It is important to immunize children up to five years. The first flu shot is given at six months after the children are born, as up to six months they have their mother’s immunity to protect them. Therefore, once a child turns six months, parents must ensure they get their child flu shot every year until the children turn 5.” He further said that children above six years can still suffer from flu if they have certain serious conditions such as asthma, immune problems, or heart issues. Other preventive measures that can be taken by children alongside flu shots are to stay away from people who are sick, wash their hands frequently, avoid touching their eyes, face, and mouth frequently, wear masks and practice social distancing. “Remember that even after taking a flu shot, children need to follow the Covid protocol. Getting a flu shot does not mean that you will not get infected with Covid-19. Apart from that, children should exercise at home. Try to do activities like aerobics or walking with your parents. Also, opting for a well-balanced diet is key. Parents should make sure that the children avoid eating spicy, oily, junk, and processed foods. Say NO to sugary and carbonated drinks. If you haven’t given flu shot to your child then do that right away!,” Dr concluded. Also Read: Ever heard about saree cancer?
