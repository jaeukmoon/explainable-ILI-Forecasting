- Canine influenza, also known as dog flu, is a contagious respiratory disease in dogs caused by specific type A influenza viruses that infect and spread in dogs.
- Canine influenza viruses are different from seasonal influenza viruses that commonly spread among people, and there is currently no evidence of spread from dogs to humans.
- The signs of canine influenza in dogs include cough, runny nose, fever, lethargy, eye discharge, and reduced appetite. Severity of illness can range from no signs to severe illness resulting in pneumonia and death.
- Most dogs recover from dog flu within 2 to 3 weeks, but some may develop secondary bacterial infections that can lead to more severe illness and pneumonia.
- H3N2 canine influenza viruses are not endemic in dogs in the United States, but localized outbreaks continue to occur, seeded by repeated reintroductions from Asia.
- H3N8 canine influenza viruses have not been reported since 2016 and do not appear to be actively circulating anymore.
- CDC has a plan in place to limit the introduction and/or spread of a pandemic virus into or within the United States if evidence emerges that canine influenza viruses can infect people with sustained human-to-human spread.
- CDC regulations require dogs to be healthy to enter the United States, and dogs that appear sick or are dead may require veterinary examination or necropsy at the owner's expense. Veterinary Services of the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has animal health requirements for bringing a pet dog into the United States from a foreign country.
