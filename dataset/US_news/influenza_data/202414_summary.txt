Variant Influenza Virus Infection: The CDC reported the first U.S. human infection with a variant influenza virus (influenza A(H1N2)v) that normally spreads in pigs and not people in 2024. The infection occurred in a child in Pennsylvania who had direct contact with pigs. The patient was hospitalized but has since recovered. No person-to-person spread of the virus has been identified. Variant influenza viruses can cause mild to severe illness and are of concern due to their potential for a pandemic. People with certain underlying conditions are at higher risk of developing serious complications from infections with swinish-origin influenza viruses.
