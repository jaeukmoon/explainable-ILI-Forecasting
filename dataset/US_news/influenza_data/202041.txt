Murine studies have shown that T cells can protect against a broad range of influenza strains. However, ferrets are a more potent model for studying immune correlates of protection in influenza infection. We therefore set out to investigate the role of systemic and respiratory T cells in the protection against heterosubtypic influenza A infections in ferrets. H1N1-priming induced systemic and respiratory T cells that responded against pandemic H2N2 and correlated with reduced viral replication and disease. CD8-positive T cell responses in the upper and lower respiratory tract were exceptionally high. We additionally confirmed that H2N2-responsive T cells are present in healthy human blood donors. These findings underline the importance of the T cell response in influenza immunity and show that T cells are a potent target for future universal influenza vaccines.

Traditional influenza vaccines mainly activate the humoral immune response against the surface proteins haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA; reviewed in Keshavarz et al.2). However, HA and NA can mutate over time (antigenic drift) and multiple influenza strains can reassort to establish a new virus with altered HA and/or NA composition (antigenic shift; reviewed in Taubenberger and Kash3). Both antigenic drift and shift can lead to evasion of the antibody response. In contrast to surface proteins, the internal influenza proteins are far less subject to change and are highly conserved between influenza subtypes. Epitopes of internal IAV proteins can be recognized by T cells that can either kill virus-infected cells or assist in the development of adaptive immune responses (reviewed in refs. 4,5).The impact of influenza strains evading the human immune response is illustrated by the pandemic of H2N2 in 1957. After introduction into the human population the virus spread rapidly, leading to ~1–2 million deaths worldwide6,7. Although H2N2 disappeared from the human population in 1968, there is a risk of reintroduction as associated-H2N2 strains still circulate in birds8,9. Moreover, persons born after 1968 have not encountered H2N2 and will likely have no neutralizing antibodies against H2N27,10. With the pandemic history of H2N2, a possible reemergence in humans should be considered.T cells might offer protection if H2N2 reemerges. The Cleveland Family study already reported in 1958 that prior exposure to H1N1 influenza resulted in reduced disease in participants infected with H2N211,12. This was independent of neutralizing antibodies, hinting toward a role for T cells. Later studies provided more evidence that T cells can protect against heterosubtypic IAV infections. Pre-existing influenza-specific CD8 T cells correlated with decreased disease burden during the H1N1 pandemic of 200913 and were also found to contribute to recovery from H7N9 infection14. In a human challenge study, pre-existing CD4 T cells responding to internal influenza proteins were associated with reduced virus shedding and disease upon infection with seasonal H1N1 and H3N215.Animal studies provided additional proof that T cells are essential for heterosubtypic immunity. In ferrets, prior exposure to influenza protected against heterosubtypic infections with H1N116, H3N217, or H5N118, which was likely mediated by T cells. Murine research demonstrated that T cells in general (reviewed in Altenburg et al.19) – and especially tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm)20,21,22,23 – are crucial for protection against heterosubtypic IAV infections. Trm is a population of non-circulating T cells that is located near the site of infection and can respond rapidly upon (recurring) infections with the production of cytokines and killing of infected cells (reviewed in Rosato et al.24). Trm have also been identified in human lungs25,26,27,28,29, but the availability of tissue and ethical concerns are hindering a more in-depth investigation.The rol of T cells in influenza infections is often studied in murine models, which offer a wide variety of techniques and reagents but are limited as an influenza model. Mice do not display the traditional disease symptoms (fever, sneezing, etc.) of an influenza infection and virus strains often require adaptation to increase virulence in mice30. Hence extrapolation to humans is difficult and it is unknown how well the findings from murine studies translate to humans. In contrast, ferrets show typical symptoms of influenza disease and are susceptible to both avian and human influenza strains. Ferrets are therefore considered the best small animal model for predicting IAV disease outcome in humans31. Elucidating influenza T cell responses in the ferret model can bridge the gap between murine and human research, thereby facilitating the development of improved influenza vaccines.Although reagents for the ferret model are still scarce, we recently developed techniques to study (respiratory) T cell responses in IAV infections. Due to this we had the unique opportunity to investigate the role of systemic and respiratory T cells in the protection against H2N2 infection in ferrets. We show that priming with seasonal influenza H1N1 (A/California/07/2009) induced a T cell response that could reduce H2N2 (A/Singapore/1/57) viral replication and disease. H1N1-induced T cells responded to H2N2 and both systemic and respiratory T cell responses were boosted by heterosubtypic H2N2 infection. Respiratory CD8 T cell responses were especially high, even without prior H1N1-priming. Importantly, a group of healthy human donors that was too young to have been into contact with H2N2, displayed responses to H2N2 peptide pools. Together, these results argue that T cells induced by infections with seasonal influenza strains can contribute to protection against pandemic H2N2 infections. Future influenza vaccination strategies should take into account that inducing or boosting T cell responses can protect against heterosubtypic influenza infections.ResultsH1N1 immunity reduces H2N2 viral replication and diseaseInfection with circulating IAV might partially protect against H2N2 influenza strains by inducing T cells that recognize shared epitopes (hereafter called “cross-reactive T cells”). To estimate the likelihood of shared epitopes, we first assessed the level of protein identity between IAV subtypes. Viral protein sequences from early human and recent avian H2N2 isolates were retrieved from influenza database GisAid32 and aligned against recently circulating A/California/07/2009 (hereafter called H1N1). While HA (<65%) and NA (<44%) are poorly conserved, most internal proteins retain >90% sequence identity (Fig. 1a). We then determined how many human CD4 and CD8 T-cell epitopes were conserved between H1N1 and a pandemic H2N2 strain (A/Singapore/1/57; hereafter called H2N2) using the Immune Epitope Database33. Corresponding with the sequence identity, epitopes were relatively well conserved for internal IAV proteins, but not for HA and NA (Fig. 1b).Fig. 1: Epitopes are conserved between H1N1 and H2N2 influenza A subtypes.a Sequence identity of influenza A proteins between different H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 strains. Sequence identity is expressed as percent amino acid overlap with A/California/07/2009 (H1N1). As H1N1 does not express PB1-F2, all PB1-F2 sequences have been excluded from analysis. b Influenza epitopes presented by human MHC class-I were mapped against the protein sequence of H1N1 and A/Singapore/1/57 (H2N2). Conserved epitopes (dark blue) are present in both H1N1 and H2N2, while H1N1-specific epitopes (light blue) are only present in H1N1.Full size imageBased on the sequence identity between H1N1 and H2N2, we expect that cellular immunity induced by H1N1 priming can protect against H2N2 infection. To confirm this in a relevant influenza model, we intranasally primed six female ferrets with H1N1 or administered ferrets with PBS as a treatment control (day 0; Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1). When 4 weeks later both groups were infected with H2N2, animals primed with H1N1 showed decreased viral replication in the throat and nose (Fig. 2b). Correspondingly, weight loss and fever was less severe in primed animals (Fig. 2c, d). A control group that received PBS on both occasions showed baseline weight and temperature and no detectable viral replication. Together, these results confirm that immunity induced by H1N1 priming can protect against heterosubtypic H2N2 infection, as seen by reduced disease symptoms and viral replication.Fig. 2: H2N2 viral replication and disease manifestation are reduced by prior H1N1-priming.a Outline of the study. Ferrets were primed with H1N1 (A/California/07/2009) or received PBS on day 0. Subsequently, both primed and non-primed animals were infected with H2N2 (A/Singapore/1/57) on day 28. The placebo group received PBS on both occasions. All animals were euthanized on day 42 to analyze T cell responses. b Viral replication in throat and nose of H2N2-infected ferrets prior to infection (day 28) and 2, 4, and 7 days after infection (days 30, 32, and 35 respectively).

H1N1 priming did not raise detectable hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or virus neutralization (VN) titers against H2N2 (Fig. 3a, b). This shows that disease was not reduced by neutralization of virus particles. However, we did detect low levels of binding to recombinant H2-protein by ELISA, indicating that there was cross-reactivity of H1N1-induced antibodies with H2-protein (Supplementary Fig. 2). Importantly, the level of H2-binding antibodies after a single H1N1 infection was relatively low when compared to after H2N2 infection. When we measured IFNγ-responses in PBMCs by ELISpot prior to H2N2 infection, we observed not only responses to H1N1, but also against H2N2 in primed animals (Fig. 3c). PBMCs from these animals additionally responded against H3N2 influenza (A/Switzerland/97/15293/2013), but not against a nonspecific viral control (mumps), proving the observed responses were influenza-specific. These results are in agreement with prior findings that T cells respond to multiple influenza subtypes by recognizing conserved epitopes34,35,36.Fig. 3: H1N1-priming induced H2N2-reactive T cells but no H2N2-neutralizing antibodies.a, b Sera from primed and non-primed ferrets was tested for antibody responses against A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) and A/Singapore/1/57 (H2N2) before H1N1-priming (day 0), before H2N2 infection (day 28) and 2 weeks after H2N2 infection (day 42).

Non-primed and placebo animals were negative for all peptide pools tested but were left out for visualization purposes. e For each ferret shown in d, relative responses against the different influenza proteins was calculated.

In all plots n = 6. * indicates significant differences (p < 0.05) between non-primed and H1N1-primed groups after correction for multiple testing.Full size imageTo determine the target-proteins of the T-cell response, we stimulated PBMCs with peptide pools spanning the internal proteins of H2N2 and assessed IFNγ-responses by ELISpot. Following H1N1-priming, most responses were observed against NP (59% ± 26) and NS1 (22% ± 22) H2N2 peptide pools (Fig. 3d, e). Virtually no responses against M2, NEP, or PB-F2 were detected. Naïve animals did not respond to any of the H2N2 peptide pools (Supplementary Fig. 3). The high variability in responses between animals is likely in part due to MHC diversity in outbred ferrets. Despite this variation, it is clear that H1N1 priming induced T cells that respond to internal proteins of H2N2.H1N1 immunity results in higher CD8 T-cell numbers in the airways upon heterosubtypic infectionPrevious studies have shown that T cells residing in the respiratory tract are essential for the protection against heterosubtypic influenza infections20,21. To assess whether respiratory T cells contributed to protection against H2N2 infection, we first determined absolute T-cell numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) two weeks after H2N2 infection. Using a non-centrifugation staining protocol for flow cytometry, we found no difference in absolute CD4 T-cell counts (Fig. 4a). However, CD8 T-cell counts were significantly increased after H2N2 infection with the largest increase seen in primed animals (Fig. 4a, b).Fig. 4: Pre-existing T-cell immunity leads to increased infiltration of CD8 T cells into the respiratory tract upon heterologous influenza infection.a Representative flow cytometry plots depicting the infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the BAL and nasal turbinates in ferrets 2 weeks after H2N2 infection (day 42).

Absolute CD8a+ T-cell numbers and IFNγ-responses toward several virus stimulations were assessed by flow cytometry and ELISpot respectively. The PCC indicates Pearson’s correlation coefficient between spot count and number of CD8a+ T cells in BAL. *p < 0.05 after correction for multiple testing.Full size imageWe also investigated T-cell numbers in nasal turbinates (NT), but due to the large variation in absolute cell counts that is inherent with creating a single-cell suspension from tissue, we could only analyze relative T-cell numbers for NT. Similar to BAL, the NT of placebo animals contained few CD8 T cells (~3% of lymphocytes) and relative numbers were increased after H2N2 infection in non-primed ferrets (~12.5%; Fig. 4c). Again, we observed that the response in primed animals was substantially higher (~29.7%). Relative CD4 T-cell numbers remained similar between groups (Fig. 4a).Infiltrating T cells might be attracted due to inflammation without being responsive to IAV. By plotting the number of infiltrating CD8 T cells versus the number of IAV responsive cells determined by IFNγ-ELISpot, we can derive whether those infiltrating T cells are also IAV-responsive. As expected, increased CD8 T-cell numbers in the BAL correlated with higher IFNγ-responses against IAV (Fig. 4d). Importantly, responses against H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 all correlated with CD8 T cell influx, demonstrating that the infiltrating CD8 T-cell population recognizes a broad range of IAV subtypes. Although we did not investigate the presence of T cells in the respiratory tract of H1N1-primed animals before H2N2 infection, we did find that a single influenza infection (with H2N2; Fig. 4b) is sufficient to induce respiratory T cells. Furthermore, respiratory T cell numbers were increased in H1N1-primed ferrets after H2N2 infection. This suggests that these T cells were at least in part induced by primary H1N1 infection, and that they responded to secondary H2N2 infection and likely contributed to reduced disease severity.T-cell responses in the lung are high but not boosted by heterosubtypic infectionTo further dissect the T-cell response in lung, we measured IFNγ-production in CD4 and CD8 T cells by flow cytometry after ex vivo stimulation with IAV. As lung tissue is rich in vasculature, we perfused the lungs with saline solution to reduce contamination by blood lymphocytes. After stimulation with H1N1, H2N2, or H3N2, CD8 T cells from infected animals responded strongly with up to 40% of all CD8 T cells being positive for IFNγ (Fig. 5a, b). Interestingly, responses were similar between primed- and non-primed animals. As CD8 T-cell responses in the lung are high even after primary infection, further boosting of the response might be inhibited to prevent excessive immunopathology. In comparison to the CD8 T-cell compartment, CD4 T-cell IFNγ-responses were smaller but noteworthy, with up to 10% of lung-derived CD4 T cells producing IFNγ. As virus stimulations induced some nonspecific IFNγ-responses in placebo animals, we also stimulated lung-derived T cells with a cocktail of peptide pools spanning NP, PA, and NS1 proteins of H2N2 that elicited high responses in ELISpot assays (Fig. 3d). Stimulation with this peptide cocktail induced a clean T-cell response with hardly any responses in placebo animals (Fig. 5c). The majority of responses was seen in the CD8 T-cell compartment, with relatively few CD4 T-cell responders.Fig. 5: IFNγ-responses in the lung are high and only systemic responses are boosted by heterosubtypic H2N2 infection.Lymphocytes were isolated from blood, spleen, and perfused lungs 14 days after H2N2 infection and stimulated for 6 (peptides) or 24 (viruses) h.

In panels b–e n = 3 for PBMC, n = 6 for spleen and n = 4–6 for lung. Boxplots depict the 25, 50, and 75% quantile where the upper and lower whiskers extend to the smallest and largest value respectively within 1.5* the inter quartile ranges. Asterisk indicates significant differences (p < 0.05) between non-primed and H1N1-primed groups after correction for multiple testing.Full size imageIn order to compare T cell responses between respiratory and systemic tissues, we additionally measured T-cell responses in blood and spleen. In contrast to the lung, average CD8 T-cell responses after viral restimulation were clearly increased in the spleen of H1N1-primed animals compared to non-primed animals (Fig. 5d). Similar findings were seen for CD4 and CD8 T cells in the blood, but results were not significant due to the small group size (n = 3). Additionally, after stimulation with the H2N2 peptide cocktail, H1N1-primed animals displayed significantly increased CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses in the spleen, with a similar trend for CD8 T cells in the blood (Fig. 5e). CD4 T cells hardly responded to peptide cocktail stimulation by producing IFNγ. Importantly, CD4 T cells might respond by producing other cytokines that we were unable to measure. Hence, we are likely underestimating the true contribution of the CD4 T-cell compartment. These results suggest that a boost shortly after priming can improve systemic T-cell responses, but hardly leads to increased T-cells responses in lung tissue. Interestingly, CD8 T-cells numbers were increased in the BAL and NT after heterosubtypic infection, indicating that there might be differences between the different sites of the respiratory system.Pre-existing H1N1 immunity slightly alters the immune hierarchy of an H2N2 infectionAs some internal IAV proteins are more conserved than others (Fig. 1a, b) we wondered whether priming could affect the response to individual H2N2 proteins after an H2N2 challenge. To test this, we measured the IFNγ-responses of primed and non-primed animals to IAV and H2N2 peptide pools by ELISpot. In agreement with our flow cytometric analysis, responses toward IAV stimulations were higher in the blood of primed animals, but not in the lungs (Fig. 6a). However, when we investigated responses to individual influenza proteins, differences between primed and non-primed animals were marginal (Fig. 6b). Out of all H2N2 peptide pools tested, only responses toward NS1 and possibly NP (n.s.) were higher in H1N1-primed animals. Interestingly, primed animals actually responded less well to PB1 and M2 peptide pools compared to non-primed animals. Although PB1-responses detected after H1N1-priming were boosted by H2N2 infection (Supplementary Fig. 3), the boost was minor and did not exceed the primary PB1-response seen upon a single H2N2 infection. H1N1-priming did not raise any responses to H2N2 M2 peptide pool (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 3) and while H2N2 infection induced responses to M2 peptide pool in non-primed animals, this was not the case for primed animals (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 3). Although most responses toward H2N2 peptide pools are similar between primed and non-primed animals, these results suggest that T cell responses can be skewed toward certain antigens by previous infections.Fig. 6: Primed animals show increased responses to influenza A virus.a, b Lymphocytes isolated from blood or lung were stimulated with multiple influenza virus subtypes (a) or H2N2 peptide pools (b) in an ELISpot assay for 20 h. Responses are corrected for background signals (minus medium stimulation). In all panels, n = 5–6. Boxplots depict the 25, 50, and 75% quantile where the upper and lower whiskers extend to the smallest and largest value respectively within 1.5* the inter quartile ranges. Asterisk indicates significant differences (p < 0.05) between non-primed and H1N1-primed groups after correction for multiple testing.Full size imageH2N2 cross-reactive T cells are present in human blood donorsWe have shown that H1N1 priming can induce H2N2 cross-reactive T cells in an animal model. However, this is no guarantee that similar cross-reactivity exists in humans. To investigate whether cross-reactivity to H2N2 is also present in the human population, we measured IFNγ-responses to H2N2 peptide pools in PBMCs of 18 healthy donors (8 male, 10 female). All donors were born after 1968, when the H2N2 influenza subtype was no longer circulating. Strikingly, almost all donors responded to stimulations with NP, M1, and PB1 peptide pools, with some individuals additionally reacting to PA, PB2 and NS1 (Fig. 7). These findings show that H2N2 cross-reactive T cells are present in the human population. Based on earlier studies and our findings in the ferret model, these T cells have the potential to reduce H2N2 spread and disease, although their numbers may be too low in the general population. Boosting the responses by vaccination could therefore be a strategy to limit the consequences of newly introduced influenza subtypes such as H2N2.Fig. 7: H2N2 cross-reactive T cells are present in human blood donors that were born after H2N2 stopped circulating.Frozen PBMCs from healthy human donors (n = 18) were thawed and stimulated with peptide pools coding for the internal proteins of H2N2 or HIV gag in an ELISpot assay. Responses are corrected for background signal (minus medium stimulation). Boxplots depict the 25, 50, and 75% quantile where the upper and lower whiskers extend to the smallest and largest value respectively within 1.5* the inter quartile ranges.Full size imageDiscussionWith this study we confirmed prior murine work in a more relevant model for influenza disease. We present evidence that (respiratory) T cells can protect against heterosubtypic influenza infection in the ferret model. Priming with H1N1 lead to reduced viral replication and disease upon H2N2 infection, which was associated with the presence of cross-reactive influenza-specific T cells in the blood before H2N2 infection. Correspondingly, H2N2 infection boosted the T-cell responses that were evoked by H1N1-priming. This was illustrated by increased CD8 T-cell numbers in the respiratory tract of primed animals and higher IFNγ-responses in spleen and blood. Importantly, we could confirm the finding that infection with other influenza subtypes can induce T-cell responses to pandemic H2N2 in healthy human blood donors. By using both the ferret model and human blood donors, we partly mitigated the shortcomings that are associated with murine and human influenza studies.The Cleveland Family study which ran from 1947 to 1957 reported that adults pre-exposed to H1N1 displayed reduced H2N2 disease11,12. With our study we have clearly shown that H1N1 priming induces cross-reactive T cells and that they are associated with protection against H2N2 infection in ferrets. H2N2-responsive T cells are also present in our selection of human blood donors and it is thus likely that T cells played a role in the protection against H2N2 observed in the Cleveland study. This stresses the importance of the T cell response in heterosubtypic influenza infections. Later studies with influenza-infected individuals extended the initial findings of the Cleveland Family study by showing that high numbers of IAV cross-reactive T cells in the blood correlate with improved clinical outcome in H1N113,15, H3N215, and H7N914 infections. Like the Cleveland study, these studies are however limited by the availability of tissue (mainly PBMCs) and the unknown infection history of subjects. The more fundamental questions regarding T-cell immunity in influenza infections can therefore only be investigated in animal models.Earlier ferret studies have shown that prior exposure to IAV can protect against heterosubtypic IAV infection16,17,18,37,38,39,40,41,42. While some studies especially investigated the role of T cells in this protection, thus far none have addressed the involvement of CD4 and CD8 populations in multiple compartments of the respiratory tract in ferrets. This is especially important as tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) – a subset of T cells that are non-circulating and respond rapidly upon a (recurring) infection21,22 – can reduce disease severity and duration upon heterosubtypic infections20,21,43,44. In order to study respiratory T cells, we set up a lung perfusion model, which enabled us to analyze a relatively pure population of lung-derived lymphocytes. Additionally, we developed techniques to isolate T cells from the upper respiratory tract (nasal turbinates), which have recently been attributed an important role in blocking dissemination of IAV infection to the lower respiratory tract23. These techniques allowed us to investigate the T-cell response in respiratory tissues, although we lacked the reagents to determine whether these cells were also truly tissue-resident.Unfortunately, we could not investigate T cells in respiratory tissues of H1N1-primed animals before H2N2 infection. However, as a single H2N2 influenza infection induced a strong T-cell response in the respiratory tract (Fig. 5), it is very likely that this was also the case for the H1N1 infection. Moreover, CD8 T-cell numbers and T cell responses to H2N2 were higher in the respiratory tract of primed animals compared to non-primed animals (Fig. 4), indicating that T cells induced by H1N1 were boosted by H2N2 infection. These findings suggest that influenza-specific T cells were present in respiratory tissues of H1N1-primed ferrets at the time of H2N2 infection and that these cells are associated with reduced H2N2 disease severity.We also investigated whether humoral immunity could have contributed to reduced H2N2 disease. HAI and VN assays did not indicate the presence of H2N2-neutralizing antibodies, although it is possible that H1N1-priming induced antibodies which protected against H2N2 by other modes of action. Indeed, in ELISA assays we found that H1N1-induced antibodies could bind to H2N2, albeit at low levels. The antibodies that we detected by ELISA might bind conserved domains in the HA head or stalk, which can mediate protection against heterosubtypic influenza infections45,46. However, others have shown that broadly-reactive HA-stalk targeting antibodies attain sufficiently high levels only after repeated vaccination or infection47.Although the ferret model is less cost-efficient than mice and is hampered by a lack of reagents, the strong resemblance to human influenza infection and disease is a strong motivation to develop the model further for performing studies on correlates of protection. This requires a more thorough understanding of how well the influenza-specific T-cell response in ferrets resembles that of humans. In this study we showed that both H1N1-primed ferrets and healthy human donors display high responses against NP and intermediate responses against PA and NS1 H2N2 peptide pools. Responses against PB-F2, M2, and NEP were absent or very low in both ferrets and humans. M1 responses were high in human samples but low in H1N1-primed ferrets, although H2N2 infection did lead to higher responses (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 3). This discrepancy might be caused by differences in infection history and/or MHC alleles. Improved understanding of ferret MHC composition and diversity is essential for understanding such similarities and differences between ferret and human T-cell responses.The current generation of influenza vaccines is focused on inducing HA-neutralizing antibodies. Subunit vaccines contain only HA and NA, while split vaccines additionally contain unknown or small amounts of other influenza A proteins48,49. Whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccines do contain a broader range of influenza proteins. However, inactivated vaccines in general do not infect cells or induce expression of viral proteins, which likely leads to a lower presentation of T-cell epitopes and a reduced T-cell response. With rapid mutations in IAV surface proteins and the threat of pandemics, the use of vaccines that solely focus on humoral responses is an unviable approach. In addition, vaccination of children without prior exposure to influenza might hinder the development of heterosubtypic immunity when traditional inactivated influenza vaccines are used18,50. Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) does infect cells and induce expression of viral proteins49, but in recent years LAIV vaccination has yielded mixed results (reviewed in Matrajit et al.51). Hence, despite these developments we are still in dire need of improved influenza vaccines.In the end, a successful influenza response requires both the humoral and cellular immune response, in which tissue-residency is an important factor. These branches of the immune system play different roles in the response against influenza and complement each other. As the main line of defense, neutralizing antibodies can prevent infection. Cross-reactive antibodies might additionally limit disease upon heterosubtypic infections. If an influenza strain still manages to escapes the humoral immune response, the cellular response can prevent severe disease and reduce viral replication by recognition of conserved epitopes. However, care should be taken to prevent excessive immune activation which could lead to immunopathology52. Vaccines that support the interplay of cellular and humoral immunity while preventing excessive immune responses, could help us in reducing future morbidity, mortality, and spread of seasonal and pandemic influenza infections.MethodsEthical statementThe experiment was approved by the local Authority for Animal Welfare of the Antonie van Leeuwenhoek terrain (Bilthoven, The Netherlands) under permit number AVD3260020184765 of the Dutch Central Committee for Animal experiments. All procedures were conducted according to EU legislation. Ferrets were examined for general health on a daily basis. If animals showed severe disease according to the defined endpoints prior to scheduled termination they would be euthanized by cardiac bleeding under anesthesia with ketamine (5 mg/kg; Alfasan) and medetomidine (0.1 mg/kg; Orion Pharma). Endpoints were scored based on clinical parameters for activity (0 = active; 1 = active when stimulated; 2 = inactive; and 3 = lethargic) and impaired breathing (0 = normal; 1 = fast breathing; 2 = heavy/stomach breathing). Animals were euthanized when they reached score 3 on activity level (lethargic) or when the combined score of activity and breathing impairment reached 4.VirusesA/California/07/2009 (H1N1) and A/Switzerland/97-15293/2013 (H3N2) influenza viruses were obtained from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC, London, England). A/Singapore/1/57 (H2N2) influenza virus was kindly donated by the Institute of Experimental Medicine (IEM, St Petersburg, Russia). All experiments involving H2N2 virus were carried out under BSL-3 conditions. Influenza viruses were grown on MDCK cells in MEM medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 40 µg/ml gentamicin, 0.01 M Tricine and 2 µg/ml TPCK treated trypsin (all from Sigma-Aldrich). At >90% cytopathic effect (CPE), the suspension was collected and spun down (4000 × g for 10 mins) to remove cell debris. H1N1 and H3N2 viruses were sucrose purified on a discontinuous 10–50% sucrose gradient. Due to restrictions inherent with the BSL-3 regime, H2N2 virus suspension was not sucrose purified. Instead, virus suspensions were washed twice on Amicon 100kD Ultra-15 filter units (Merck) with MEM medium. Wild-type mumps virus (MuVi/Utrecht.NLD/40.10; genotype G)53 was multiplied on Vero cells in DMEM (Gibco) with 2% fetale bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, GE Healthcare). Supernatant of the infected Vero cells was centrifuged at 500 × g and subsequently filtered (5um pore size). All virus aliquots were stored at −80 °C.Animal handlingAnimals were housed by subgroup in open cages. From the moment of infection till 14 days after, all groups were housed in BSL-3 level isolators. Animals were visually inspected each day and received food and water ad libitum. For the placement of temperature transponders animals were anesthetized with ketamine (5 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.1 mg/kg) with 0.2 ml Buprenodale (AST Farma) as a post-operative analgesic. Anesthesia was antagonized with atipamezole (0.25 mg/kg; Orion Pharma). Blood collection from the vena cava on days 0, 14, and 28 happened under similar conditions but without post-operative analgesic. For (mock)-infections, anesthesia likewise consisted of ketamine and medetomidine, but atipamezole administration was delayed by 30 mins to avoid excretion of the inoculum by sneezing and coughing. Weight determinations and swabbing occurred under anesthesia with ketamine alone and did not require an antagonist.Study designOutbred female ferrets (Schimmel b.v.) aged 18–20 months arrived at the Animal Research Centre (Bilthoven, The Netherlands) at least 3 weeks before commencement of the study for acclimatization. Each treatment/control group consisted of six animals. For practical reasons the experiment was divided into two sub-experiments – named ‘A’ and ‘B’ – with each three animals per group. The animals were semi-randomly distributed by weight. Although there were no evident differences between results of the experiments A and B, the statistical analyses used blocking by experiments in order to correct for possible time effects (see ‘Statistics’ section below).Animals received temperature transponders (Star Oddi) in the intra peritoneal cavity two weeks before start of the experiment, which recorded body temperature every 30 mins. On day 0, two groups were mock-primed intranasally (i.n.) with PBS (‘control’ and ‘non-primed’ groups). A third group was primed with 106 TCID50 H1N1 i.n. (‘H1N1-primed’ group). After four weeks, non-primed and primed groups were infected i.n. with 106 TCID50 H2N2 while the control group received a mock-infection i.n. with PBS. For both H1N1 and H2N2 infections, inoculum was administered in 0.1 ml. Prior to infection and on days 2, 4, 7, and 14 after infection, viral nose and throat swabs were collected and animal weight was measured. At the end of the experiment, animals were euthanized by heart puncture and heparin blood and serum was collected. The lungs were then perfused and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was collected by flushing the lungs twice with 30 ml of room temperature RPMI1640 (Gibco, Thermo Fisher). Heparin blood and BAL were used the same day. The spleen, lungs, and nasal turbinates were collected in RPMI1640 and stored overnight at 4 °C. Serum was isolated by centrifugation of clotted blood at 2000 × g for 10 mins and stored at −20 °C until further use.Lung perfusionTubing for manual artificial breathing was inserted via an incision in the trachea followed by opening of the chest. A cannula was inserted into the pulmonary artery via an incision in the right ventricle. The abdominal aorta was cut below the junction with the hepatic aorta to allow flushing of the cardiovascular system. Via the cannula the lungs were perfused with physiological saline (B. Braun) until the lungs appeared white and a colorless liquid ran from the abdominal aorta.Lymphocyte isolationBlood was collected in sodium-heparin coated Vacutainers (BD) and diluted 1:1 with PBS (Gibco) for density centrifugation on a 1:1 mixture of LymphoPrep (1.077 g/ml, Stemcell) and Lympholyte-M (1.0875 g/ml, Cedarlane). Cells were spun down for 30 mins at 800 × g (RT) and the interphase was washed twice using washing medium (RPMI1640 + 1%FBS). The cells were collected in stimulation medium (RPMI1640 + 10% FBS + 1x penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine [Gibco]) and counted using a hemocytometer.Spleens were homogenized in a sieve using the plunger of a 10-mL syringe after which the suspension was collected in a 50 ml tube. The tube was gently inverted to mix the suspension after which the tube was left for 1–2 mins to let the larger debris sink. The upper 40 ml of cell suspension was transferred to another tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 500×g. The pellet was resuspended in EDTA-supplemented washing medium (RPMI1640 + 1% FBS + 2 mM EDTA (Invitrogen)) and put over a 100 µm cell strainer. The resulting suspension was layered on top of Lympholyte-M and density centrifugation was performed in a similar manner as described for blood. All washing steps were performed with EDTA-supplemented medium to prevent agglutination of cells.BAL was washed twice with washing medium and resuspended in stimulation medium for further use. Lungs were processed into small cubes of ~5 mm3 and digested in 12 ml of collagenase I (2.4 mg/ml, Merck) and DNase I (1 mg/ml, Novus Biologicals) for 30 mins at 37 °C while rotating. Following this, samples were further homogenized in a sieve using a 10-mL plunger and subsequently washed with EDTA-supplemented washing medium. The suspension was then filtered over a 70-µm cell strainer and used for density centrifugation similar to the spleen.Nasal turbinates (NT) were gently mashed in a sieve and subsequently filtered over a 70-µm cell strainer. The resulting suspension was rested for 1 min to allow the cartilage fragments to sediment. The suspension – excluding the sedimented cartilage fragments – was transferred to another tube and washed twice with EDTA-supplemented washing medium. The cells were then resuspended in 40% Percoll (GE Healthcare) and layered on top of 70% Percoll. Samples were centrifuged for 20 mins at 500 × g after which the interphase was collected and washed twice with EDTA-supplemented washing medium. Lymphocytes were resuspended in stimulation medium for further use.H2N2 peptide poolsPepMixTM peptide pools for T-cell stimulation assays were obtained from JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH. Each pool contained 15 amino acids long peptides with an overlap of 11 amino acids spanning an entire protein of the internal influenza proteins of the H2N2 A/Leningrad/134/17/1957 strain. The sequence identity between A/Leningrad/134/17/1957 and A/Singapore/1/57 is ≥98% for all proteins, excluding NA and HA. The peptides were synthesized by FMOC-chemistry using a peptide synthesizer and analyzed by LC-MS. Before use, freeze-dried peptide pools were dissolved in DMSO, aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. On the day of use, peptide pool aliquots were thawed and diluted with stimulation medium. The peptide pool suspension was added to cells such that a final peptide concentration of 1 µg/ml per peptide with a DMSO concentration of <0.2% was achieved.IFNγ responses by flow cytometryIn total, 1–3 million lymphocytes were stimulated with virus at MOI 1 for 24 h or H2N2 peptide pools for 8 h. For the last 6 hours of stimulation, Brefeldin A (Golgiplug, BD) was added to the cells, followed by storage o at 4 °C. The next day, cells were washed twice with FACS buffer (2 mM EDTA, 0.5% BSA in PBS) and extracellular staining was performed in 100 µl FACS buffer with live-dead aqua (Invitrogen), α-CD4-APC (02, Sino Biological) and α-CD8a-eFluor450 (OKT8, eBioscience) for 30 mins at 4 °C. After washing, cells were fixated and permeabilised with Foxp3/Transcription factor staining buffer set (eBioscience) according to the manufacturers protocol. Cells were then stained intracellularly with α-CD3e-FITC (CD3–12, Biorad), α-CD79a-APC/eFluor780 (eBioscience), and α-IFNγ-PE (CC302, Bioconnect) for 30 mins at 4 °C. After washing twice, the pellet was resuspended in FACS buffer and measured on a LSR Fortessa X-20 (BD). Data were analyzed using FlowJoTM Software V10 (BD) and an example of the gating strategy is presented in Supplementary Fig. 4a.Cell counts by flow cytometryTo reduce cell loss inherent to washing and centrifugation steps during staining, NT and BAL samples were stained using the non-centrifugation PerFix-NC kit (Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturers protocol. In brief, cells were stained with α-CD4-APC, α-CD8a-eFluor450, and α-CD14-PE (Tük4; Thermo Fisher) for 30 mins at RT. Subsequently, cells were fixated with 25 µl Fixative Reagent for 15 min followed by permeabilization by the addition of 300 µl of Permeabilizing Reagent containing α-CD3e-FITC and α-CD79a-APC/eFluor780. Cells were intracellularly stained for 30 mins at RT, after which 3 ml of Final Reagent was added to each tube. To concentrate the cells the tube was spun down (500×g, 5 min) and 2.5 ml of the liquid was discarded while the pellet was resuspended in the remaining volume. In total, 50 µl of Coulter Flow-Count Fluorospheres (Beckman Coulter) was added to each sample and the sample was vortexed just before measurement on a LSR Fortessa X-20. Data was analyzed using FlowJoTM Software V10 (BD) and an example of the gating strategy is presented in Supplementary Fig. 4b.ELISpotPre-coated Ferret IFNγ-ELISpot (ALP) plates (Mabtech) were used according to the manufacturers protocol. Lymphocytes were stimulated with live virus (MOI 1 or 0.1) or H2N2 peptide pools in ELISpot plates at 37 °C. Per well, 250 K cells (PBMC, splenocytes), 125 K cells (nasal turbinates), and 62.5 K cells (lung lymphocytes) or undiluted cell suspension (BAL) was added. After 20 h the plates were developed according to the manufacturers protocol, with the modification that the first antibody staining was performed overnight at 4 °C. Plates were left to dry for 2–3 days after which they were packaged under BSL-3 conditions and heated to 65 °C for 3 h to inactivate any remaining infectious influenza particles. Analysis of ELISpot plates was performed using the ImmunoSpot® S6 CORE (CTL, Cleveland, OH).Virus titer analysisNose and throat swabs were collected in 2 ml transport medium containing 15% sucrose (Merck), 2.5 µg/ml Amphotericin B, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 250 µg/ml gentamicin (all from Sigma) and stored at −80 °C. For analysis, swabs were thawed, vortexed, serially diluted, and tested in 6-plo on MDCK cells. CPE was scored after 5 days of culturing and TCID50 values were calculated using the Reed & Muench method.ELISAImmulon 2 HB 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher) were coated overnight at RT with 100 μl/well recombinant H2-protein of A/Singapore/1/57 (0.5 μg/ml; BEI Resources; NR-2668). Sera were 2-fold serially diluted in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween-80, incubated on the coated plates for 60 mins at 37 °C, and subsequently washed thrice with 0.1% Tween-80. HRP-conjugated goat anti-ferret IgG (Alpha Diagnostic) was diluted 1:5000 in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-80 and 0.5% Protivar (Nutricia) and used to stain H2 bound antibodies for 60 mins at 37 °C. Plates were then washed thrice with 0.1% Tween-80 to remove residual antibodies and once with normal PBS to remove Tween-80. Plates were developed for 10 mins with SureBlue™ TMB (KPL) substrate, after which development was stopped by the addition of 100 μl 2 M H2SO4 per well. OD450-values were determined on the EL808 absorbance reader (Bio-Tek Instruments) and individual curves were visualized using local polynomial regression fitting with R software54.Serological analysisHemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers in ferret sera were determined according to WHO guidelines55. In brief, sera were heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min, treated with receptor destroying enzyme (Sigma), and tested in duplicate against four hemagglutinating units of H1N1 or H2N2 using 1% turkey red blood cells (bioTRADING Mijdrecht).Human blood donorsBuffy coats from healthy individuals born after 1968 were obtained from the Dutch blood bank (Sanquin, Netherlands). Donors provided written informed consent and the study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Sanquin Blood Supply. PBMCs were isolated by density centrifugation as described before56 and stored at −135 °C till further use. Samples were thawed, resuspended in stimulation medium, and rested for 3 h at 37 °C. ELISpot plates were coated with the Human IFN-γ ELISpotBASIC kit (Mabtech) and stimulations were performed as described above with 400K PBMCs per stimulus.Influenza A sequence and epitope analysisProtein sequences of influenza A subtypes were retrieved from the GISAID database32 (www.gisaid.org [accessed 9-4-2019]) and aligned against A/California/07/2009 using the online NIH protein blast tool. For the epitope analysis, influenza A epitopes were retrieved from the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource33 (IEDB; www.iedb.org [accessed on 25-9-2019]). A search for linear, MHC class-I restricted and assay-confirmed epitopes yielded a total of 849 epitopes for all influenza A proteins. After exclusion of non-unique epitopes and alignment against A/California/07/2009 using R software54, a total of 343 epitopes was found to be present in proteins of A/California/07/2009. These 343 epitopes were subsequently mapped against the proteins of A/Singapore/1/57 to determine if these epitopes were conserved between strains.Statistics and reproducibilityThe experiment was divided into two subgroups, A and B, for practical reasons. Although we did not see evident differences between experiments A and B, we included the experimental subgroup as a blocking factor in our analysis. In brief, differences between groups were analyzed using R software54 and images were visualized with the R package ggplot257. Treatment groups, namely H1N1-primed and Non-primed, were compared by means of the permutation test for differences in group averages with experiment (time) as block implemented in the R package coin58, with p-values estimated by 10,000,000 simulations. Assays analyzed by this method include TCID50 determinations on MDCK cells sampled from the throat and from the nose at days 30 and 32, and with respect to weight at days 30, 32, 35, and 42. The same test was used to compare the two treatment groups and each treatment group with the placebo group with respect to the following endpoints: maximum temperature between days 28–38, infiltration of CD8 T cells in the BAL and NT, percent IFNγ+ cells within CD4 and in CD8 T-cell population sampled from spleen, lungs and PBMC, IFNγ-spot counts for lungs and PBMC. The results of the tests were corrected for multiple testing by using the Benjamini–Hochberg method59 at a nominal false discovery rate (FDR) of 10%. Only the results that passed the correction have been reported as findings in the results section, which, roughly speaking, means that at most 10% of our findings are likely to be spurious. Associations between IFNγ-spot count and CD8 T cell numbers were tested by using Pearson’s correlation coefficient.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Recently, the focus has been on the start of the influenza season. âEven before the coronavirus pandemic, demand for influenza vaccines was growing,â says Lyn Morgan, Sanofi Pasteur Public Affairs Lead on Influenza and COVID-19. âVaccination rates in recommended populations typically vary by country: some countries succeed in vaccinating large majorities of their recommended populations while others reach less than half.â Without consistently high coverage rates, influenza still takes a heavy toll around the world. Influenza can trigger severe complications such as pneumonia and more unexpected outcomes such as heart attacks and strokes.1, 2Â Each year, influenza-associated deaths range from 290,000 to 650,000 globally with some 10 million influenza-related hospitalizations.3, 4, 5 A yearly flu shot is considered the most effective way to prevent influenza infection and its complications. The World Health Organization recommends annual influenza vaccination for people aged 65 and older, pregnant women, people with pre-existing health conditions (such as diabetes, asthma, chronic heart or lung diseases), children aged six months to five years, and healthcare workers.6Â Individual health authority recommendations vary by country. The COVID-19 pandemic has further boosted demand for influenza vaccines in upcoming seasons to help protect vulnerable people and reduce preventable impact on healthcare systems. Sanofi Pasteur offers several different kinds of influenza vaccines. Its standard-of-care quadrivalent vaccines help protect against all four main virus strain types that circulate each season and are some of the most broadly produced and administered flu vaccines worldwide. In addition, Sanofi has developed high-dose vaccines that are indicated for adults aged 65 and older, as well as a vaccine produced with recombinant protein technology, which ensures an exact match to virus strains recommended by the WHO each season. âWe have done everything possible to accelerate and optimize our supply of all of our influenza vaccines to help satisfy the additional demand this year around the world,â says Sean Batten, Lead on Global Supply Chain for Influenza Vaccines. âWe sincerely hope that the huge effort that has been made to maximize our ability to meet country requests for vaccines will contribute to less influenza disease this season, and fewer people at risk from its severe effects,â concludes Lyn. If you would like to learn more about influenza vaccines or if one is recommended for you in your country, please ask your doctor.

BrooksUpdated: January 9, 2024 | Original: October 5, 2020copy page linkPrint PageThe National ArchivesWhen it came to getting healthcare during the 1918 influenza epidemic, America’s Black communities, hobbled by poverty, Jim Crow segregation and rampant discrimination, were mostly forced to fend for themselves. Opportunities for hospital care proved scarce, leaving many relying on family care and, where available, the small but burgeoning ranks of Black nurses.When the 1918 influenza epidemic began, African Americans were already beset by a barrage of social, medical and public health problems, asserts Vanessa Northington Gamble, a physician and medical historian at George Washington University. Among the challenges she identified in her 2010 study of the African American experience of the 1918 flu pandemic: “racist theories of black biological inferiority, racial barriers in medicine and public health, and poor health status.” The Spanish Flu Was Deadlier Than WWISome 675,000 people were infected in the United States and 500 million worldwide during the 1918 pandemic, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Accurate numbers showing how many African Americans contracted the disease—or succumbed to it—aren’t available; records remain scarce, since so few of those victims had contact with institutional healthcare providers or agencies.Some research suggests African Americans may actually have been less susceptible to catching the 1918 influenza virus. “One of the theories we advance is that segregation was functioning somewhat as a quarantine,” says Lakshmi Krishnan, a physician and medical historian at Georgetown University, who co-authored a paper comparing racial disparities in COVID-19 relative to the 1918 flu pandemic. Since pandemics “have always disproportionately affected Black, indigenous and Latinx people,” she says, that made the 1918 influenza “a bit of an anomaly” from an epidemiology perspective.Most Hospitals Turned Away Black PeopleBut while African Americans were less likely than white Americans to contract the disease, they were far more likely to die from it if they did catch it.The key reason: Black Americans received substandard care in segregated hospitals—if they could even be admitted. “Not many hospitals accepted Black Americans, and those that did sent them to the basement for care,” says Marian Moser Jones, a public health scholar at the University of Maryland. There, they likely languished in rooms unintended for patient treatment, receiving neither the full resources nor timely medical attention white patients received in the main wards.Only a small number of Black hospitals existed at the time—and only in large metropolitan areas. They included Freedman’s Hospital (now Howard University Hospital) in Washington, D.C., Provident Hospital in Chicago (the nation’s first Black owned and operated hospital) or Lincoln Hospital in New York City. And while pioneering in the training of African American doctors and nurses—Provident, for example, was the first nursing school in the nation—they tended to be understaffed and under-resourced relative to the white hospitals.Most African Americans ended up being treated in their homes by family members and midwives. The cramped and difficult living conditions driven by poverty, racism and discrimination made caring for loved ones—and avoiding spread of the infection—challenging. “African Americans did not have the funds for a private day nurse,” says Jones. “This was before health insurance. So many people suffered and died at home, or suffered and survived at home.”Communities Tried to Care for Their OwnHealth historians paint a picture of heroic efforts by handfuls of Black nurses and physicians working to serve their community. They also acknowledge the role of black churches, women’s groups, newspapers and community leaders in stressing education and prevention, and in mobilizing local volunteers. “There was a very community-driven response to secure the health of Black people who were ill and to also to make sure they realized that this was a serious illness,” says S. Michelle Ogunwole, general internal medicine fellow at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and co-author of “Historical Insights on Coronavirus Disease 2019.” One example: The National Urban League implemented grassroots neighborhood programs to try to help Black Americans living in cities. According to Gamble’s report on the epidemic, it hired a trained nurse in Columbus, Ohio to provide free home care to influenza victims. The Chicago branch organized volunteers to serve the same function. In one case, the report states, volunteers arrived at a home where a mother and her five children were stricken, only to discover that two of the children had already succumbed. “The volunteers cleaned the home and also summoned a nurse.”Baltimore’s Black community was hit early and hard—with higher infection rates than in other cities, says Jones. With cemeteries full and caskets piling up, the city called in sanitation workers to help handle the backlog. When they refused, the mayor asked for help from the War Department, which sent in more than 300 African American soldiers—who were always detailed, Jones says, to “the most undesirable, gruesome and most labor-intensive jobs.”Black Nurses, Sidelined Elsewhere, Became a ForceBuyenlarge/Getty ImagesHoward University class in nursing, circa 1915.Black nurses played a major role in the caring for the Black community’s stricken, despite facing discrimination. Southern nursing schools denied them entrance, while Northern schools admitted them in token numbers. After the U.S. entered World War I, the Army and the American Red Cross turned Black nurses away when they tried to volunteer, Jones says. “By the time the flu came around, there were almost 3,000 Black women who had top-notch training that rivaled those of white nurses,” she adds. But eventually, as more white nurses shipped overseas to military hospitals in Europe during World War I, and the pandemic took hold, a nursing shortage developed at home. “Many [African American nurses] were called up to serve in hospitals, private day nursing and in military hospitals, where they had previously been excluded,” says Jones, who wrote about their efforts in a study on Black nurses during the 1918 flu pandemic.Among them: Frances Reed Elliott, the first Black nurse enrolled into the Red Cross nursing service. Sent to rural Tennessee to finally fulfill her hard-fought dream of working in healthcare, she reportedly learned to drive a car in a single day so she could make house calls to patients in both Black and white communities. After several months of service there, she eventually contracted influenza herself and was admitted to Washington, D.C.’s Freedman’s Hospital—where she had completed her training. Elliott recovered and went on to a long career in public health.When the influenza pandemic ended, it didn’t lead to any public health or medical initiatives to improve the poor health status of Black Americans, says Gamble. Nor did it lead to changes in opportunities for Black health professionals—with very few exceptions. “They remained segregated in the Black medical world.”By: Rodney A. BrooksRodney A.

Wearing masks, washing hands, and keeping six feet away from other people to avoid COVID-19 are measures you can take that will also help protect you from flu. But some will still get the flu, and COVID-19 is still with us. What if both viruses surge and then mingle in the emergency room, straining health care resources as doctors try to care for everyone?Doctors and public health experts have no way of predicting how things will go in the coming months, so they are responding with an urgent message: Get a flu shot. Even if you’ve never gotten the vaccination before, do it this year.“I would tell people who don’t typically get flu shots that the coronavirus makes this year a different story,” says Matthew Grant, MD, a Yale Medicine infectious disease specialist. Flu alone fills many hospital beds in normal years, so doctors are already preparing for the higher numbers of sick patients that could happen this season, he says. “This year, if we don’t do things right, the flu has the potential to take a much greater toll.” Children need to get vaccinated as well, says Caitlin Hansen, MD, a pediatric infectious disease specialist. “I start to sound like a broken record, but the one thing we know you can do is get a flu shot. It is the best thing we have in our toolbox for flu.”How does the upcoming flu season look?Based on reports of fewer flu cases in Australia and other countries below the equator (where the virus peaks during their winter, which is our summer), public health experts here in the U.S. are hoping for a mild season. But nobody knows for sure—there are many flu viruses and the predominant ones are always changing. Vaccine makers have increased supply and are making enough flu vaccine for a record 194-198 million doses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends every adult and child who is 6 months or older get vaccinated in September or October (although the vaccine will be available through the end of the season in March 2021). There are several vaccination options, including standard-dose shots, high-dose shots for people ages 65 and older, shots made with virus grown in cell culture (making it safe for people with egg allergies), and the live attenuated vaccine given by nasal spray (for people ages 2 through 49). If you still have doubts, here are five reasons to consider getting the flu vaccine this year. 1. It will help avoid overwhelming a system that may be stretched as it manages both flu and COVID-19.Even in years when there isn’t a threat like COVID-19, “flu can lead to bed shortages in the hospital,” says Dr. Grant. At Yale, he has been participating in extensive planning for the possibility of a “twindemic” that could result from severe outbreaks of both COVID-19 and the flu—a scenario that some doctors say would mean initially treating every patient as a COVID-19 case, isolating them until they are tested and diagnosed. “A lot of work goes into reacting to the epidemiology of the outbreak in the community and figuring out how best to meet the needs of our patients,” says Dr. Grant. “If the rate of either flu or coronavirus infections goes up by as little as 10%, it affects how health care workers will need to respond.” In addition, avoiding the flu can protect other people, Dr. Grant says. Flu is contagious in the 48 hours before people who are infected begin to have symptoms, so you can spread it to other people before you know you have it, he says. 2. Getting the flu shot may help cut down on symptom confusion.Flu and COVID-19 share many symptoms. While you can always call your doctor if a symptom is confusing, it could be easier to figure out what it means if you’ve had the flu vaccine. “There is a lot of overlap,” says Dr. Hansen, “and I think it is going to be a challenge for us to differentiate between these illnesses. Although getting a flu shot doesn’t mean someone couldn’t still get the flu, knowing if a patient had one is important information during a pandemic.” Both viruses can cause illness that may range from mild to severe. According to the CDC, both flu and COVID-19 may cause the following symptoms: Fever or feeling feverish/chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue (tiredness) Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle pain or body aches Headache Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults It’s important to note, however, that loss of taste and smell is a symptom of COVID-19 that doesn’t occur with the flu. 3. You may have more protection from the worst-case scenarios.Precautions such as social distancing that are already in place for COVID-19 could help prevent flu. “We know from years of experience with influenza that there are things that can interrupt transmission. Surgical masks are the primary mode of reducing in-hospital spread of influenza, along with handwashing,” Dr. Grant says. But the flu vaccine is considered to be the most important tool for preventing flu. A flu shot may also protect people from COVID-19 in other ways. Doctors can’t say for sure if getting the flu would make someone more susceptible to COVID-19, or vice versa—although they do know that having the flu makes people more vulnerable for bacterial infections like pneumonia, Dr. Grant says. They can’t say what would happen if someone contracted both flu and COVID-19, either. “We really don’t know, but one might imagine the two viruses could act synergistically and make you more ill.” 4. A bad flu can be life-threatening.While illness and death statistics from COVID-19 have been alarming, the numbers of people seriously affected by flu alone are also formidable. During the 2018–2019 season, an estimated 35.5 million people got the flu. Many had a mild enough case that they were able to take care of themselves at home. But 16.5 million consulted a health care provider, 490,600 were hospitalized, and 34,200 died, according to the CDC. “People who have had flu before know how bad it can be,” says Dr. Grant. But it could have been worse: According to the CDC, during the same period, the flu vaccine is believed to have prevented an estimated 4.4 million flu-associated illnesses, 2.3 million medical visits, 58,000 hospitalizations, and 3,500 deaths. Similar to COVID-19, older people are at highest risk for flu complications, but young, healthy people get seriously sick too. “Sometimes we see perfectly healthy teenagers and young adults who have influenza so serious we need to put them on ventilators—and some who die. It can be very tragic,” Dr. Grant says. Dr. Hansen adds, “Younger kids also can get very bad flu that makes them very sick, lands them in the hospital, and even in the intensive care unit. It can be a very serious illness for children, even if they’re otherwise healthy.” 5. The vaccine can help even if it's not 100% effective.It’s true that the flu vaccine’s effectiveness varies from year to year. (Studies show that when it’s most effective it reduces risk for flu illness by 40 to 60%.) But if you turn out to be one of the people who gets sick despite getting the vaccine, chances are you will have a milder flu and a lower chance of being hospitalized. Contrary to what some people think, the flu shot will not give you the flu, although some have experienced mild flu-like reactions such as achiness and fever. Another myth is that the flu shot could protect against COVID-19. It will not, but scientists are currently testing more than 35 potential vaccines for the new coronavirus in clinical trials and hoping to find one that can be deemed safe and effective enough for general use. How and where you get a flu vaccine may change this year due to the pandemic. If you aren’t sure where to go, call your doctor, or go to VaccineFinder, an online tool recommended by the CDC to help find a vaccination site close to home.

Diagnosis depends on clinical presentation and characteristic neuroimaging findings of abnormal signal intensity involving the thalami as well as the supra and infra-tentorial areas. Treatment modalities are not well-established; empirical treatment with antibiotics and antiviral agents is the initial step, followed by steroids and immunoglobulin, as well as supportive care. Patients with ANEC have a variable prognosis, but mortality is very high. Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with ANEC in five tertiary centers from January 2015 to October 2018 was performed. Clinical and radiological findings, as well as the therapeutic approach and outcomes, were described. Results: Twelve children were included ranging in age from 10 months to 6 years. All patients presented with preceding febrile illness, altered level of consciousness, and seizure. Radiological features showed abnormal signals in the thalami, and five patients (41.7%) had brainstem involvement. All patients received empirical treatment with antibiotics and antiviral agents. Ten patients (83.3%) received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and IV Methylprednisolone therapy. Outcomes were variable ranging from good outcomes with minimal neurological deficits to poor outcomes and death in 25% of cases. Conclusion: ANEC is a rare fulminant disease in children. The treatment is challenging. Early interventions with the use of IVIG and IV Methylprednisolone may change the outcome; however, further studies are needed to establish a consensus guideline for the management. Introduction Acute necrotizing encephalopathy of childhood (ANEC) is a fulminant type of encephalopathy. Most reported cases occur in Asian children with the highest prevalence among patients between the age of 6 and 18 months (1). The most common clinical presentations are fever, rapid alteration in the level of consciousness, and seizures, in addition to characteristic findings in brain imaging that include, but are not limited to, bilateral thalamic lesions with supra and infra-tentorial lesions of variable dimensions (2). The diagnosis of ANEC was determined by specific diagnostic criteria as described by Mizuguchi (1) which consist of (1) encephalopathy preceded by viral febrile illness with rapid deterioration in the level of consciousness and convulsions. (2) Absent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis. (3) Symmetric multifocal brain lesions. (4) Elevation in serum aminotransferase levels. (5) Exclusion of similar diseases. The most frequent etiologies are viral-related, but sporadic cases of non-viral ANEC have been reported (3). Influenza virus has an important role in causing ANEC. In 1994, it was noticed that the number of cases of ANEC in Japan increased after discontinuation of the influenza vaccine that year (4). It was observed previously that influenza-associated ANEC is characterized by an increase in serum cytokine concentrations (interleukin-6 and interleukin-10) as compared to controls (5). The association between RANBP2 gene pathogenic variants and susceptibility to ANEC has been addressed in previous studies (6–8). In this study, we aimed to present the clinical and radiological features, as well as treatment modalities and outcomes of 12 children with ANEC following viral infection in five tertiary care centers in Saudi Arabia. Methods This was a retrospective review of patients who were diagnosed with ANEC in five tertiary centers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from January 2015 to October 2018. The diagnosis of ANEC was determined by specific characteristic findings proposed by Mizuguchi (1) and Mizuguchi et al. (2). We included patients who were under 18 years and presented with clinical features consistent with ANEC in the form of altered level of consciousness, and seizures, preceded by viral illness with typical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of ANEC which include symmetrical, multifocal brain lesions involving mainly both thalami. Clinical characteristics and radiological features, as well as laboratory investigations, were collected. Other differential diagnoses were excluded based on clinical and radiological features as well as metabolic screening. All patients had normal serum ammonia, normal basic metabolic workup, including serum lactate, amino acids, and urine for organic acids. We described the outcome based on the follow-up visits in neurology clinics. The need to obtain informed consent was waived for a retrospective review of patient records. Statistical Analysis The mean standard deviation was used to describe continuous variables, categorically measured variables were described using frequency and percentage. The Pearson's correlation test (r) was used to assess the correlation between continuous variables and the Fischer's exact test and Chi Square tests were used for assessing the correlation between categorically measured variables. The multiple response dichotomies analysis was employed to assess the combined incidence of various signs and symptoms and presenting complaints of ANEC diagnosed patients at admission time due to the possibility of presenting with different combinations of symptoms and signs. The study was approved by the institutional review board and ethical committee of the College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSU-IRB Number 18/0683). Results Clinical Presentation and Radiological Features A total of 14 patients with ANEC were identified; two patients were excluded due to the inability to meet the ANEC radiological criteria. Patients' ages ranged from 10 months to 6 years (mean 30.92 months, median 22 months, standard deviation 20.63). Nine patients (75%) were female. All patients presented with preceding febrile illness in the form of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms, or gastrointestinal symptoms in the form of vomiting or diarrhea, and altered level of consciousness. Seizures were the initial presentation in eight cases (66.7%). Brain imaging was carried out using Axial, Sagittal, and Coronal T1,T2, FLAIR, diffusion, and susceptibility weighted images which showed characteristic high signal intensity on axial T2 and FLAIR with variable degree of involvement of both thalami in all cases. Diffusion restriction was also seen, while the susceptibility sequence showed dark signal intensity with blooming, indicating hemorrhagic changes. Out of 12 patients, five (41.7%) had brainstem involvement. Follow up brain MRIs were done 2–3 months after the initial presentation, which showed signs of improvement on 33.3%, and 66.7% (n = 8) showed no signs of improvement. The clinical and radiological presentations are summarized in Tables 1, 2. Figures 1–4 show brain MRIs for selected patients. TABLE 1 Table 1.

Laboratory Investigations All patients had a preceding viral illness. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was positive for influenza A in 6 (50% of patients), whereas one patient had adenovirus, and the remaining (5 patients) had no isolated viral agents. A CSF polymerase chain reaction test for influenza A, enteroviruses and Herpes simplex virus was negative in the 10 tested patients. Patients showed variable complete blood count (CBC) findings. Five patients (41.7%) had mild reversible thrombocytopenia and three developed leukocytosis. High levels of liver enzymes on initial presentation were detected in 66.7% of patients. All patients had a normal serum ammonia level. Basic metabolic workup, including serum amino acid, urine for organic acid, and serum lactate, were normal. CSF testing was done for all patients except two of them due to hemodynamic instability. Patients who underwent CSF testing had a normal cell count. Bacteriology culture studies were negative, Influenza virus and other viruses such as herpes simplex virus and human herpesvirus-6 were not isolated in the CSF, including patients with a positive nasopharyngeal aspiration (NPA) test for influenza A. CSF glucose and protein levels were variable, ranging from 3.2 to 5.6 mmol/L and from 0.19 to 1.65 g/dL, respectively. Laboratory findings are summarized in Table 3. TABLE 3 Table 3. Laboratory investigations. Genetic Testing Genetic testing was done in five patients [whole exome sequencing (WES) in three and direct gene sequencing in two patients]. Genetic testing was not done for other patients either due to limited access to genetic testing or early deterioration and death in others. For the patients who had WES, the result was negative, while single gene sequencing for the RANBP2 gene revealed a missense heterozygous variant in two patients [c.3363G>T, p. (Lys1121Asn) and c.128A>T, p. (Asp43Val)]. Both variants were classified as a variant of uncertain significance according to the recommendations of the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG). Treatment and Outcomes All cases were initially treated with antibiotics (mainly vancomycin and ceftriaxone) and antiviral (acyclovir) therapy. Intravenous methylprednisolone, 30 mg/kg daily for 3 days, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), 1 gm/kg daily for 2 days, was administered early in the course of the disease (within 72 h of presentation) in 10 cases (83.3%). The remaining two patients did not receive this regimen due to rapid deterioration and early death within the first 48 h. Tapering dose of oral steroids was used in six patients (50%). Plasma exchange (PLEX) was tried for two patients who did not show significant improvement. All patients underwent physiotherapy and speech therapy with variable responses. Table 4 summarizes the treatment received. Outcomes were variable among our cases. Five patients had improvements in motor and cognitive functions; two patients had dystonia, two patients had speech delay, and early death in three patients (25%). Nine of the 12 patients had survived; all those survivors had received a combination of IVIG and IV methylprednisolone. Two patients who did not receive this combination of therapy died. However, statistical significance cannot be established due to singularity of the measured variables due to the small sample size. Table 5 shows prognoses and final outcomes. Survival was associated significantly with the use of IVIG and IV methylprednisolone combination (P = 0.043, Fisher's exact chi-squared test), demonstrated in Table 6. TABLE 4 Table 4. Treatments received. TABLE 5 Table 5. Prognosis and final outcomes: n = 12. TABLE 6 Table 6. The Bivariate association between IVIG and IV methylprednisolone use with the survival: (n = 10). Discussion ANEC represents a fulminant type of encephalopathy which was initially described among Japanese and Taiwanese patients (2, 9). It is believed that ANEC has similar behavior to that of metabolic and immune-mediated disorders (10), but the exact pathophysiology is still unknown. It has multiple presumed causes that include previous infection, predominantly by influenza, herpes simplex virus, and human herpesvirus-6 (10–14). The affected children are more commonly to be those who are under 2 years of age. However, it can also affect older children as evidenced in this series. In the present study, all patients had a preceding viral illness, as evidenced by clinical presentation and virology screening. Mizuguchi proposed specific criteria to establish the ANEC diagnosis (1). All patients had the proposed diagnostic criteria. Yagishita et al. (9) mentioned that it is not uncommon for patients with ANEC to have a normal CSF cell count. Similarly, all patients in our retrospective series had normal CSF findings. In accordance with previous studies, all patients showed bilateral thalamic lesions with variable involvement of other areas of the brain, including the basal ganglia, brainstem, cerebral white matter, and cerebellum. All of our patients had normal serum ammonia levels, which is one of the criteria proposed in the literature and noticed in previously reported cases (1, 9). Differential diagnoses, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and other metabolic disorders like Leigh disease, organic acidemia, and Reye syndrome, need to be ruled out (15). The affected individuals with ANEC in this study were previously healthy, and basic metabolic studies were done with negative findings, including the absence of hypoglycemia, hyperammonia, and lactic acidosis as well as negative WES testing in three tested patients. In addition to the fact that previously reported cases did not have recurrent episodes (16). Reye syndrome can be differentiated from ANEC since the former is accompanied by hypoglycemia and hyperammonia and predominantly develops in patients treated with Aspirin (17). Multiple studies have shown an association between RANBP2 gene pathogenic variants and increased susceptibility to ANEC (6–8, 18–20). The RANBP2 gene is located on chromosome 2q12.1-q13 and is part of the nuclear pore complex. This complex facilitates protein import and export and plays an important role in neuronal energy maintenance (20, 21). Heterozygous pathogenic variants in RANBP2 gene and familial or recurrent ANEC have been reported in the literature, with the most common pathogenic variant being a missense, c.1754C>T, p.(Thr585Met). Those variants are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and most of them have incomplete penetrance. On the other hand, there were cases in which no RANBP2 variants were found, which suggests the existence of other predisposing factors (22, 23). In this study, both patients had RANBP2 gene variants of uncertain significance according to the recommendations of the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG). The treatment of ANEC is not well-established and remains controversial. A previous study found that early intervention within 24 h of the presentation by IV Methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day for 5 days or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/day divided into two to four doses for 2–4 days was associated with a good prognosis, while patients treated after 24 h had poorer outcomes. In the same study, patients who had brainstem lesions did not show significant recovery. On the other hand, IVIG administration was not shown to have significant prognostic value (24). Despite the prognostic value of administering IV Methylprednisolone within 24 h of presentation, the treatment of ANEC remains challenging as physicians hesitate to start their patients on IV Methylprednisolone early, since the condition may mimic herpetic encephalitis. The presence of characteristic neuroradiological features and initial negative CSF study may encourage treating physicians to consider the initiation of steroids early in the course of the disease. Nine of the patients in our study who received IV Methylprednisolone and IVIG had acceptable outcomes in motor and mental functions during their follow up. However, there were no standardized outcome measurements done for the patients. Survival was associated significantly with the use of IVIG and IV methylprednisolone combination. It is difficult to judge the efficacy of PLEX based on two patients. The prognosis of ANEC is generally variable; however, multiple studies have shown improvement over time (15). It is assumed that patients under 2 years old with increased liver enzyme levels and brainstem lesions have a poorer prognosis (9, 25–28). Liver function tests did not help determine vital prognosis. Liver enzyme levels were mildly to moderately increased in patients who died, while one case had a better prognosis despite the significantly higher aminotransferase levels. Brain edema and brainstem involvement, documented in five of our patients, led to variable outcomes, while the degree of severity of brainstem involvement may play an important role in determining prognosis. Limitations of the Study This study has some limitations. First, it was a retrospective study, which did not allow us to determine a causal relationship between the tested parameters and the prognosis of ANEC, or to have standardized outcome measures. Second, the sample size was small, which limits the statistical analysis and generalization of results. Thirdly, we could not conduct functional studies on the found RANBP2 variant, and there was no other data supporting pathogenicity. Conclusion ANEC is a rare fulminant disease. Optimizing treatment tends to be challenging, but early recognition and intervention and early use of IVIG and IV Methylprednisolone may help improve outcomes. Further studies are needed to establish a consensus guideline for the management of such cases.

As the Northern Hemisphere heads into winter, countries face the double threat of the annual flu season overlapping with the continuing coronavirus pandemic. Influenza cases typically see a spike from November to March in the Northern Hemisphere and from June to August in the Southern Hemisphere – coinciding with cold weather conditions. In tropical and subtropical countries, there is no marked cold season, so flu tends to circulate all year round. The WHO has warned that the co-circulation of influenza and COVID-19 – both of which cause respiratory illness – could place an additional burden on vulnerable populations and healthcare systems that are already stretched because of the pandemic. To alleviate some of that strain, the UN health agency is urging countries to prioritise their influenza vaccination programmes this year, vaccinating those at high risk of developing complications – including pregnant women, the elderly, children, and people with underlying health issues. According to interim recommendations for the COVID-19 pandemic, if the flu vaccine is in short supply, two target groups – health workers and older people – should have the highest priority to get vaccinated. There are currently no licensed treatments nor a vaccine for COVID-19, but several drugs and more than 200 vaccine candidates are being studied in large clinical trials. “The good news is that there are ways to prevent and treat flu through vaccination, and antivirals for treatment, and also through the public health and social measures, which we’re using quite a lot for COVID that serve a purpose for both of them,” Ann Moen, chief of influenza preparedness and response at the WHO, told Al Jazeera. This year, countries in the Southern Hemisphere have already reported a significantly lower number of flu cases compared with previous years. In Australia, for instance, a total of 21,156 lab-confirmed cases of influenza have so far been recorded by the department of health, compared with 289,731 flu cases over the same period last year. Similar trends were seen during the peak winter months in New Zealand, South Africa and parts of Latin America. Experts believe lockdowns, travel restrictions and school closures, as well as other infection prevention and control measures in place for COVID-19 – like physical distancing, hand-washing, respiratory etiquette and face masks – likely contributed to the downward trend. But it remains unclear if a similar decline will be seen in the Northern Hemisphere in the coming months. Moen said other reasons, like viral interference or viral competition, could be contributing factors and need to be studied further. Flu cases in the Southern Hemisphere [Photo credit: WHO] Similar symptoms There are concerns about the overlap of the flu season with the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the similarities between the two viruses. Both are transmitted by droplets spread through direct or close contact with an infected person, and indirect contact with contaminated surfaces, also known as fomite transmission. A person infected with COVID-19 or flu can experience their illness in a wide range of ways: from being asymptomatic or getting a mild case, to experiencing severe disease and even death. However, the greater mortality rate and higher fraction of severe and critical infections are seen in patients with COVID-19, according to current data and the WHO. The flu and COVID-19 also have a similar range of symptoms – from fever, sore throat and dry cough to tiredness, headaches, and aches and pains. However, a loss of smell and taste, especially among young adults, is more specific to COVID-19 patients. “The only way to really know if somebody has the flu or COVID-19 is [through] a lab test. People can’t really self diagnose,” Moen said. In all cases, people should follow local health guidelines, monitor their symptoms and seek medical care in case of severe illness, she added. And, if a person tests positive for COVID-19, it is important for them to self-isolate. In a recent Q&A, Sylvie Briand, director of the Department of Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness at the WHO, said people with underlying conditions, such as cardiac disease or other respiratory chronic illness, asthma and diabetes, should be more aware of the signs of severity so they can get prompt advice and treatment. Pregnant women are also at a higher risk of developing a severe form of influenza because of a change in their immunity. Where supplies permit, they should be prioritised to receive the flu vaccine. The WHO will publish detailed guidelines to help countries better prepare and tackle the upcoming flu season amid COVID-19.

Oct. 8, 2020 SLIPPERY ROCK, Pa. — Hundreds of Slippery Rock University students have already done what a majority of the U.S. adult population doesn't do: get vaccinated for influenza. SRU's Student Health Services administered flu shots to nearly 400 students who chose to attend free vaccination clinics on campus, Sept. 17 and Oct. 5. Additionally, more than 65 SRU employees received flu shots through two on-campus clinics, Sept. 30 and Oct. 6, organized through the Human Resources Office. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 48% of American adults received flu vaccinations last year, including 38% of those ages 18-49. While people around the world anxiously await a vaccine for another respiratory virus, the novel coronavirus that resulted in the current global pandemic, the flu vaccine has heightened importance in 2020. "There is no greater time to get a flu shot than now," said Kris Benkeser, director of student health and wellness. "The best way to manage the flu in 2020 is the same as every year: vaccinate as many people as possible to prevent it from circulating. But it's even more important this year because of the stress that COVID-19 already puts on available health care resources and the compounding effect that both viruses have on the health of individuals." CLUKEY According to the CDC, it is possible to have the flu, as well as other respiratory illnesses, and COVID-19 at the same time. Health experts are still studying how common this can be. "Getting a flu vaccine will not protect you from COVID but it will help prevent the diagnostic dilemmas in flu season, as more testing is needed to help confirm a COVID diagnosis," Benkeser said. "As far as clinical presentation, the flu and COVID are virtually indistinguishable. The only symptoms that people with COVID present that people with flu do not sometimes include the change in or loss of taste or smell." The symptoms of both COVID-19 and the flu include: fever or chills; cough; fatigue; muscle or body aches; headache; sore throat; congestion or runny nose; shortness of breath; vomiting; and diarrhea. Not everyone with the flu will experience fever, and vomiting and diarrhea are more common in children with the flu than adults. SRU students and employees who were recently vaccinated are getting out ahead of the flu season, which typically starts in the U.S. in October and peaks between December and February. Recent flu seasons in the U.S. have been among the deadliest (estimated 61,000 deaths in 2017-18) and the longest (21 weeks in 2018-19), and last year's cases could have been just as severe as previous years, with 34,157 deaths, if not for the COVID-19 control measures that shortened the season. Even if members of the SRU community could not attend one of the on-campus vaccination clinics, they are encouraged to get their flu shot from their doctor or at their local pharmacy, as flu shots are covered under most health insurance plans. However, some SRU students said they preferred taking advantage of the convenience and safety of the on-campus vaccination clinics. The Sept. 17 and Oct. 5 clinics were conducted outdoors under open-air tents set up in the Alumni House parking lot along Campus Drive. "I get a flu shot every year because it's important to protect yourself and others, and especially with COVID, I don't want to get hit with both viruses," said Avery Clukey, a junior health care and administration management major from Mechanicsburg. "I'm getting vaccinated as I early as I can. It's really important (that SRU offers on-campus clinics) because, personally, I was reluctant to go to a pharmacy or other places where they also might be doing COVID testing. At an outdoor event (like the one at SRU), you don't have to risk your health going inside, and it's just a nice central location where you can walk up and be on your way in five minutes." SHS will host more flu shot clinics on campus as vaccinations are available from its supplier and based on students' needs. Details about future clinics will be communicated to students through all-campus email. Last year, SHS administered 600 doses during the fall semester with orders determined based on previous years' supply and demand as well as the number of students who indicate that they receive their flu shots elsewhere. Another variable is fewer students living on campus this year because of reduced residence hall capacities as 80% of fall semester classes are occurring online. Any student who is ill or experiencing symptoms associated with COVID-19 or the flu should contact SHS at 724.738.2052. SHS will be able to provide students with guidance and connect them with testing options. Students with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are expected to self-isolate until cleared by a medical professional. SHS can guide all students through this process regardless of whether they live on or off campus. More information is available on SRU's COVID-19 resource webpage and the SHS webpage.

While the community pharmacist-led vaccination service has now been established in England for a decade, continual quality improvement of the service could increase vaccine uptake and improve patient care. Aim: To evaluate patient satisfaction of a seasonal influenza vaccination service in a community pharmacy setting. Method: Following the 2019/2020 influenza vaccination season, a service evaluation was conducted between 1 January 2020 and 29 February 2020, to evaluate the quality and acceptability of the service across a range of community pharmacy settings in England. The results were analysed for person-centredness, professionalism and privacy, and recommendations for service improvement for the 2020/2021 season were proposed. Results: A total of 485 patients from 55 community pharmacies completed a patient survey; 88% of patients (n=426) were very satisfied with the quality of the service and with the caring and friendliness of the wider pharmacy team. Furthermore, 90% of patients (n=437) were very satisfied with the pharmacist administering the vaccine and 77% (n=368) with the standard of the consultation room in terms of brightness, cleanliness and being tidy. In terms of overall satisfaction, 99% of patients would recommend the influenza vaccination service to their friends and family, and 99% had confidence in their pharmacist to extend the service to additional vaccinations (n=479). Conclusion: The community pharmacist-led vaccination service is highly valued by patients. High levels of patient satisfaction were noted and this is significant if there is to be an increase in uptake of the vaccination to meet the World Health Organization’s target to vaccinate 75% of adults aged 60 years and above and to increase vaccination coverage for all those in high-risk groups. Key words: Community pharmacy, influenza, vaccination, pharmacist, patient satisfaction Original submitted: 3 June 2020; Revised submitted: 9 August 2020; Accepted for publication: 14 September 2020; Published online: 6 October 2020. doi: 10.1211/PJ.2020.20208383Influenza (Flu) 06 October 2020 By Tim RendellCorresponding author Tim RendellAdvertisement Advertisement Copy link to page Download PDF IntroductionIn 2019, recognising the threat a global influenza pandemic posed to public health, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched its global influenza strategy, in which it calls for “every country to have a tailored influenza programme that contributes to national and global preparedness and health security”[1] .Influenza is a highly contagious viral infection that affects between 3 million and 5 million people globally each year, and is responsible for between 290,000 and 650,000 respiratory deaths over the same period[1] . For many, influenza is a mild disease; however, for the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions, the outcome can be more serious. As early as 2003, the WHO adopted resolution WHA56.19, which emphasises the need to vaccinate 75% of adults aged 60 years and above, and to increase vaccination coverage for all those in high-risk groups (e.g. patients with diabetes and immunosuppressed patients)[2] . However, in the 2014/2015 influenza vaccination season, vaccine uptake across Europe for older people was still below the WHO target, with a median uptake of 34% and a range of 0–76% (Scotland being the only country to have achieved the target)[3] . By 2017, no improvement had been noted, with a vaccination rate of 44% across Europe for people aged 65 years and above — the UK achieved the highest uptake, with 73%[4] .Historically, the influenza vaccination was only available from GPs, but following some small-scale, locally commissioned NHS pilots and a larger, region-wide pilot in London in 2015, an NHS-funded national service for all community pharmacies was commissioned, legislated by the community pharmacy seasonal influenza vaccination advanced service direction 7A; part of the National Health Service Act 2006[5],[6],[7] . Since then, in addition to private services, any community pharmacy in England could deliver this commissioned service, providing it had a private consultation room; could procure the appropriate strains of influenza vaccination for the northern hemisphere for the season; could meet all data-recording obligations; and the pharmacist had completed the identified training requirements, all of which were detailed in the annually revised service specification from NHS England and NHS Improvement[8] .Nationally, the service has grown since launch, from 0.6 million doses being administered in 2015/2016, increasing to 1.7 million doses in 2019/2020 across all community pharmacies[9] . By quantity of vaccinations, the fifth-largest participating pharmacy chain in England is Day Lewis, one of the largest independent pharmacy groups in Europe[10] . From 1 September 2019 to 31 March 2020, all Day Lewis pharmacies participated in the annual NHS influenza vaccination programme, in addition to offering a private influenza vaccination for those not eligible for the NHS scheme. During this period, 96,183 patients consented to having an influenza vaccine administered by a community pharmacist in a community pharmacy setting[11] . For 79.8% (n=76,752) of patients, the service was funded by the NHS, while the remaining 20.2% (n=19,431) of patients engaged in the private service[11] .While the number of vaccines administered is an important metric for contributing towards delivering the WHO’s ambitions, the quality of the service offered to patients is also paramount. Furthermore, quality improvement to enhance patient experience, through evaluating pharmacy services, is an important part of professional practice. Watson, Silver and Watkins considered service quality in community pharmacy and made recommendations about the quality of care, focusing on three themes: person-centredness, professionalism and privacy, as these were deemed what mattered most to patients from their research[12] .For person-centredness, they concluded that “relational aspects with pharmacy personnel” was important; caring and friendly staff were noted as being central to the delivery of a quality service. For professionalism, the participants assessed quality through the appearance of the staff, levels of training attained, competence and confidence in their ability to give advice and, finally, a light, hygienic and clean environment. In terms of privacy, the quality was perceived by the participants to include a confidential room that enabled private consultations[12] .Patient satisfaction with community pharmacist-led influenza vaccine servicesResearch published to date indicates that overall satisfaction with the community pharmacist-led influenza vaccination service appears to be high. For example, one of the first locally commissioned community pharmacy influenza vaccination services was implemented on the Isle of Wight by the primary care trust in 2010; in their analysis of this initiative, Warner et al. concluded that the service helped increase vaccination uptake and was “associated with high levels of patient acceptability”[13] . The authors noted that proportionately higher levels of carers and frontline healthcare workers were vaccinated than the GP-led service in this locality. In addition, the high level of patient satisfaction was linked with the accessibility of the community pharmacy (with no appointments required), reduced infection risk, ease of access and a perceived reduction in workload for GP practices[13] . Of the 1,597 respondents, 98% (nâ€‰=1,540/1,565) stated that they would use the service again in the future and 91% (nâ€‰=1,427/1,570) assessed the service to be excellent[13] .Following an evaluation of the NHS influenza vaccination service in London in 2015, Atkins et al. noted a high level of patient satisfaction with the first large-scale community pharmacy pilot[6] . Of 11,754 patient respondents, 97.3% (n=11,436) were very satisfied with the service and 99.1% (n=11,645) were happy to have other vaccines administered by the community pharmacist[6] . In a subsequent study in the West Midlands in 2017, Rai and Wood noted that patient satisfaction was, again, high, with 95.8% (n=8,066) respondents stating that the influenza vaccine administration was as good as that by a nurse or GP[14] . Furthermore, 99.6% (n=8,156) of patients stated that they would use the service in the future, with key factors including increased patient choice and convenience[14] .In a mixed methods research study conducted in Western Australia in 2016, Hattingh et al. noted that “vaccine delivery was safe” and that community pharmacies were both accessible and convenient for service users and, as a result, the service could be extended to other vaccines[15] . In another Western Australian study in 2018, Burt, Hattingh and Czarniak evaluated patient satisfaction and the experience of an influenza vaccination service in 13 community pharmacies[16] . Overall, 99.5% (n=432) of patients were satisfied with the service and 97.2% (n=422) agreed that they would return to a community pharmacy for a vaccination in the future. In addition, 60.4% (n=262) of patients stated that they would like pharmacists to administer vaccines for other conditions[16] .To profile citizens accessing the pharmacist-led service, Anderson and Thornley surveyed 1,741 patients across 55 pharmacies in England in 2016. They noted that there was access from “all postcode areas, including some from the most deprived localities”[17] . They concluded that the influenza vaccination service was “highly accessed by patients from all socio-demographic areas”, including frontline healthcare workers, carers and people of working age, because of the accessibility and convenience of community pharmacy[17] .In a 2017 review of the influenza vaccination service in England, the United States and Portugal, Kirkdale et al. noted that a community pharmacist-led vaccination service overall increased the number of at-risk patients receiving the vaccination and, furthermore, that the service could “create value for payors and reduce pressure on health systems[18] . In a second paper in the same journal, Kirkdale et al. described the barriers to implementation of a vaccination service, including differing regulatory frameworks, remuneration mechanisms, training requirements and operating models[19] . They also noted the varying requirements for facilities, recording of data, patient engagement and interprofessional working[19] .In summary, a high similarity in findings has been noted across the various studies, with overall patient satisfaction levels high.Study backgroundFor this study, a service evaluation was conducted to assess a specific service in a healthcare setting, which sought to “assess how well a service is achieving its intended aims” from the perspective of patient benefit[20] . This was conducted using the NHS Health Research Authority (HRA) definition: that the single aim of a service evaluation is “to define or judge current care”, and to measure and assess the delivery of the current service, without randomisation or allocation of patients to a particular intervention, with the desired outcome being to inform local decision making and improve the service in the future[21] . The service evaluation framework used themes on patient perspective highlighted by Watson, Silver and Watkins that focused on quality of pharmacy services in the community setting, person-centeredness, professionalism and privacy[12] .AimTo achieve an improvement of quality in patient care, a service evaluation of the Day Lewis influenza vaccination programme was completed between 1 January 2020 and 29 February 2020. This aimed to evaluate the person-centredness, professionalism and privacy of the service, with the desired outcome to make recommendations for service improvement for the 2020/2021 influenza vaccination season.ObjectivesTo design a survey instrument to evaluate the quality and acceptability of an influenza vaccination service in a community pharmacy setting through attitudinal measurement;To implement the survey instrument across 55 community pharmacy settings towards the end of the 2019/2020 influenza vaccination season;To evaluate the results from the survey instrument for the attributes of person-centredness, professionalism and privacy;To make recommendations based on collected data for service improvement for the 2020/2021 influenza vaccination season.Ethics approvalAs this study was a service evaluation and as all data were anonymised, ethical approval was confirmed to not be required, using the HRA assessment tool[22] .MethodsA sample of 19% (n=55) of Day Lewis pharmacies were identified to be included in this study. These pharmacies all hosted a preregistration pharmacist who collected the data as they had a professional knowledge of the service, but had not personally been involved with the administration of the vaccine. Geograhically, these pharmacies were spread across the country, represented the 270 pharmacies within the business, covered a mix of demographic profiles, and were placed in both rural and urban settings. Pharmacies (n=54) were only included in the analysis if they delivered a minimum of 50 vaccinations in the 2019/2020 season — one of the participating pharmacies did not meet this target. It was also anticipated that 500 responses would be achieved, giving a 0.5% sample size.A survey instrument was designed to meet the objectives of the service evaluation. The survey was divided into two sections: the first section comprised nine closed questions to evaluate the quality and acceptability of a community pharmacy-based influenza vaccination service, and the second section featured demographic data (gender, eligibility category for vaccine and ethnicity). A four-point Likert scale (ranging from ‘very satisfied’ to ‘very unsatisfied’) was used for the attitudinal measurement questions. The survey was then reviewed by a senior academic at the University of Bath and revised prior to printing for circulation to each of the participating pharmacies.Selection criteriaPreregistration pharmacists in the participating branches were briefed by the researcher in December 2019 and were asked to complete surveys with patients between 1 January 2020 and 29 February 2020. The background to the service evaluation, including a detailed explanation of how to complete the survey, was provided. Each preregistration pharmacist received 20 surveys and was requested to conduct the surveys with select patients. This number of surveys were provided because it meant that there was potential for 1,100 respondents, helping increase the chance that the representative 0.5% would be obtained.Patients were recruited when they visited the pharmacy. These patients had received the influenza vaccination (either NHS-funded or private) from the pharmacy within the previous four months and would give their consent to participate in the service evaluation. Each patient was then asked to complete the first part of the survey in the confidential setting of the consultation room. The preregistration pharmacist then completed the second part of the survey with the patient, ensuring accurate completion of the patients’ demographic and medical profile; no personal information and no identifying information was collected from the participants. Once all the surveys had been completed, they were returned to the Day Lewis support office for data analysis. Although the flu vaccination service ended on 31 March 2020, very few patients were vaccinated after 31 December 2019; therefore, it was unlikely that individuals would receive their vaccination and then immediately complete the survey.Survey results were then entered into an Excel spreadsheet. Statistical analysis using frequencies, percentages and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were applied for categorical variables (attitudinal measurements), along with medians, means, standard deviation and ranges for variables measured on a continuous scale (demographics).ResultsIn total, 55 pharmacies in both rural (44%) and urban (56%) settings across England participated in this service evaluation and 54 pharmacies delivered the prerequisite 50 vaccinations to be included in the study. Overall, 45% (n=485) surveys were completed in 57% (n=31) pharmacies and returned for analysis. For the 2019/2020 season, a total of 96,183 vaccines were administered; therefore, a purposive sample of 0.5% (n=481) of total patients vaccinated was achieved. The average age of patients completing the survey was 55.5 years, with a standard deviation of 18.1. The median age was 57 years (range 17–100 years) and there were no statistical outliers. The ages of patients were mildly negatively skewed, with a wider variation in younger patients compared with patients older than the average. In addition, there was a mild negative kurtosis with a flatter distribution compared with a normal distribution (Figure). Figure: Histogram showing frequency distributionAnalysis of the key demographic features noted that of the 363 patients who completed this section, 50% (n=183) were in the category of aged 65 years and above, and the remainder were in one of the high-risk categories, with the highest prevalence being diagnosed with chronic respiratory disease (11%). In terms of gender and ethnicity, 55% (n=256) of respondents were female and 45% (n=210) were male; 67% (n=313) were from a white British background and 33% (n=154) were from all other ethnic groups combined.For person-centredness, 87.8% (n=425) of patients were very satisfied (95% CI, 84.6% to 90.4%) with the quality of the influenza vaccination service, and 88.0% (n=426) of patients were very satisfied (95% CI, 88.4% to 90.6%) with the caring and friendliness of the pharmacy team. In relation to professionalism, 90.1% (n=437) of patients were very satisfied (95% CI, 87.1% to 92.5%) with the pharmacist administering the vaccine; however, only 77.1% (n=368) of patients were very satisfied (95% CI, 73.1% to 80.7%) with the standard of the consultation room in terms of brightness, cleanliness and being tidy. For privacy, 89.2% (n=430) of patients were very satisfied (95% CI, 86.1% to 91.7%) with the service (Table 1). Table 1: Results of survey for person-centredness, professionalism and privacyIn terms of overall satisfaction, 99.4% (n=479) of patients would recommend the influenza vaccination service to their friends and family (95% CI, 98.2% to 99.8%), 99.2% (n=480) stated that they would return to a community pharmacy for their influenza vaccination in the future (95% CI, 97.9% to 99.7%) and 98.7% (n=469) had confidence in their pharmacist to extend the service to additional vaccinations (95% CI, 97.3% to 99.4%; see Table 2). Table 2: Results of survey for overall patient satisfactionFinally, it was noted that 52.1% (n=265) of patients participated in the service because of information or recommendation from the community pharmacy team. This was followed by posters in the window, 18.7% (n=85), and word of mouth, 17.3% (n=88). Advertising was less influential, with only 6.3% (n=32) of patients finding out about the service in this way.DiscussionWhile many community pharmacy services may be well established, it is necessary to maintain and improve quality. The “objective measurement of people, practices and organisations against valid and explicit standards” is required to help understand and, subsequently, implement any required change[23] . This service evaluation has reviewed person-centredness, professionalism and privacy, in line with the literature, to both measure and improve the quality of the service — and with the objective of improving the planning of the influenza vaccination service to be conducted in all Day Lewis pharmacies for the 2020/2021 season.Person-centredness can be defined as “a standard of care that ensures the patient is at the centre of care delivery”[24] . Patients value the relationship they have with their local community pharmacy team, with a requirement for a “friendly caring service, continuity of care and the staff ‘knowing’ the individual” [12] . This is in line with previous studies and was clearly noted in this service evaluation owing to the high levels of patient satisfaction with the quality of the influenza vaccination service, and the caring and friendliness of the pharmacy team. The opportunity to develop this relationship further could be achieved through more proactive recruitment of patients to attend for a vaccine. This may be achieved through personal contact with patients in target groups when they visit the pharmacy, to remind them of the importance of having an influenza vaccination this winter. More direct methods of patient contact may also be deployed; for example, reminder texts or information leaflets included with dispensed medicines, both of which are currently being used in all Day Lewis pharmacies.Leadership and team-working considerations are important to deliver patient-centred care; the results noted that more than half of the patients were made aware of the service by the pharmacy team. It is therefore essential that the whole pharmacy team are fully appraised and are ambassadors for the benefits of the service. In addition, following a recent government consultation, it has been proposed to allow other healthcare professionals to also administer the influenza vaccine; in community pharmacy, this may open up new opportunities for pharmacy technicians to extend their role[25] .Patients clearly expect professionalism in the dispensing of prescriptions, product sales and pharmacy services in a community pharmacy setting. While high levels of satisfaction were noted with the pharmacist administering the vaccine, a lower satisfaction was reported with the standard of the consultation room in terms of brightness, cleanliness and being tidy. There is an opportunity to reflect upon patient expectations, and while community pharmacy consultation rooms may often be smaller in size than a room in a GP surgery or a secondary care setting, the importance of a high-quality clinical environment should not be underestimated. In addition, the consultation room should be in line with the General Pharmaceutical Council’s standards for registered pharmacies[26] . To achieve this, a full decluttering and cleaning of the room should be considered. This may include removing unnecessary furniture, books and paperwork and replacing fabric-covered patient chairs with easy-to-clean, impermeable, wipeable PVC alternatives to maintain infection control standards[8] . In some cases, a more extensive refurbishment may be required. This may include replacing carpet with resilient flooring (vinyl), including coved edging, allowing the flooring to continue up onto the wall for a distance of 150mm for ease of cleaning; introduction of energy-efficient and brighter LED lighting; installation of a clinical hand-wash basin with elbow action or hands-free taps; and a full redecoration. In extreme cases, the pharmacist may decide that a new enlarged and upgraded consultation room may be the best option as a long-term investment; indeed, at Day Lewis, 20 new consultation rooms will be installed by the end of 2020.In addition, professional clinical leadership of the service will require pharmacists to be fully up to date with the vaccine and service specification and the patient group direction for the community pharmacy flu vaccination service 2020/2021 to ensure full compliance with all legislation surrounding the service[8],[27],[28] .Privacy, confidentiality and dignity are all vital elements of a trusting relationship between healthcare professionals and their patients. While a high level of satisfaction was noted, the importance of this to patients in terms of both record keeping and confidential conversations should always be reflected upon for improvement. Patient informed consent in the written form has always proved to be a challenge in terms of storage capacity, but, more recently, environmental reasons to eliminate paper have contributed towards this. New technology to obtain electronic signatures for patient consent should be considered. A thorough review of information governance requirements for each pharmacy, relating to all pharmacy services, could be beneficial.Confidential discussions can be achieved in the consultation room setting, although it may be a good opportunity to review how soundproof the room is. In addition, consider not placing chairs for patients adjacent to the consultation room. There is a need to ensure lockable filing storage and password-protected computers for all patient-related data.As an addendum, since the service evaluation commenced, the WHO announced the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic[29] . Owing to the pandemic, pharmacy teams will need to be mindful of guidance by public health bodies, such as Public Health England, as to the appropriate requirements for pharmacies, in terms of personal protective equipment and social distancing[30] . These changes may impact the patient experience of flu vaccination services delivered by community pharmacy.Examples of measures that could be adopted include:Reconfiguring the consultation room to maximise social distancing;The introduction of clear perspex acrylic protective screens in the consultation room, either hanging or free-standing;Cleaning the consultation room after each vaccination;Encouraging patients to complete some of the required consultation questions prior to the appointment;Asking patients to wear a short-sleeve garment for ease of vaccination and asking them to wear a face mask or face covering;Temperature monitoring of patients prior to vaccination, using an infrared digital handheld thermometer.Finally, the literature review identified the opportunity to extend the vaccination service to additional vaccines; this was supported by the service evaluation, which showed participants that would be willing to have other vaccines delivered in the community pharmacy. For example, once the COVID-19 vaccine is available, this may be an opportunity for all UK community pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals such as pharmacy technicians, to support the national effort to vaccinate all at-risk groups.LimitationsThe main limitation of this study was that the service evaluation was only conducted in Day Lewis pharmacies and may not be generalised to other community pharmacies in England, or the rest of the UK. In addition, the time since accessing the service to answering the questionnaires could be up to four months, and patients’ detailed memory of events may have deteriorated. Finally, the service evaluation only captured regular patients to the community pharmacy, and not those who visited as a one-off to have the vaccination. In the future, it may be a methodological improvement to conduct the survey with all patients who received the vaccination by also contacting non-regular patients. In addition, a fixed time duration after the vaccination may be more appropriate to survey patients (e.g. four weeks), but not immediately afterwards, to allow for reflection time.ConclusionIn conclusion, this study has demonstrated the importance of person-centredness, professionalism and privacy to the delivery of a quality influenza vaccination service in a community pharmacy setting. It has highlighted how pharmacists and their teams can modify their practices based on the results from this service evaluation to ensure high levels of satisfaction for the 2020/2021 season.Currently, Day Lewis pharmacists have implemented all the recommendations in this paper, and they have delivered 114% more vaccines up to 1 October 2020, compared with the same period last year. This is testament to the commitment of pharmacists and their teams to step up at a time of national pandemic to protect increased numbers of both older and vulnerable patients from the influenza virus.Key pointsInfluenza is a highly contagious viral infection and severely affects between 3 million and 5 million people globally each year, causing between 290,000 and 650,000 respiratory deaths annually. For most, influenza is a mild disease; however, for the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions, the outcome can be more serious.Community pharmacists have been delivering a pharmacy service for the influenza vaccination since 2010 and administered 1.7 million doses as part of the NHS vaccination programme in England in 2019/2020.A service evaluation was conducted with 485 patients across 55 pharmacies following the 2019/2020 campaign to assess person-centredness, professionalism and privacy, and to make a recommendation for improvements for the 2020/2021 season.Satisfaction levels were high, with 99.4% of patients stating that they would recommend the influenza vaccination service to their friends and family; 99.2% would return to a community pharmacy in the future; and 98.7% had confidence in their pharmacist to extend the service to additional vaccinations.Reviewing current practices in community pharmacy will enhance the service in the future; considerations may include proactively recruiting patients, decluttering or refurbishing the consultation room, reviewing patient confidentiality and data security, and implementing any additional measures requred as a result of COVID-19.

Is it the flu, a cold or COVID-19? October 6, 2020UCLA Credit: University of California With COVID-19 in the mix, this year’s cold and flu season could prove interesting. Here’s what you can do to keep yourself and your community safe. With COVID-19 in the mix, this year’s cold and flu season could prove interesting. For starters, every throat tickle and sneeze might make you anxious. Are you coming down with a cold? The flu? Could it be COVID-19? UCLA Health’s clinical chief of infectious diseases, Daniel Uslan, M.D., MBA, shares how to tell the difference. A simple way to know when it’s a cold “A cold is an upper respiratory infection that causes nasal congestion, sore throat and occasionally a cough,” says Dr. Uslan. Unfortunately, these symptoms are also trademarks of the flu and COVID-19. But there’s a key difference. “With a cold,” Dr. Uslan continues, “you won’t have a fever or muscle aches, which are hallmark signs of influenza and COVID-19.” Comparing the flu and COVID-19 is more challenging Distinguishing between the flu and COVID is a lot more challenging. The two illnesses share many common symptoms: fever (above 100.4 degrees F), chills, muscle aches, headaches, cough, sore throat, and a stuffy or runny nose. Both illnesses can also make it hard to breathe. But with COVID-19, this problem in particular tends to be much worse. “That gasping-for-air feeling typically doesn’t happen with influenza unless you’ve also developed pneumonia,” says Dr. Uslan. Losing your sense of taste or smell is a good indication that you have COVID-19, as this doesn’t happen with the flu. However, not everyone with COVID-19 develops this problem. Testing is key The only way to know for sure what’s causing your symptoms is to get tested, Dr. Uslan says. The right diagnosis can affect treatment decisions and also help track and prevent the spread of both viruses. If you have the flu, antiviral medications like Tamiflu® can lower the risk of respiratory infections like pneumonia and knock a day or two off of how long you’re sick — but you should start treatment within 48 hours of symptom onset for best results. Other flu treatments — rest, fluids and over-the-counter antihistamines and decongestants — are also the best options if you’re diagnosed with COVID-19 and can recover at home, which most people are able to do. Breathing difficulties signal a life-threatening emergency, and if you are experiencing this symptom, “you should immediately call 911 or head to the nearest emergency department,” Dr. Uslan says. While a COVID-19 vaccine is in development, flu vaccines are available now Don’t forget to get your flu shot! Credit: University of California While scientists are still working on a COVID-19 vaccine, the good news is that there’s already a vaccine to protect you against the flu. There’s also good news coming from countries in the southern hemisphere like Australia and South America, where flu season is wrapping up. “It appears that this flu season may be milder than usual because of all of the extra precautions everyone is taking to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease,” says Dr. Ulsan. “Frequent hand washing, physical distancing and mask wearing are great ways to prevent getting sick and spreading illness.” Keep reading Thursday, September 12, 2024 Study: People facing life-or-death choice put too much… In simulated life-or-death decisions, about two-thirds of people allowed a robot to change their minds when it disagreed with them — an alarming display of excessive trust in artificial intelligence… Thursday, February 8, 2024 As pickleball's popularity surges, injuries are also… UC San Diego Health physical therapists offer ‘prehab’ exercises to keep players out of a pickle The University of California opened its doors in 1869 with just 10 faculty members and 40 students.

Flu Season by Niall McCarthy, Oct 7, 2020 Influenza in the U.S. Fall traditionally marks the start of flu season in the U.S. and this year is expected to be more difficult than usual due Covid-19. Yesterday, President Trump once again downplayed the threat posed by the coronavirus by exaggerating influenza's death toll. He tweeted that many people die from the flu each year, "sometimes over 100,000", a claim that was quickly debunked. Twitter hid the president's post, tagging it with a warning that it violated its rules about spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to Covid-19. Up to October 07, 211,000 Americans had died from Covid-19, a toll that is expected to continue rising during the winter months. So just how wrong was the president about the flu and how many people die from it annually?Seasonal influenza viruses can occur throughout the year in the U.S. but they hit hardest during the fall and winter, peaking between December and February. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that the 2019-2020 flu season involved two waves of activity and moderate severity with 38 million people contracting influenza, 18 million visiting a health care provider, 400,000 being hospitalized and 22,000 sadly passing away. That is a significantly lower total than the 100,000 deaths tweeted by President Trump. Even the deadliest flu season of the last decade, 2017-2018, had a lower death toll with an estimated 61,000 people dying.

T-cell function is highly influenced by the cellular metabolic state; however, it remains unknown how altered systemic metabolism in obesity alters T-cell metabolism and function to influence immune response. Our objective was to identify the altered cellular metabolic state of T cells from obese mice so that we may target T-cell metabolism to improve immune response to infection.MethodsMice were fed normal chow or high-fat diet for 18–19 weeks. Changes in T-cell populations were analyzed in both adipose tissue and spleens using flow cytometry. Splenic T cells were further analyzed for nutrient uptake and extracellular metabolic flux. As changes in T-cell mitochondrial oxidation were observed in obesity, obese mice were treated with metformin for 6 weeks and compared to lean control mice or obese mice undergoing weight loss through diet switch; immunity was measured by survival to influenza infection.ResultsWe found changes in T-cell populations in adipose tissue of high-fat diet-induced obese mice, characterized by decreased proportions of Treg cells and increased proportions of CD8+ T cells. Activated CD4+ T cells from obese mice had increased glucose uptake and oxygen consumption rate (OCR), compared to T cells from lean controls, indicating increased mitochondrial oxidation of glucose. Treatment of isolated CD4+ T cells with metformin was found to inhibit OCR in vitro and alter the expression of several activation markers. Last, treatment of obese mice with metformin, but not weight loss, was able to improve survival to influenza in obesity.ConclusionsT cells from obese mice have an altered metabolic profile characterized by increased glucose oxidation, which can be targeted to improve survival against influenza infection.

Low pathogenic (Low-path LP) AI in chickens caused by less virulent strains of AI viruses (AIVs)—when compared with highly pathogenic AIVs (HPAIVs)—are not even well-described yet or known how they contribute to wider AI and immune system issues. Co-circulation of LPAIVs with HPAIVs suggests their interactions in their ecological aspects. Here we show for the Pacific Rim an international approach how to data mine and model-predict LP AI and its ecological niche with machine learning and open access data sets and geographic information systems (GIS) on a 5 km pixel size for best-possible inference. This is based on the best-available data on the issue (~ 40,827 records of lab-analyzed field data from Japan, Russia, Vietnam, Mongolia, Alaska and Influenza Research Database (IRD) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) database sets, as well as 19 GIS data layers). We sampled 157 hosts and 110 low-path AIVs with 32 species as drivers. The prevalence across low-path AIV subtypes is dominated by Muscovy ducks, Mallards, Whistling Swans and gulls also emphasizing industrial impacts for the human-dominated wildlife contact zone. This investigation sets a good precedent for the study of reservoirs, big data mining, predictions and subsequent outbreaks of HPAI and other pandemics.

The genetic diversity of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) is assumed to be maintained by their circulation in wild aquatic bird populations (see2,3,4,5,6 for Pacific Rim region). Avian influenza (AI) is a complex but poorly understood disease which is based on many strains. Some of those are not fully described and are highly pathogenic (hi-path HP, as defined in chicken ). The majority of them is classified as lower pathogeny (low-path LP); those are still underestimated, insufficiently studied and little surveyed even. It has been suggested, but poorly studied, that those AI strains actually co-occur and interact. The prevalence of AI viruses in wild birds varies greatly by species, age, season and geographical location. While species surveying is unequal the highest known prevalence of the 16 haemagglutinin (H1—H16) and nine neuraminidase (N1—N9) subtypes is observed in birds belonging to the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes orders7,8. Due to its virulence, public focus, main research attention and subsequent funding sits on high-path AI, whereas the ecologically more relevant low-path AI and its contributions are widely ignored, certainly understudied and consequently not so well managed.However, the rapid and unpredictable evolution of AI viruses leads to the emergence of new influenza virus strains and subtype combinations, which potentially point towards a global pandemic3,4,8. Outbreaks of AI virus infections are known to have serious consequences for animal health and may result in major economic losses for the poultry industry9 including product mis-trust, fear, massive financial loss, trade interruption and food insecurity. It’s probably not helpful, and arguably quite dangerous to ignore LP AI in this discussion as it is likely a major stepping stone for any so-called HPAI and pandemic. This is even more important given that co-occurrences of diseases in vectors are likely.There are well-known landscape hotspots of HPAI9, and likely those link with LPAI occurrences and movements as the underlying pool (reservoir). Those AI patterns are increasingly geo-referenced and tracked for origins, nations, and for continents (6e.g. https://www.fludb.org/, see9 for application), but wider international and cross-continental linkages are hardly coordinated nor well known or studied yet. Since hi-path AI usually comes from areas and hotspots with abundant low-path AI likely it forms a resilient reservoir. But those AI reservoirs and consistent hotspots are also not well identified or studied nor is it understood how they behave over time and seasons (see9 for polar breeding seasonalities).To get closer to such type of questions, here we focus on the northern Pacific Rim, a region between North America and Asia, namely Alaska, Russia, Japan and Vietnam (Fig. 1; see2,9 for an application). This region is known to be connected through various animal migration patterns (birds2 and10, marine mammals, mammals, fish and sea turtles), as well as climate regimes. Using the ‘best available’ scientific information on AI for those nations, we then try to obtain alternatively validated AI samples to draw generalizable inferences explicit in space and time.Figure 1Study area of eASIA project and sampling sites in the Pacific Rim.Full size imageMethodsStudy areaThe study area consists of the wider northern Pacific Rim area which is known to be an exchange frontier between diseases and cultures (Fig. 12,9). We followed methods outlined in5,11,12 and specifically13 drawing inference from predictions.The conducted international landscape investigation in this study area is described in a research workflow (Fig. 2), and it mainly consists of different steps: field work, open access data compilation, data cleaning and lab work, GIS mapping, data mining and prediction, reflection and inference, as further described below (for more clarifications or questions please contact authors).Figure 2Workflow of this study to obtain best-available AI data and to data mine and predict them with machine learning in a geographic information system (GIS) for best-possible predictions and inference for the Pacific Rim study area (IRD = Influenza Research Database; USDA = U.S. Department of Agriculture); for more details, model specifications etc. see manuscript text.Full size imageField workAs part of the eASIA program the field sampling of AI was conducted in Russia and Japan primarily during the fall (August) 2016, 2017 and 2018. Fall is a season when birds finished breeding and started to migrate southwards to their wintering sites. Birds are known during that time to disperse relatively slowly along flyways10,12,14,15. Traditionally, this time period has the highest known prevalence of virus, thus far9 In Vietnam, the surveillance targeting domestic birds was conducted in summers and falls. Together with all eASIA participants, we extracted data from an agreeable compatible workflow and protocol that allowed for geo-referenced and time-referenced AI samples in the field. Hunters were not directly involved in the study (see permits for bird specimen details). In Russia, following their lab method protocol and according to standard procedures16,17 it resulted in 52 samples (10 LPAI presences) from years 2016 and 2017 with 13 unique locations. In Japan, their respective lab method protocol was followed (details in18) resulting in 203 samples from years 2016 and 2017 based on 5 unique locations. In Vietnam, the lab method protocol of Japan was followed (details in19) resulting in 1,182 samples (951 LPAI presences) from years 2016 and 2017 based on 102 unique locations. Finally, we were also able to obtain 407 samples (395 LPAI presences) for Mongolia for 27 unique locations, also following the protocol from Japan. Alaska was not part of field campaign but had data available through the IRD ‘flu’ database (see details below).All field data were compiled into one eASIA database for further analysis (Appendix 1), namely to carry out data mining, model-training and subsequent predictions with machine learning and geographic information system (GIS; details in9,10).Compilations of open access AI dataTo reach across the Pacific Rim for a wider and more robust inference, and to make a connection with North America and other available data, further AI data from Alaska were obtained from the IRD database online (https://www.fludb.org/brc/home.spg? Decorator = influenza). This resulted in 38,517 samples (448 low-path AI presences) from 1,175 unique locations. We then queried all these data for low-path AI strains which resulted in 110 strains and 40,837 samples from 157 host species entries that we used for this study (see Appendix 2 for details). To our knowledge, that is the biggest and most diverse AI database ever compiled and analysed for the Pacific Rim (see Herrick et al. 2013 for a first initial model and using all of AI).Data mining of low-path AIWe queried the obtained data for the number of low-path AI strains, host species distribution, proportion of host species carrying a specific low-path AI strain, and prevalence.Compilations of open access GIS data layers for the study areaGIS layers are used as predictors for model-predictions in the study area. Here we used 19 global GIS layers available from earlier research (Sriram and Huettmann unpublished https://www.earth-syst-sci-data-discuss.net/essd-2016-65/; Table 1). For polygon outlines we used data with our ArcGIS UAF campus license (FH). All GIS data layers were displayed for the study area as a Mercator projection using WGS84, decimal degrees coordinates (latitude and longitude) with a precision of 6 decimals (GPS and GIS, a real world precision of 5 decimals).Table 1 List of GIS Predictors used in this study to data mine and predict low path (LP) Avian Influenza (AI) *Full size tableGIS mapping and data processingWe used commercial and open source GIS softwares (ArcGIS, QGIS) to operate, map and overlay all data. We imported the AI Data from ASCII table (MS Excel) into a shapefile layer of AI, and overlaid them with 19 environmental GIS layers we had available from compiled global data sets. This resulted into a data cube that is analyzed with data mining and for modeling and predictions.Modeling and predictionsThe resulting data cube was imported into SPM 8.2 (https://www.minitab.com/en-us/products/spm/) and then modeled and predicted. We ran a stochastic grading boosting (TreeNet) algorithm for best-possible predictions and inference (20see also9,10,12,21; for an R implementation see22). As outlined in9,12,21 we started with default settings for this powerful software as they are known to achieve best inference, as taken from the predictive performance13. Models then used 6 Maximum nodes per tree, 10 Cases as a Terminal Node Minimum, 200 trees to converge, a balanced class weight and a ten-fold cross-validation (a repeated 90% training vs 10% testing setting) optimizing on the ROC. To avoid overfitting we used an auto learn rate and a 50% subsampling. The resulting tree model was stored as a grove and applied to an equally-spaced lattice of the predictors (excluding species information). The maps were presented in GIS with a resolution of a 5 km pixel size (Appendix 3).Model assessment dataWe were able to obtain two alternative data set on AI for an assessment of our predictions. The Influenza Research Database (IRD) has an Asian subset (n = 28,205 and 19,405) comparable to our work, and which was used to confront our predictions for the study area.Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has a U.S-wide AI survey data set (3,589 for Alaska), it actually lacks geo-referencing with coordinates (just done by counties etc.) and just includes H5, H7 Avian Flu columns; presumably done trying to protect the industry. We still used this best-available alternative data set for further assessment of the model predictions.Ethics statementFor this eASIA project oropharyngeal and cloacal samples in Russia were collected according to the “Federal Law on Hunting and Sharing of Hunting Resources of Russian Federation # 209-ФЗ” and with the permissions of local governments in hunting regions during each hunting seasons. Hunted birds were provided for sampling by licensed hunters to our group during expeditions.Fecal samples in Japan were collected with the permission of the municipality managing the sampling areas and Hokkaido University. Fecal samples in Mongolia were collected with the permission of the State Central Veterinary Laboratory, Mongolia. These samples were transferred to Japan under the permissions of the Animal Quarantine Service, Japan (27douken560-2, 28douken563-6, 29douken 683–2). Swab samples in Vietnam were collected with the permission of the Department of Animal Health, Vietnam. These samples were transferred to Japan under the permissions of the Animal Quarantine Service, Japan (27douken560-3, 28douken563-1, 28douken563-4, 28douken563-5, 29douken683-3, 29douken683-4).Data reported in the Influenza Research Database (IRD) were from samples obtained and submitted under NIH-funded avian influenza surveillance collection efforts (CEIRS) and are publicly available at: www.fludb.org . This work was supported in part by a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Centers of Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveillance (CEIRS) award, Contract HHSN272201400008C (to Eric Bortz).For Alaska USDA data, wild bird samples primarily came from hunter-killed waterfowl, with voluntary participation from hunters. These sampling activities were covered under US Fish and Wildlife Service Federal Permit MB124992-0.ResultsData compilationWe were able to present the best-available data set on low-path AI—presence/absence—for the Pacific Rim (Fig. 3). We documented this dataset with ISO-compliant metadata (Appendix 1) in an Open Access data sharing framework for the global audience. In addition, we were able to obtain Influenza Research Database (IRD) Asia data as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Alaska database on Avian Influenza. To our knowledge, there is no better data set for this topic available thus far.Figure 3Map of low-path AI data, presence and absence data distribution.Full size imageGeneral AI query and analysisThis is one of the first concerted analyses of low-path AI ever undertaken, also including standardized and shared AI lab work. While the species and study area are widely undersampled, our findings show app. 110 strains of low-path AI, distributed over many bird species. However, of the c. 183 hosts sampled for AI, only 32 carried identifiable low-path AI (details shown in Appendix). Of those species, only a few co-occur, and likely migrate, between the shores of the Pacific Rim in the study area (6). Almost all of those species, and especially those with a high prevalence, are from ducks, gulls, and a few shorebirds. The highest prevalence was found with ‘ducks’, chicken, and human-associated species like Muscovy duck, whistling swan, mallards and gulls, for instance. As one of the most abundant species in the study area (14, see9,11 for an example) passerines were consequently widely undersampled but thus far reported almost no low-path AI. Our study overall did not differentiate between types of AI sampling but most relied on feces. We therefore cover minimum estimates in space and time, for hosts and for low path AI still.Prevalence and keystone speciesTable 2 shows species with the highest sample sizes and their outcome of low-AI strains (cut-off > 0.2%). The highest prevalences are found for duck and chicken samples (species of tufted duck and whistling swan just carry very low sample sizes and might be considered positive outliers lacking power). Muscovy duck and mallard, as well as environmental samples, should also be considered. All other samples, wild birds, carry relatively low AI subsamples but do occur in the wider reservoir.Table 2 Prevalences of host species for low-path AI strains from the compiled AI dataset.Full size tableThe Appendix shows the most dominant low-path AI strains and with their associated host diversity and major contributing hosts. Low-path AI co-occurs in several species and might be found as a community. A low path AI strain is found in average in over 7 different host species (for the Top 20 hosts). Figure 4 summarizes the relationship between prevalence and contribution rank for the major low-path AI strains. It finds that chicken, ducks and human-associated waterfowl species like Muscovy duck and mallards, as well as Larid gulls seem to play a major ecological role for low-path AI. Figure 5 shows how those species contribute to the model and how location and human factors interact towards low path AI prediction.Figure 4Figure showing relationship between prevalence and importance rank (contribution) to the top 10 low-path AI strains (data shown in Table 2).Full size imageFigure 5Partial dependence plots of the top 3 predictors a) host species for data mining, and b) showing a 3-dimensional partial dependence plot for predictions (Koeppen Geiger classification and poultry density index).Full size imageModel-details and predictionsOur model predictions are the first type of inference for low-path AI and its compiled best-available public data set. We present a model prediction surface in Fig. 6, showing a hotspot in Asia, namely China, coastal Asia, central Siberia and a more mixed-pixel and declining gradient further north. A connecting corridor of low-path AI would be possible between Asia with Alaska across the dateline but is not very dominant.Figure 6a) Model-predicted surface of low-path AI, b) Alaska zoom-in, c) Asia zoom-in. This map shows a heatmap where predicted presence and absence is shown as a relative index of occurrence (RIO with red = presence, green = absence, and gradient colors in-between).Full size imageFor predicted coldspots (= absence) they seem to occur in the high arctic and in areas that are less populated or lack urbanization as well as the are not within the immediate coastal zones.Our model is based on 19 predictors, of which app. 5 are among the most important ones acting in concert (Table 3). We wish to see it interpreted as a multivariate set of predictors in which low-path AI can be predicted well (ROC of over 90%). This set of relevant predictors for low-path AI has a co-occurring scheme. It consist of anthropogenic factors in the tropical Asian landscape such as roads and road proximity, poultry density and landcover types that have a human population and development on a global scale. It shows a direct affiliation with relevant centers of the world’s economic growth.Table 3 Importance ranking of predictors for low-path AI model based on Treenet algorithm (SPM).Full size tableThe host species makes for the major driver of low-path AI in the Pacific Rim. But arguably, the host species occurrence is eventually determined by the ecological niche, which consists, in a large part, of predictors we used in this model. Those show us a multivariate set of predictors that determine the response of low-path AI (details shown Fig. 5). Beyond the identified Koeppen Geiger classes—namely categories in Western China, the triangle between Mongolia- Russia-China, Southern Japan and Vietnam—individual climate predictors like monthly temperature and precipitation play less of a role for low-path AI and human factors dominate overall.Model assessmentBased on confronting low-path AI predictions for an assessment with alternative data we find a good match with the IRD data for Asia (Fig. 7a). While the second testing data from USDA is not geo-referenced with coordinates but uses counties, and just sampled for AI presence, H5 and H7, it cannot fully be compared. However, while with less evidence, it also shows a general match with our data (Fig. 7b) indicating that LP AI could relate to HP AI even.Figure 7Model assessment and overlay of predicted surface of low-path AI vs alternative AI data a) IRD Asia data, b) USDA Alaska data.Full size imageDiscussionOne of the fundamental unknowns in the field of influenza biology is a panoramic understanding of the role wild birds play in the global maintenance and spread of influenza A viruses. AI may be perceived as an industrial disease with commercial chicken and ducks playing the major roles and ecological spill-over effects into the wild. A well-known fact is that wild aquatic birds are considered a reservoir host for all low pathogenic avian influenza A viruses. Thus, genes of low path viruses may contribute to the emergence of pandemic viruses responsible for morbidity and mortality in both poultry and humans worldwide. Therefore presenting reservoir locations is important information to identify and treat a potential source of zoonotic AIV (9,23).Here we were able to compile and document the best-available (‘Big Data’) data set for LPAI in the Pacific Rim study area, available as a publically-available GIS layer with ISO-compliant metadata. Further, we were able to create the best-possible publically available prediction of low-path AI for the Pacific Rim using machine learning and open access data. In addition, we were able to obtain and use two alternative low-path AI data sets to confront the model predictions for validity: U.S. IRD Asia and USDA Alaska. It is supposed to be the first ever ‘Big Data’ synthesis analysis across years, nations and data sets for AI done anywhere (compare with6 and9). This work is based on the coordinating eASIA project for the Pacific Rim allowing for international views of AI and public health perspectives.Arguably the data mining workflow and international large-scale multi-lab methodology is the first of its kind allowing for Ecological Niche analysis and inference (Fig. 2; see9 for generic AI). Our field sampling work is still incomplete on a landscape-scale though and lacks a research design assessment for effectiveness, which is to be improved in subsequent efforts. However, here we set a first and digital baseline to start from, all in Open Access formats to work from further, e.g. filling sampling gaps, pursuing specific research and management questions, and improving and testing model predictions. Further, quality control of AI data is to improved, standardized and assessed also, specifically detection rates in the field and with certified lab protocols.Although it is one of the largest AI studies ever done, our data are still widely undersampling the species in the vast landscapes10,15. We therefore report underestimates. Looking at co-occurrences, we found that app. 32 host species are involved—including the environment- for low-path AI. We also find that low-path AI are found in many hosts, e.g. over 7 species on average for the top 20 low-path AI strains. From the data at hand, one can easily see that human-dominated species such as chicken and duck -including mallards and Muscovy ducks—play a central role for low-path AI. However, the wild species component remains widely undersampled but matters with wider ecological reality to focus on.Our prediction maps are able to show hotspots in Asia, namely China, coastal Asia, parts of Central Siberia, as well as a connecting ‘flyways’, with a lower proportion in higher latitudes. Similar to findings in Asia, in Alaska, urban centers, roads and river plains seem to host much of the low-path AI in the landscape. Our hotspots are based on the widely proven Ecological Niche analysis concept9,12 and the synthesis shows a co-occurrence with areas of globally recognized high human populations, development and subsequent economic growth. There is a concern then that AI can spread and transfer from these regions further, affecting livelihoods, wilderness and mankind worldwide (9,24,25). That’s where a focus on more ecological perspectives, connectivity and spill-over effects (‘telecoupling’26) provides more progress.The assessment data indicate that our model predictions are pretty robust. This must not come as a big surprise when knowing the reliability of machine learning modeling methods in space and time (see for instance9,13, and12 for generic applications and performance).This study sets a baseline, and it now can be improved further, namely making good use of digital products compiled and created. Further we suggest a focus on holistic/ecological approaches, an increased representative sampling of all species and landscapes (hotspots, coldspots, gradients in space and time), coordinating sampling and public data sharing with other projects and hotspots elsewhere, e.g. in the European Union and with the World Health Organization. Also more assessments should be carried out, and data accuracy and sharing are to be improved, e.g. for Alaska, geo-referencing using quantitative coordinates with 6 decimals and providing AI subtype information all done open access with ISO-compliant metadata.Here we were able to present a first Big Data low-path AI perspective and to highlight hotspots, coldspots and reservoirs for improved handling, studying, and management of AI in the Pacific Rim and globally. We think this work allows for a template to gain better inference and for better management of low-path AI and AI overall using modern methods.

Secondly, in vivo, we have investigated its efficacy against infectious bronchitis using a broiler infection model. In vitro, these antimicrobials had expressed antiviral activity against all five viruses through all phases of the infection process of the host cells. In vivo, the antimicrobial mixture reduced the virus load in the tracheal and lung tissue and significantly reduced the clinical signs of infection and the mortality rate in the experimental group E2 receiving AuraShield L. All these effects were accompanied by a significant reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in IgA levels and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in both trachea and lungs. Our study demonstrated that mixtures of natural antimicrobials, such AuraShield L, can prevent in vitro viral infection of cell cultures. Secondly, in vivo, the efficiency of vaccination was improved by preventing secondary viral infections through a mechanism involving significant increases in SCFA production and increased IgA levels. As a consequence the clinical signs of secondary infections were significantly reduced resulting in recovered production performance and lower mortality rates in the experimental group E2.

Some of the most common viral diseases in farmed animals are infectious bronchitis, Newcastle disease, avian influenza, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and bovine coronavirus. Currently, vaccination for these diseases is only partially efficacious therefore additional preventions and treatments are needed.Natural antimicrobials including plant extracts or organic acids are currently tested for their ability to inhibit viruses and prevent their pathogenic impact on the host. Plant phytochemicals, in particular flavonoids and polyphenols, contain an abundant pool of potent antiviral molecules (e.g., vitexin), a flavonoid isolated from pink coral tree Erythrina speciose leaves, demonstrated antiviral activity against Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1) and Hepatitis A virus-H10 (HAV H10)2. Improving the efficiency of antimicrobial compounds represents a crucial step in developing alternative strategies, but this depends on a better understanding of their mode of action. For example, gamma-coronavirus (IBV) that was pre-treated with elderberry (Sambucus nigra) fruit extracts resulted in damage to virus molecular structure causing an elimination of Vero cell cytotoxicity3. The mechanism of elderberry extract efficacy was attributed to altered virion envelopes and membrane vesicles4.The identification of the active compounds with antiviral effects will lead to a better understanding on how natural antimicrobials inhibit viruses and diseases. Tangeretin is a polymethoxylated flavone found in citrus fruit peels that inhibits viral entry into cells by blocking viral fusion5, and citrus extracts are active against avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) in different environments6. Moreover, vaccines containing citrus derived molecules were more efficient in stimulating the immune system with fewer side effects7. Maltodextrins are plant polysaccharides that are commonly used as food additives that when used as a vaccine nanoparticle increased activity against influenza virus8. Lactic acid also inhibited influenza A infection replication8. Citric acid is another potent natural antimicrobial with anti-viral activity that inhibits the foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV)9.An additional anti-viral mechanism by which natural antimicrobials can prevent viral infections refers to their ability to inhibit cellular oxidative events. For example, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) has been proven crucial in the fight against viral infections due to its role as superoxide scavenger and as anti-inflammatory agent10. The pro-inflammatory response, including the release of cytokines to avoid apoptosis is partially dependent on the levels of cellular hydrogen peroxide production as it leads to the stimulation of neutrophils and macrophages leading to the elimination of either microbes or viruses11. Natural antimicrobials or plant extracts (phenolics, flavonoids, tannins) have the ability to negatively impact on oxidative stress helping the organism to protect itself from the detrimental effect of reactive oxygen species12.Combinations of natural antimicrobials, similar to AuraShield L (e.g. Auranta 3001), were previously described as efficient in preventing bacterial infections in chicken and mouse animal models13,14,15,16. These results show that Auranta 3001 has a negative impact on the expression of virulence genes in Campylobacter spp.13, (hcp gene) and that improves the immune system response in challenged broilers. In infections caused by Listeria spp., these mixtures of antimicrobials were able to reduce the bacterial load in the liver and spleen of the infected mice and significantly reduced inflammation and reduced the mortality rate15. It is thought that these mixtures of natural biochemical antimicrobials can directly affect viruses through their viral capsids or modify the receptors on the host cells involved in adhesion being strongly suggested that a comprehensive understanding of their anti-viral mechanisms is strongly recommended17.Understanding the mechanisms involved in the anti-viral and anti-infectious activity of biochemical compounds require extensive in vivo testing in order to prove their efficiency in reducing the clinical signs of disease without a negative impact on animal health. We hypothesized that given the fact that in combination natural antimicrobials can act antagonistically against each other18 a detailed scientific report is often required, allowing the end user to design informed interventions at farm level. In the present study we examined the in vitro activity of a mixture of citrus extract, maltodextrin, sodium chloride, lactic acid and citric acid (AuraShield L) against viruses causing infectious bronchitis (B1648), Newcastle disease (ATCC, 699), avian influenza (H9N2, ATCC, VR-1642), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (ATCC, VR-2386) and bovine coronavirus (ATCC, VR-874). We have investigated the effectiveness of this antimicrobial mixture by supplementing it via drinking water, against the infectious bronchitis virus in challenged broilers (B1648).ResultsThe in vitro antiviral effect of AuraShield LFirst we have investigated, in vitro, as described in Materials and Methods the antiviral effect of AuraShield L against the five of the most common infectious viruses in livestock including Infectious Bronchitis (B1648), Newcastle disease (ATCC, 699), Avian Influenza (H9N2, ATCC, VR-1642), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (ATCC, VR-2386) and bovine coronavirus (ATCC, VR-874). The 50% effective concentration (EC50) of AuraShield L was detected between 0.004 and 0.007 μl/ml, with the highest concentrations (0.007 μl) required against VR-2386 (Table 1). Next we have demonstrated the effect of the antimicrobial mixture on the viral replication by treating the cells and the viruses individually with AuraShield L prior to infection. Additionally, the antimicrobial mixture was tested by inclusion during adsorption or after the adsorption period. Infected cells in the absence of AuraShield L were used as a control. The percent reduction in viral replication was calculated relative to the amount of virus produced in controls, and a non-cytotoxic concentration was used in all assays. Pre-treatment with AuraShield L caused a decrease in the number of plaques in all experimental investigations and for all viruses used (Fig. 1A). Pre-treatment of cells with AuraShield L (0.01%) led to over 80% reduction in B1648, VR-699 and VR-2386 virus production compared to control. In the case of VR-1642 (Fig. 1A) the reduction was of approximately 70% and 50% for VR-874. The impact was even more dramatic when viruses were pre-treated with AuraShield L with over 90% reduction for all viruses except VR-874 (65%). When AuraShield L was added during the adsorption period, virus titres were reduced by 52% for VR-874. Similar results were observed during viral replication, when the antimicrobial mixture was added only to the overlay medium. Collectively, these results suggest that the anti-viral effect of AuraShield L is exerted through all phases of host cell infection.Table 1 Cytotoxic and efficiency of AuraShield L.Full size tableFigure 1(A) the anti-viral effect of AuraShield L against B1648, ATCC, 699, VR-1642, VR-2386 and VR-874. AuraShield L was added at the non-cytotoxic concentration of 0.01%. Cells were pre-treated with AuraShield L prior to virus infection (pre-treatment cells), viruses were pre-treated prior to infection (pre-treated virus), AuraShield L was added during the adsorption period (adsorption) or after penetration of the viruses into cells (replication). Two-way ANOVA and Three-way ANOVA was used to analyse the significance of percentage decrease. (B) Viral RNA copies in the trachea and lungs. Viral RNA copies were measured by RT-qPCR. In (C) the average percentage of mortality in groups C, E1 and E2 is represented (birds per group at each time point). Asterisks indicate significant differences as indicated on the graph. Error bars represent the standard deviation of means from three replicate experiments.Full size imageAuraShield L reduces the viral load in the trachea and lungs of in vivo challenged broilers with the avian bronchitis virus (B1648)We have next examined the anti-viral effect of AuraShield L in broilers in an in vivo infectious bronchitis model using the B1648 virus to cause infection. Viral RNA was measured in samples of tracheal and lung samples, using RT-qPCR (Fig. 1B). The viral RNA copies in the lung were at approximately 7.1 log10 copies/g tissue in group E1 with a significant decrease in the group E2 (p = 0.003) similar to the un-infected control group C. Inclusion of AuraShield L in the broiler’s drinking water reduced the viral load in the trachea from 8.7 log10 copies/g, in the untreated group E1, to 0.8 log10 copies/g in the tracheal tissue (p = 0.001) of the treated group E2. The virus levels were reduced below the levels recorded in the un-treated and un-challenged group C. The levels of significance were calculated considering group E1 as reference. These results indicate that the antimicrobial mixture reduced the virus load in the tracheal tissue having a negative impact the virus transition into the lung tissue.AuraShield L has a negative impact on the pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, stimulates immunity and reduces oxidative inflammation in challenged broilersIn order to gain more information on why we detect low levels of infection in the trachea and lungs of the experimental group we have designed experiments to investigate the effect against the main pro-inflammatory cytokines, on the immune system and cellular oxidation. The inclusion of AuraShield L in the drinking of the infected broilers (E2) reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TGF-β3 (p = 0.0008), INFα (p = 0.01), INFβ (p < 0.0001) and INFγ (p = 0.0008) in the trachea (Fig. 2A). Similarly, to trachea, all pro-inflammatory factors in the lung were also decreased by the inclusion of AuraShield L compared to the control and group E1 (Fig. 2B). The significance was calculated against group E1 in order to account for the effect of AuraShield L. Overall inclusion of AuraShield L in the drinking water of group E2 broilers led to a reduction in the expression levels of all pro-inflammatory cytokines investigated indicating that this antimicrobial mixture could have impacted the lung and tracheal inflammation caused by infection. High serum IgA concentrations were detected at 5 days post AuraShield L inclusion in the drinking water (Fig. 2C). Secreted IgA levels were higher (405 vs 300 ng/ml, p = 0.02) in group E2 compared to group E1 and moreover, in group E1 (p = 0.0008) were significantly higher compared to group C. This is probably a result of vaccination and the response of infection, but equally AuraShield L treatment in group E2 boosted IgA levels above E1 (p = 0.02).Figure 2Pro-inflammatory cytokine (TGF-β3, TNF-α, INFα, INFβ and INFγ) production in the trachea and lung tissue of B1648 infected/un-infected broilers which received or not AuraShield L in the drinking water for 5 days post-infection, (A) in the trachea and (B) in the lungs. (C) Represents the IgA levels in broilers serum, (D) the SCFAs concentrations in the cecal contents. The levels of MnSOD (pg/ml) in the lung and trachea following exposure to AuraShield L are presented in (E). Asterisks indicate significant differences with the respective P values being indicated on the graph. Error bars represent the standard deviation of means from three different experiments. Student t test was used to calculate significance (**p < 0.005).Full size imageWe have next investigated the association between SCFA production and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) expression as indicators of an improved immune response during viral infections. The levels of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) produced in broilers gut (cecum) were also investigated due to their association to a better immunity. The total measured SCFA levels in the cecal contents were significantly increased in group E2 (p < 0.01) with the pH levels remained similar between the three groups (Table 2). Succinic acid, lactic acid and butyric acid concentrations were significantly increased by inclusion of AuraShield L (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2D). The concentrations of lactic acid, succinic acid, formic acid, lactic acid and butyric acid were significantly increased following inclusion of AuraShield L in the drinking water (p < 0.05). Inclusion of AuraShield L in the drinking water of the infected broilers resulted in a significant increase in pulmonary and tracheal MnSOD activity (Fig. 2E). The levels of MnSOD, in the lung increased significantly from 380 pg/ml to 720 pg/ml (p = 0.0003) and to 676 pg/ml (p = 0.01) in the trachea following the inclusion of AuraShield L. These findings indicate that increased MnSOD expression in the pulmonary and tracheal tissue contributes to a better immune response and more efficient virus elimination.Table 2 Effect of AuraShield L on total SCFA production and pH levels in the cecum (mg/cecum).Full size tableAuraShield L reduces the clinical signs of disease in broilers challenged with the avian bronchitis virus (B1648) and reduces mortalityIn order to quantify the beneficial effects described above we have closely monitored the clinical signs in the challenged broilers during AuraShield administration. Symptoms were mild in both groups except for tracheal rales which impacted 33% of the E1 broilers and 24% in E2 (Table 3). Pulmonary rales were the second obvious clinical sign measurable in the first day of investigation with 11% of broilers affected in group E1 and 18% in group E2. Beginning on day 2 clear signs of improvement were observed in AuraShield treated group (E2). The efficacy of AuraShield L treatment was compared between group E1 and E2 on day 5 and excluded the negative control C group. Broilers displaying no signs of ruffled feathers increased by 150% in group E2 when AuraShield L was included in the drinking water. Sneeze and coughs behaved similarly and demonstrated that the number of broilers showing no clinical signs increased 129.4% and 136.8%, respectively in group E2. Similarly, AuraShield L treatment decreased the number of broilers with tracheal and pulmonary rales. Dyspnoea was lower in the AuraShield L treated group (7% vs. 17%, respectively). No clinical nephritis were recorded during the course of experiment in any group, and clinical symptoms were detected in a small percentage of control broilers, but these were levels higher than that of group E2. The absence or presence of these clinical signs can also be reflected in the mortality rate recorded during the experiment. The inclusion of AuraShield L in the drinking water of broilers in group E2 maintained the broiler survival rate to 93.7%. In contrast, broilers in group E1 had a survival rate of 66.6% and the control group 87.5% (Fig. 1c). The addition of AuraShield L in the drinking water also resulted in performance recovery in the infected broilers (supplementary Table 2).Table 3 Clinical signs in infected and uninfected broilers treated with AuraShield L.Full size tableDiscussionEnsuring animal health and welfare also includes having efficient technologies to reduce the incidence of infectious diseases in order of safeguarding of national and international food supplies19. A wide range of natural antimicrobial substances have been investigated and have shown activity against various viruses20. Organic acids, including citric acid, are known not only for their role in increasing feed utilisation efficiency but also for their role in improving the immune response in infected animals21. In this study, we have tested a mixture of natural antimicrobials containing citrus extract, maltodextrin, sodium chloride, lactic acid, and citric acid (AuraShield L) to test its activity in vitro against viruses responsible for avian infectious bronchitis, Newcastle disease, avian Influenza, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), and bovine coronavirus. In vivo the antimicrobial mixture was also tested for its ability to reduce the disease signs of infectious bronchitis using a broiler infection model.Viruses need to penetrate into the cellular cytosol by breaking the endosomal membrane requiring undamaged surface structures to cause infection22. AuraShield L acts upon the host and on the pathogen directly indicating a possible disruption of the early stages of viral infection. Experiments developed to evaluate the toxicity of AuraShield L indicated a moderate toxic behaviour towards viruses in cell cultures with the effective cytotoxicity being reached between 0.004–0.007 (µl/ml). Our study shows that the mode of anti-viral action was greatest when cells were treated with AuraShield L before infection or when viruses were incubated with non-cytotoxic concentration of AuraShield L prior to infection. We have also observed that AuraShield L maintained its antiviral properties during adsorption or after penetration into the host cells.Chickens are an important natural host of the infectious bronchitis virus which targets the upper respiratory tract, and intensive virus replication leads to signs characteristic of the clinical manifestation of this respiratory disease23. When AuraShield L was included in the drinking water of artificially IBV (B1648) challenged chicken broilers, the viral mRNA was detected in the trachea and lungs of IBV infected broilers but was significantly decreased by AuraShield L treatment. The reduced presence of IBV virus in trachea of infected birds confirmed the ability of AuraShield L to reduce respiratory disease progression24.AuraShield L treatment reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines during infection. The transforming growth factors (TGF-β) are polypeptides with role in cell growth and differentiation, and all five examined had similar biological activities including important pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory activities25. In our study the impact on TGF-β3 expression in AuraShield L treated broilers was also significant in both tracheal and lung tissue, with a similar pattern observed for most of the measured cytokines. The detrimental effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines can also be explained by the presence of maltodextrin in AuraShield L, as it has been shown that maltodextrin increased IgA production, an antibody that plays a crucial role in mucous membranes immune function26. In our experiments, IgA levels were significantly increased in the serum of broilers treated with AuraShield L and offer protection to the host27. The anti-infectious role of IgA was observed in the case of broiler coccidiosis where it has an essential role in the immune response to E. tenella28. Overall, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were reduced by AuraShiled L to the level of the un-infected control emphasizing its anti-inflammatory effect.Intestinal immunity if often involved in shaping lung immunity and preventing lung inflammation29 through production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA). SCFA’s are known for their role in reducing allergic airway inflammation30,31. This anti-inflammatory effect of SCFAs against viral infections was specifically described for the equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV1) where the effect was observed at physiological levels32. In our study the inclusion of AuraShield L in the drinking water significantly increased the SCFA (lactate, succinate, formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate) production which justifies the observed effect on the immune system with positive effects on the viral pathogenicity. Another reason for the observed stimulated immune response in our study was the increased level of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the lung and tracheal tissue. It has been shown previously that in infectious bronchitis (IB) the oxidative status is improved by increasing the levels of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) with a significant impact on virus elimination via an increased immune response33. A similar effect was observed in infections caused by influenza A virus where inclusion of MnSOD in aerosols led to a mild improvement of the disease. Other natural antimicrobials are also known for their antioxidant effect12 also when included in the feed of farmed poultr34 with a direct effect in controlling the levels of MnSOD35.At present, the primary method of protecting chickens from infectious bronchitis is through vaccination36. However, vaccination does not eliminate all clinical signs, which can have detrimental impact on production efficiency, economic return, and animal welfare37. Vaccination of broilers coupled with inclusion in the drinking water of AuraShield L reduced clinical signs associated with infectious bronchitis and reduced mortality rates.In countries with intensive poultry production the incidence of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is very high with vaccination only partially diminishing the occurrence of infection and appearance of clinical signs38. Identification and testing of novel and natural antimicrobial mixtures designed to reduce the severity of clinical manifestations and possibly to prevent viral infections are crucial for the industry to enhance animal health and welfare, while maintaining performance. Our study clearly shows that antimicrobial compounds and mixtures, such as AuraShield L, can reduce viral pathogenicity in vitro and can boost the efficacy of vaccination in vivo by boosting the immune system through a mechanism that involves SCFA production and increased MnSOD expression.Material and methodsViruses and antimicrobial mixtureInfectious Bronchitis (B1648)39, Newcastle disease (ATCC, 699), Avian Influenza (H9N2, ATCC, VR-1642)40, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (ATCC, VR-2386) and bovine coronavirus (ATCC, VR-874) were used. Viruses were propagated in pathogen free 10 days old embryonated chicken eggs. The viruses from the second passage were used in the present experiments. After 48 h post-infection the allantoic fluids were harvested by low-speed centrifugation and stored at − 70 °C. In this study we have used a commercial product (AuraShield L), a mixture of maltodextrin (4%) and sodium chloride (0.5%). As additives lactic acid (30%) and citric acid (15%) and citrus extract (8%) were also included and the balance to 100% is made up with dH2O. This commercially available mixture is identified in the manuscript AuraShield L supplied by Auranta LTD.Cytotoxicity assay (CC50, EC50 and SI)AuraShield L was used for the determination of EC50 and SI (selective index). The mixture was titrated from 1 to 1:128 CC50 and used for virus exposure. After the addition of 10 μl MTT reagent (Sigma Aldrich) the samples were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The EC50 concentrations were calculated against extract concentrations.In order to determine the cytotoxic activity of AuraShield L the antimicrobial product was dissolved in water and added to the cell culture medium at a final concentration of 2% in order to quantify the effect on monolayer culture. The Hep-2 cells (ATCC CCL-23) were grown in Dubleco Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM—Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with foetal bovine serum to a final concentration of 10%. Cells were incubated 37 °C with the medium being renewed every 48 h. The Hep-2 cells were grown in 0.001–0.2% AuraShield L containing medium. The antimicrobial mixture was tested in triplicate and on three different occasions. The absorbance of each well was measured at 620 nm in a microplate reader (Fluostar Omega, BMG Labtech) and the percentage of cell survival was calculated.Direct plaque assayThe plaque reduction assay was performed as previously described41. Brielfy, 2 × 103 plaque forming units were incubated with different concentrations of AuraShield L for 2 h at room temperature. Serial dilutions of the treated viruses were adsorbed to the cells for 2 h at 37 °C. All assays was performed in triplicates. Incubation was performed for 4 days at 37 °C, followed by 10% formalin fixation. Plaque counting was performed after staining with 1% crystal violet.In vitro antiviral activityAntiviral activity was performed as previously described41 except that in our experiments Hep-2 cell line was used. Briefly, Hep-2 cells were pre-treated with AuraShield L before viral infection and separately the viruses were incubated with AuraShield L before infection. In order to test for viral absorption or penetration the cells and viruses were incubated together. AuraShield L was always used at the nontoxic concentration of 0.09% and was added to the cells followed by incubation for 2 h at 37 °C. The supernatant was removed, cells were washed and infected with each virus individually. In the case when the antimicrobial mixture was used to pre-treat the viruses the incubation took place for 1 h at room temperature followed by infection of cells. The absorption period was analysed by mixing individually the viruses with 0.09% AuraShield followed by infection of cells. In the case of replication after infection the inoculum was removed and replaced with media containing 0.5% methylcellulose. Each assay was performed in three replicates on 3 different occasions. Plaque reduction assays were carried out as mentioned above and number of plaques of AuraShield L treated cells and viruses were compared to untreated controls. Data were subjected to statistical analyses using the Graph Prism software package.In vivo infections with IBV B1648Two-week-old ROSS 308 broilers were separated in three groups (n = 150 broilers/group): Control (C), first experimental group (E1) included broilers challenged with IBV B1648 and the second experimental (E2) included broilers challenged with IBV B1648 and supplemented with AuraShield L as described in Fig. 3. All groups were vaccinated against IBV with Biovac H120 (V1) and Nobilis IB491 (V2). Each broiler in groups E1 and E2 was inoculated intratracheally with (200 μl) with 103 EID50/400 μl B1648 on day 14. AuraShield L was administered to the experimental group E2 through drinking water following the protocol described in Fig. 3. Birds were housed in separate negative pressure isolation rooms, and drinking water and feed were ad libitum duration the experiment. The aim of our study was to assess the effect of Aura Shield L on infection rate and symptoms, and this use of a low IBV challenge dose keeps a low mortality rate as previously described39. Control broilers were inoculated with 200 µl PBS (Phosphate Buffer Saline) and served as a negative control group. At 28 days, 30 chickens from each group were humanely euthanized and tracheal and lung samples were stored at − 70 °C for viral RNA quantification by RT-qPCR. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β3, TNF-α, INFα, INFβ, INFγ) in tissue of trachea, lung of IBV B1648-infected chickens was determined by using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay systems from Quantikine, R&D Systems. Results of cytokine concentration were expressed as pg (picograms) per milliliter of culture medium. Each study run was performed in triplicate. The experimental design was evaluated and approved by the Ethical and Animal Welfare Committee of the Banat University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, King Michael I of Romania, Timisoara and we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.Figure 3Schematic outline of the in vivo experimental design. Broilers were vaccinated at day 5 (V1) and day 15 (V2). Groups E1 and E2 were challenged with IBV B1648 day 14. Group E2 received AuraShield L in the drinking water for 5 days. At day 28 performance was recorded and 30 broilers euthanized for analysis.Full size imageScoring and clinical signsClinical signs, such as ruffled feathers, sneezing, coughing, tracheal and pulmonary rales and dyspnoea were recorded daily during the 5 days of AuraShield L administration and once infection was established. Clinical signs and gross lesions were recorded. Clinical signs were quantified and expressed as a percentage of the total number of birds. The percentage difference (Eq. 1) was used to indicate the efficiency of AuraShield L in reducing the clinical signs of disease.$$\%\, difference = \frac{V1 - V2}{{\left[ {\frac{V1 + V2}{2}} \right]}} \times 100$$ (1) RT‑qPCR assay for ORF 1a geneAs previously described39 RT-qPCR primers were used to detect the B1648 strain in the tracheal samples using the following primers cDNA_FW ggtgttaggcttatagttcctcag, cDNA_RV taaacattagggttgacaccagt, T7_FW taatacgactcactatagggggtgttaggcttatagttcctcag, qPCR_FW gctattgtagaggtagtgtatgtgag and qPCR_RV agggttgacaccagtaaagaat. Viral RNA was extracted from tracheal secretions using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, United Kingdom). The RNA was reverse transcribed using Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The mRNA levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR using QuantiNovaSYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, United Kingdom) on a LightCycler 96 (Roche). The conditions for genes consisted of incubating at 95 °C for 8 min were followed by 40 cycles, each 10 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 58 °C. A total of 5 μl of SYBR Green master mixture was used in each reaction along with 0.5 μl of 10 μM primer mixture, 3 μl of molecular grade water, and 1 μl of DNA sample. Viral RNA extracts from tracheal secretions were analysed in triplicate RT-qPCR reactions as described above. Quantification of the number of viral RNA copies in tissues (RNA copies/g) was similar like in other samples.Determination of IgA levels in the serumThe total levels of IgA were measured by IgA Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit (ab157691 ABCAM) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.SCFA determinationsThe SCFA were analysed by gas chromatography as previously described42. In brief, 1 g of ceca was mixed 1 ml of H2O and 1 ml of 20 mmol/l pivalic acid solution as an internal standard. The solution was mixed and 1 ml of HClO4 (perchloric acid) was added in order to extract SCFA by shaking by vortexing for 5 min. The HClO4 acid was precipitated by adding 50 ml of 4 mol KOH into 500 ml of supernatant. The addition of saturated oxalic acid, at 4 °C for 60 min, and centrifugation at 18,000 g for 10 min. Samples were analysed by gas chromatography using SCION-456-GC with a flame ionization detector.Superoxide manganese dismutase (SOD2/MnSOD) determination in the lung tissueThe superoxide manganese dismutase was quantified in the lung and trachea using the chicken SOD 2 Eliza Kit (Assay Solution) according to the manufacturer instructions. Briefly, the tissues were rinsed in ice-cold PBS (0.02 mol/l, pH 7.0–7.2) to remove excess blood, minced the tissues to small pieces and homogenized them in a certain amount of PBS and stored at -80 °C until further use. A standard curve was prepared for each experiment. Volumes of 100 μl sample and standard were added per each well in a 96 well plate, except the control well where 0.1 ml of the sample diluent was added. Each well was washed with wash buffer two times for a total of three washes. After the last wash the wash buffer was removed by aspirating or by inverting the plate and blotting it against clean paper towels. In the next step 100 μl of the detection antibody was added to each well followed by incubation at room temperature for 2 h. Next, streptavidin-HRP (100 μl) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Each measurement was done in triplicate.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad software. Data were represented as mean ± SD. p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001). ANOVA and Student t were used. An ANOVA was performed to analyse the percentage decrease compared to control using both Two-way ANOVA (p < 0.0001) and Three-way ANOVA (p < 0.0001).

This article is part of the series. Infectious disease specialists warned for years of the ‘Big One,’ likely an influenza pandemic, that lurked on the horizon. But despite these looming concerns, we were still not prepared for the current outbreak. One way we could have been better prepared was through the global health coordination that existed between the US and China. But this program was weakened after President Trump took office due to cuts to the global health budget. How would this cooperation have helped stem the effects of the current pandemic outbreak and could it help to prevent the next one? We have long recognized the importance of international cooperation in monitoring and controlling diseases that emerge in other parts of the globe and travel to our shores. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has set up disease surveillance programs and trained public health epidemiologists in over seventy countries around the world, including China. Beginning in the 1980s, the CDC began working with China to create a true public health infrastructure. They trained people in flu sample collection and started a flu detection program in China. Following the outbreak of SARS, the two countries escalated their bilateral health program. By 2009, the CDC employed fifty people (both US and Chinese citizens) to monitor health in China. This was critical to CDC’s ability to get information about what was going on in China. Much of this collaboration slowed down to almost a halt when Trump was elected president. His administration drastically cut the global health budget, forcing the CDC to make tough decisions that resulted in the reduction of CDC staff in China. This disruption was likely aggravated by the tensions that developed between the US and China under Trump and the increased focus on isolating and identifying Chinese scientists suspected of intellectual property fraud. This allowed the novel coronavirus to emerge in a vacuum where the US had no ability to detect and help stem an epidemic emerging in the global community. Going forward, I would urge any administration that assumes office in January to rebuild our cooperation on public health with China. This will be key to detecting future emerging infections and learning important lessons in treating these diseases.

Share this item with your network: By Jacqueline LaPointe, Director of Editorial Published: 07 Oct 2020 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the American Medical Association (AMA) is adding two new codes to the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code set. The codes are for multi-virus tests that can detect both COVID-19 and other viruses, like the flu. The new Category I codes and long descriptors are: 87636: Infectious agent detection by nucleic acid (DNA or RNA); severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Coronavirus disease [COVID-19]) and influenza virus types A and B, multiplex amplified probe technique 87637: Infectious agent detection by nucleic acid (DNA or RNA); severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Coronavirus disease [COVID-19]), influenza virus types A and B, and respiratory syncytial virus, multiplex amplified probe technique The CPT Editorial Panel approved the new codes for immediate use. Providers would normally use CPT code 87631 to report a test panel that detects the flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. But the public health emergency has created a need for clinicians to rapidly distinguish these virus from COVID-19, the AMA states in new coding guidance. Multi-virus tests could help boost testing capacity for the healthcare industry, which continues to face a shortage of testing supplies, according to Susan R. Bailey, MD, AMA president. “Two of the newly approved codes report nucleic acid assays that allow a single test to simultaneously detect the novel coronavirus and a combination of common viral infectious agents, including influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial virus,” Bailey said in an announcement earlier today. “Concurrent detection promises to conserve important testing resources, allowing for ongoing surveillance of influenza while testing for the novel coronavirus.” The announcement also highlighted the revision of CPT codes 87301 through 87430, which report tests for infectious agency antigen detection by the immunoassay technique. Effective immediately, code descriptors for the impacted CPT codes no longer have the undefined term “multi step method.” “The revision clarifies the proper reporting for antigen tests that are read by a machine, as compared to those which can be visually interpreted without a machine. This revision affects the newly developed descriptor for CPT code 87426,” AMA stated in the announcement. In accordance with the revision, the CPT Editorial Panel also approved a new Category I code to report infectious agent antigen detection by immunoassay with direct visual observation. The CPT code and long descriptor are: 87811: Infectious agent antigen detection by immunoassay with direct optical (ie, visual) observation; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Coronavirus disease [COVID-19]) The new CPT codes join the ranks of a growing list of new COVID-19-related changes to the code set. Since the start of the pandemic, the CPT Editorial Panel has approved about a dozen new CPT codes to account for changes in medical services and diagnostics in light of COVID-19. The codes cover a wide range of COVID-19 testing, including by nucleic acid and for antibody and antigen detection. A code approved in September (99072) also accounts for the additional supplies and clinical staff time required to prevent the spread of the virus. Additionally, the Panel has added several codes to the Proprietary Laboratory Analyses (PLA) code set, including the most recent addition of codes 0240U and 0241U for the detection of COVID-19, influenza A, and influenza B. Another new code (0240U) also detects RSV. The latest coding guidance from AMA also includes revisions to Immunology guidelines. The revisions “correct and clarify reporting of infectious agent antigen studies in the Microbiology subsection in the Pathology and Laboratory section of the CPT code set,” the guidance states. AMA noted that, per the standard early release delivery process for new CPT codes, providers will need to manually upload the code descriptors into their EHR systems. New codes are typically included in the complete CPT code set in the data file for the new year. AMA released the data file for 2021 at the start of September.

Vincent Gerasole/Archdiocese of Chicago On Sept. 17, Cardinal Cupich and the Archdiocese of Chicago launched a media campaign urging people to get a flu shot this season. “We have faced unprecedented challenges this year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Loved ones have sickened and, in some cases died. We have had to adjust to drastic changes in the way we live our lives,” Cardinal Cupich wrote in a letter to parishes. “As Catholics committed to defending life, we are called to take responsibility for the welfare and safety of our community. This year, that means wearing a mask, washing our hands and taking other precautions to prevent the spread of this deadly virus.” “Archdiocese of Chicago personnel have worked hard these past few months to plan and execute preventive measures so we could open our churches and schools safely. All our hard work might have less impact though, if we don’t take one more step and get our influenza immunizations as soon as possible,” he wrote. More than 200,000 Americans are hospitalized each year with the flu, the cardinal noted. “While it’s known as the common flu, there’s really nothing common about influenza in 2020. Without a doubt, this will be the most important flu shot you will ever receive. In the coming weeks, we will witness a convergence of both viruses — influenza and COVID-19,” he wrote. “Let’s roll up our sleeves and take this simple step. You may save a life. You will certainly help make this unprecedented year less deadly for our community.” The flu vaccination campaign includes a video message from Cardinal Cupich, posters for churches and schools and flyers for parishioners and school families to be distributed via email and social media. The materials focus on the importance of being vaccinated, provide links to public health information and a vaccine finder for locating flu shot sources in each ZIP code. Campaign materials, including Cardinal Cupich’s video and letter, can be viewed at archchicago.orgews-and-events/flu-2020. Dr. Alfredo Mena Lora, medical director of infection prevention at St. Anthony Hospital, said that even though the flu vaccine is for only one strain of the virus each year, it is still important to get it. “Even when this is somewhat mismatched, you reduce your risk of getting influenza and, importantly, you reduce the risk of getting influenza that is severe. Even if you get the flu after a vaccination you are much less likely to be critically ill or to die,” Mena Lora said. While it’s important for older people, especially those with other health issues, to get the vaccine, it’s also important for younger people to get it. “For young people that are less likely to develop severe influenza and die, similar to what’s happening with COVID-19, those folks are more likely to give it to other people who are older and more likely to have severe consequences,” Mena Lora said. “So by getting the influenza shot, no matter who you are, we are less likely as a community to have transmission from each other.” During COVID-19 it is extremely important to get the vaccine because hospitals can be easily overwhelmed if they see many admissions for both COVID-19 and the flu. “It’s important every year to get the influenza vaccine but in a year when PPE and resources are strained by a larger pandemic, it’s important to try to reduce that element,” he said. Having support from community leaders like Cardinal Cupich around getting the flu vaccine is helpful to the medical community. “Vaccines tend to be the victims of their own success. It is very important for communities to have people that they trust and people that they know deliver the facts,” he said. “I think if it comes from people in the community like parishes, priests, schools, family members, then I think it’s easier to get the message across.” Topics: cardinal blase j. cupich Related Articles Book by Cardinal Cupich inspires new series on the Eucharist Inspired by Cardinal Cupich’s book “Take, Bless, Break, Share: A Strategy for a Eucharistic Revival” (Twenty-Third Publications), the archdiocese’s Office for Lifelong Formation and Office for Divine Worship produced “Remain In Me,” a five-part series on the eucharistic revival. Cardinal Cupich visits with migrants at Oak Park parish The number of migrants coming to the St. Catherine-St. Lucy campus in Oak Park for help with basic needs has swelled so much that it has outgrown the former rectory on the site and will move to the first floor of St. Edmund School starting this month.

But Woodrow Wilson’s White House largely ignored the global health crisis. Instead, the president focused on the Great War enveloping Europe and offering “no leadership or guidance of any kind,” as historian John M. Barry, author of The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History, recently told Time’s Melissa August. “Wilson wanted the focus to remain on the war effort,” Barry explained. “Anything negative was viewed as hurting morale.” In private, the president acknowledged the threat posed by the virus, which struck a number of people in his inner circle, including his personal secretary, his oldest daughter and multiple Secret Service members. Even the White House sheep came down with the flu, reports Michael S. Rosenwald for the Washington Post. Wilson himself contracted the disease shortly after arriving in Paris in April 1919 for peace talks aimed at determining the direction of a post-World War I Europe. As White House doctor Cary T. Grayson wrote in a letter to a friend, the diagnosis arrived at a decidedly inopportune moment: “The president was suddenly taken violently sick with the influenza at a time when the whole of civilization seemed to be in the balance.” Grayson and the rest of Wilson’s staff downplayed the president’s illness, telling reporters that overwork and Paris’ “chilly and rainy weather” had sparked a cold and fever. On April 5, the Associated Press reported that Wilson was “not stricken with influenza.” Behind the scenes, the president was suffering the full force of the virus’ effects. Unable to sit up in bed, he experienced coughing fits, gastrointestinal symptoms and a 103-degree fever. Then, says biographer A. Scott Berg, the “generally predictable” Wilson started blurting out “unexpected orders”—on two separate occasions, he “created a scene over pieces of furniture that had suddenly disappeared,” despite the fact that nothing had been moved—and exhibiting other signs of severe disorientation. At one point, the president became convinced that he was surrounded by French spies. “[W]e could but surmise that something queer was happening in his mind,” Chief Usher Irwin Hoover later recalled. “One thing was certain: [H]e was never the same after this little spell of sickness.” Wilson’s bout of influenza “weaken[ed] him physically … at the most crucial point of negotiations,” wrote Barry in The Great Influenza. As Steve Coll explained for the New Yorker earlier this year, the president had originally argued that the Allies “should go easy” on Germany to facilitate the success of his pet project, the League of Nations. But French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, whose country had endured much devastation during the four-year conflict, wanted to take a tougher stance; days after coming down with the flu, an exhausted Wilson conceded to the other world leaders’ demands, setting the stage for what Coll describes as “a settlement so harsh and onerous to Germans that it became a provocative cause of revived German nationalism … and, eventually, a rallying cause of Adolf Hitler.” Whether Wilson would have pushed harder for more equitable terms if he hadn’t come down with the flu is, of course, impossible to discern. According to Barry, the illness certainly drained his stamina and impeded his concentration, in addition to affecting “his mind in other, deeper ways.” Despite his personal experience with the pandemic, the president never publicly acknowledged the disease wreaking havoc on the world. And though Wilson recovered from the virus, contemporaries and historians alike argue that he was never quite the same. Six months after he came down with the flu, Wilson suffered a debilitating stroke that left him paralyzed on his left side and partially blind. Instead of disclosing her husband’s stroke, First Lady Edith Wilson hid his life-threatening condition from politicians, the press and the public, embarking on a self-described “stewardship” that Howard Markel of “PBS Newshour” more accurately defines as a secret presidency. The first lady was able to assume such broad power due to a lack of constitutional clarity regarding the circumstances under which a president is considered incapacitated. A clearer protocol was only established with the ratification of the 25th Amendment in 1967. As Manuel Roig-Franzia wrote for the Washington Post in 2016, Edith’s “control of the flow of information did not go unnoticed by an increasingly skeptical Congress.” At one point, Senator Albert Fall even declared, “We have a petticoat government! Wilson is not acting! Mrs. Wilson is President!” Though Wilson’s condition improved marginally in the final years of his presidency, Edith continued, for all intents and purposes, to serve as the nation’s chief executive until her husband left office in March 1921. The weakened president died three years later, on February 3, 1924.

Mild, short-lived side effects from flu shots are common, such as pain at the site of injection, soreness and fever. These side effects result from the intended immune response stimulated by the vaccine. Serious adverse reactions to flu shots are very rare and can be associated with allergic reactions to specific ingredients in the vaccine.The benefits provided by the flu vaccine largely outweigh the risks for the population. Flu vaccination is particularly important this year given the risks of coinfection by the flu and COVID-19. Reviewed content Verdict: Lacks context Claim: Flu shots lead to severe or life-threatening conditions; flu shots are unsafe Source: Facebook, Facebook users, 2020-10-01 Verdict detail Inadequate support:: Scientific evidence does not support the claim that serious or life-threatening conditions commonly occur after a flu shot. On the contrary, the flu vaccine has a strong track record of safety. See our method of evaluation Full Claim Flu shots lead to severe or life-threatening conditions; flu shots are unsafe Review Claims that the flu vaccine for the 2020 – 2021 season caused dangerous side effects started circulating on social media in early October 2020 (see here). For example, some social media users reported developing an abnormally high fever after receiving the flu shot, and others claimed that someone who received a flu vaccine nearly died. The 2020-2021 flu season starts in October in the Northern Hemisphere, and flu shots are currently being distributed. Flu vaccination is particularly important in 2020 because health systems strained from the COVID-19 pandemic might not be able to cope with an additional influx of patients experiencing flu complications. Furthermore, cases of coinfection with COVID-19 and the flu may produce worse disease outcomes in patients compared to single infections with either the flu or COVID-19[1]. Consequently, ensuring the safety of the flu vaccine is crucial to encourage the public to receive vaccines and achieve a vaccine coverage of the population in accordance with the national target of 70%. The flu vaccines currently available are licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on safety testing and clinical trials prior to release. Every year between February and March, the FDA selects influenza strains to be included in the vaccine, based on recommendations by the World Health Organization and other experts. These recommendations are based on predictions of which types of influenza virus would circulate during the flu season. Every year, the new vaccines aiming at protecting against the selected virus strains are then produced and tested for efficacy and safety before FDA approval. Given that the flu season just started in the Northern Hemisphere, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the prevalence of mild or serious adverse effects of flu shots in the general population. However, scientific evidence from previous years demonstrates a strong track record of safety for the flu vaccine, contrary to claims that flu shots are dangerous. Posts from numerous social media users reporting serious or life-threatening adverse reactions to the flu shot offer no evidence to support their claims. Instead, dangerous reactions from the flu vaccine are very rare according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Mild side effects to the flu vaccine are common and short-lived, as indicated by the CDC. The main side effects are soreness, headache, fever and muscle ache, which result from the body’s immune response stimulated by the flu vaccine. Vaccination works by using a harmless antigen such as an inactivated virus to trigger the immune system to mount an immune response against that specific virus. This immune response leads to the formation of an immunological memory that allows a faster and stronger response in the event of a subsequent encounter with the pathogenic form of the virus. In other words, some immune reaction from the body is necessary for a vaccine to effectively immunize a person. An immune response triggered by a vaccine typically involves initial inflammation resulting from the activation of the body’s defense mechanisms. Inflammation is characterized by swelling, redness, and soreness. Therefore, it is normal for the flu vaccine to induce these side effects, which are transient. For instance, clinical trials of Afluria Quadrivalent, the most commonly used flu vaccine for the 2020 – 2021 flu season, indicate that 47% of 18-64 years old patients reported pain at the site of injection and 21% reported headaches. Fever was reported by only 2% of patients. Similarly, the CDC reports that 65% of people vaccinated for the flu experienced pain at the injection site during the first week after vaccination, which usually did not interfere with the person’s typical activities. According to an article by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices from the CDC, placebo-controlled trials also found that the most common side effect was soreness at the site of injection, which lasted less than two days. In addition, a review of the safety profiles of influenza vaccines showed that mild and transient side effects, such as local pain and fever, are common[2]. Therefore, it is unsurprising to experience pain, muscle aches or even a fever in the first few days after receiving a flu vaccine. The rate of systemic symptoms is the same between people receiving a flu vaccine and people receiving a placebo. Serious adverse effects from flu shots are very rare, as they were reported in less than 1% of cases during clinical trials, according to the CDC. In some cases, these adverse reactions are due to a patient having an allergic reaction to some components of the vaccine, like the protein albumin, also known as egg white protein. This immediate hypersensitivity occurs at a rate of one per one million vaccine injections and is not a new side effect for the 2020 – 2021 flu season[3]. Although life-threatening allergic reactions to flu vaccines are possible, they are very unlikely to occur, contrary to what these claims suggest. Because common side effects to flu vaccines are mild and transient, it is safer for most people to get a flu shot than to get the flu. During the 2019 – 2020 flu season, the CDC estimated that 7.52 million illnesses, 3.69 million medical visits, 105,000 hospitalizations, and 6,300 deaths were averted due to flu vaccinations. These estimates are based on the coverage and effectiveness of flu vaccines each year. In addition to the benefit at the population level, vaccination decreases the risk of developing a severe form of the disease. The CDC reports that vaccinated people who get infected nonetheless have a lower risk of needing hospitalization compared to unvaccinated people. Similarly, a study in New Zealand demonstrated that vaccination decreased the risk of admission into intensive care units because of flu complications[4]. In summary, claims alleging that serious, life-threatening reactions to the flu shot are common during the 2020 – 2021 flu season are unsupported by scientific evidence. It is too early to draw conclusions about the effectiveness and frequency of adverse effects from the flu vaccine for the 2020 – 2021. Contrary to this claim, data from previous years indicate that mild and transient side effects from flu shots, such as soreness, are common and an indication of the body responding effectively to the vaccine. Furthermore, serious adverse events to the flu vaccine are extremely rare. Overall, the benefits of the flu vaccine greatly outweigh its risks. Considering the burden averted by flu vaccination each year and the current risk of coinfection of flu and COVID-19, the flu shot remains a safe and efficient strategy to protect the population.

College of Family Physicians, said doctors are already noticing increased interest in the flu shot in light of the pandemic."It's going to be extremely critical and essential to make sure that everyone has access to flu vaccines," Boyd told CBC.But because of COVID-19, many workplaces aren't planning their usual office clinics, and the B.C. Pharmacy Association has warned that in most cases, patients should expect to book an appointment for a shot this year rather than just walking into a drug store.At London Drugs, customers are being asked to book online, wear a mask and show up at the time of their appointment — not any earlier."We really have to try to limit the number of people in the store and try to limit their exposure in the store," pharmacy manager Gianni Del Negro said.B.C. announces 115 new COVID-19 cases, no new deathsAt her news conference Thursday, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said the vaccine "should be available in the coming weeks for everybody who wants it."Henry said planning for this flu season began in February, and extra influenza vaccine has been ordered to meet demand.

Experts say he's flat wrong. Facebook removed a similar post on Trump's page for having spread misinformation.President Donald Trump watches Marine One from the Truman Balcony at the White House on Monday.Jabin Botsford / The Washington Post via Getty Images fileOct. 6, 2020, 2:16 PM UTC / Updated Oct. 6, 2020, 7:52 PM UTCBy Rebecca ShabadWASHINGTON — In a comparison disputed by public health experts, President Donald Trump likened the coronavirus to the seasonal flu Tuesday and said Americans can learn to live with Covid-19."Flu season is coming up! Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu," tweeted Trump, who has Covid-19 and returned to the White House on Monday after three days at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. "Are we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!"The number of deaths from the flu Trump cited is misleading, and in recent years it has been far lower.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 22,000 people in the U.S. died from the flu during the last flu season from late 2019 into 2020. For the 2018-19 flu season, the CDC said, about 34,000 people died. And for the 2017-18 flu season, there were 61,000 influenza-related deaths.During the 2009-10 H1N1 flu pandemic, about 12,500 people died in the U.S., according to the CDC. There were about 100,000 deaths from the flu during the 1968 pandemic.This week, the U.S. surpassed 210,000 deaths from Covid-19, and some models have suggested that hundreds of thousands more people could die by the end of the year.Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakDoctors and public health experts rejected the president's comparison of the flu and Covid-19.Dr. Michael Saag, associate dean for global health at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, School of Medicine, said he is "horrified" at the death toll in the current pandemic."The notion of just learning to live with it is not an acceptable policy or strategy, in my opinion," said Saag, a researcher and physician who has been treating patients with HIV/AIDS since the 1980s. There was "nothing worse" in his career, he said, than "taking care of a large number of people for whom we had no treatment."It’s not the same as influenza.— Monica Maalouf, MD (@MaaloufMD) October 6, 2020 Literally wrong, as @CarlosdelRio7 and I wrote. https:/.co/JfKST5khP4 https:/.co/g5uBA17Evr— Jeremy Faust MD MS (ER physician) (@jeremyfaust) October 6, 2020 This is a lie, and a lie that will get people killed. The last time 100,000+ Americans passed away due to influenza virus was (likely) in 1968. We're already twice that with COVID-19. And we're going into the fall with 40,000+ new cases each day. https:/.co/9O9Q4QlmCA— Ryan McNamara 🧬 (@Ryan_Mac_Phd) October 6, 2020 Clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines continue, and the entire population remains largely at risk because there is no immunity to such a new virus. While influenza viruses change from year to year, "there's still a lot of cross-immunity from prior influenza viruses, as well as the fact that millions of doses of flu vaccine are given every year," said Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease and critical care specialist at the Mayo Clinic.Later Tuesday morning, Twitter shielded the president's tweet and slapped a warning label on it, saying the post "violated the Twitter Rules about spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19." The company said it would not remove the tweet because "it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible." Separately, Facebook deleted Trump's same comment on its platform.There are some similarities — but also some key differences — between the flu and Covid-19. They are contagious respiratory illnesses, they can have similar symptoms, and they can spread in similar ways, from person to person through droplets when a person talks, sneezes or coughs.The CDC, however, says that, compared to the flu, Covid-19 is more contagious among certain populations and age groups and that it has more "superspreading" events. Young healthy children, meanwhile, are at higher risk of severe illness from the flu than from Covid-19.While Trump seemed to suggest that Covid-19 can be less deadly than the flu, the CDC says on its website, "While there is still much to learn about COVID-19, at this time, it does seem as if COVID-19 is more deadly than seasonal influenza; however, it is too early to draw any conclusions from the current data."The CDC says "getting a flu vaccine is more important than ever during 2020-2021 to protect yourself and the people around you from flu, and to help reduce the strain on healthcare systems responding to the COVID-19 pandemic." The CDC says it recommends that people get the flu vaccination by the end of October. Trump did not mention the flu vaccine in his tweet.In addition, while many states shut down at the height of the pandemic earlier this year, most have reopened, while others are in the process of reopening, are pausing those plans or are reversing their timelines to reopen.Rebecca ShabadRebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.Erika Edwards contributed.AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesCA NoticeTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLCNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday LogoMany N.S. seniors still have to shell out for high-dose flu shots | CBC News ContentSkip to Main ContentAccessibility HelphamburgerMenuWhen search suggestions are available use up and down arrows to review and enter to select.SearchSearchSign InQuick LinksNewsSportsRadioMusicListen LiveTVWatchnewsTop StoriesLocalClimateWorldCanadaPoliticsIndigenousBusinessThe NationalHealthEntertainmentScienceCBC News InvestigatesGo PublicAbout CBC NewsBeing Black in CanadaMore Many N.S. seniors still have to shell out for high-dose flu shots | CBC News LoadedNova ScotiaMany N.S. seniors still have to shell out for high-dose flu shotsMany seniors in Nova Scotia looking for greater protection from the seasonal flu than a regular shot provides will continue to have to pay for it themselves.Vaccine offers greater protection but only available free to seniors in long-term care facilitiesVernon Ramesar · CBC News · Posted: Oct 10, 2020 5:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: October 10, 2020Seniors outside of long-term care homes will have to pay up to $100 to get the high-dose flu shot (Tara Walton/The Canadian Press)Social SharingMany seniors in Nova Scotia looking for greater protection from the seasonal flu than a regular shot provides will continue to have to pay for it themselves. A high-dose flu vaccine has been available for four years and offers more of an immune boost than the regular vaccine. The vaccine is manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. CBC checks indicate the retail price per dose ranges from $60 to $100 in Nova Scotia. The province is providing the vaccine to residents of long-term care facilities but other seniors will have to pay.Bill VanGorder of CARP says it's a puzzling distinction."CARP does not understand why the high-dose [vaccine] isn't available to all at-risk seniors in the entire province," he said. "P.E.I. makes it available to all their seniors. We already put it in our long-term care homes, so we know that it's effective."Bill VanGorder of CARP wants the high-dose vaccine available to all Nova Scotians over 65. (David Laughlin/CBC)He said the COVID-19 pandemic makes it all the more important for seniors to protect their immune systems. "We know that people, seniors, are in a high-risk category," he said. "If they get COVID, it's extremely dangerous to them. If they already have the regular flu … then they're going to be even in a worse position."The province says the current policy addresses the most vulnerable seniors."Residents aged 65 years and older within these facilities are at an increased risk of influenza and influenza related complications due to age, compromised health status and institutional living environment," the Department of Health and Wellness said in a statement.It said seniors who are outside care facilities can "choose to purchase the high-dose version through a healthcare provider."Diane Harpell says the Pharmacy Association of Nova Scotia would support providing the high-dose vaccine to all seniors. (PANS)Diane Harpell of the Pharmacy Association of Nova Scotia said seniors who may have to purchase the high-dose vaccine also face an availability problem because it is not part of the public supply."So, it is challenging right now to get any supply of high-dose [vaccine]," she said. "So, right now, you're running into issues … where there's not a lot of it available."She said if pharmacists had access to a public supply of the high-dose vaccine they would "absolutely be ready to provide that service to seniors."VanGorder said expecting seniors, many of whom are on a fixed income, to shoulder the expense of protecting themselves is unreasonable and unfair. "if you're on a fixed income, any amount of extra money that you have to pay is a real problem because then you have to make choices, " he said. "If you don't have the money to pay for it, then it's not available to you."Harpell said the vaccine "isn't cheap" and seniors would also have to pay an administration fee that ranges from $15 to $25. She noted the regular flu vaccine is still available for seniors who are not able to obtain or afford the high-dose flu shot. She said seniors should check with their health-care provider or pharmacist about options. Pharmacy association would back programShe said the pharmacy association would support a government-funded program to provide the high-dose vaccine to everyone over 65 who wants it. "We would absolutely be in favour of providing that," she said. "The key thing that you need to remember, and this is with supply of anything … we need to make sure that [the] supply chain is supported."VanGorder believes the province's indication that it has no immediate plans to change its current strategy is based on politics and finances and not the recommendations of health officials."This is another evidence of ageism in our province," he said.MORE TOP STORIESCBRM getting millions to move Sydney fire stationQ&AMike Savage can wear a dress, dance and sing.

JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images By Peter Chianca October 6, 2020 FacebookTwitterEmailEmail2 Fearing a “twindemic” of flu cases combined with a possible second surge of the coronavirus, Gov. Charlie Baker issued a mandate in August that requires children get an influenza vaccine in order to attend school in Massachusetts — a move that has had some parents speaking up with their concerns ever since. Demonstrators took to Beacon Hill in late August to protest the decision, and on Monday they gathered in front of the Moakley Federal Courthouse in Boston with signs declaring Baker a “tyrant” and insisting that when it comes to vaccines, it’s a situation of “My Child, My Choice.” Advertisement: “There’s no rhyme or reason why a flu shot should be mandated by the governor,” Vinnie Delaney, the organizer of the rally, told WCVB, adding that his group, known as “Flu You Baker,” plans to file a lawsuit against the governor in federal court in the coming weeks. Students must get the influenza vaccine by Dec. 31 unless they have a medical or religious exemption, the state Department of Public Health said in a statement.

James Barker In This Story Destination Guide Alaska 45 Articles 102 Places It wasn’t so long ago that Yup’ik culture, in Alaska’s subarctic Bristol Bay, revolved around dance. There were dances of greeting, dance festivals, dances that went all along the river and into communities. These days, many, if not all, of these dances have been lost to cultural memory. “We don’t do that anymore,” says Arnaq Esther Ilutsik, the director for Yup’ik Studies for the Southwest Region Schools in Dillingham, Alaska. “It’s no longer practiced, because of the big flu epidemic.” As an educator, Ilutsik has dedicated decades of her career to filling a long-standing cultural void, the one left after the so-called Spanish influenza swept across Bristol Bay in 1919, wreaking extraordinary devastation on the area and its peoples. She interviews Yup’ik elders, for instance, and transcribes and translates what she can to prevent knowledge from being lost entirely. Inevitably, holes emerge: She hears individual words she’s never heard before, she says, ”words that we don’t know, because we don’t have that high vocabulary fluency.” She jots them down, and tries to follow up where possible. “But it comes to the point where—well, we’re getting old, too.” Over the winter of 1918, as outbreak after outbreak of influenza made its way through the United States and the world, the people of Bristol Bay were protected by isolation. Home to one of the world’s most productive salmon fisheries, Bristol Bay is beautiful, wild, and extremely remote. One 1920 account, by missionary Hudson Stuck, describes a bitter climate and sometimes desolate landscape. “Yet it is not without scenes of great beauty and even sublimity, and its winter aspects have often an indescribable charm,” he writes. “A radiance of light, a delicate lustre of azure and pink, that turn jagged ice and windswept snow into marble and alabaster and crystal.” But few people outside the Native community saw this icy beauty: From September to May, the area was naturally walled off by multiple mountain ranges and the frozen Bering Sea. Bristol Bay is isolated by geography and boasts a productive salmon fishery. Design Pics Inc / Alamy As the sea ice began to thaw at the start of 1919, says Alaska historian Katie Ringsmuth, the first fishing boats of the season arrived, and people started to gather once again. “That winter, people thought [the epidemic] was over,” she says. “They had shut everything down—the school, public gatherings and churches, and all of a sudden, springtime, they thought it was okay to come back.” By the time canners arrived from San Francisco to work the salmon fishery in May, people had already begun to succumb to the virus. Accounts of how the flu arrived differ. Some sources point to a Russian Orthodox priest who held a large Easter service attended by many local people. Others suggest that the dates behind that theory don’t hold up to scrutiny, and it must have been some unknown outsider in the weeks that followed. Either way, by the third week of May, dozens had died. It would grow much worse. A salmon cannery in Nushagak, 327 miles southwest of Anchorage, ca. 1912. The Picture Art Collection / Alamy In the mid-1980s, Harold Napoleon, a respected Yup’ik elder, spent nine years in prison after killing his four-year-old son in what he described as an “alcoholic haze.” While incarcerated, Napoleon wrote a powerful treatise about what his people had endured the past century, entitled Yuuyaraq: The Way of the Human Being. Before Westerners came to Alaska, he writes, the Yup’ik were ruled by the same cultural practices and spiritual beliefs they had maintained for hundreds of years. Everything was prescribed: the relationships between individuals, the correct way to hunt and fish, every song and dance, every kayak and umiak. “When the Yup’ik walked out into the tundra or launched their kayaks into the river or the Bering Sea, they entered into the spiritual realm,” he writes. “They lived in deference to this spiritual universe, of which they were, perhaps, the weakest members.” The arrival of Western explorers, traders, and missionaries in the 19th century disrupted these practices. At first, the Yup’ik continued to live as they had always done, resisting Russian efforts at colonization, but they were susceptible to wave after wave of disease that decimated their population. By the turn of the century, outbreaks of measles, smallpox, influenza, and other diseases had reduced the Native population of southwestern Alaska by more than a quarter. These successive tragedies both traumatized survivors and undermined their cultural practices. “In their minds, they had been overcome by evil,” writes Napoleon. “Their medicines and their medicine men and women had proven useless. Everything they believed in had failed.” A yup’ik shaman exorcising evil spirits from a sick boy in Nushagak in the 1890s. Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) By 1918, the Yup’ik were a people in transition. “They still lived mainly by hunting and fishing, and sought out shamans to interpret the spirit world for them—especially when they were sick,” writes Laura Spinney in Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How It Changed the World. “But many now lived in modern houses, wore store-bought clothes and, in the Nushagak area, professed the [Russian] Orthodox faith.” That winter of 1918 and 1919, as the flu moved across the world, Linus Hiram French, a cannery doctor employed by the Alaska Packers Association (APA), had imposed a quarantine on the region, restricting travel in and out of the villages, even as the region itself was isolated by ice and geography. As the spring came, and the flu appeared to be abating elsewhere, the restrictions gradually fell away. When it arrived, there was little to slow the contagion. On May 19, an APA steamer arrived in Bristol Bay from Seattle. Aboard the ship was Shirley Baker, the federal Bureau of Fisheries’ warden, who later filed a report on what he saw. “The Government hospital was crowded with victims, and the whole hospital staff was sick with the disease,” he wrote. “The dead were lying unburied in their barabaras, and in many instances half-starved children were found in homes with the badly decomposed bodies of their elders about them.” For the next three weeks, he helped locals to bury the dead: “Many of the bodies were far gone in decomposition; ravenous dogs had been feeding upon them, and the conditions were too harrowing to narrate in this report in detail.” Toksook Bay seal hunters George Chimigak and James Charie near Nelson Island in 1980. James Barker Though millions all over the world perished due to the influenza outbreak, “more people died per capita in Alaska than anywhere in the Americas,” says Ringsmuth. Throughout the territory—Alaska did not become a state until 1959—Native communities were hammered. “Many didn’t have running water,” she says. “Culturally, people lived in very close proximity together. So you have a situation where when one person gets sick, then everybody does, and it moves through communities very quickly.” In Bristol Bay, the hospital was overwhelmed, with insufficient nurses and doctors to treat the scale of the outbreak. The sickness spread throughout the community, Ringsmuth says: “It was also the ethnic migrant workers, who worked in the canneries that were brought up. They got sick, too, and they were blamed for that, because of their race, and I think that helps us to understand the kind of racism that existed at that time.” These were essential workers, feeding the world, and many of them perished. “It’s also a story of complacency,” she says, pointing to a report made by the governor at the time. “He was furious with Congress, because Congress did not allocate enough funds to save Alaskans. Again, it was because they didn’t see Alaskans as humans, as Americans.” Though three institutions did work to rescue the sick in Bristol Bay—the Coast Guard, the Bureau of Education Territorial Hospital, and the APA—there were numerous bureaucratic and practical problems, ranging from sick team members to insufficient vessels that could make it up the river to treat the sick in remote communities. Racist attitudes, including the quasi-phrenological belief that Native blood was somehow inferior for warding off disease, sometimes interfered with caring for highly traumatized, starving children. It’s hard to know exactly how many people died due to the outbreak, though estimates of the total population loss are as high as 40 percent. In some cases, entire villages were abandoned after all the adults died, with children raised by relatives or in orphanages, without the languages or cultural practices that ought to have been their birthright. A 1919 photo taken in Dillingham, Alaska, at what is now known as Kanakanak Hospital, shows children orphaned by the epidemic. The French family via the Bristol Bay Heritage Land Trust Even a hundred years on, the 1919 influenza outbreak still feels very close, says Ilutsik. “I’m really concerned with COVID-19,” she says. “We’ve really tried to be really strong about who comes in and goes out—I myself grew up without any grandparents, because my parents’ parents both passed in the flu epidemic.” Though she spoke the language with her parents when she was a small child, Ilutsik was placed in a white foster home for three years due to a tuberculosis outbreak. When she returned to her family, at age six, she’d forgotten a great deal, and the language was further suppressed in schools and other official settings. When she had children of her own, she opted not to speak Yup’ik with them. “My daughter understands why I never spoke Yup’ik to her, because it was a forbidden language. And so you have it deep in your memory that you don’t use that language.” Her own mother eventually helped her to pick it back up, though she says she’ll never have the fluency or cultural familiarity of previous generations. “The big flu really devastated a lot of different cultural traditions and practices,” she says.

Copyright 2020 Clark James Mishler “They used to have a really strong kinship system. I grew up in a traditional home, but we didn’t really have any relatives around to reinforce different ideas and values.” When speaking to her father, a reindeer herder, she would be expected to pass questions on through her mother, even if he was sitting right there—a practice that’s long since been abandoned. “My parents, especially my mother, would always excuse me for my accent, because I didn’t know that proper way, the etiquette, the way to honor different parts of the family.” Now, as a teacher of Yup’ik Studies, Ilutsik works to educate Native youth about traditional Yup’ik ways and language, in addition to instructing new Alaskan teachers on the region’s culture and history. “I’ve had no training in language preservation or how to build a program or that kind of thing, so it’s all new to me,” she says. High school students in the area can learn Yup’ik to replace foreign language credits, in addition to taking subsistence classes to learn about traditional foodways. But it’s a challenge, especially when it comes to getting distracted teenagers to engage with their cultural heritage. Ilutsik has tried to look beyond teaching numbers and colors, and to the sharing and maintaining of the storytelling that has long been a critical part of Yup’ik culture. Here, the accounts relayed by elders are especially useful, as they paint a vivid picture of what once was. “We’re trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together,” she says.

He lamented that foreign medical equipment eventually enters the country with difficulty and sabotage of the enemy. Shanehsaz explained that the influenza vaccine was planned to hit the market this year but due to the difficulties created by the enemy it will enter the market next year. There are many problems in the supply and transfer of foreign currency needed for the imports of medicine, he added. Shanehsaz reiterated that Iran produces 97 percent of its required medicine domestically. In February, an Iranian knowledge-based company gained the technical know-how to synthesize and mass-produce a flu vaccine after 10 years. Officials say the homegrown flu vaccine is comparable in quality to the foreign ones, will be available at much lower costs, and has been fully produced with Iranian raw materials. According to Iranian health officials, the country has achieved significant capabilities in producing medicine, its formulation, pharmaceutical knowledge, and even the supply of domestic raw materials.

WorldNo, Getting The Flu Vaccine Does Not Lead To COVID-19The chart provided as evidence is from a study which did not find that the flu shot is spreading the deadly virus.By - AFP | 9 Oct 2020 5:28 PM IST Follow Us Instagram posts claim that the influenza vaccine will give patients the coronavirus. This is false; the chart provided as evidence is from a study which did not find that the flu shot is spreading the deadly virus, and Immunize Canada and the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) said larger, multiseason studies found no evidence that the vaccine increases coronavirus risk. "You can get coronavirus from getting the flu vaccine. It's right here in the package insert for the flu vaccine under side effects," claimed an Instagram post from late September 2020 that is no longer available. Screenshot of an Instagram post taken on October 1, 2020 Also Read: Post On Bacteria From Face Masks Viral With Misleading ClaimThe post included a screenshot of the private Instagram account @silent.saint, which AFP confirmed has since removed the post. Another screenshot of the post was also reshared on Instagram here. While the posts claim that the chart is from a vaccine "package insert," a keyword search reveals that the chart comes from this 2012 study, conducted years before the novel coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 1,057,000 people worldwide. Screenshot of Google search results, taken on October 6, 2020 The study did not find flu shots give people coronavirus. Rather, it found that in a small group of children who received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine there was "a statistically significant" increased risk of respiratory virus infection, including coronavirus -- a family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. However, Brian Ward, professor in the McGill University Department of Medicine, called the study "very weak," pointing to the small sample size of 115 children. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention discusses this study on a web page addressing misconceptions about the flu shot saying: "No other studies have found this effect. It's not clear why this finding was detected in the one study, but the majority of evidence suggests that this is not a common or regular occurrence and that flu vaccination does not, in fact, make people more susceptible to other respiratory infections." Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford's Nuffield Department of Medicine, also said in an email that based on this study alone, "no one should make decisions to avoid flu vaccinations." AFP fact check previously investigated false claims made using this study here. Also Read: No, Africa Is Not Being Used As A Guniea Pig To Test the COVID-19 VaccineFlu shot and coronavirus risk Danuta Skowronski, the principal investigator at the BCCDC agreed. Her team published a study in May 2020 that looked at thousands of people over multiple flu seasons in Canada. Skowronski said an important contrast with the 2012 study was that the Canadian research relied on a more strict definition of flu symptoms. She told AFP by phone, "We saw no association in children nor in adults between the receipt of influenza vaccine and coronavirus risk." Similarly, a 2013 study conducted in the US state of Wisconsin over six flu seasons and including more than 3,000 patients found: "Influenza vaccination was not associated with detection of noninfluenza respiratory viruses." Although the BCCDC research did not specifically assess risk of the novel coronavirus, Lucie Marisa Bucci, Senior Manager of Immunize Canada said in an email: "According to Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), there is no current evidence to support the claim that the influenza vaccine increases the risk of Covid-19 infection." Public health officials across Canada strongly encourage the flu vaccine to prevent serious illness and ensure the health care system is not overburdened during the ongoing pandemic. The flu shot is a regular target of disinformation. AFP Fact Check has also debunked the false claim that the influenza vaccine contains coronaviruses and the false claim that receiving a flu shot will make you test positive for Covid-19.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by BOOM staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)TagsFluInfluenzaFlu ShotInfluenza VaccineCOVID-19Coronavirus PandemicCoronavirus OutbreakCoronavirus CureCoronavirus VaccineRead Full ArticleClaim : Influenza vaccine will give patients the coronavirus.Claimed By : Posts on InstagramFact Check : False Next Story Our website is made possible by displaying online advertisements to our visitors.

Toronto: Seasonal influenza vaccine development and mass production may lead to future efforts targeted at developing and evaluating vaccine strategies for Covid-19 say, researchers. In the study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, the research team evaluated whether existing flu trial networks could offer primary and secondary prevention strategies for patients with cardiovascular disease at risk of complications from Covid-19. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that influenza kills as many as 6,50,000 people every year globally, citing influenza as a top 10 leading cause of death among people of all ages, especially those with one or more comorbidities like cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, seasonal influenza epidemics have been associated with population-level increases in cardiovascular hospitalisation and mortality. For these reasons, clinical guidelines recommend the general population receive their flu vaccination annually to reduce the risk of influenza-like illness, with high-risk individuals the most urged to get vaccinated. Research has shown that viral respiratory infections such as seasonal influenza and Covid-19 are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Patients with cardiovascular disease are also at a higher risk of complications following viral respiratory infections, including increased morbidity, mortality and health care utilization. Current data suggests influenza infection and the novel coronavirus share similar symptoms at the outset, primarily fever, cough and shortness of breath. However, Covid-19 appears to be more contagious than the flu. "Although Covid-19 and other respiratory virus infections are associated with acute myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular events, influenza has the best evidence of a safe vaccine option for cardiovascular risk reduction to date," said study author Jacob A. Udell from the University of Toronto in Canada. Several observational and small, randomized studies have suggested that influenza vaccination may serve as a preventative measure against adverse cardiovascular outcomes. However, despite international guidelines recommending routine influenza and pneumococcal vaccination for patients with cardiovascular disease, uptake is substantially lacking and often deprioritised, including at the time of cardiovascular hospitalisation. There are currently three international cardiovascular outcome trials examining the cardioprotective effects of different influenza vaccine formulations, according to the team. "Three large ongoing influenza vaccine cardiovascular outcome trials have an opportunity to contribute further to our understanding of the underlying comorbidities in these patients that may be driving morbidity and mortality associated with Covid-19 infection," Udell said. "While developing new vaccines, we will also definitively learn soon whether influenza vaccination is an effective, low-cost, widely available therapy that reduces cardiovascular risk, which may further help prevent fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular complications of Covid-19," Udell noted.Show Full ArticleEmail ArticlePrint ArticleMore OnWorld Health OrganisationAmerican College of CardiologyInfluenza vaccineNext StoryMore Stories ADVERTISEMENT Just InMost ReadVideosADVERTISEMENTS NewsHomeContact UsAbout UsE-PaperCompanyAdvertise With usTerms & Conditions Subscriber Terms of Use Privacy PolicyDisclaimerSitemapEntertainmentCinemaSportsEditor'S DeskCrimeLife StyleTechAll NewsAPTelanganaNationWorldBusinessThe HANS© 2024 Hyderabad Media House Limited/The Hans India.
