ICD-10-CM codes included U07.1, COVID-19 and J12.82 (pneumonia due to coronavirus disease 2019). SNOMED CT codes included 840539006 (disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 [disorder]), 840544004 (suspected disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 [situation]), and 840533007 (SARS-CoV-2 [organism]). † Influenza visits were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), ICD-10-CM, and SNOMED CT diagnosis codes. ICD-9-CM codes included those beginning with 487 (influenza) and 488.01, 488.09, 488.11, 488.19, 488.81, and 488.89 (influenza due to certain identified influenza viruses with pneumonia and other manifestations). ICD-10-CM codes included those that start with J09 (influenza due to certain identified influenza viruses), J10 (influenza due to other identified influenza virus), and J11 (influenza due to unidentified influenza virus). SNOMED CT codes included 442696006 (influenza caused by influenza A virus subtype H1N1 [disorder]); 442438000 (influenza caused by influenza A virus [disorder]), 24662006 (influenza caused by influenza B virus [disorder]), 6142004 (influenza [disorder]), and 195878008 (pneumonia and influenza [disorder]). § Data include ED visits from 71% of U.S. facilities in all states except Hawaii; some states have a higher proportion of facilities sending data than others. Data are presented as ED visits for influenza or COVID-19 as the weekly percentage of all ED visits during June–March for a given year. TopIn late June 2020, the percentage of ED visits for COVID-19 increased and reached a peak of 2.8% of all ED visits in early July before declining through August. This decline was followed by a larger and more prolonged increase beginning in September 2020 that reached a peak (7.2%) in early January 2021. Influenza activity generally begins in October with increased activity throughout the winter months. By the beginning of February 2018, the percentage of ED visits for influenza reached 3.1%, and by the beginning of February 2019, reached 5.0%. During June 2020–March 2021, ED visits for influenza accounted for less than 0.1% of all visits.

The vaccine nanoparticle, designed by Jeffrey Boyington (VRC), is a hybrid of a protein scaffold (blue) and eight influenza hemagglutinin proteins arrayed on the surface (yellow). The hemagglutinin protein waNIAID What The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, has established a network of research sites to study the natural history, transmission and pathogenesis of influenza and provide an international research infrastructure to address influenza outbreaks. The program, called the Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response (CEIRR), is expected to be supported for seven years by NIAID contracts to five institutions. Funding for the first year of the contracts will total approximately $24 million. CEIRR will replace the Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance (CEIRS) program, which was supported by contracts that concluded on March 31, 2021. The CEIRR sites will conduct studies in the United States and internationally that follow cohorts of people to evaluate influenza-related research areas, such as understanding immune responses to vaccination and infection and identifying which immunological factors can determine influenza disease severity. They also will undertake projects on influenza surveillance, including transmission of influenza viruses from animals to humans (zoonotic transmission) to better understand how influenza viruses evolve, adapt and transmit. The sites will prepare studies that could be rapidly launched as part of emergency research responses to outbreaks of influenza and other emerging viral pathogens. Although CEIRR is primarily focused on influenza, the network also will study SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and other emerging viruses of pandemic potential.

Increased risk of NT1 has been reported among children or adolescents vaccinated with AS03 adjuvant-supplemented pandemic H1N1 influenza A vaccine, Pandemrix. Here we show that pediatric Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients have enhanced T-cell immunity against the viral epitopes, neuraminidase 175–189 (NA175–189) and nucleoprotein 214–228 (NP214–228), but also respond to a NA175–189-mimic, brain self-epitope, protein-O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1675–689). A pathogenic role of influenza virus-specific T-cells and T-cell cross-reactivity in NT1 are supported by the up-regulation of IFN-γ, perforin 1 and granzyme B, and by the converging selection of T-cell receptor TRAV10/TRAJ17 and TRAV10/TRAJ24 clonotypes, in response to stimulation either with peptide NA175–189 or POMT1675–689. Moreover, anti-POMT1 serum autoantibodies are increased in Pandemrix-vaccinated children or adolescents. These results thus identify POMT1 as a potential autoantigen recognized by T- and B-cells in NT1. Similar content being viewed by others A/H1N1 hemagglutinin antibodies show comparable affinity in vaccine-related Narcolepsy type 1 and control and are unlikely to contribute to pathogenesis Article Open access 18 February 2021 Vaccination and immunotherapies in neuroimmunological diseases Article 06 April 2022 Protective effect of TCR-mediated MAIT cell activation during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis Article Open access 28 October 2024 IntroductionNarcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is a rare, chronic brain disorder, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy and disturbed nocturnal sleep1,2,3. An exceptionally high association of NT1 with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II allele DQB1*0602, and polymorphisms in the genes encoding the T-cell receptor (TCR) α-chain (TRA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) promoter, TNF receptor 2 and P2Y11 receptor, strongly suggest an immunological origin of the disease4,5,6,7,8. In particular, T-cell mediated mechanisms leading to impaired hypocretin (HCRT) signaling have been implicated in the development of NT14,9,10,11. Increased risk of NT1 has been reported from several European countries, among children and adolescents vaccinated during 2009/10 with the AS03 adjuvant-supplemented pandemic H1N1 influenza A vaccine (Pandemrix®)12,13,14,15. We previously reported that Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients showed enhanced antibody responses to influenza A virus proteins present in Pandemrix vaccine16. This suggested that vaccinees who later developed NT1 may also have mounted aberrant T-cell responses to Pandemrix. Further, we hypothesized that CD4+ T-cells primed by influenza A (H1N1) virus peptides cross-react with CNS autoantigens, and orchestrate an immune-mediated attack on the hypocretin neuronal network in NT1.Here we demonstrate enhanced T helper 1 (Th1)-cell/cytotoxic T-cell responses in Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients against distinct viral NA and NP peptide epitopes. Patient-derived T-cells also respond against a self-epitope in brain-expressed protein-O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1), that represents a peptide mimic of a T-cell epitope of NA strongly recognized in patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression profiles are closely matched, and TCR repertoire analyses detect upregulation of identical clonotypes in response to either NA or POMT1 peptide stimulation, thus supporting molecular mimicry and a pathogenic role of virus-directed, autoreactive T-cell clonotypes in NT1. Finally, vaccinees have increased antibody levels against human POMT1, suggesting that Pandemrix vaccination triggers POMT1 autoimmunity. These findings provide a link between influenza A (H1N1) virus-directed T-cell immunity and the development of autoimmunity in NT1.ResultsInfluenza A H1N1 virus T-cell epitope screen in Pandemrix-vaccinated HLA-DQ6.2 transgenic mice, and HLA-DQB1*0602 positive individualsTo map influenza A (H1N1) T-cell epitopes in Pandemrix-associated NT1, 15-mer peptides covering hemagglutinin (HA), NA, and NP of influenza (Aeassortant/NYMC X-179A (California/07/2009 × NYMC X-157)(H1N1)) vaccine virus with 12 amino acid overlap were produced. The experimental design for T-cell epitope discovery is illustrated in Fig. 1. First, we screened T-cell responses to peptide pools (Supplementary Data 1) using spleen cells from Pandemrix-vaccinated HLA-DQ6.2 transgenic mice17. Upregulation of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and/or interleukin-2 (IL-2) mRNA (RT-qPCR) or protein (fluorescent multiplex bead-based immunoassay, FMIA) were used as read-out (Fig. 2a–c). As the second step, T-cell reactivity to single peptides from pools stimulating IFN-γ or IL-2 upregulation was tested in spleen cells from Pandemrix-vaccinated HLA-DQ6.2 mice (Supplementary Fig. 1A–C) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBC) from Pandemrix-vaccinated HLA-DQB1*0602 positive individuals (sleep clinic control patients without a diagnosis of NT1; Fig. 2d–f; Supplementary Table 1). Single T-cell peptides from HA, NA or NP that stimulated IFN-γ upregulation either in mice, or in HLA-DQB1*0602 positive individuals, were identified as antigens for subsequent T-cell assays comparing NT1 patients and controls (Supplementary Table 2).Fig. 1: Overall experimental study design for T-cell epitope discovery in Pandemrix-associated NT1.As a first step, influenza A (H1N1) virus HA, NA, and NP peptide T cell recognition was tested with spleen cells from Pandemrix-vaccinated HLA-DQ6.2 mice, restimulated with pools of 5 peptides each (15-mers). Pools that stimulated IFN-γ or IL-2 expression were broken up, and single peptides tested either with spleen cells from additional Pandemrix-vaccinated HLA-DQ6.2 mice, or PBMC from Pandemrix-vaccinated HLA-DQB1*0602 positive individuals. As a second step, recognition of single peptides was then tested with PBMC from pediatric Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients, and healthy Pandemrix-vaccinated controls. As a third step, influenza A (H1N1) T cell peptides that showed increased stimulation of IFN-γ or IL-2 secretion in patients vs. controls were validated and mapped. Cross-reactive T cell self-epitopes were predicted by BLAST against human proteome, and recognition tested with PBMC from pediatric Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients, and healthy Pandemrix-vaccinated controls.Full size imageFig. 2: Influenza A H1N1 virus T-cell epitope screen in HLA-DQ6.2 mice, and Pandemrix-vaccinated HLA-DQB1*0602 positive individuals.Spleen cells from Pandemrix-immunized HLA-DQ6.2 mice were stimulated in culture with pools of five overlapping 15-mer peptides each, covering a hemagglutinin (HA), b neuraminidase (NA) or c nucleoprotein (NP) from influenza (Aeassortant/NYMC X-179A (California/07/2009 × NYMC X-157)(H1N1)) vaccine virus used in Pandemrix (pooling cells from 2 × 2 mice, n = 2). Recombinant hemagglutinin (rHA) and nucleoprotein (rNP; A/Puerto Rico/8/34 corresponding to the Pandemrix vaccine strain) were used as positive controls. d–f PBMC from Pandemrix-vaccinated HLA-DQB1*0602 positive individuals (sleep clinic patients without a diagnosis of NT1) were stimulated in culture with single 15-mer peptides, derived from the same vaccine virus strain (n = 1–2). The expression of IFN-γ or IL-2 was measured by FMIA (protein) or RT-qPCR (mRNA). Results are expressed as ratios between cytokine concentrations (lines representing means) or relative gene expressions (dots representing single values, bars representing means) measured in peptide-stimulated and negative control samples (stimulation index). An asterisk (*) indicates a pool or single peptide that was selected for further testing.Full size imageIdentification of influenza A H1N1 virus T-cell epitopes in Pandemrix-associated NT1 patientsTo dissect the influenza A (H1N1)-directed T-cell immunity, PBMC from a discovery cohort of well-characterized Finnish pediatric cases of Pandemrix-associated NT1, and from healthy age-matched, Pandemrix-vaccinated control children (Table 1, Supplementary Tables 3A, B), were stimulated with a panel of pre-selected 15-mer peptides from HA, NA or NP (Supplementary Table 2). Interestingly, two viral T-cell epitopes were differentially recognized and induced high IFN-γ and IL-2 responses in Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients in comparison to healthy vaccinees. These epitopes were AWSASACHDGINWLT (NA178–192) and KTRIAYERMCNILKGKFQ (NP214–231). Epitopes AFAMERNAGSGIIIS (HA271–285) and MERNAGSGIIISDTP (HA274–288), previously associated with NT118, were also recognized, but the IFN-γ and IL-2 responses were relatively low, and no significant differences between patients and healthy vaccinees were observed (Fig. 3a–f, Supplementary Fig. 2A–F)Table 1 Clinical information on PBMC and plasma sample donors.Full size tableFig. 3: Identification of influenza A H1N1 virus T-cell epitopes in Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients.PBMC from pediatric Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients (NT1) or pediatric Pandemrix-vaccinated healthy controls (C) were stimulated in culture with single 15-mer peptides from influenza (Aeassortant/NYMC X-179A (California/07/2009 × NYMC X-157)(H1N1)) vaccine virus hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) or nucleoprotein (NP) (discovery cohort). Recombinant neuraminidase (rNA) and nucleoprotein (rNP) were used as positive controls. The secretion of IFN-γ (a, c, e) or IL-2 (b, d, f) was measured by FMIA (protein). Results are expressed as the ratio between cytokine concentrations measured in peptide-stimulated and negative control samples (stimulation index). Statistical comparisons between groups were performed, using Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests.Full size imageNext, the AWSASACHDGINWLT (NA178–192) and KTRIAYERMCNILKG (NP214–228) epitopes were mapped in a validation cohort of Finnish pediatric Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients, and from healthy age-matched, Pandemrix-vaccinated controls (Table 1, Supplementary Tables 3A, B). Stimulations with overlapping 15-mer peptides in T-cell assays showed that AWSASACHDGIN (NA178–189) and IAYERMCNILKG (NP217–228) are T-cell core epitopes (Fig. 4a, d, Supplementary Fig. 3A, D). Interestingly, the AWSASACHDGIN (NA178–189) epitope includes WSASACHD (NA179–186), an influenza A (H1N1) B-cell epitope, predicted by phage display-mimotope variation analysis to react with sera from Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients19.Fig. 4: Mapping of identified influenza A H1N1 virus T-cell epitopes in Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients.a, d PBMC from pediatric Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients (NT1; validation cohort) or pediatric Pandemrix-vaccinated healthy controls (C) were stimulated in culture with overlapping 15-mer peptides from influenza (Aeassortant/NYMC X-179A (California/07/2009 × NYMC X-157)(H1N1)) vaccine virus neuraminidase (NA) or nucleoprotein (NP), as indicated. b, c, e, f PBMC from NT1 patients (invariably HLA-DQB1*0602 positive; discovery and validation cohorts combined; HLA-DQB1*0602 homozygous NT1 patients marked with red dots) or HLA-DQB1*0602 positive (C/DQ6+) or negative (C/DQ6−) healthy controls were stimulated with single NA- or NP-derived peptides. The secretion of IFN-γ was measured by FMIA (protein). Results are expressed as the ratio between cytokine concentrations measured in peptide-stimulated and negative control samples (stimulation index). Statistical comparisons between groups were performed, using Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests.Full size imageDifferential T-cell responses to influenza A H1N1 epitopes in NT1 patients and HLA-DQB1*0602 positive or negative healthy vaccineesT cell responses to the epitopes NA175–189, NA178–192, and NP214–228 were stronger in NT1 patients than in either HLA-DQB1*0602 positive or negative controls (combination of NT1 patient discovery and validation cohorts; Fig. 4b, c, e, Supplementary Fig. 3B, C, E). Homozygosity for HLA-DQB1*0602 did not appear to augment responses to these T-cell peptides beyond the levels reached in HLA-DQB1*0602 heterozygous NT1 patients. In contrast, T-cell responses against HA271–285 and HA274–288 were not increased in NT1 patients in comparison to controls, while responses against NP217–231 were significantly enhanced in NT1 patients only when compared to HLA-DQB1*0602 negative, but not positive controls (Supplementary Fig. 4A–D, Fig. 4f, Supplementary Fig. 3F). The results indicated that NT1 patients mounted unusually strong T-cell responses against NA175–192 and NP214–228 viral epitopes in response to Pandemrix vaccination, and that this was not simply a result of restriction by HLA molecules present on the DRB1*1501-DRB5*0101-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602 haplotype. These findings were consistent with our previous report of enhanced antibody responses in NT1 patients against viral proteins from Pandemrix, also in comparison to healthy vaccinees carrying the HLA-DQB1*0602 allele16.Search for human protein sequences with homology to identified influenza A H1N1 T-cell epitopes from NA and NPTo identify possible cross-reactive self-epitopes, we performed basic local alignment of 12-mer peptides against human proteome (blastp). Sequence similarity searches for IAYERMCNILKG (NP217–228) and ESVAWSASACHD (NA175–186) produced top hits for syntrophin gamma-1 (YEIMCKILK, SNTG1338–346; E-value 2.0, 75% query cover, 78% identity) and protein-O-mannosyltransferase 1 (VAWYSSACH, POMT1681-689; E-value 0.083, 75% query cover, 78% identity). Both proteins are known to be expressed in the human brain.Discovery of a putative influenza A H1N1 virus cross-reactive T-cell self-epitope in Pandemrix-associated NT1 patientsTo test immunological cross-reactivity, we performed T-cell assays with overlapping 15-mer peptides covering the two possible self-epitopes identified by blastp in SNTG1 and POMT1 (Supplementary Table 2). Interestingly, increased IFN-γ responses to peptide IFSALVVAWYSSACH (POMT1675–689) were demonstrated in NT1 patients (p < 0.01, Fig. 5a; Supplementary Fig. 5A). This suggested that POMT1 could represent an autoantigen in NT1. As seen for T-cell responses to peptide NA175–189, homozygosity for HLA-DQB1*0602 did not appear to augment responses to POMT1675–689 beyond the levels reached in HLA-DQB1*0602 heterozygous NT1 patients. In contrast, peptide RAEKTFSVYEIMCKI (SNTG1330–344) was recognized only by one NT1 patient, and by vaccinated controls (n.s., Fig. 5b; Supplementary Fig. 5B).Fig. 5: Autoreactive T-cells in Pandemrix-associated NT1.a, b PBMC from pediatric Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients (NT1) or pediatric Pandemrix-vaccinated healthy controls (C) were stimulated in culture with overlapping 15-mer peptides derived from human protein-O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1) or syntrophin gamma-1 (SNTG1), as indicated. The secretion of IFN-γ was measured by FMIA (protein). HLA-DQB1*0602 homozygous NT1 patients are marked with red dots. Results are expressed as the ratio between cytokine concentrations measured in peptide-stimulated and negative control samples (stimulation index). Statistical comparisons between groups were performed, using Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests.Full size imageIFN-γ responses to peptide NA175–189 and POMT1675–689, or NA178–192 and POMT1675–689, showed correlation, further suggesting cross-reactivity of specific, virus-directed T-cells with this self-epitope in NT1 (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients rs = 0.511 and rs = 0.778, respectively (p = 0.078; **p = 0.007)).Transcriptomic analyses of PBMC stimulated with influenza A H1N1 NA175–189 or human POMT1675–689 indicate activation of T helper 1-cell and cytotoxic T-cell responses with cross-reactivity in Pandemrix-associated NT1To further characterize T-cell responses against the epitopes from influenza A (H1N1) virus NA and human POMT1, and to identify putative pathogenic pathways in NT1, we studied the gene expression levels of viral NA175–189- or human POMT1675–689-stimulated PBMC from Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients and Pandemrix-vaccinated healthy controls. In RNA sequencing, stimulation induced a clear response in NT1 patients versus healthy controls. Altogether 74 genes were differentially expressed, either in response to NA175–189 (49 genes), or POMT1675–689 (28 genes; overlap of 3 genes, **p < 0.01; Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. 6, Supplementary Data 2). The results further demonstrated that the gene expression profiles of PBMC from NT1 patients responding to these two peptides were closely matched (Fig. 6), and that no genes were differentially expressed in PBMC from NT1 patients stimulated with either one of the peptides (p-level < 0.05). These findings confirmed the correlation analyses for IFN-g responses, and supported T-cell cross-reactivity between NA and POMT1. The list of 74 differentially expressed genes contained several genes closely associated with cytotoxic T-cell function, e.g., IFN-γ, chemokines/chemokine ligands known to be associated with IFN-γ, perforin 1, and granzyme B. A focused view onto T-cell effector molecules also showed that T-cells from individual NT1 patients responded similarly to stimulation either with viral NA175–189 or human POMT1675–689, consistent with cross-reactivity of specific, influenza A (H1N1) virus-directed T-cells with the autoantigen POMT1 in NT1 (Fig. 7). This was exemplified most clearly by two strong responders, NT1 patients P003 and P015 (Figs. 6, 7), both characterized clinically by rapid onset of disease with the development of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy within 4 weeks from vaccination with Pandemrix.Fig. 6: Gene expression profiling by RNA-seq of peptide-stimulated PBMC from Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients.Hierarchically clustered heatmap of the gene expression levels (z-score scaling generated with the Heatmapper program) in all tested PBMC samples for 74 genes showing significant differences in expression (**p < 0.01) between NT1 patients and controls either after stimulation with NA175–189 (49 genes) or POMT1675–689 peptides (28 genes; overlap of 3). Differentially expressed genes were identified using edgeR, based on a test analogous to Fisher’s exact test. The paired method was used for comparisons, calculating 2-sided p-values and adjusting for multiple testing using BH correction. If significance was reached (*p < 0.05), log2 fold changes between NT1 patients and controls are shown on the right. Data derived from FACS-sorted CD4+ and CD8+ cells available from one NT1 patient were added for comparison.Full size imageFig. 7: T cell-related genes differentially expressed in peptide-stimulated PBMC from Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients (RNA-seq).Dot plots demonstrating the expression levels (normalized read counts) of nine T cell-related genes showing significant differences in expression (**p < 0.01) between NT1 patients and controls either after stimulation with NA175–189 or POMT1675-689 peptides (compare Fig. 6). Differentially expressed genes were identified using edgeR, based on a test analogous to Fisher’s exact test. The paired method was used for comparisons, calculating 2-sided p-values and adjusting for multiple testing using BH correction. The lines indicate paired data of two strong responders, NT1 patients P003 and P015.Full size imageIn addition, RNA sequencing of FACS-sorted, NA175–189-stimulated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations from a single pediatric, Pandemrix-associated NT1 patient (P003) revealed upregulation of IFN-γ, perforin 1, granzyme B, chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 4, and chemokine (C motif) ligand in CD8+ T-cells, while the gene expression profile of CD4+ T-cells from the same patient was characterized mainly by IFN-γ (Fig. 6; FACS gating and sort strategy shown in Supplementary Fig. 7). Overall, gene expression in the NA175–189-stimulated CD8+ T-cell sample matched the profile obtained from NA175–189-stimulated PBMC, suggesting that peptide NA175–189 might be presented by both HLA class I and II. This finding was also consistent with the notion that cytotoxic T-cells are a key effector cell population mediating immunity against influenza A virus20.T-cell receptor sequencing demonstrates converging selection of influenza A H1N1 NA175–189- and human POMT1675–689-reactive clonotypes in Pandemrix-associated NT1To characterize T-cell responses against the putative cross-reactive epitopes at the clonal level, we sequenced TCR α-chains (TRA) and β-chains (TRB) from RNA of viral NA175–189- or human POMT1675–689-stimulated PBMC from Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients and Pandemrix-vaccinated healthy controls. TRA variable (TRAV), TRA joining (TRAJ), TRB variable (TRBV), TRB diversity (TRBD), and TRB joining (TRBJ) gene segment usage did not differ significantly between peptide-stimulated and medium control samples, neither in patients nor controls (Supplementary Data 3). We identified TRA clonotypes that were upregulated in ≥3 NT1 patient samples, stimulated either with NA175–189 or POMT1675–689 peptides (Fig. 8). Among these public TRA clonotypes, six clonotypes significantly increased in abundance both when stimulated with NA175–189, or POMT1675–689 (proportion of false positives <0.05), further supporting T-cell cross-reactivity. Most strikingly, clonotypes CVVSAIKAAGNKLTF-TRAV10/TRAJ17 and CVVSAMTTDSWGKFQF-TRAV10/TRAJ24 were upregulated in 3 of 8 (3 of 8) NA175–189-stimulated, and 5 of 10 (4 of 10) POMT1675–689-stimulated samples. In NT1 patients P003 and P015, characterized by T helper 1 (Th1)-cell/cytotoxic T-cell gene expression signatures in response to stimulation with NA175–189 or POMT1675–689, both clonotypes were upregulated in response to either of the two peptides. Three additional clonotypes were found, significantly more abundant after stimulation with at least one of the two peptides, and with high similarity to either of the two clonotypes above: CVVITIKAAGNKLTF-TRAV10/TRAJ17, significantly upregulated in POMT1675–689-stimulated samples, including P003; CVVSGMTTDSWGKLQF-TRAV10/TRAJ24, upregulated in NA175–189-stimulated samples, including P015; and CVVSGMTTDSWGKFQF-TRAV10/TRAJ24, upregulated in both NA175–189- and POMT1675–689-stimulated samples, including both P003 and P015. These results demonstrated converging selection of NA175–189- and/or POMT1675–689-reactive T-cell clones using TRAV10/TRAJ17 or TRAV10/TRAJ24 gene segments in Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients.Fig. 8: TCR α chain sequencing of peptide-stimulated PBMCs from Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients.TCR α chains (TRA) were sequenced from the same RNA samples as used for RNA sequencing. P: patient; HC: healthy control. Displayed are TRA clonotypes that were upregulated in ≥3 NT1 patient samples, based on fold changes between peptide- (NA175–189- or POMT1675–689-) treated and medium control samples from the same participant in data normalized by downsampling (heatmap). Statistical significance on the group level (NT1 patients only; Rank products test; proportion of false positives <0.05) is indicated on the left side bar.Full size imageA complete list of both public and private clonotypes using TRAV10/TRAJ17 and TRAV10/TRAJ24, identified in NT1 patients or healthy controls, is provided in Fig. 9a, b. The results demonstrate that in addition to the identified public clonotypes using TRAV10/TRAJ17 (CVVSAIKAAGNKLTF, CVVITIKAAGNKLTF) and TRAV10/TRAJ24 (CVVSAMTTDSWGKFQF, CVVSGMTTDSWGKLQF, CVVSGMTTDSWGKFQF), several highly similar clonotypes were present in peptide-stimulated samples from various NT1 patients, including CVVSMIKAAGNKLTF-TRAV10/TRAJ17, CVVSSMTTDSWGKFQF-TRAV10/TRAJ24, CVVTVMTTDSWGKFQF-TRAV10/TRAJ24, and CVVSSLTTDSWGKFQF-TRAV10/TRAJ24. The identified public clonotypes were not exclusive to NT1 patients, but occasionally seen in healthy controls, too. In particular, the HLA-DQB1*0602-negative healthy control HC27 shared several of the clonotypes upregulated in NT1 patient samples stimulated with NA175-189 or POMT1675-689. However, in contrast to NT1 patients, HC27 did not show an increase in expression of inflammatory cytokines/ chemokines in response to peptide stimulation (compare Fig. 4a, b; 5a; 7). Therefore, these TRAV10–TRAJ17 and TRAV10–TRAJ24 clonotypes might have contributed to an inflammatory reaction in NT1 patients, but their functional phenotype could be effectively regulated when present in healthy controls.Fig. 9: T cell clones using TRAV10–TRAJ17 and TRAV10–TRAJ24 gene segments.TCR α chains (TRA) were sequenced from the same RNA samples as used for RNA sequencing (compare Fig. 8). P: patient; HC: healthy control. Heatmaps present clone fractions, i.e. the proportions of clones using TRAV10–TRAJ17 (a) and TRAV10–TRAJ24 (b) of all clones in total data. Clones are clustered based on CDR3 sequence.Full size imageApplying the same search criteria as used for TRA, we also identified a smaller number of TRB clonotypes that were upregulated in ≥3 NT1 patient samples, stimulated either with NA175–189 or POMT1675–689 peptides (Supplementary Fig. 8). Among these public TRB clonotypes, again one clonotype significantly increased in abundance in both NA175–189- or POMT1675–689-stimulated patient samples, further supporting T-cell cross-reactivity. This clonotype was CASSEAGQGAYEQYF-TRBV6-1/TRBJ2–7 (upregulated in P003, P015, and P023).Discovery of POMT1 autoantibodies in Pandemrix-vaccinated childrenFinally, we studied levels of plasma antibodies to POMT1 by radioimmunoassay (RIA), a sensitive and specific liquid-phase method for the detection of autoantibodies recognizing conformational epitopes21. Autoantibodies to POMT1 were increased in Pandemrix-vaccinated children (both in NT1 patients and healthy controls) in comparison to unvaccinated control children, suggesting that Pandemrix induced autoimmunity to POMT1 (****p < 0.0001, Fig. 10; Table 1).Fig. 10: Autoantibodies in Pandemrix-associated NT1.Plasma from pediatric Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients (NT1) or pediatric Pandemrix-vaccinated or unvaccinated healthy controls were analyzed by POMT1 radioimmunoassay. Radioactivity is expressed in relative units (RU). The medians (line in box), 75 and 25% quartiles (upper and lower box boundaries) and maxima/minima (upper and lower whiskers) of each group are displayed. Statistical comparisons between groups were performed, using Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests.Full size imageDiscussionGenetic studies strongly implicate HLA-DQ6.2-restricted CD4+ T-cells in the pathogenesis of NT14,5. A central role for CD4+ T-cells is seen in many autoimmune disorders, e.g., in celiac disease and type 1 diabetes. Both disorders show exceptionally strong HLA class II associations22, to be surpassed still in NT1. HLA class II-associated autoimmune diseases are considered antigen driven (e.g., by wheat gliadin in celiac disease), although tissue pathology is not mediated by CD4+ T-cells only. Other immune cells are involved in tissue destruction, and antigen spreading leads to broad autoimmunity. In Pandemrix-associated NT1, we hypothesized that CD4+ T-cells primed by influenza A (H1N1) virus epitopes are disease drivers, cross-react with CNS autoantigens, and orchestrate an immune-mediated attack against the hypocretin neuronal network. Therefore, we focused our study on influenza A (H1N1) T-cell epitopes that are recognized in the context of HLA-DQ6.2, although HLA-DQ6.2 peptide binding was not directly tested. Due to limitations in the availability of blood samples from pediatric, Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients, we started to search for dominant T-cell epitopes using Pandemrix-primed mice that expressed HLA-DQ6.2 as the only MHC class II allele, and Pandemrix-vaccinated, HLA-DQB1*0602-positive individuals. Choosing this strategy, the selected T-cell peptides were enriched for HLA-DQ6.2-binding, but likely included both MHC class II- and/or class I-binding peptides.We found that T-cell responses against two NA- and NP-derived epitopes were enhanced in children and adolescents with Pandemrix-associated NT1 in comparison to Pandemrix-vaccinated controls. Further, our study provided evidence for influenza A (H1N1) virus-directed T- and B-cell cross-reactivity with human POMT1. Homology of a viral NA peptide sequence and a human POMT1 sequence was suggested by basic local alignment. We could show that IFN-γ secretion in response to NA175–189/NA178–192- and POMT1675–689-stimulation was correlated, and that T cell cytokine/chemokine gene expression patterns were closely matched. This was exemplified by two strong responders, patients P003 and P015, who both developed clinical narcolepsy with cataplexy within one month from Pandemrix vaccination. TCR repertoire analyses in NT1 patients revealed increased abundance of seven public clonotypes in response to stimulation both with NA175–189 and POMT1675–689 in NT1 patients. In addition, vaccination with Pandemrix induced anti-POMT1 autoantibodies in children. These results were consistent with cross-reactivity of specific, virus-directed T-cells and antibodies with the autoantigen POMT1 in Pandemrix-associated NT1.The reasons remain unknown for the strongly enhanced T-cell reactivity to different influenza A (H1N1) protein fragments demonstrated in this study in patients who developed NT1 after Pandemrix vaccination. Our earlier study showed that viral proteins contained in the Pandemrix antigen suspension formed complexes, which may have contributed to the enhanced reactivity to both NA- and NP-derived epitopes16. Alternatively, and not mutually exclusive, enhanced T- and B-cell reactivity in NT1 patients may be attributed to immunogenetic predispositions6,7,8,23, resulting in hyper-responsiveness to pro-inflammatory signals and AS03 adjuvant-supplemented influenza A (H1N1) priming.Specific HLA class I alleles, most consistently HLA-A*11:01, account for additional genetic risk contributions in NT1, independent from HLA-DQB1*06:0224,25. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, likely acting in concert with CD4+ Th1-cells, are frequently implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including the neurological disorders multiple sclerosis26 and NT125. In this study of Pandemrix-associated NT1, cytokine and chemokine gene expression by PBMC in response to stimulation with influenza A (H1N1) NA175–189 or human POMT1675–689 matched closely, and revealed a cytotoxic T cell signature, characterized by IFN-γ, IFN-γ−associated genes, perforin 1, and granzyme B. This phenotype was consistent with CD8+ T-cells, but also unconventional, cytotoxic CD4+ T-cells, previously observed in influenza A infection20. In FACS-sorted T cell fractions, available for study from one Pandemrix-associated NT1 patient only, perforin 1 and granzyme B expression was upregulated in NA175–189-stimulated CD8+ T-cells, but not in CD4+ T cells. Thus, NA175–189 peptide is most likely binding to both HLA class I and II molecules.Six TRA clonotypes, and one TRB clonotype, significantly increased in abundance in samples from Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients both when stimulated with NA175–189, or with POMT1675–689. Strikingly, public TRA clonotypes CVVSAIKAAGNKLTF-TRAV10/TRAJ17 and CVVSAMTTDSWGKFQF-TRAV10/TRAJ24 were upregulated in 37.5% of NA175–189-stimulated, and 40–50% of POMT1675–689-stimulated samples. In addition, we identified several public TRA clonotypes with high similarity to these two dominant clonotypes in samples from NT1 patients. These results suggest converging selection in different NT1 patients of NA175–189- and/or POMT1675–689-reactive T-cell clones using TRAV10/TRAJ17 or TRAV10/TRAJ24 gene segments. This indicates that these clonotypes are likely involved in the pathogenesis of NT1.However, the identified public clonotypes were not exclusive to NT1 patients. Occasionally, they were seen in Pandemrix-vaccinated healthy controls, too. Interestingly, a HLA-DQB1*0602-negative healthy control shared both dominant TRAV10–TRAJ17 and TRAV10–TRAJ24 clonotypes, indicating that T-cells expressing these clonotypes were probably not HLA-DQ6.2-restricted. Therefore, TRAV10–TRAJ17 and TRAV10–TRAJ24 clonotypes might have contributed to an inflammatory reaction in NT1 patients, likely driven by CD8+ T-cells recognizing NA175–189 and putative cross-reactive POMT1675–689 (auto-) antigens, while the same clonotypes appeared effectively regulated when present in healthy controls. Use in future studies of single cell technology may allow the direct functional characterization of T-cell clonotypes in NT1 patients and controls.Of special interest is the identification of CVVSAMTTDSWGKFQF-TRAV10/TRAJ24 as a dominant public clonotype, and of additional, highly similar TRAV10–TRAJ24 clonotypes, upregulated in NA175–189- or POMT1675–689-stimulated samples from NT1 patients. Han et al. described a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with NT1, rs1483979. This SNP was located within the TRAJ24 segment and changed an amino acid within the CDR3 peptide-binding site of the TCR (F8L)27. Of the top public TRAV10–TRAJ24 clonotypes detected in samples from NT1 patients in our study, two encoded for phenylalanine (F), and one for leucine (L). All TRAJ24 (and 3 of 4 TRAJ17) clonotypes that were upregulated in response to NA175–189- or POMT1675–689-stimulation shared TRAV10 gene segment usage. These clonotypes differed from TRAV2–TRAJ2418 and TRAV6–TRAJ2428 clonotypes, previously isolated from NT1 patients using HLA-DQ6.2-HCRT tetramers. To our knowledge, clonotypes using TRAV10, TRAJ17 or TRBV6–1/TRBJ2–7 have not been described in NT1 patients before. The dominant public TRAV10–TRAJ17, TRAV10–TRAJ24, and TRBV6–1/TRBJ2–7 clonotypes described here represent potential biomarkers for NT1.Among the identified T-cell epitopes, IAYERMCNILKG (NP217–228; Immune Epitope Database ID 145824), derived from the NYMC X-157 vaccine strain, is shared between different influenza A virus strains. In contrast, ESVAWSASACHD (NA175-186; ID 97390) and MERNAGSGIIISDTP (HA274-288; ID 188723) are carried mainly by influenza A (H1N1) virus strains. A recent study by Luo et al. demonstrated an increased frequency of T-cells specific for HA273–287 in NT1 patients in comparison to HLA-DQB1*0602 positive controls18. However, a report by Schinkelshoek et al. found no significant increase in T cell reactivity against HA273–287 in NT1 patients in comparison to HLA-DQB1*0602 positive controls29. Peptides HA271–285 and HA274–288 were recognized by patients with NT1 and healthy vaccinees in our study cohort, confirming HA273–287 as an influenza A (H1N1) T-cell epitope. Yet again, we did not see a clear-cut difference between NT1 patients and healthy vaccinees, neither in comparison to HLA-DQB1*0602 positive or negative controls, questioning the role of HA273–287-reactivity in the pathogenesis of NT1.Using HLA-DQ6.2 tetramers, the study by Luo et al. demonstrated the presence of CD4+ T-cells specific for C-terminally amidated, human HCRT54–66 and HCRT86–97 peptides, but not for native HCRT peptides, in NT1 patients and controls18. Furthermore, TCR sequencing analyses suggested cross-reactivity with HA. The recent study by Jiang et al., also using HLA-DQ6.2 tetramers, detected CD4+ T cells specific for native HCRT56–69 and HCRT87–100 peptides in NT1 patients and controls28. In addition, Latorre et al. reported increased frequencies of predominantly HLA-DR-restricted CD4+ T cell clones recognizing much more diverse peptide epitopes of HCRT in NT1 patients. These clones did not show reactivity with HA. Notably, T-cell reactivity to HCRT was also detected in type 2 narcolepsy, which is not associated with HCRT-deficiency30. Thus, the current literature on T cell reactivity to HCRT in NT1 remains conflicting. In many autoimmune diseases, autoimmunity is directed against multiple autoantigens expressed in the target tissue. The results of our study do not exclude a role of autoimmunity to HCRT, but identify with POMT1 another autoantigen in NT1.POMT1 is a glycosyltransferase anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum, catalyzing in complex with POMT2 the first step of O-mannosyl glycan synthesis. In humans, O-mannose-linked glycosylation is observed mainly in brain, peripheral nerve, and muscle glycoproteins. The best-known substrate of POMT1/POMT2 is α-dystroglycan, mediating the binding of extracellular matrix components such as laminin to the dystrophin complex. Congenital defects in POMT1 are a cause of muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy types A1, B1, and C131. Some forms of muscular dystrophies, most clearly myotonic dystrophy type 1, are associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dysregulation32. It is currently unknown whether POMT1 or its substrates are involved in neuronal sleep regulation, but this possibility could be explored in experimental studies.In this study, T-cell reactivity with POMT1 was detected in Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients. Samples from unvaccinated NT1 patients were not available for comparisons. Currently, it remains unknown whether T cell reactivity against POMT1 can be observed in NT1 patients not exposed to influenza A (H1N1) vaccination or infection. Other questions to be addressed by future studies include the identities of the HLA alleles involved in the restriction of the dominant public TRAV10–TRAJ17, TRAV10–TRAJ24, and TRBV6–1/TRBJ2–7 clonotypes described, their function, antigenic peptide specificity and cross-reactivity, and their value for NT1 diagnosis.In summary, this study provides evidence for an influenza A (H1N1) virus directed, POMT1 cross-reactive T-cell response in NT1, in the context of HLA-DQ6.2. We identified two dominant T-cell epitopes of influenza A (H1N1) NA and (NYMC X-157 vaccine strain) NP virus proteins in Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients. Patients mounted a vigorous Th1-cell/cytotoxic T-cell response against these epitopes and showed T-cell reactivity against a self-epitope in POMT1, an enzyme expressed in brain. The POMT1 epitope is a peptide mimic of a dominant T-cell epitope of influenza A (H1N1) NA in Pandemrix-associated NT1. IFN-γ, perforin 1, granzyme B, and chemokine gene expression in response to stimulation with T-cell peptides NA175–189 or POMT1675–689 was closely matched in individual NT1 patients. TCR repertoire analyses demonstrated converging selection of TRAV10/TRAJ17 and TRAV10/TRAJ24 clonotypes in NT1, upregulated in response to either NA175–189- or POMT1675–689-stimulation, thus supporting T-cell cross-reactivity and a pathogenic role of these clonotypes in NT1. Moreover, vaccinees had elevated antibody levels against human POMT1, suggesting that Pandemrix vaccination triggered an autoimmune response to POMT1. The results of this unbiased search identify POMT1 as an autoantigen recognized by T and B cells in NT1.MethodsVaccineThe 2-component vaccine Pandemrix, containing inactivated influenza A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) split virus (3.75 μg per 0.5 ml emulsion), and AS03 adjuvant (10.69 mg squalene, 11.86 mg DL-alpha-tocopherol and 4.86 mg polysorbate 80 per 0.5 ml emulsion), was obtained from GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium.MiceHomozygous HLA-DQA1*0102, -DQB1*0602, human CD4-transgenic Ab0 NOD mice (“HLA-DQ6.2 mice”; stock number 006023) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA, and bred at the University of Helsinki Laboratory Animal Centre17. All mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions, under a 14–10 h light–dark cycle, at 22 ± 2 °C and 50–60% humidity. Pandemrix vaccine was injected under isoflurane anesthesia into the right thigh muscle (50 μl emulsion volume; male or female mice; 3 months of age), followed by one booster injection after 14 days. After 6–9 weeks from the first injection, mice were exsanguinated by retro-orbital bleeding under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia (Intervet International, Boxmeer, The Netherlands; Bayer HealthCare, Leverkusen, Germany), and spleens were harvested for collection of cells.Peptides and recombinant proteins15-mer peptides covering hemagglutinin (GenBank entry ACP41953.1) and neuraminidase (YP_009118627.1) of influenza (A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)), and nucleoprotein (ADE29096.1) of influenza (Aeassortant/NYMC X-179A (California/07/2009 × NYMC X-157)(H1N1)) with 12 amino acid overlap were produced. 2 × 5 15-mer peptides with 12 amino acid overlap, covering 2 viral peptide mimotopes identified in POMT1 (AAH65268.1) and SNTG1 (AAI04830.1), respectively, were also produced (all peptides from New England Peptides, Gardner, MA, USA). Peptides that failed in-house quality control by mass spectrometry were excluded (0–5.4% of viral peptides). Peptides were dissolved in endotoxin-free water/DMSO (50%; both from Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany), and stored as 25 mM stock solutions at −70 °C, until the day of use. Recombinant influenza A H1N1 (A/California/07/2009) hemagglutinin (cat#11085-V08H), (A/California/04/2009) neuraminidase (cat#11058-VNAHC or cat#11058-V01H), and (A/California/07/2009) or (A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai) nucleoprotein (cat#40205-V08B and cat#11675-V08B) were purchased from Sino Biological, Beijing, China. Endotoxin-free, recombinant human protein-O-mannosyltransferase 1 and syntrophin gamma 1 were from Origene, Rockville, Maryland, and endotoxin-free ovalbumin from Hyglos, Bernried, Germany.Mouse spleen cell stimulationSpleen cells from 1 to 2 individual mice were pooled, and seeded in triplicates in 96-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well in RPMI 1640 medium (200 μl volume) containing heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (10%), penicillin/streptomycin, glutamine, and HEPES (25 mM), at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (all from Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were stimulated for 6 days with 15-mer peptides (10 μM; resulting in DMSO concentration 0.1%), a combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (positive control, 3 μg and 2 μg/ml; clones 145–2C11 and 37.51; eBioscience, San Diego, CA), endotoxin-free ovalbumin (negative control), recombinant influenza A hemagglutinin, neuraminidase or nucleoprotein (all 10 μg/ml). For each stimulation, two plates were run in parallel (from two different spleen cell pools).Patient and healthy control donor materialThe T cell study included 28 pediatric Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients (20 in the discovery cohort, and 14 in the validation cohort; 6 patients were included in both cohorts), and 33 healthy Pandemrix-vaccinated control children or adolescents (Table 1, Supplementary Table 3A, B). If results from different experiments were pooled for analysis, and two results from a single patient were available, only the result obtained with the sample drawn earlier was used. PBMC from Pandemrix-vaccinated HLA-DQB1*0602-positive individuals (sleep clinic patients without a diagnosis of NT1) were also used for influenza A (H1N1) virus T cell epitope screening (Supplementary Table 1). The plasma study included 37 pediatric Pandemrix-associated NT1 patients, 57 healthy Pandemrix-vaccinated control children or adolescents, and 130 healthy control children or adolescents that had not received Pandemrix vaccine (Table 1). NT1 patients were diagnosed in outpatient clinics at Finnish university hospitals, by pediatric neurologists, pediatricians or neurologists with expertise in sleep medicine. All NT1 patients were diagnosed based on criteria defined in the third edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders33. All NT1 patients suffered from excessive daytime sleepiness. They also had abnormal Multiple Sleep Latency Tests in polysomnography (sleep latency <8 min and ≥2 sleep onset REM periods), and either cataplexy, or cerebrospinal fluid HCRT 1 levels below 110 pg/ml, as measured using the standardized Phoenix RIA method with Stanford reference.Human plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) separation and storageWhole blood was drawn and heparinized. Plasma was separated from fresh heparinized blood samples, and stored at −70 °C, before isolation of PBMC by Ficoll (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) isogradient centrifugation. PBMC were stored in liquid nitrogen until further analysis.Genotyping of the HLA-DQB1*0602 alleleGenotyping for the HLA-DQB1 locus was performed using a homogeneous assay based on asymmetrical PCR and hybridization with sequence-specific lanthanide labeled oligonucleotide probes, as described earlier34. In short, blood dried on sample collection cards was used for asymmetric PCR where the sequence of interest was simultaneously amplified and detected using lanthanide labeled probes with locked nucleic acid additions. Complementary quencher oligonucleotides were also included in the reactions. Two different specific probes, one labeled with europium and another with terbium, were present in each reaction and allowed simultaneous use of two different probes and their individual detection by two signals measured after the amplification. Presence of DQB1*0602 allele was deduced based on a positive signal with DQB1*0602/ *0603 specific probe and a negative with DQB1*0603/*0604 specific probe. All oligonucleotides used in this study are defined in Supplementary Table 4.Human PBMC stimulationFrozen PBMCs were thawed and allowed to recover in RPMI 1640 culture medium (Life Technologies, Paisley, United Kingdom) containing 2 mmol L-glutamine, 25 mmol/l HEPES, 25 μg/ml gentamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10% of heat-inactivated AB serum (Innovative Research, Novi, MI, USA), for 1 h in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were seeded in duplicates or triplicates in 96-well round-bottom plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at 2 × 105 cells/well, using RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 5% of heat-inactivated AB serum, 2 mmol L-glutamine, 25 mmol/lHEPES and 25 μg/ml gentamycin (200 µl/well), and stimulated for 6 days with 15-mer peptides (10 μM; resulting DMSO concentration 0.1%), tetanus toxoid (20 μg/ml), PBS (negative control), recombinant influenza A hemagglutinin, neuraminidase or nucleoprotein (all at 10 μg/ml). Generally, samples were stimulated with different T cell peptides selected at random. Peptide testing was prioritized, and proteins were only tested if enough cells were available. For epitope mapping, peptides were not selected at random. Instead, more samples were used for testing the inner three than the outer two peptide epitopes. No patient or control samples that had passed viability control (trypan blue staining, positive response to stimulation with tetanus control) were excluded from the study.FACS sortingTo study gene expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, PBMCs were stimulated for 6 days with 15-mer peptides, as described in the previous section. Stimulated cells were stained with anti-CD3-Efluor 610 (BioLegend), anti-CD4-FITC (BD Pharmingen), anti-CD8-AF700 (eBioscience) and SYTOX® Blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A BD Influx flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) was used to sort CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Dead cells and monocytes were excluded from analysis by appropriate gating strategies and SYTOX® Blue staining (gating and sort strategy shown in Supplementary Fig. 7).Mouse cytokine RT-qPCR analysisTotal RNA from stimulated murine cells was isolated with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and cDNA was synthesized using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). TaqMan gene expression assays (IFN-γ Mm01168134 _m1; Rn18S Mm03928990_g1), TaqMan® Fast Universal PCR Master Mix 10 × 250 Rxn and a StepOne Plus instrument (all Applied Biosystems) were used for real-time detection of IFN-γ target gene complementary DNA amplification. Ribosomal 18S was used as endogenous reference. Relative expression was calculated by the 2−ΔΔCt method.Cytokine fluorescent multiplex bead-based immunoassayThe cytokines IFN-γ and IL-2 were measured in cell culture supernatants using human or mouse Milliplex MAP Kits (HCYTMAG-60K, MCYTMAG-70K, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantification was performed with a Magpix instrument and xPONENT 4.2 or 4.3 software (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX), or Bio-Plex 200® System and Bio-Plex Manager software version 5.0 (BIO-RAD Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The concentration of each cytokine was determined from an 8-point standard curve using five parameter logistic regression. The samples below minimum detectable concentration (MinDC) were given an arbitrary value of 50% of MinDC. Each sample was compared to an unstimulated sample.Basic local alignment of protein sequencesBasic local alignment of protein sequences was performed using the web-based BLASTP program search tool (version 2.2.32+) at the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).RNA extraction from human PBMC and sorted CD4+ and CD8+ T-cellsRNA was prepared from stimulated PBMC stored at −70 °C in RLT buffer (Qiagen), using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were homogenized with QIAshredder columns (Qiagen). After extraction, RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA samples were stored at −70 °C. RNA was captured from stimulated CD4+ or CD8+ T cells stored at −20 °C in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific) after FACS sorting, according to a published protocol35. Briefly, samples were mixed with lysis buffer (0.3% (v/v) Triton X100, 20 mM DTT, 2 mM dNTPs) in ratio 1:1 and vortexed. Magnetic Dynabeads (M-270 Streptavidin, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated with RNA capturing polyT-tailed Indexing Oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) were added to each well. After 5 min of incubation the magnetic beads were separated from the supernatant and washed twice with 6X SSC buffer. Subsequently, the beads were combined with RT mix as described later.RNA SequencingThe in-house 3′ bulk RNA-sequencing “3B-seq” method was modified from the single cell Drop-seq protocol36, as described37. Briefly, 10 ng of RNA was mixed with indexing oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) and after 5 min of incubation, the RNA was combined with RT mix (1× Maxima RT buffer, 1 mmol/L deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 10 U/μL Maxima H-RTase (all Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 U/μL RNase inhibitor (Lucigen, Middleton, WI), and 2.5 μmol/L Template Switch Oligo (TSO; Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA)). Primers are listed in Supplementary Table 4. Samples were incubated in a T100 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) for 30 min at 22 °C and 90 min at 52 °C. The constructed complementary DNA (cDNA) was amplified by PCR using the RT mix as template and adding 1× HiFi HotStart Readymix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA), and 0.8 μmol/L SMART PCR primer. The samples were thermocycled in a T100 thermocycler (Bio-Rad) as follows: 95 °C for 3 min; then 4 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 65 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 3 min; then 16 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 67 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 3 min; and with the final extension step of 5 min at 72 °C. An aliquot of this PCR product was used for TCR sequencing (below). The PCR products were pooled together in sets of 12 samples containing different indexing oligos and purified with 0.6× HighPrep PCR reagent (MAGBIO, Gaithersburg, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. They were eluted in 10 μL of molecular grade water. The 3′-end complementary DNA fragments for sequencing were prepared using the Nextera XT (Illumina) tagmentation reaction. The reaction was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, except for the use of P5 SMART primer, which replaced the S5xx Nextera primer. Each set of 12 samples that was pooled after the PCR reaction was tagmented with a different Nextera N7xx index. Subsequently, the samples were PCR amplified as follows: 95 °C for 30 seconds, 11 cycles of 95 °C for 10 seconds, 55 °C for 30 seconds, and 72 °C for 30 seconds, with the final extension step of 5 minutes at 72 °C. Samples were purified twice using 0.6× and 1.0× HighPrep PCR reagent and eluted in 10 μL of molecular-grade water. The concentration of the libraries was measured by using a Qubit 2 fluorometer (Invitrogen) and the Qubit DNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The quality of the sequencing libraries was assessed using the LabChip GXII Touch HT electrophoresis system (PerkinElmer), with the DNA High Sensitivity Assay (PerkinElmer) and the DNA 5K/RNA/Charge Variant Assay LabChip (PerkinElmer). Samples were stored at −20 °C. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument, with a custom primer (DS Custom Read 1) producing read 1 of 20 base pairs (bp), and read 2 (paired end) of 50 bp. Sequencing was performed at the Functional Genomics Unit of the University of Helsinki, Finland.Read alignment and generation of digital expression dataRaw sequence data were processed as described before37. The pipeline originally suggested by Macosko et al. for processing of Drop-seq data was used36. Briefly, reads were filtered to remove polyA tails of length 6 or greater, and then aligned to the human (GRCh38) genome using STAR aligner v2.7.238, with default settings. Uniquely mapped reads were grouped according to the 1–12 barcode, and gene transcripts were counted by their unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to reduce the bias emerging from the PCR amplification. Digital expression matrices reported the number of transcripts per gene in each sample (according to the distinct unique molecular identifiers sequences counted). Differentially expressed genes were identified using edgeR v3.4.0, based on a test analogous to Fisher’s exact test39. The paired method was used for comparisons, calculating 2-sided p-values and adjusting for multiple testing using BH correction. RNAseq heatmaps were hierarchically clustered and drawn using the web-based Heatmapper software (accessed 25th of July 2020)40.TCR sequencingPrimers were designed for human TCR constant genes using Primer341,42, and appended to a tailing sequence to produce the reverse primers N7tail-TRAC-2 and N7tail-TRBC-2 (Supplementary Table 4). Forward primers (DS_N5xx_5TSO) contained a sequence complementary to the Template Switch Oligo and an index sequence (I5). TCR sequences were amplified using KAPA HiFi HotStart Readymix, 0.3 μM of each primer and 1 μl pre-amplified cDNA library (see RNA Sequencing) in 10 μl volume with 16 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 62 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by purification with 1.5× volume of HighPrep PCR reagent. The TCR libraries were dual indexed using the same forward primer as in the previous step, and one of Nextera N7xx primers. PCR was done using KAPA HiFi HotStart Readymix, 0.3 μM of each primer and 3 μl template in 10 μl volume with 10 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 62 °C for 20 seconds and 72 °C for 30 s. The libraries were pooled according to concentration and purified first with 1× and then with 1.5× volume of HighPrep PCR reagent. The quality of the libraries was assessed with a LabChip GXII Touch HT electrophoresis instrument and quantitative PCR. Libraries were sequenced with a MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (600-cycle) using the 300 + 300 bp paired-end protocol, a custom read 1 primer (DS-CustomRead1_5TSO) and 10% PhiX on an Illumina Miseq instrument at Department of Virology, University of Helsinki, Finland.TCR analysisTCR sequencing reads were mapped and clonotypes assembled with MiXCR v3.0.1243,44. The NA175–189-stimulated sample from HC19 did not produce any clonotypes and was excluded. Low-count clones that had an identical CDR3 nucleotide sequence to a high-count clone (over 500-fold difference) were filtered out as probable cross-sample contaminants. Non-productive clones were also filtered out. To normalize the data, counts were downsampled pairwise using VDJtools v1.2.145 so that each NA175–189-treated and medium-treated sample from the same patient was downsampled to the same total count. The same was done separately for the POMT1675–689-treated samples. Further processing was done using R statistical software v3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Gene usage differences between peptide and media-treated patient samples were examined using the Immunarch package v0.5.5 (Zenodo/CERN, Geneva, Switzerland) and Wilcoxon test with the paired method. P values were corrected for multiple testing with the Benjamini–Hochberg method. For clone-level analysis, low-count clones were filtered out by requiring each clone to have count >10 in at least one sample. One pseudocount was added, the counts were log2 transformed and fold change between the peptide-treated sample and medium control from the same individual was calculated for public clones (present in at least three samples). Statistical significance was tested with Rank Products test implemented in the RankProd package v3.12.046,47, using the paired method. Clones were hierarchically clustered based on the Levenshtein edit distance of their CDR3 sequences.Plasma POMT1 antibody radioimmunoassayThe full-length human POMT1 cDNA (GenBank entry BC065268.1) was cloned into the pTNT vector (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) under the control of the SP6 promoter, and multiplied in Invitrogen subcloning efficiency DH5α competent cells (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 35S-methionine-labeled POMT1 was produced by in vitro transcription and translation of the purified plasmids using the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in the presence of 35S-methionine (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Unincorporated 35S-methionine was removed by gel chromatography on NAP-5 columns (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Plasma samples were analyzed for POMT1 (auto)-antibodies by RIA, as described for GAD autoantibodies21. Briefly, 2 µl of plasma was incubated overnight at 4 °C in 96-well plates with 20,000 cpm of 35S-methionine-labeled POMT1, diluted in 50 µl of TBST buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.4). Antibody–antigen complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose, and unbound label was removed by washing several times with TBST buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.4). The bound radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter (1450 MicroBeta Trilux, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland), and the results were expressed in relative units (RU), based on a serial dilution in-house standard curve.StatisticsStatistical comparisons between groups were performed, using Prism version 6.05 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA), and Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests. Correlation analyses were performed by calculating Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Additional details on the statistics used in the analysis of RNA and TCR sequencing data are included in the sections above.Study approvalNT1 patients were Finnish participants in the NARPANORD narcolepsy study.

When you think of a pandemic, COVID-19 probably comes to mind.However, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve also experienced another pandemic relatively recently: the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.You may be curious how these two pandemics compare with each other. Keep reading as we break down their similarities and differences below.Quick comparison tableBefore we go on to compare the two pandemics in more detail, here are some fast facts about each of them.2009 H1N1 InfluenzaCOVID-19Year started – year ended2009–20102020–presentWorldwide deathsabout 284,000 in the first 12 monthsabout 2,000,000 in the first 12 monthsVirus2009 H1N1 influenza virusSARS-CoV-2 coronavirusTransmissionrespiratory droplets and aerosols, contact with contaminated surfaces, asymptomatic spreadrespiratory droplets and aerosols, contact with contaminated surfaces, asymptomatic spreadContagiousnessless contagious than COVID-19, contagious from 1 day before symptoms begin until 5 to 7 days after becoming sickmore contagious than 2009 H1N1 influenza, contagious from 2 days before symptoms begin until 10 days after testing positiveSymptomsfever and chills, fatigue, cough, body aches and pains, headache, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, digestive symptoms like diarrhea and vomitingsimilar symptoms to 2009 H1N1 influenza, but also includes loss of smell and tasteSymptom onsetsudden after 1 to 4 daysgradual after 2 to 14 daysAge group most impactedpeople younger than 30adults over age 30Illness severity94–98 percent mild80 percent mild, 20 percent severe or criticalRisk factorsbeing 65 years or older, being younger than 5 years old, being pregnant, having certain underlying health conditionsbeing 65 years or older, being pregnant, having certain underlying health conditionsComplicationspneumonia, worsening of underlying health conditions, secondary bacterial infections, respiratory failure, inflammation of tissues of the heart, brain, or muscles, injury to the kidneys or liver, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsissame complications as 2009 H1N1 influenza, but also includes: long-haul COVID-19, blood clots, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) Treatmentssupportive care, FDA-approved antiviral medications like oseltamivir (Tamiflu)supportive care, FDA-approved antiviral remdesivir (Veklury), various treatments under Emergency Use AuthorizationVaccinesseveral vaccines developedseveral vaccines developedSimilarities between the H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemicsLet’s look at some of the similarities between the 2009 H1N1 influenza and COVID-19 pandemics.TransmissionBoth 2009 H1N1 influenza and COVID-19 can be transmitted in similar ways. These include:Respiratory droplets and aerosols. These are tiny droplets that are made when a person who has the virus talks, sneezes, or coughs. If you inhale these droplets or aerosol particles, you can contract the virus.Contaminated objects. Respiratory droplets containing virus can land on things like countertops and doorknobs. You can contract the virus by touching these things and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.It’s also possible for a person to pass both viruses when they don’t have any symptoms. This is called asymptomatic transmission.SymptomsBoth 2009 H1N1 influenza and COVID-19 are respiratory infections that share many symptoms in common. These can include:fever and chillsfatiguecoughbody aches and painsheadachesore throatrunny or stuffy nosedigestive symptoms like diarrhea and vomitingOne symptom that’s unique to COVID-19 is loss of smell and taste.The 2009 H1N1 influenza and COVID-19 can range from mild to severe. In both pandemics, certain groups were at an increased risk for severe illness.Risk factorsThe groups at risk for complications from 2009 H1N1 influenza and COVID-19 have significant overlap. They include:adults aged 65 and overpregnant peoplethose with certain types of underlying health conditionsUnderlying health conditions that can contribute to complications include: chronic lung diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and cystic fibrosisdevelopmental disorders like Down syndromediabetesheart disease, including heart failure or coronary artery diseasekidney diseaseliver diseaseneurological conditions, such as stroke and dementiasickle cell diseaseweakened immune system due to cancer treatments, HIV/AIDS, or immunosuppressive drugsAdditional high risk groups for the 2009 H1N1 influenzaSome additional groups that were at a higher risk for serious illness during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic included:children under the age of 5people under the age of 19 who were receiving long-term aspirin therapyAdditional high risk groups for COVID-19Additionally, people with the following underlying health conditions are at a higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19:hypertensionhaving overweight or obesitysmokingsubstance use disordersComplicationsBoth 2009 H1N1 influenza and COVID-19 can lead to similar complications, including:pneumoniaworsening of underlying health conditionssecondary bacterial infectionsrespiratory failureinflammation of tissues of the heart, brain, or musclesinjury to the kidneys or liveracute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)sepsisCOVID-19 also has a few additional complications, including:long-haul COVIDblood clotsmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)VaccineAfter the emergence of 2009 H1N1 influenza and COVID-19, efforts were quickly made to develop a vaccine.Over the course of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, a total of five vaccines were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These vaccines were developed using the same technology that had previously been used for seasonal flu vaccines.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 200 COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in development at the time of this article, with at least seven different vaccines currently in use across the globe. They use a variety of different technologies, including:mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna)viral vectors (Johnson & Johnson, Oxford-AstraZeneca)protein subunits (Novavax)Three vaccines are currently authorized by the FDA for emergency use in the United States. These include the vaccines produced by:Pfizer-BioNTechModernaJohnson & JohnsonDifferences between the H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemicsNow let’s explore the differences between the two pandemics.The type of virusThe 2009 H1N1 pandemic was caused by an influenza virus. Influenza viruses are part of the viral family Orthomyxoviridae. Their genetic material consists of eight separate strands of RNA.This specific influenza virus jumped to humans from pigs in 2009, hence its moniker “swine flu.” It actually contains RNA strands of human, swine, and avian origin. How does this happen?Pigs can get several different types of influenza virus. When this happens, the RNA strands from the different viruses can mix together through a process called reassortment. This can create a unique influenza virus, such as the 2009 H1N1 virus.COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus from the viral family Coronaviridae. Its genetic material consists of a single strand of RNA. The specific virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2.The exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown. A recently released report from the WHO indicates that SARS-CoV-2 probably originated in bats and was passed to humans through an unknown intermediate animal host.2009 H1N1 influenza todayEven though the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic ended in 2010, these viruses continue to circulate today as seasonal flu strains. They’ve been included as one of the components of the seasonal flu vaccine each year since the pandemic.Worldwide deathsIn a 2012 study, researchers estimated that about 284,000 deaths occurred worldwide in the first 12 months of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Since the end of the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that an additional 75,000 deaths occurred in the United States due to 2009 H1N1 influenza. COVID-19 has caused significantly more deaths worldwide. It’s estimated that about 2,000,000 deaths from COVID-19 occurred in the first 12 months of the pandemic.As with 2009 H1N1 influenza, deaths due to COVID-19 will continue during and after the pandemic. At the time of writing, COVID-19 has caused almost 3,000,000 deaths worldwide. Over 500,000 deaths have occurred in the United States.ContagiousnessCOVID-19 is more contagious than 2009 H1N1 influenza. This means that COVID-19 can spread more easily between individuals.It’s estimated that the R0 for COVID-19 is about 3 while the R0 for 2009 H1N1 influenza is between 1.3 and 1.7. “R0” stands for “basic reproduction number.” It reflects the number of other people who are susceptible to contracting the virus if one person has it.So, one person who’s developed COVID-19 may potentially transmit the virus to three other people. Meanwhile, a person that has 2009 H1N1 influenza may pass it to between one to two other people.The period of contagiousness between the two viruses can also vary:Flu: A person who has the flu can typically pass the virus from 1 day before symptoms start until 5 to 7 days after becoming ill.COVID-19: COVID-19 can be passed about 2 days before symptoms start. Whether or not symptoms are present, a person can pass the virus for up to 10 days after testing positive.Symptom onsetFlu, including the 2009 H1N1 flu, and COVID-19 differ when it comes to symptom onset:Flu: The incubation period for flu can range from 1 to 4 days. When symptoms occur, they often come on suddenly.COVID-19: COVID-19 has a longer incubation period, ranging from 2 to 14 days, although many people develop symptoms 5 days after contracting the virus. Symptoms typically appear more gradually.Age group most impactedThe two pandemics also differed in the age groups that were most impacted:2009 H1N1 influenza: People under the age of 30 were most impacted by the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. It’s believed that this is due to pre-existing influenza immunity in older people.COVID-19: Adults aged 30 and over have been most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Generally speaking, fewer and less severe cases have been observed in younger people.Illness severityIt’s estimated that between 94 and 98 percent cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza were mild. Much fewer people experienced severe or critical illness.A higher percentage of people who develop COVID-19 have severe illness. The WHO estimates that, while COVID-19 is mild 80 percent of the time, 20 percent of people who contract the virus can become seriously or critically ill.TreatmentsThe treatment for 2009 H1N1 influenza included supportive care and antiviral medications. Supportive care involves:getting enough restdrinking plenty of fluidsusing over-the-counter (OTC) medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve) to ease symptoms like fever and painThe H1N1 virus was also susceptible to antiviral medications that had been previously used (and are still used) for seasonal flu, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza).When COVID-19 first emerged, however, we didn’t know of any treatments that were effective against it. Over time, various therapies have either been approved by the FDA or authorized for emergency use.Mild to moderate COVID-19 is often treated with supportive care. Additional treatments are also available to people who are hospitalized or at a high risk of serious illness. These can include:remdesivir (Veklury), the only FDA-approved antiviral treatment for COVID-19SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodiesdexamethasone, a type of steroid medicationCOVID-19 convalescent plasmaTakeawayWe’ve experienced two different pandemics in the 21st century: the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. There are various similarities and differences between these two pandemics.Although they’re caused by different viruses, both 2009 H1N1 influenza and COVID-19 are respiratory illnesses that are transmitted in the same way. There’s also a lot of overlap in symptoms, complications, and risk factors for serious illness.However, COVID-19 is more likely to cause serious illness than 2009 H1N1 influenza and has led to more deaths worldwide. It’s also more contagious than 2009 H1N1 influenza.While effective treatments weren’t known at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we now have several that are available. Additionally, as in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, vaccines have been rapidly developed for COVID-19.How we reviewed this article:SourcesHistoryHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

Photo: USDAPoultry World discusses the current avian influenza outbreak in Europe and Asia with Dr David E. Swayne.Dr David E. Swayne, Laboratory Director at the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory at the US National Poultry Research Center Agricultural Research Service, USDA, tells us what makes this virus different and offers his advice for the poultry sector in the southern hemisphere ahead of winter.How serious is this outbreak compared to previous avian influenza outbreaks?The current outbreak strains in Europe and Asia are the H5Nx HPAI viruses that have a genetic origin from the initially identified H5N1 High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Virus (HPAIV) from the Guangdong province in China in 1996. This virus lineage has spread to many additional countries and changed by drift and shift. There have been changes in hemagglutinin (HA) protein by mutations in the gene that have produced diverse HA structure which have necessitated change in vaccine seed strains and have also resulted in changes in the biology of the virus infections in poultry and wild birds. These newest viruses are still highly lethal to poultry but vary in ability to infect and cause severe disease and death in wild birds.What makes this outbreak different to the previous one?This clade of virus has infected migratory waterfowl and spread across multiple countries in Europe and Asia with overflow into domestic poultry causing outbreaks in backyard and commercial poultry. This is similar to the outbreaks seen in the USA in 2014-2015. But many previous outbreaks with 1996 lineage of HPAIV do not always spread by migratory birds.What advice do you have for the southern hemisphere as they prepare for winter?Increased surveillance in migratory birds and outdoor poultry for early HPAIV detection and the development of mitigation strategies to reduce introduction into commercial poultry to limit onward spread.Join 31,000+ subscribers Subscribe to our newsletter to stay updated about all the need-to-know content in the poultry sector, three times a week.

Download PDF Copy By Dr. Osman Shabir, PhDReviewed by Sophia Coveney Live-attenuated vaccines are very effective vaccines used in the prevention of a variety of diseases including influenza, chickenpox, measles, polio and TB. Image Credit: LookerStudio/Shutterstock.com What are live-attenuated vaccines? Live-attenuated vaccines differ from traditional inactivated vaccines where the pathogen is “killed”, and as the name suggests the pathogen (typically a virus) remains active in live vaccines, however, is attenuated or modified in a way that the pathogen is not able to cause disease itself but can produce a robust immune response. Typically, live vaccines lead to a stronger, more prolonged and robust immune response in comparison to inactivated vaccines. Live-attenuated vaccines can be produced by reverse genetics including RNAi. Briefly, reverse genetic tools are used to create live-attenuated vaccines. Genes from current (novel) viruses are combined with previously altered (attenuated) viruses belonging to the same generic strain. However, due to these live viruses being attenuated, they are unable to replicate to the same extent as live unattenuated viruses. This means that they are no longer able to sufficiently infect the host, but can do so enough for the host to develop broad and robust immunity. What are the Different Types of Vaccines? The immunological mechanism of live-attenuated vaccines usually involves a broad immune response including the involvement of CD4+ & CD8+ T lymphocytes (T-cells) as well as antibodies against the pathogen (produced by B-cells). Live-attenuated vaccines usually result in long-term (potentially life-long) protection without requiring additional doses in adulthood. Advantages of live-attenuated vaccines over some other forms of vaccines (such as inactivated) include the production of a robust, strong antibody and cell-mediated immune response, long-lasting immunity, with a relatively quick onset of action. Disadvantages may include production, maintenance & transport considerations due to the use of live pathogens and the fact that because they are live pathogens it could lead to issues in immunocompromised individuals (see considerations below). Examples of live-attenuated vaccines The most common live-attenuated vaccines include: Live-attenuated Influenza (flu) vaccines (LAIV) Measles, Mumps & Rubella (MMR) Polio – nearing global eradication due to mass vaccination Smallpox – officially eradicated due to mass vaccination Chickenpox Yellow Fever Japanese encephalitis Shingles Rotavirus Whilst the majority of these vaccines are for viruses, some do exist for specific bacterial infections. These include cholera, TB and oral typhoid vaccines. Two of the most common live-attenuated vaccines are discussed below: influenza & MMR vaccines. Live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) Influenza causes worldwide seasonal epidemics each year (see influenza). To combat influenza, a variety of different vaccines are available to use including inactivated vaccines and live-attenuated. The LAIV can provide up to 90% protection in adults under 65 years of age, and up to 40% of adults over 65 (though inactivated vaccines are preferred for older individuals). LAIVs are usually administered via the nose – mimicking the natural infection route of the influenza virus.

In the live attenuated vaccine, a combination of 6 attenuated segments combined with 2 normal (WT) segments – engineered into plasmids – creating a 6:2 reassortment LAIV. LAIVs are typically produced in 10–11-day old chicken embryonated eggs using a WHO-approved virus variant and a master donor virus (MDV). The 6:2 reassorted virus is passaged in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against the MDV at low temperatures so that it becomes cold-adapted & temperature-sensitive. This means it no longer replicates in the lower-respiratory tract, which is warmer and where influenza causes disease. Instead, it allows it to replicate in the slightly colder upper respiratory tract to elicit an immune response without causing the disease. Mumps, measles & rubella (MMR) vaccine The MMR vaccine offers a high level of protection (over 90% effective overall) against mumps, measles and rubella and is usually given as part of a 2-dose regimen in toddlers. Due to the MMR vaccine, the levels of mumps, measles and rubella infections and fatalities are incredibly low, though cases have increased in unvaccinated populations. The MMR vaccine usually contains an attenuated rubella virus grown in human cell strains, whereas the attenuated measles and mumps viruses are grown using chicken embryo cells (not chicken embryonated eggs). The MMR vaccine may also incorporate attenuated varicella virus; chickenpox, in the MMRV vaccine. Whilst these vaccines are incredibly safe, they do come with some side effects, and the MMRV vaccine has a higher rate of side effects compared to the MMR vaccine. One of the biggest and potentially most damaging aspects of the MMR vaccine was the false & fraudulent claim by Andrew Wakefield; a disgraced former doctor, that the MMR vaccine leads to autism. This fuelled anti-vaccine sentiment, conspiracy theories and inevitably led to a rise in cases of mumps, measles and rubella in unvaccinated groups who believed the claims. There is absolutely no credible scientific evidence to back up Wakefield’s claims, and all legitimate scientific studies are to the contrary. This highlights the damage baseless misinformation can create where the MMR vaccine is an incredibly safe and effective vaccine and has saved (and continues to save) millions of lives worldwide. Considerations of live-attenuated vaccines Whilst live-attenuated vaccines lead to strong, robust and long-term immunity to viruses (and some bacteria) in most healthy individuals, there may be cases where such vaccines may not be appropriate. Specifically, individuals with compromised immune systems – either due to chemotherapy, HIV infection, or primary disorders of immunodeficiency should not be given live-attenuated vaccines. Compared to inactivated vaccines, live-attenuated vaccines also need to be carefully prepared, stored, transported and administered. These normally need to be kept uninterruptedly at cold temperatures, and this may present a challenge to more remote areas of the world or where such facilities do not exist. In summary, live-attenuated vaccines are highly effective and safe vaccines used in the prevention of a variety of viral diseases (including influenza, measles, mumps, rubella & chickenpox) as well as some bacterial diseases (such as cholera and TB). In these vaccines, the pathogen remains viable, but altered in a way that it can cause an immune response, but not lead to infection. Generally, these vaccines produce more robust and broader immune responses compared to inactivated (killed pathogen) vaccines. References Minor, 2015.

Librarians in Gary, Indiana protect themselves with masks in October 1918 during the flu pandemic. via Calumet Regional Archives Share Copy link Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Reddit WhatsApp Email By: Julia Skinner April 14, 2021 April 16, 2021 7 minutes The icon indicates free access to the linked research on JSTOR. In 1918, World War I was coming to a close, and widespread changes were afoot. It was in some ways a moment similar to today: rapid technological development brought sweeping changes to workplaces and homes. Fights for labor and voting rights were underway. Then, in the spring, a pandemic began to sweep the globe, killing millions. Libraries across the U.S. helped people stay informed, entertained, and cared for as they disseminated information and resources, shifted their services, and re-imagined how they brought collections to the communities they served. Public libraries in the United States started to proliferate in the late 1800s and early 1900s, often founded by women’s clubs and other social groups seeking to benefit their communities. Their early focus was on classic literature, which was thought to improve and transform the reader. However, thanks in part to librarianship during the pandemic , a shift occurred after World War I towards “useful information”, and with that shift came a focus on readers’ needs and interests.

Δ In 1918, when the pandemic hit the United States, many libraries temporarily closed. Some libraries had existing policies for dealing with materials and quarantined patrons after smaller outbreaks, but few were prepared for a disease outbreak at a large scale. At the Cedar Rapids, Iowa Public Library, for instance, ill patrons were still allowed to browse and borrow prior to 1918, a policy that was quickly reversed and never re-adopted. International health guidelines from 1921, drafted in the wake of the Influenza virus, explicitly note the importance of social distancing and closing public gathering spaces. During the pandemic itself masks were mandated in public spaces, including libraries. Libraries quickly shifted focus to protect public health, limiting programing while still getting materials to readers, who demanded books in ever greater numbers while stuck at home. Despite precautions, some staff still fell ill, and financial as well as personal strain on staff and libraries led to job cuts and resignations. Cedar Rapids librarian E. Joanna Hagey recalled the strain the public health crisis put on librarians: Never before did we run with such a short staff. The circulation is larger than last December’s. All but the most pressing business had to be left undone, but when there are not people enough to cover all duties the less important must be dropped. For a time Miss Taylor, Miss Wolfe and I were the only full time people here. All members of the staff have shared the extra duties and have worked with a will. Let us hope that such a succession of resignations and absences on account of sickness will never recur. At the time, medical research held that paper materials, including the books and newspapers at libraries, would harbor contagions from anyone who touched them, and local health officials (not librarians) determined whether or not materials would be destroyed. Librarians and library records lamented the physical loss of books, which were destroyed after being returned from influenza-afflicted homes. E. Joanna Hagey mourned her collection, saying in her minutes: “Many times the books have done good service before destruction overtakes them, at other times it is the new books which are the victims.” The 1918 flu pandemic was the first in which libraries were central to disseminating public health information. Librarians’ concerns sparked waves of changes to collection policies, as older theories about the spread of infection through library materials and postage stamps gave way to more nuanced understanding. In 1918, library books were seen as fomites (or objects likely to harbor infectious microbes); today we know that paper and books are not reliable conductors of viral agents, for the most part. Library services began to change, too, away from a strict focus on classic literature and towards a variety of resources best suited to individual communities. Perhaps the most notable was Forrest Spaulding, a Des Moines, Iowa library director who is said to have destroyed “pro-German” pamphlets by the fistful during the war, doing so at night to avoid backlash. Twenty years later, he changed course dramatically, authoring the Library Bill of Rights, which aims to ensure patrons’ access to information. The Bill was adopted by the Des Moines Public Library board, and later became an important guiding document for American librarianship writ large. These changes in library philosophy, as well as in library policy around contagion, laid the groundwork for responses to COVID-19. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Richard Tutwiler of Flagstaff City-Coconino County Public Library recalls that, “The biggest priority was quickly determining how to best serve our communities’ needs from a distance, keeping public health and safety paramount for not only our patrons, but our staff.” Just as in 1918, the goal was to provide the best community services possible while minimizing risk. In many libraries, buildings were closed, work from home schemes (far more feasible than in 1918) were devised and quickly implemented, and social programming and interlibrary loan suspended. Laura Gray, a Library Assistant at the West Linn, Oregon Public Library, says what stands out most to her about the early days of lockdown was “just feeling grateful that I worked with such a creative and flexible team.” The growth of community-focused librarianship in the last century became evident too: in particular the priority in maintaining popular programs geared towards specific community needs. While in 1918, children’s books were often off-limits and children’s programming limited, most librarians I spoke to cited their storytimes and other children’s programming from 2020 to be some of the most rewarding and well-attended, and many offered other children’s programs as well. One Illinois librarian recalls her library’s “Tech Take Homes” which gave kids simple science and technology activities. For university libraries, immediate community needs looked a bit different: Sarah Bosler from Citrus College, remembers that when lockdown started “the most important resource that students needed was reserve textbooks,” and the library responded by providing digital versions, shifting collection policies around textbooks in order to get information in the hands of the people who needed it. In 1918, some libraries, like Cedar Rapids Public, still allowed limited browsing but prohibited “lingering”. In 2020, this was no longer true, and libraries tried to make up for the lack of physical materials access by offering curbside service: including print materials, but sometimes art supplies as well. Redwood City library director Derek Wolfgram recalls that one great success of 2020 were curbside craft kits, for families to pick up and assemble at home. While ebook circulation numbers rose dramatically, sometimes almost 400%, many librarians also noted that browsing physical books still mattered to their patrons, and Sydney Pearlstein in Gwinnett County, Georgia recalls making displays in the windows to help patrons safely browse at a distance. Library staff also turned to each other to provide care: the LACUNY Mutual Aid network, was formed by the Library Association of the City University of New York several months after lockdown started as a way for library professionals to give and receive financial aid. But the going has not always been easy, and librarians pointed to some challenges unique to this pandemic, particularly as Tutwiler noted, that “the exclusively digital formats of programs (and not just from libraries) led to a bit of burnout.” Others pointed to the challenges of furloughs and limited staffing, tight budgets, and general exhaustion. While candid about the year’s challenges, many were also hopeful, and eager to continue supporting their communities and each other. But perhaps one of the biggest roles libraries played was in asking them to do what they do best: To connect people to the information they need. The 1918 flu pandemic was the first in which libraries were central to disseminating public health information, spurred by health officials’ struggles to share updates with communities during the 1916 Polio epidemic. This new library role in educating the public, combined with shifts in library focuses towards usable information, made libraries partners in many public awareness campaigns, from public health to nuclear safety, in the coming decades. In 2020, libraries offered everything from parking lot hot spots to curbside pickup to distance educational programming and online resources. Tutwiler looks back with pride, noting how hard the library’s staff worked when they “were given an impossible task, serving the public without interacting with the public.” The 1918 influenza pandemic had a profound impact on how librarians do their work, giving them a chance to reevaluate what was working and what wasn’t in old models. What changes might we see after COVID? More remote services, permanent curbside pickup? The combination of the pandemic and the end of the war was profound, resulting in widespread and lasting changes to the core of librarianship itself. Only time will tell what, if any, core values will change in the ongoing effort to connect communities with information. Support JSTOR Daily! Join our new membership program on Patreon today.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The world’s first mRNA vaccines — the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna — have made it in record time from the laboratory, through successful clinical trials, regulatory approval and into people’s arms. The high efficiency of protection against severe disease, the safety seen in clinical trials and the speed with which the vaccines were designed are set to transform how we develop vaccines in the future. Once researchers have set up the mRNA manufacturing technology, they can potentially produce mRNA against any target. Manufacturing mRNA vaccines also does not need living cells, making them easier to produce than some other vaccines. So mRNA vaccines could potentially be used to prevent a range of diseases, not just COVID-19. Remind me again, what’s mRNA? Messenger ribonucleic acid (or mRNA for short) is a type of genetic material that tells your body how to make proteins. The two mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, deliver fragments of this mRNA into your cells. Once inside, your body uses instructions in the mRNA to make SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. So when you encounter the virus’ spike proteins again, your body’s immune system will already have a head start in how to handle it. So after COVID-19, which mRNA vaccines are researchers working on next? Here are three worth knowing about. 1. Flu vaccine Currently, we need to formulate new versions of the flu vaccine each year to protect us from the strains the World Health Organization (WHO) predicts will be circulating in flu season. This is a constant race to monitor how the virus evolves and how it spreads in real time. Moderna is already turning its attention to an mRNA vaccine against seasonal influenza. This would target the four seasonal strains of the virus the WHO predicts will be circulating. But the holy grail is a universal flu vaccine. This would protect against all strains of the virus (not just what the WHO predicts) and so wouldn’t need to be updated each year. The same researchers who pioneered mRNA vaccines are also working on a universal flu vaccine. The researchers used the vast amounts of data on the influenza genome to find the mRNA code for the most “highly conserved” structures of the virus. This is the mRNA least likely to mutate and lead to structural or functional changes in viral proteins. They then prepared a mixture of mRNAs to express four different viral proteins. These included one on the stalk-like structure on the outside of the flu virus, two on the surface, and one hidden inside the virus particle. Studies in mice show this experimental vaccine is remarkably potent against diverse and difficult-to-target strains of influenza. This is a strong contender as a universal flu vaccine.

Malaria vaccine Malaria arises through infection with the single-celled parasite Plasmodium falciparum, delivered when mosquitoes bite. There is no vaccine for it. However, US researchers working with pharmaceutical company GSK have filed a patent for an mRNA vaccine against malaria. The mRNA in the vaccine codes for a parasite protein called PMIF. By teaching our bodies to target this protein, the aim is to train the immune system to eradicate the parasite. There have been promising results of the experimental vaccine in mice and early-stage human trials are being planned in the UK. This malaria mRNA vaccine is an example of a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine. This means very small amounts of mRNA need to be made, packaged and delivered, as the mRNA will make more copies of itself once inside our cells. This is the next generation of mRNA vaccines after the “standard” mRNA vaccines seen so far against COVID-19. Read more: COVID-19 isn't the only infectious disease scientists are trying to find a vaccine for. Here are 3 others 3. Cancer vaccines We already have vaccines that prevent infection with viruses that cause cancer. For example, hepatitis B vaccine prevents some types of liver cancer and the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine prevents cervical cancer. But the flexibility of mRNA vaccines lets us think more broadly about tackling cancers not caused by viruses. Some types of tumours have antigens or proteins not found in normal cells. If we could train our immune systems to identify these tumour-associated antigens then our immune cells could kill the cancer. Cancer vaccines can be targeted to specific combinations of these antigens. BioNTech is developing one such mRNA vaccine that shows promise for people with advanced melanoma. CureVac has developed one for a specific type of lung cancer, with results from early clinical trials. Then there’s the promise of personalised anti-cancer mRNA vaccines. If we could design an individualised vaccine specific to each patient’s tumour then we could train their immune system to fight their own individual cancer. Several research groups and companies are working on this. Yes, there are challenges ahead However, there are several hurdles to overcome before mRNA vaccines against other medical conditions are used more widely. Current mRNA vaccines need to be kept frozen, limiting their use in developing countries or in remote areas. But Moderna is working on developing an mRNA vaccine that can be kept in a fridge. Researchers also need to look at how these vaccines are delivered into the body. While injecting into the muscle works for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, delivery into a vein may be better for cancer vaccines.

However, as regulatory bodies around the world have already approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, there are far fewer regulatory hurdles than a year ago. The high cost of personalised mRNA cancer vaccines may also be an issue. Finally, not all countries have the facilities to make mRNA vaccines on a large scale, including Australia. Regardless of these hurdles, mRNA vaccine technology has been described as disruptive and revolutionary. If we can overcome these challenges, we can potentially change how we make vaccines now and into the future.

Chankova / 15 Apr 2021 The economic consequences of Covid-19 are often compared to a war, prompting fears of rising inflation and high bond yields. However, historically, pandemics and wars have had diverging effects. This column uses data extending to the 1300s to compare inflation and government bond yield behaviour in the aftermath of the world’s 12 largest wars and pandemics. It shows that both inflation and bond yields typically rise in wartime but remain relatively stable during pandemics. Although every such event is unique, history suggests high inflation and bond yields are not a natural consequence of pandemics. Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Authors Kevin Daly Managing Director and Senior Economist, Global Macro Research department Goldman Sachs Rositsa D. Chankova Analyst, Global Macro Research Goldman Sachs In economic terms, the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic is often compared to a war – national resources have been commandeered in the battle against an ‘invisible enemy’, driving government debt levels sharply higher around the world (Baldwin and Weder di Mauro 2020). For financial markets, one worrying aspect of this analogy is that the aftermaths of major wars have often been associated with rising inflation, high bond yields, and financial disruption. But how close does the ‘pandemic as war’ analogy hold in practice? In a recent paper, we used data extending back to the Black Death in the 1300s to compare how inflation and government bond yields have behaved in the aftermath of history’s 12 largest wars and pandemics (Daly and Chankova 2021). From Covid-19 to the Black Death: Very long-run data on inflation and bond yields Our inflation and bond yield data come from two separate sources, both from economists at the Bank of England (Bank of England 2021, Schmelzing 2020), and our country sample consists of France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, the UK, Spain, the US, and Japan.1 Our sample of wars and pandemics includes the 12 largest wars and pandemics measured by deaths, excluding regional wars and pandemics affecting countriesegions where we have no data (Table 1).2 Re-scaling fatalities to today's global population, the cut-off point for inclusion in the sample is around two million deaths for wars and around 1-1.5 million deaths for pandemics (compared with an estimated 2.7 million deaths globally to date from Covid-19).3 Table 1 Our sample of major wars and pandemics Notes: The 12 largest wars and pandemics measured by deaths, excluding regional wars and pandemics without economic data. *The fatalities data for wars and pandemics have both been re-scaled to today's global population.Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, Cirillo and Taleb (2020). Wars result in higher inflation and bond yields, pandemics do not Figure 1 displays the median behaviour of inflation around major wars, together with its interquartile range (and also a median based only on global wars in our sample). Inflation has typically risen sharply both during and – especially – in the aftermath of major wars, with median inflation peaking at 8% one year after the war has ended. Figure 1 Inflation has typically risen sharply both during and especially in the aftermath of major wars Notes: CPI Inflation (% year-on-year) around wars, median and interquartile range.Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, Bank of England (2021), Schmelzing (2020). Figure 2 displays the same inflation data around the ends of pandemics. Inflation has typically remained weak during pandemics and declined in their aftermath, with median inflation falling below zero one year after the pandemic has ended and fluctuating close to zero for nine years after the pandemic has ended. Figure 2 Inflation has typically remained weak in the aftermath of major pandemics Notes: CPI Inflation (% year-on-year) around pandemics, median and interquartile range.Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, Bank of England (2021), Schmelzing (2020). The contrast between the behaviour of inflation following wars and following pandemics is particularly clear in Figure 3, which plots median inflation rates across the 12 wars and pandemics. Figure 3 Inflation has typically risen sharply following major wars, but not following pandemics Notes: Median CPI Inflation (% year-on-year) around pandemics/wars.Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, Bank of England (2021), Schmelzing (2020). In Figure 4, we set out the same comparison for nominal government bond yields.4 Bond yields have typically risen during wars, with median bond yields increasing by around one percentage point to a peak of 6.4% in the final year of the war. By contrast, during pandemics, median bond yields remained stable at around 5.5%, before declining in the years following the pandemic. Figure 4 Bond yields rise much more during wars than pandemics Notes: Nominal ten-year bond yields (or closest equivalent) around wars/pandemics, median (%).Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, Bank of England (2021), Schmelzing (2020). Lessons from the past: From the world wars to the Black Death Averaging across a number of wars and pandemics can obscure important details. It is therefore instructive to also explore some key episodes in a little more detail, to see how the contrasts between wars and pandemics have played out: WWI (1914-18): The years leading up to the outbreak of war were characterised by relatively rapid growth, partly fuelled by a rapid military expansion by European powers (Figure 5). Inflation accelerated sharply across Europe from 1914 onwards, as the UK, Germany, and France were forced to abandon the gold standard, rising to a peak of 50% year-on-year in Germany and 25% year-on-year in the UK in 1917. The US did not join the war until 1916 and growth and inflation both accelerated sharply in that year, with GDP rising 14% year-on-year and inflation reaching 17% year-on-year in 1917. The ‘Spanish Flu’ (1918-1920) is estimated to have killed around 40-50 million people worldwide, or 2-2.5% of the world’s population, around twice the number that died during WWI. While growth and inflation both weakened during the pandemic (Figure 5), it is difficult to determine from time series data alone whether this was due to the war ending or the pandemic. To distinguish between these effects, Barro et al. (2020) use cross-sectional data on war and flu deaths. On this basis, they estimate that the Spanish Flu reduced real GDP per capita by 6% on average and that, in contrast to the highly inflationary effects of WWI, the pandemic had a ‘negligible’ impact on the price level. WWII: In common with WWI, the years leading up to WWII were also characterised by relatively strong growth which, in Europe, was partly fuelled by rapid military expansion. Inflation accelerated sharply in the UK in 1939-40, as war was initially declared, and later in the US, as it subsequently joined the war (Figure 5). During the war years, GDP growth was exceptionally strong in the US (boosted by a significant increase in arms production and without the cost of war damage) but weaker in Europe (where governments strained to maintain arms production amid widespread war damage). Inflation remained high throughout the war years and through the initial post-war period, before declining in 1949-1950. Figure 5 GDP and inflation over the two world wars and the Spanish Flu a) GDP growth b) Inflation Notes: Evolution of GDP growth and inflation between 1910 and 1950 in the UK, US, and Germany. Sources: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, Bank of England (2021), Schmelzing (2020), Maddison. Napoleonic Wars: As tensions rose between England and France ahead of the Napoleonic Wars, the UK government tripled government spending over a five-year period (1792-97), partly funding this increase through a depletion of the Bank of England’s gold reserves (Broadbent 2020). Fears over the impending war resulted in a private sector switch from Bank paper into gold, causing the government to suspend gold convertibility. The price level subsequently rose by 59% over the following three years, although it stabilised thereafter and gold convertibility was subsequently restored in 1821. The Black Death: The bubonic plague reached England in late 1348 and, over the subsequent three years, resulted in a 30-45% reduction in the country’s population. As Jordà et al. (2020) discuss, the sharp reduction in labour was the primary cause of the Peasants' Rebellion, a doubling of real wages, and a significant reduction in rates of return on land. Why wars are different from pandemics: Wars result in overheating and the destruction of physical capital The contrast between the performance of inflation and bond yields during wars and pandemics makes intuitive sense, in our view, for two reasons: Wars drive aggregate demand up, while pandemics drive aggregate demand down: In wars, there is a long history of using debt-financed spending to fund increased war-related expenditure (before and during wars) and reconstruction efforts (in the aftermath), driving aggregate demand higher relative to war-damaged supply. In pandemics, by contrast, any increase in government spending is used to fill the gap left by absent private sector demand, with very different implications for the overall balance between aggregate demand and supply.5 Wars destroy physical capital, driving investment and interest rates higher: Wars are often associated with the widespread destruction of physical capital, a development that increases the demand for investment and pushes interest rates higher. By contrast, pandemics do not result in any loss of physical capital and, if there is widespread loss of life, can result in an increase in the capital-labour ratio. Standard economic theory suggests that a higher capital-labour ratio should lower equilibrium interest rates, while raising real wages.6 Higher inflation is not a natural consequence of pandemics Every war and pandemic is different, and we should be cautious of drawing lessons from events that occurred in the long-distant past and in very different circumstances. One feature of the current pandemic that is clearly distinctive to past episodes is the size of the government response. Equally, however, one can argue that an unusually large government response was necessitated by an unusually large collapse in private sector demand.7 What is clear is that history provides no evidence that higher inflation or higher bond yields are a natural consequence of major pandemics. None of this precludes the possibility that higher inflation might result as a policy choice in the face of elevated debt levels. Higher inflation can bring welcome relief to debtors, including the government, by eroding the real value of their obligations. Faced with the choice of reducing debt through austerity or inflation, it is possible that policymakers might ‘choose’ higher inflation to help limit the need for tax rises and/or government expenditure reductions. However, such a policy would require the cooperation of central banks to keep interest rates low, even as inflation is rising. And, in a world of independent central banks, even this route towards higher global inflation appears less likely than it did during past crises.

Endnotes 1 Combining these datasets provides us with annual inflation data for the UK from 1210, for France and Germany from the early 1300s, and later dates for the other countries. Nominal bond yield data for the UK, Italy, and Germany is available from the early 1300s and later dates for the other economies. We focus on data for inflation and government bond yields for two reasons: (1) because there are reasonably accurate data for both extending over very long time horizons, based on contemporary records, and (2) where GDP data are available, it is often difficult to separate changes in growth that have been driven by demand factors (e.g. increased spending on armaments) and those driven by supply factors (e.g. reduced potential output due to war destruction). One advantage of focusing on inflation is that it provides a direct indication of the balance between demand and supply. 2 As the end-year for wars and pandemics (Year = 0), we use the last year of significant fatalities. In a number of instances, this is one year before the formal end of the war/pandemic. 3 Around half of the wars and pandemics in our sample were global in nature and, for these events, we focus on median economic outcomes across countries. For regional wars and pandemics, we focus only on data for the economies directly affected. For example, for the Franco-Spanish war of 1648-1658, we consider only French and Spanish data. Note that, in accompanying exhibits, we also display results focusing only on global wars and pandemics. 4 Ideally, we would also consider ex ante real bond yields, but for this we would need a long-run history of inflation expectations. One can calculate a simple measure of real yields by subtracting current inflation but, because inflation typically rises sharply during wars, this has the effect of pushing real yields lower. 5 A similar argument has previously been made by Broadbent (2020), who argues that institutional quality is a more important determinant of inflation than the rise in debt. Looking the UK’s experience, Miles and Scott (2020) also argue that wars and pandemics have typically had different implications for inflation. 6 Jordà et al. (2020) also make this argument and find that pandemics tend to reduce r* or the equilibrium interest rate. 7 One can list many other differences between the Covid-19 pandemic and previous pandemics. However, the differences that are likely to be most relevant for the medium-term inflation outlook are those that affect the relative balance between demand and supply and, in our view, those differences appear to have broadly offsetting effects. In particular, relative to past pandemics, there has been a greater willingness through Covid-19 to lower activity through lockdownsestrictions, implying a larger short-term collapse in private demand and more short-term downward pressure on inflation. Set against this, there has also been a greater willingness to offset this shortfall through larger government income replacement.

Just like we see today, even 100 years ago brands claimed their products prevented or cured the deadly influenza virus. There was a similar barrage of hygiene and immunity products that promised protection from the flu. Ashwini Gangal 15 Apr 2021 15:09 IST Follow Us New Update Just like we see today, even 100 years ago brands claimed their products prevented or cured the deadly influenza virus. There was a similar barrage of hygiene and immunity products that promised protection from the flu. AdvertismentOver the last 12 months I've taken to something called 'narrative prophylaxis' - protecting oneself with stories. I've been reading different kinds of books - old, new, fiction, non-fiction. I toggle between formats - paperback, kindle, audio books. One of the books I finished reading recently (actually, listening to on Amazon's Audible) is a shocker titled 'The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Plague in History' by John M. Barry. Written in 2004, it's a brilliant, detailed account of the 1918 flu pandemic, that overlapped with the 1st world war. Just like we see today, even 100 years ago brands claimed that their products prevented or cured the deadly virus. There was a similar barrage of hygiene and immunity products that claimed to protect users from the disease. All italicised bits below are plucked from the book. I've taken the images from different websites. Peruna One para goes, "Meanwhile, Vicks VapoRub advertisements in hundreds of papers danced down the delicate line of reassurance while promising relief, calling the epidemic 'Simply the Old-Fashioned Grip Masquerading Under a New Name'." Vicks Another page in the book reads: "Advertisements filled the newspapers, sometimes set in the same small type as—and difficult to distinguish from—news articles, and sometimes set in large fonts blaring across a page. The one thing they shared: they all declared with confidence there was a way to stop influenza, there was a way to survive. Some claims were as simple as a shoe store’s advertising, “One way to keep the flu away is to keep your feet dry.” Johnston's Shoes Dolby's Clothing The author goes on, "Some were as complex as “Making a Kolynos Gas Mask To Fight Spanish Influenza When Exposed to Infection.” Foley's Honey They also all played to fear. “How To Prevent Infection From Spanish Influenza…. The Surgeon General of the U.S. Army urges you to keep your mouth clean…. a few drops of liquid SOZODONT.” Hocking Bros Johnson's Joyner's Bovril Hygiene brands made noise as well. The author writes about a Lysol ad: “Help your Health Board Conquer Spanish influenza By Disinfecting your Home…Lysol Disinfectant.” And an immunity led brand: “For GRIP…You are Safe When You Take Father John’s Medicine.” “Influ-BALM Prevents Spanish Flu.” Another para goes: “Special Notice to the Public. Telephone inquiries from Minneapolis physicians and the laity and letters from many parts of America are coming into our office regarding the use of Benetol,…a powerful bulwark for the prevention and treatment of Spanish influenza….” Horlick's Followed by: “Spanish influenza—what it is and how it should be treated:…Always Call a Doctor/ No Occasion For Panic…. There is no occasion for panic—influenza itself has a very low percentage of fatalities…. Use Vicks VapoRub.” Pluto Water Some ads were downright ridiculous. We've seen a bunch of those in 2020-21. An ad for an onion sale 100 years have passed, yet so little has changed. Pathogens continue to ravage humanity, while brands continue to promise protection. I highly recommend the 500-something pager 'The Great Influenza' by John M. Barry. Gude's This piece was first published on LinkedIn, by Ashwini Gangal, executive editor, afaqs!.

What you need to know: The directive follows a Ugandan government announcement that the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), which infects both animals and humans, has been detected following tests on carcasses of white winged black birds that died on the shores of Lake Victoria near Entebbe on January 2. Thank you for reading Nation.Africa Show plans Dar es Salaam. The Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children has instructed regional and district medical officers to strengthen monitoring and diagnosis of bird flu at all health facilities across the country. The directive follows a Ugandan government announcement that the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), which infects both animals and humans, has been detected following tests on carcasses of white winged black birds that died on the shores of Lake Victoria near Entebbe on January 2.

We need to take precautions to prevent the disease from entering the country. Since 2007, Tanzania has been on the alert for bird flu. We prepared a Strategic Plan for Bird Flu Prevention and Control,” she noted. She noted that in 2012, her ministry, in collaboration with other ministries and government agencies, prepared the five-year plan. Ms Mwalimu further noted that steps have been taken after receiving reports of the disease outbreak in Uganda, including collaborating with the office that deals with the diseases that afflict humans and animals (zoonotic diseases) under the Prime Minister’s office, where a special meeting was scheduled for January 18 for stakeholders to deliberate on the scare and prepare the action plan. “Precaution letters have been sent to administrative secretaries of all regions of mainland Tanzania alerting on how the disease might spread,” she noted.

According to the state branch of the Poultry Farmers Association of Nigeria (PAN), over 223,695 birds were affected with each costing not less than N1,800. Recall that last week, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had confirmed the outbreak of Avian Influenza in seven states of the federation. Related Posts Honouring an enigma: Tunde Bakare at 70 Nigeria’s Gross External Reserves add $244m in seven days to cross $40bn Blow your own ‘trumpet’ Chairman of the Poultry Association of Nigeria (PAN), Kano State Chapter, Alhaji Umar Kibiya Usman, in an interview with journalists explained that apart from the already confirmed number of infected chickens, there were thousands yet to be confirmed. According to him: “At least, 223,695 chickens have been affected so far. They have been depopulated. This is worth over N402 million. There are also some that are not confirmed. They run into hundreds of thousands. So, the amount of the loss is over N500 million” Usman therefore urged the state government to take quick steps to mitigate the outbreak of the disease and further enlighten and educate poultry farmers on ways to ensure that their farms were protected from the deadly disease adding that fumigation and disinfection should be sustained at the live-bird markets and other places. On his part, Director of veterinary services in the Kano state ministry of agriculture and natural resources, Bello Bala, who also confirmed the outbreak, said that the government had gotten the report of the index case from a man who brought his ailing bird for diagnosis. Bala further explained that when the sample collected from the bird was taken to the national veterinary research institute in Jos for tests, it returned positive for avian influenza. Following confirmation of the disease, Bala added that the ministry had immediately alerted stakeholders and disinfected farms and live-bird markets in about eight areas in Kano metropolis as well as various places where poultry activities take place.

At the time of publishing, the results of the tests carried out to determine whether it is the high pathogenic (HPAI) or low pathogenic (LPAI) strain of avian influenza had not yet been released.

The farm has been placed under quarantine. Colin Steenhuisen, acting general manager of the Egg Organisation of the South African Poultry Association (SAPA), said small-scale and commercial poultry producers needed to implement appropriate biosecurity contingency measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including restricting the movement of people and birds on farms. Steenhuisen said this was the first outbreak of avian influenza on a commercial farm in South Africa since the outbreak of HPAI (strain H5N8) in 2017, which had a serious impact on the layer industry in South Africa, as well as a marginal effect on the broiler industry.

Steenhuisen said the World Health Organization and the World Organisation for Animal Health had been advised of the outbreak, and had confirmed that the suspected strain of the virus was not dangerous to humans. “Consumers are reminded that meat and eggs on [supermarket] shelves are safe for consumption as long as normal food-safety steps are followed when preparing meals,” said Steenhuisen.
